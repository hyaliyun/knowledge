Career Walla grew up as an only child with his mother and grandmother. His mother dressed and educated him as a girl, to prevent him from becoming a soldier. Walla later declared that he had been a \\"Nazi girl\\" who had been re-operated during the Soviet occupation into a \\"communist twin\\". In his works, female figures are often marked with a swastika, while male figures are marked with a hammer and a sickle. Until the age of 9, he showed normal development and attended a special school. After that, no teaching or job could be found for him. At age 16, he first entered in-patient psychiatric treatment, where he remained until age 20. He returned to psychiatry at age 36 when his mother fell ill. Walla worked very artistically as a draftsman, painter and photographer. In his art, he captured his surroundings by painting invented and existing symbols as well as godlike creatures on objects (even on houses or trees). Figures and symbols can be found in all his works. He created a complete artistic cosmos. August Walla lived in the House of Artists in Maria Gugging since 1983 and was one of the most versatile artists of the so-called \\"Art Brut\\". The well-known German punk band EA80 refers to Walla's work in the piece Gugging of their 1992 album \\"Schauspiele\\".

Personal life Achille Cantoni was born in Forl√¨, Italy, in 1835.Garibaldi, Giuseppe. Cantoni Il Volontario. Milan, 1870. Although Cantoni was a real volunteer during the Italian Risorgimento, little else is known of his origins. Much of what is known about him comes from Giuseppe Garibaldi's novel, Cantoni il volontario, a work of historical fiction. According to the novel, Cantoni had a lover who fought alongside him as a volunteer named Ida. Cantoni and Ida were 15 and 14 years old, respectively, when they met.Gundle, Stephen. \\"The 'Bella Italiana' and the 'English Rose'\\" In Performing National Identity: Anglo-Italian Cultural Transactions, edited by Manfred Pfister and Ralf Hertel, 145-46. Vol. 14. Internationale Forschungen Zur Allgemeinen Und Vergleichende. Rodopi, 2008. Wars of Italian Unification Achille Cantoni was only 15 years old when joined as a volunteer with the patriotic forces of Italy, or the Redshirts. He was likely part of Garibaldi's military corps Hunters of the Alps, which brought together Italian volunteers to fight in the Second Italian War of Independence (also known as the Franco-Austrian War) and the Third Italian War of Independence. Cantoni fought in both of these wars. These two wars were among the many battles fought as a part of the Italian Unification effort, which sought to bring together the many states of the Italian peninsula into one country as the Kingdom of Italy.Coppa, Frank J. The Origins of the Italian Wars of Independence. London: Longman, 1992. What makes Cantoni significant is his defense and rescue of one of the most important figures of the Risorgimento, Giuseppe Garibaldi. On May 19, 1849, in the town of Velletri, a battle commenced between Italy and the Spanish Bourbon Neapolitan forces.Riall, Lucy. Garibaldi: Invention of a Hero. New Haven: Yale University Press, 2007. Cantoni saved Garibaldi's life by shielding him with his own body. Awestruck, Garibaldi himself called him ‚ÄúCantoni, the brave volunteer of Forl√¨‚Ä¶ favorite son of Romagna.‚ÄùBrentari, Ottone. Il Secondo Battaglione Bersaglierei Volontari Di Garibaldi Nella Campagna Del 1866. D.G. Agnelli, 1908. Cantoni il volontario On November 3, 1867, Cantoni followed the Italian volunteers under the command of Giuseppe Garibaldi into the Battle of Mentana against the French. The battle was an ill-fated disaster for the Italians. Along with many other volunteers, Cantoni was killed in action. Giuseppe Garibaldi so greatly admired Cantoni and his efforts that, following Cantoni's death, he wrote the novel Cantoni il volontario, published in Milan in 1870, in honor of the man who saved his life. Rather than an exact retelling of his life and accomplishments, Garibaldi instead used Cantoni as a character in a fictionalized tale of his heroism. Though the novel is fictional, the figure of Cantoni is set against real occurrences during the Risorgimento. Set in 1848-1849,Field, Ron, and Peter Dennis. Garibaldi: Leadership, Strategy, Conflict. Oxford: Osprey Pub., 2011. the book tells of Cantoni's bravery and dedication through many battles and events. Garibaldi highly romanticizes Cantoni as a heroic figure. He also addresses Cantoni's lover, Ida, who fought alongside him as a volunteer herself. Cantoni eventually dies at the end of the novel, nobly defending the honor of his country. However, the novel's focus is not entirely on Cantoni. Garibaldi used the novel to publicize his opinions and ideas on politics and religion. For instance, he writes about his idea of the ideal Italian volunteer. Volunteers were more than just citizens willing to fight for their country, but rather became heralded icons of the nation. They fought for Italy by their own choice and put their country before anything else as their main priority. The Italian people greatly admired these volunteers, as did Garibaldi. The novel also shows Garibaldi's anti-clericalism, a result of his frustrations with the Catholic Church and the First Vatican Council in Rome. He considered the Papal Theocracy ‚Äúthe plague of the World‚Äù and portrayed members of the church as evil villains in his novel. One character, a Jesuit priest named Fra Gaudenzio, attempts to rape Ida while she is imprisoned. Another anti-clerical scene describes the papal dungeons as horrific and filthy. Cantoni and the other volunteers‚Äô battle for Italy is designed to be against pretismo (‚Äúpriestism‚Äù) and politicians.

Reilly. An Italian-led production with co-producers in France and the United Kingdom, Tale of Tales is Garrone's only English-language film. It competed for the Palme d'Or at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival. It is a screen adaptation based on collections of tales by Italian poet and courtier Giambattista Basile: Pentamerone or Lo cunto de li cunti (Tale of Tales, or Entertainment for Little Ones), which contains the earliest versions of famous fables like Rapunzel, Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella. The three tales are La Cerva Fatata (The Enchanted Doe), La Pulce (The Flea), La Vecchia Scorticata (The Flayed Old Lady), which have been freely adapted with elements of other tales by Giambattista Basile as well as a touch of artistic license. Plot Alcantara river, location for the scenes with the aquatic dragon In the kingdom of Longtrellis the King and Queen cannot conceive a child. A necromancer suggests that if the Queen eats a sea dragon's heart cooked by a virgin, she will become with child but this will cost a life. The King slays the sea monster but dies from his wounds. The Queen eats the heart and the next day bears a son, Elias, with hair as white as the dragon. The cook also gives birth to a boy, Jonah. The boys are identical and inseparable friends. This vexes the Queen who attempts to murder Jonah. Jonah leaves the kingdom, plunging a knife into a tree root and telling Elias that as long as the root spouts clear water, he is alive and well. One day the water is clouded with blood. Elias leaves to find Jonah. The Queen has her subjects search for Elias to no avail. The necromancer blames the Queen and says the youths are truly inseparable, and that her violent desire can only be achieved through violence. Elias finds Jonah wounded in a cave. They are threatened by a monster which wounds Jonah but hesitates to attack Elias, who kills the monster and returns Jonah to his mother. In the cave, the monster's corpse dissolves into that of the Queen. Castle of Roccascalegna) The lustful King of Strongcliff is intrigued by the sound of a woman's heavenly singing. He courts her outside her home, unaware that she is one of two elderly sisters, Imma and Dora. Dora agrees to spend the night with him as long as it is in complete darkness. He is horrified when he sees her appearance the next morning and has his guards throw her out of the window. She survives, entangled in the branches of a tree. A witch rescues her and nurses her from her breast. Dora awakens as a young, beautiful maiden. The King comes upon her while hunting and decides to make her his Queen. Dora invites Imma to the wedding and promises to take care of her, but says she cannot stay in the castle. Imma refuses to leave, asking for the secret to her sister's youth and beauty. In annoyance, Dora says she got herself flayed. Finally thrown out after violating the royal couple's privacy in their bedroom, Imma finds someone willing to flay her, leaving her bloody and disfigured. Castel del Monte) The King of Highhills becomes fascinated by a flea which he hides in his room as a pet. It grows gigantic under his care. When it dies, the King decides to skin it. His daughter Violet tells him she wants to be married, so he offers her as a bride to whoever can guess from what beast the skin was taken, believing no-one could do so. However an ogre correctly identifies the hide by smell. Violet is horrified but her father says he cannot go back on his word. Violet goes through with the marriage but says her father never loved her. The ogre takes Violet to his cave where she is raped and kept prisoner. A family of acrobats helps her to escape, but the ogre gives chase and kills the entire family. He is mollified by Violet who then slits his throat. Violet returns to the castle where the King has grown ill and reveals she has the head of the ogre, the husband he \\"chose\\" for her. The King falls to his knees crying and the courtiers follow suit. Violet, too, begins to cry. Elias, Dora and the King of Strongcliff are among the guests for Violet's coronation as Queen. There, Elias nods to her and the King of Strongcliff. As Violet's father walks her to the throne the crowd looks skyward where an entertainer is walking a tightrope of fire. We see Dora's beauty begin to fade and, unnoticed, she flees the castle. Themes In an interview with Variety, director Matteo Garrone emphasized that the three tales have contemporary themes: \\"plastic surgery; the frenzied desire to have a child; the conflict between generations; the painful passage from adolescence to adulthood.\\" He has also said that although the three stories have distinct themes, they are all connected to the idea of desire that can lead to obsession. Although screenplays were written for other tales in the Basile collection, those filmed told the story of \\"a woman in three different stages of her life\\": youth, motherhood and advancing age.

Garrone had previously been best known for employing a naturalist style in films such as Gomorrah, but argued that all his previous films also have a fairytale aspect to their narratives. An important source of inspiration was Francisco Goya's Los caprichos collection of etchings. For Garrone, they encapsulated the mood of Basile's tales. Tale of Tales had a budget corresponding to USD$14.5 million. It was produced through Garrone's company Archimede Film, with co-production support from France's Le Pact and Britain's Recorded Picture Company. It received financing from Rai Cinema and additional support from MiBACT and Eurimages. Filming Principal photography commenced on 15 May 2014 and lasted four months. The film was shot entirely on location in various parts of Italy, including Naples (Royal Palace, Palace of Capodimonte and its gardens); Apulia's Castel del Monte (octagonal castle appears in the poster near Vincent Cassel), Gioia del Colle (in particular the throne room), Laterza, Mottola, Statte; Sicily's Donnafugata Castle (gothic castle, stone labyrinth and gardens) and Gole dell'Alcantara in Alcantara (mainly scenes of sea dragon); Abruzzo's Castello di Roccascalegna (appears in the poster with Castel del Monte); Tuscany's Moorish castle of Sammezzano, the towns of Sorano and Sovana (tuff caves); and Lazio (Bosco del Sasseto in Viterbo). \\"The movie is an epic tribute to the history of fairytales with great care to the style of their portrayal.

Winkelhausen was the alternate on the Swiss team (skipped by Binia Feltscher-Beeli) at the 2010 Ford World Women's Curling Championship, finishing 10th. In 2010, Winkelhausen re-joined the J√§ggi rink at third, playing on that team until 2014. During this period, they won three World Curling Tour (WCT) events, the 2011 Kamloops Crown of Curling, the 2012 International Bernese Ladies Cup and the 2012 International ZO Women's Tournament. They played in their first Grand Slam event at the 2012 Curlers Corner Autumn Gold Curling Classic. They also played in the 2012 Colonial Square Ladies Classic, where they lost in the quarterfinals, the 2012 ROGERS Masters of Curling, the 2013 Players' Championship, the 2013 Curlers Corner Autumn Gold Curling Classic (losing in the quarterfinals), the 2013 Manitoba Liquor & Lotteries Women's Classic (quarterfinals), and the 2013 Colonial Square Ladies Classic, where they lost in the finals to Jennifer Jones. While a student at the Swiss North-West University of Applied Sciences, Winkelhausen won a bronze medal at the 2013 Winter Universiade. She played third on the team, which was skipped by J√§ggi. Winkelhausen found success after joining the P√§tz rink in 2014, playing second. The team won two WCT events in their first season together (the 2014 Red Deer Curling Classic and the 2015 International Bernese Ladies Cup.) They also made it to the quarterfinals of the 2014 Masters of Curling and also played in the 2014 Colonial Square Ladies Classic. The team won the Swiss championship and went on to win a gold medal at the 2015 World Women's Curling Championship. Later that year, she represented Switzerland at the 2015 European Curling Championships, where they missed the playoffs with a 4-5 record. Winklehausen did not return to the World Championships until 2017. Playing second for P√§tz, the team did not have the same success as in 2015 and ended up missing the playoffs after posting a 5-6 record and an 8th place finish. After that season, the P√§tz rink announced they would be disbanding. After P√§tz joined the Tirinzoni rink the following season, Winklehausen was invited to be their alternate at the 2018 European Curling Championships. The Swiss team claimed the silver medal after going on an unbeaten 9‚Äì0 run to finish top of the Round Robin, before defeating Germany 6‚Äì4 in the semi-final, and falling 5‚Äì4 to Sweden's Anna Hasselborg in the final. She was also Tirinzoni's alternate at the 2019 World Women's Curling Championship in Silkeborg, Denmark. The team got off to a shaky start posting a 2‚Äì3 record in their first 5 games before winning 6 in a row to secure their playoff spot and went on to finish the round robin with a 8-4 record and 4th place in the standings. Tight victories over China in the qualification game, and South Korea in the semi-final set up a repeat of the European Championship final against Hasselborg and Sweden. They were able to turn the tables on Sweden, with P√§tz making a draw to the four-foot in the extra end for an 8‚Äì7 win which meant they were crowned the 2019 world champions.

For example, all Jordan algebras are structurable algebras (with the trivial involution), as is any alternative algebra with involution, or any central simple algebra with involution. An involution here means a linear anti-homomorphism whose square is the identity. Assume A is a unital non-associative algebra over a field, and x \\\\mapsto \\\\bar{x} is an involution. If we define V_{x,y}z:=(x\\\\bar{y})z+(z\\\\bar{y})x-(z\\\\bar{x})y, and [x,y]=xy-yx, then we say A is a structurable algebra if: [V_{x,y} , V_{z,w}] = V_{V_{x,y}z,w} - V_{z,V_{y,x}w}. Structurable algebras were introduced by Allison in 1978.Garibaldi, p.658 The Kantor‚ÄìKoecher‚ÄìTits construction produces a Lie algebra from any Jordan algebra, and this construction can be generalized so that a Lie algebra can be produced from an structurable algebra. Moreover, Allison proved over fields of characteristic zero that a structurable algebra is central simple if and only if the corresponding Lie algebra is central simple. Another example of a structurable algebra is a 56-dimensional non- associative algebra originally studied by Brown in 1963, which can be constructed out of an Albert algebra.

It held a crew of three. Developed on the basis of the T42 experimental medium tank in mid-50s, the vehicle never entered mass production. Development In the early 1950s, the United States Military began a design program to develop tanks that would replace those currently in service. The M4 Sherman was getting obsolete and was in the process of being replaced by the M26 Pershing and the upgraded M46 Patton. These tanks, however, were still very similar to vehicles of World War II era and did not make use of newer technologies that had begun to appear. One of the tanks to spring from the design program was the Medium Tank T42. This tank would form the basis of the T69 project. The unique feature of the T69 among other medium tanks then in development was its oscillating turret and autoloading system. The T69 project followed on from the T71 Light Tank project, which featured a 76mm autoloading gun in an oscillating turret. It also ran parallel to the 120mm armed T57 and the 155 mm armed T58 Heavy Tank projects, both of which also featured autoloading systems and oscillating turrets. These two were based on the hull of the M103 Heavy Tank. T-42 The T42 medium tank was originally designed to replace the M46 Patton. The T42 was based on the T37 light tank prototype, but had increased armor protection and carried a T139 90mm gun (which would later be serialized as the 90mm Tank Gun M41) in a brand new turret. It did, however, retain the same basic dimensions and the five road-wheel running gear. However, the T42 was still halfway through development when the Korean War started in June 1950. This gave rise to the infamous \\"Korean Tank Panic\\". As a quick solution to this problem, it was decided to take the turret of the T42 and mount it on the M46 hull. This spawned the Medium Tank M47 Patton II. The T42 itself would never make it to full-scale production, having never met all of the Military's needs and expectations. A few of the tanks would be kept for experimentation and further development. This led to its use as the base hull for the T69. T-69 Further studies by the Rheem Manufacturing Company found that it would be possible to pair the T139 90mm gun with an autoloader if the equipment was mounted in an oscillating turret. Oscillating turrets, made famous by the French AMX-13, were a new feature at this time. These turrets have a fixed gun in a two-part turret. The lower half, or 'collar', is connected to the turret ring and provides horizontal rotation. The upper part, or 'body', carries the gun moving up and down on a set of trunnions providing vertical traverse. Turrets of this design allowed the use of autoloader mechanisms as the gun was fixed in place, meaning the loader did not have to be re-aligned with the breach after every shot. Equipment Schematic drawing of a T69 tank Hull The hull of the tank was made up of two parts: The front half was a long rounded casting of steel homogeneous armor, it was 4 inches (101.6 mm) thick and angled at 60 degrees, while the rear was welded steel armor plate. The two halves were welded together in the center. =Turret= The body of the turret was a single cast piece with the 90mm gun protruding from a long 'nose'. The angles of the casting provided numerous deflective surfaces against incoming rounds. This body was attached to a fully cast collar by trunnions, forming the fulcrum point of elevation and depression. The maximum elevation was 15 degrees and the maximum depression was 9 degrees. This motion was actuated by a hydraulically powered mechanism, though manual operation was possible in a case of mechanical failure. The collar was then attached to the 73-inch turret ring. The turret crew consisted of the Gunner, Loader, and Commander. The Loader sat to the left of the gun, with the gunner on its right. The Commander was situated at the right rear of the turret underneath a rotating vision cupola. Access into the turret either by way of the hatch on the left of the turret roof for the loader or another atop the Commander's cupola at the rear right. The traditional hatches in the turret roof were not the only point of entry, however. If needed, the entire turret roof had the ability to raise up via hydraulic systems and could rise to almost a full 90 degrees. This allowed full access to the interior of the turret, easy removal of the gun and loading system, and quick ammunition resupply. In case of emergency, it also allowed for a quick exit of the turret. This was operated by a control in the Loader's position. Other features on the turret consist of an AA mount for a Browning M2HB .50 Cal. (12.7mm) Heavy Machine gun on the commander's cupola and a ventilator in the left rear. On each side of the turret, positioned just above the fulcrum point were the 'Frog's Eyes', the armored housings for the lenses of the stereoscopic rangefinder, as in other tanks of its day. Armament The T69 was armed with the T178 90mm gun. The gun was mostly the same as the T139 but was mounted upside-down. This meant that the vertically sliding breach slid up towards the turret roof instead of down towards the floor, avoiding collision with the loading mechanism. The mounting lugs were also modified so that the gun's concentric recoil mechanism could be mounted in the forward part of the turret, in the nose. There was a fume extractor towards the muzzle of the gun, just behind the Muzzle break. This was a relatively new feature on tanks at the time. Firing an AP (Armor Piercing) shell, the gun could penetrate 6.2 inches (157.48 mm) of armor at 1,000 yards. A coaxial Browning M1919 .30 Cal. (7.62mm) Machine Gun was mounted on the left of the main armament. When not in action, the turret would be traversed almost fully to the rear. The gun would then be placed in a travel lock mounted on the left rear of the engine deck. =Autoloader= The T178 gun was fed by an 8-round autoloader mechanism. The system was mounted longitudinally on the centerline of the turret. It consisted of a magazine with an integral ramming system. The magazine took the form of a conical 8-tube revolving cylinder, like a scaled-up version of something found on a Smith & Wesson Revolver. The chambers of the cylinder were reloaded manually by the Loader and could be loaded with up to three different types of ammunition: AP (Armor Piercing), HEAT (High-Explosive Anti- Tank) or HE (High-Explosive) shells. The gunner could select which ammunition type he needs to fire via a control panel in his position When engaged, the cylinder was lifted into line with the breach, the hydraulic rammer then pushed the round forward into the breach. Upon withdrawal of the rammer, the cylinder indexed (rotated) forwards one chamber. The cylinder assembly then dropped back down to its stationary ready position low in the turret. Once fired, the empty shell was then passed along a chute to an ejection port in the turret bustle that automatically opened upon recoil of the gun. Once the shell was clear, the port automatically closed when the gun returns to battery (recovers from recoil). The rate of fire could be as fast as 33 rounds per minute. This was when firing just one ammunition type: when interchanging between various types, the rate of fire was reduced to 18 rounds per minute. As well as the eight rounds in the cylinder, 32 rounds were held in the bow to the right of the driver. In the T42, this rack held 36 rounds. It was found, however, there was little clearance between the autoloading assembly and the turret ring for the loader to have access to this row of four extra rounds. It was the responsibility of the Loader to replenish the Cylinder when all rounds were spent. Fate The T69 was tested at Aberdeen Proving Grounds from June 1955 to April 1956. The tests were dogged by a high rate of component failure which prevented in-depth study of the automatic loading system and operation of the oscillating turret. The tank was deemed unsatisfactory for service, but various tests on the vehicle would continue. Lessons learned would pave the way for future technologies and developments. The T69 Project was finally officially terminated February 11, 1958. The T69 was not the last experiment with oscillating turrets and autoloaders by the US Military. The project would be followed by the T54. They were intended as a means to develop a turret for the M48 that could carry the 105mm Tank Gun T140. A variant of this project, the T54E1, carried the gun in an oscillating turret and used an autoloading system.

The venue is most known for a 1990 police raid that has since been referred to as \\"Montreal's Stonewall\\". Police raid In the early morning of July 16, 1990, police officers raided the venue under the premise that it was illegally selling alcohol, a tactic that professors Jason B. Crawford and Karen Herland stated was frequently used by officers to harass Montreal gay and lesbian businesses during this time period. The police would later assert that they had also been responding to an anonymous noise complaint and that the organizers had requested help, claims that photographer and Sex Club patron Linda Dawn Hammond has stated were false. Officers were initially unable to find any alcohol and left the premises but returned about 15 minutes later, at which point they forced Sex Garage's 400 patrons to evacuate. Sex Garage's patrons began leaving the venue, only to find a large police presence facing the venue's only exit door. Hammond stated that there were an estimated 32 to 40 officers and 16 police vehicles, some of which were from a police station outside of the area. Some of the patrons fled upon seeing the police while others watched the officers start to regroup into a battalion formation. Patrons were not allowed to return to Sex Garage to retrieve their possessions or look for friends. Once in formation the police began to heckle the patrons by shouting homophobic insults and making suggestive gestures, which the patrons responded to by chanting slogans such as \\"We're here, we're queer, we're proud of it!\\" At this point the officers began removing or covering their name tags and badge IDs and started trying to steer patrons towards Beaver Hall Hill, where more officers were waiting. It is believed that one partygoer, Bruce Buck, was the first person to be assaulted after he tried to go back into the venue to retrieve his leather jacket. He was severely beaten and arrested for \\"assaulting a police officer\\". After this point the officers began beating the other patrons. During this entire process Hammond shot photographs of everything, a process that was somewhat hampered as she was only carrying a camera with a 28 mm wide angle lens, which required her to be in close proximity to take detailed photographs. She stated that the police did not initially stop her from taking photographs, which she believed was done because \\"the police may have speculated that I could be taken at any time, and I may as well provide THEM with the documentation.\\" However eventually the police began pursuing Hammond, at which point she managed to throw her camera to another patron as they were fleeing the scene. The following day Hammond's pictures were published in The Gazette and La Presse. Video footage of the raid was also found and released, which showed officers using homophobic and derogatory language while physically assaulting members of the crowd, which has since been used to deem the raid as a targeted assault against Montreal's LGBT community. By the assault's end eight people were arrested. Protests Hours after the raid victims of the assault, along with other citizens of Montreal, held a sit-in at Saint Catherine Street to protest the night's events. The group demanded several things, including a public inquiry and the removal of any charges against the patrons. The protesters disbanded after they were promised that police chief Alain St-Germain would meet them the following day at downtown Station 25. When St-Germain did not appear the following day protesters held a sit-in demonstration, only for about 70 police officers to attack the protesters. Forty-eight protesters were arrested with most assaulted by the police both on the streets and when they were taken into the police station, one of which, was hospitalized after paramedics argued with police to let them attend his injuries received due to police extreme cruel brutality. Legacy Due to the violence inflicted during the raid and during the resulting protests, the civil rights group Lesbians and Gays Against Violence was formed and several members became part of the Montreal police's minority relations committee. The brutality of the assault against the Sex Garage patrons and protesters is also credited with bringing the Montreal LGBT community together and with alerting other citizens of the unfair treatment of gays and lesbians. The event led to the creation of Divers/Cit√© in 1993.\\"Raid united city's LGBT community\\". Montreal Gazette, June 27, 2015. Divers/Cit√© served as the city's primary LGBT pride festival until repositioning itself as a general arts and music festival in 2006. The yearly Pervers/Cit√©, an alternative culture event organized as a reaction to Divers/Cit√©, has named one of their stages the Sex Garage stage after the venue.

The film stars Frank Weed and Adrienne Kroell. Plot In the picturesque little province of Burgundy in Eastern France, there lived an old miller named Meunier. With him, the joy of his heart and administrator to his simple needs, lived his daughter Louise, she of the dancing eyes and roughish beauty. Meunier enjoyed the respect of the simple easy going peasantry thereabouts and, from profits of his grist mill, he was enabled to live in a comparative comfort and contentment. This happy condition was interrupted when one Monsieur Bontemps, a rich Parisian financier and mill speculator, decided that he need Meunier's mill. To his offers, the miller however, turned a deaf ear and when Bontemp's son was sent to either purchase Meunier's mill, or start one in opposition, the old miller's future looked dark and foreboding. How the opposition mill was started, and how young Bontemps, having met with a serious accident, was nursed and cared for by Louise and her father; of how the Elder Bontemps himself, met with an accident and how this incident awakened him to a realization of his greed, all combine to make one of the sweetest stories of that year. It is pictured in a simple, charming manner amid the quaint, picturesque backgrounds of that romantic country.

The line-up most commonly associated with the band featured guitarist/vocalist Kenny Chambers, bassist Pat Leonard, and drummer Pat Brady - who with producer Lou Giordano recorded the debut album Burning In Water in 1986. Chuck Freeman replaced Leonard on bass for the band's second album Brave Noise. By the time of Moving Targets' fourth album, 1993's Take This Ride, Leonard returned to play bass and Brady was replaced with drummer Jay Arcari. In 2018 the band reformed for a European tour with drummer Emilien Catalano (of the Nils) and bassist Yves Thibault.

The pageant is believed to be the first of its kind, in that the event is presented to members of the public and media. (TV and radio personality Howard Stern has produced similar contests, but always within the confines of a studio.) The Brooklyn contest, also known by the acronym SPB, was inaugurated in July 2013 and won by Mac Hendo beating six male contestants, although only five competed for the entire event. 2013 poster The first pageant played to a packed bar and became an Internet sensation, although mainstream media coverage was limited, possibly due to the graphic nature of the contest. Talk-show hosts Jay Leno and Conan O'Brien joked about the pageant in their monologues, and pop star Miley Cyrus lamented in a Tweet to cosmopolitan.com that she had missed the event, and expressed a (possibly facetious) desire to perform and host the next contest. Newspapers, radio stations, and Web sites around the globe featured stories about SPB, often accompanied by not-safe-for-work pictures. In June 2014, Kings County Bar hosted a second Smallest Penis in Brooklyn pageant. Origin According to pageant creator Aimee Arciuolo, the idea for a small-penis pageant came to her and some girlfriends after they discussed their bedroom encounters with less-endowed men. Arciuolo told Gothamist and Playboy that she had a sexual encounter with a man who was ‚Äúactually shockingly tiny, like the size of an acorn. He came right out and said, ‚ÄòYes, I know, I‚Äôve got a little pecker. But don‚Äôt worry, we are going to have fun.'\\" \\"I was talking to the girls about this one night, and we said, ‚ÄòWe should have a pageant for these guys!‚Äô‚Äù Contest The pageant, held July 13, 2013, drew a crowd that packed the bar and spilled out into the street. The event was divided into three parts: eveningwear (a tiny penis sock), talent, and swimwear (a sheer, see-through material made more transparent by ‚Äúpenis kittens‚Äù wielding squirt guns). As the men stood atop the bar, their penis measurements were taken by judges Arciuolo and burlesque queen ‚ÄúCherry Pitz‚Äù as the crowd looked on and media filmed. Although the actual penis measurements were not announced, members of the press later issued reports: ‚ÄúNone of them [the contestants] were a big deal, and that was the cringe- worthy point‚Äù ‚Äì Brooklyn Paper. ‚ÄúAll the men lined up on the bar wearing only sheer loin-cloths while the judges measured their privates. Staying in the 1-3 inch range, it was truly a tiny affair‚Äù ‚Äì Cosmopolitan. ‚ÄúAll the penises were pretty small‚Äù ‚Äì Jezebel. Aftermath Gilronan received $200, a crown and scepter. According to interviews he gave after the contest, he was contacted and offered a role in a porn film, which he declined. He did make an appearance on the syndicated program, The Doctors. In the weeks following the pageant, Gilronan gave numerous print and radio interviews to publications and stations in America and around the globe. \\"Van Dinkle,\\" in reality a writer from Minnesota, published articles about the pageant for the Australian women's magazine Women's Health & Fitness (December 2013), \\"The Grouchy Editor,\\" and for maxim.com (October 2013). Gilronan returned to Kings County in 2014 to crown his successor, 28-year-old Rajeev Gupta, visiting the United States from India. Media coverage ranged from amused to mocking. Jezebel's Callie Beusman summed up her impressions after attending the pageant: \\"The unabashed display of the small, flaccid phallus ... is fascinating because it's unheard-of. The size of one's penis is an intimate secret; it has the potential to reveal something previously unknown about a man's innermost psyche.\\" Beusman added, \\"But also, it basically goes without saying that an event like this is compelling because of cheap beer and dicks in little tuxedos.\\"  References   External links  * Category:Clothing-optional events Category:2013 establishments in New York (state) Category:Recurring events established in 2013 Category:Human penis ","title":"The Smallest Penis in Brooklyn pageant"},{"id":"45663016","text":"Hagop Ishkanian (, born 27 July 1938) is a contemporary Armenian and American sculptor.

Overview The Commission was established in May 2014 in Mogadishu. On 19 June 2014, the Federal Parliament approved the government committee, with 139 MPs voting in favor, 9 voting against, and 10 abstaining. Asha Gelle Dirie served as the Commission's inaugural Chairperson. The five-member executive body is tasked with overseeing reform of the Provisional Federal Constitution (PFC). On 16 July 2014, the independent Constitutional Review and Implementation Commission held its inaugural meeting in the capital. The gathering was attended by a number of senior government officials, including President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud. Gelle and other panel members therein discussed various federal matters, among which were constitutional amendment procedures, public consultation, and the committee's duty protocols. In March 2015, the Constitutional Review Commission completed the first phase of its constitutional review, with the second phase slated to begin shortly afterwards. According to Chairperson Gelle, the first phase involved ascertaining any technical or political uncertainties in the Provision Federal Constitution. Among these were whether the country should have a Prime Minister or a Deputy President, and which city should serve as the national capital. Gelle estimated that around 85% of the constitutional impasses were technical in nature, while the remainder were political. On 6 May 2015, Gelle stepped down as the Chairperson of the Constitutional Review and Implementation Commission. She cited a lack of sufficient time left for the panel to complete its allotted tasks as the main reason for her resignation. Gelle suggested that some committee members had been working too slowly to meet the deadline, and also indicated that there was a dearth of funds necessary to manage the commission's affairs independently. The constitutional authorities are scheduled to appoint a replacement Chairperson within a week.

The bacterium has a low cytoplasmic potassium content, even when grown in medium containing high KCl concentrations, as has been established by x-ray microanalysis and plasma emission spectrometry. H. halophila causes no known diseases. Applications H. halophila could play a strong role in hydrogen generation, as hydrogen gas is a byproduct of the nitrogen fixation catalyzed by its nitrogenase. H. halophila also serves in the production of organic solutes such as glycine, betaine, ectoine, and trehalose.

Although most of his works were landscapes and still-lifes, he is probably best known for a series of portraits (including numerous self- portraits) painted mostly during the 1910s. Although Ruokokoski never officially joined the November Group, (Marraskuun ryhm√§), he participated in the galleries set up by the group. Biography His father was a shoemaker from Savonia.Biography @ Oravien Aarteita (Taidemuseo) The family returned to Finland when he was thirteen and settled in Helsinki. He studied at the \\"Central School of Art and Design\\" from 1902 to 1904 and at the \\"Art Society Drawing School\\" from 1903 to 1906. There he met Tyko Sallinen. His first public showing came in 1905. Until his first artistic breakthrough came four years later, he earned extra money by drawing advertisements and cartoons. In 1907 he was engaged with a girl named Olga, whom he had encountered in a cafe that he frequently visited. The engagement was broken after a short while the same year. He was very fond of public festivities; especially the circus. In 1909 he married a Swedish-Italian tightrope walker named Elvira Bono. In 1910, they were able to take a trip to Paris, courtesy of a scholarship, and he was introduced to the work of the Impressionists. Ruokokoski in 1912 In 1912, he spent some time in Helsing√∏r, Denmark, with the family of Niels-Peder Rydeng (1880-1949), a tailor and art collector who had once employed Tyko Sallinen. Word had gotten about that Rydeng was a generous man who would offer free room and board in return for paintings. He stayed for several weeks, producing sixty paintings, including portraits of Rydeng's family. They developed a lasting friendship and Ruokokoski returned there many times for brief visits.Niels-peder Rydeng and his art collection @ the Obro Art Gallery. With in Ateneum in the 1910s Back in Helsinki, he was able to sell all the paintings he had brought with him at an exhibition in the Ateneum, but spent most of the money on a drinking and partying binge. This (and a possible flirtation while he was in Helsing√∏r) created a rift between him and his wife, which widened, so they separated. He attempted to emigrate to America in 1914, but the police removed him from the ship due to unpaid debts. Second marriage and more difficulties In 1915, he settled in Hyvink√§√§, where he and Sallinen opened adjacent studios called \\"Humala ja Krapula\\" (Drunk and Hungover).Humala ja Krapula @ the Hyvink√§√§ website. Ruokokoski lived in \\"Drunk\\", painting what he saw from his windows, with an occasional trip to do landscapes. He stayed there until 1918, when he divorced Elvira and married Saima Forsstr√∂m, a model, despite his studio's financial failure. They stayed together for ten years, then separated, although they never divorced and he continued to visit their five children. He was always successful as an artist, exhibiting throughout Scandinavia as well as Rome and Milan, but continued to squander most of his money and was never far from financial ruin. He began producing quickly sketched pictures of simple things such as leaves, food and sunsets to earn extra income. An antique shop that he opened in 1924 failed after only a year. By 1931, he was barely eking out a living from a small tenement apartment. His last exhibition was in 1935. Toward the end of that year, he was hospitalized for alcohol abuse, which had damaged his liver and given him throat cancer. He died the following Spring.

It commemorates of a brief stay there by the great Russian painter Ilya Repin in 1870. Repin's stay In the summer of 1870 the young artist Ilya Repin, then 25 and early in what would become a renowned career, came to the Volga to gather inspiration for paintings of the lives of the river boatmen and burlaks. This sojourn resulted in his painting of the iconic Barge Haulers on the Volga and other work. With Repin came twenty-year-old landscapist Fyodor Vasilyev, Repin's academy classmate Yevgeny Makarov, and Repin's younger brother Basil. \\"Battle-Axe's Yard\\", 1870 sketch by Repin The petite bourgeoisie woman Anna Akhmatova Buyanova (nicknamed \\"Battle-Axe\\") operated a coaching inn at a house on Posad Street (latter Cooperative 117) in Stavropol- on-Volga (the name of Tolyatti at that time). Repin and his companions lived there for two weeks. Repin and his companions then moved further down the Volga to stay in what is now the Repin Museum. Status as a memorial In 1947, some Stavropolians made a corner of the house into a memorial to Repin, with a portrait of the artist and prints of his works. In 1955, as part of the transfer of the city to its new location (the existing city was to be submerged when the Kuybyshev Reservoir was filled), the government had originally intended to move the house to the city center, but later it was decided to place it more on the outskirts. The street in which it was placed is named Repin Street. The building was first placed under protection as a historic monument by executive decision of the government of Kuybyshev Region (the then-current name for Samara Region), order number 735 of December 21, 1970. There is a memorial plaque on the house, and it is designated as a historical and cultural monument of regional significance, so that the original exterior appearance is protected from alteration, including both the structural elements and decorations on the facade. The 2000 city registry indicates that the interior as well as the facade is protected. However, the appearance of the building has changed since Repin's day: originally a log house with a rustic plank roof, in the mid-20th-century it was trimmed with wood siding and iron window gratings and roofed with corrugated iron. Unlike the Repin house in Shiryaevo, this house is not a museum and is not open to the public. Repin Museum Repin Museum in Shiryaevo, a different structure This house is not to be confused with the Repin Museum in the village of Shiryaevo () in the Zhiguliovsk district, located about (38 versts) downstream from Stavropol-on-Don. This is a log house in which Repin and his companions lived after leaving Stavropol-on-Don, and it here that he began the sketches for Barge Haulers on the Volga. This house is also a historic monument of regional importance. It opened as a public museum on June 2, 2007. It includes an ethnographic exhibit with examples of Russian woodcarving, carts, boats, and so forth.

History In 2006, 12 year-old school friends √Åg√∫stsson (guitar and vocals) and Reynisson (drums) formed the band. Serious work only began in 2009 and within two years the band self-published their eponymous first album. In early 2012, the band signed a deal with Icelandic record label Sena ahead of work for their second album. Alexander √ñrn N√∫mason joined shortly after on bass. A second album Voyage was released in 2012 initially by Sena. The band signed to Nuclear Blast shortly after the release of Voyage. This led to a Expand Your Mind music video produced and released by the German record label. The short film shows the psychedelic 'trips' the three members experience. As of July 2015, the video reached 400,000 hits on YouTube becoming the most viewed online song by the band. Nuclear Blast re-released Voyage to a much wider audience. 2014 saw the band playing at festivals such as Roadburn Festival, Wacken Open Air and Hard Rock Hell. In April 2015, the band announced on Facebook that drummer Gu√∞j√≥n Reynisson had left the band for personal reasons however still remained good friends with the remaining band members. In the same post, Stef√°n Ari was introduced to fans as the new drummer of the band. On the 15th May 2015, Arrival was released with Nuclear Blast as the band's third studio album.

Its geography provided a home for numerous groups seeking shelter from across West Africa during the slave trade era. The original name of the settlement was Serminakuu meaning groups of 'grasses'. This name was changed to Banda, which is a corruption of 'Woanda' meaning 'they did not sleep'. Ancestors of Banda Ahenkro were allies of the Asante kingdom during wars and they provided a military force that virtually refused to sleep during at-war times. This is because they were predominantly Muslims and were found praying throughout the night. Later, 'woanda' was also corrupted by the Bono neighbours to become Banda.

Patron traffic quickly rose and broke all records: to meet demand, library staff requested other branches to share their materials. Phonograph albums and children's books were particularly popular.Benidt, Bruce W., The Library Book: Centennial History of the Minneapolis Public Library, Minneapolis Public Library and Information Center, 1984, p. 199. In the first year of service, Washburn circulated 273,000 books, higher than any other Minneapolis Public Library (MPL) branch at the time. Named for William D. Washburn, who was a founder of Washburn-Crosby Milling Company, and a United States Senator, Washburn Library's public art includes a millstone, honoring Minneapolis' heritage as a grain milling center in the 19th and 20th centuries.Neighborhood Revitalization Program, \\"Minneapolis Public Library Issues a Call for Artists\\", November 29, 2005, http://www.nrp.org/R2/News/NewsArch/2005/20051129.html The Washburn-Crosby Milling Company is now known as General Mills.Gold Medal Flour, \\"The Sign,\\" https://historicminneapolissigns.wordpress.com/signs/gold-medal-flour/  The proposed and never built Gratia Countryman Branch Library  Before Washburn Library was built, another library was proposed for Southwest Minneapolis, Gratia Countryman Library at 54th St. and Penn Ave. In 1959 the Minneapolis Public Library Board requested the City Council to acquire by condemnation a site for the new Gratia Countryman Branch Library. The desired land was in southwest Minneapolis in the vicinity of 54th St W. and Penn Ave S. The proposed library was to be the first neighborhood library built by MPL since 1931, when the Linden Hills branch was built. It would serve an area of about 30,000 residents, who were currently accessing library services via the bookmobile and at the nearest branch, the Linden Hills library, several miles away. The Countryman library was also scheduled to be the first in an ambitious 20-year branch expansion program which would extend library services to areas of the city not already served. The site for the proposed Gratia Countryman Library was selected due to the lack of library service in an area with prodigious growth. Bookmobiles were unable to meet the demand for books and information. In a library survey, MPL found that 37,373 books were circulated by bookmobiles throughout the proposed area during the period from January 1 to June 30, 1960. The new proposed branch would house 30,000 books, 100 periodicals, and more than 5,000 pamphlets and clippings. The proposed 14,000 sq. ft. building was estimated to cost $327,000 for construction, planning, site, and equipment. The library selected Graffunder-Nagle & Associates, Inc. to design the structure. Preliminary plans were approved by the library board in November, 1960. But this is where the plans ended. The legislature passed funding for the separate Hennepin County Library system in order to serve the growing suburban population, but rejected plans for growth in the city system. MPL struggled financially and lacked sufficient funds to continue its 20-year branch expansion program. The proposed Gratia Countryman Library was put on hold and then dropped. In June, 1966, the Library Board voted to offer for sale the library property at 54th St. and Penn Ave S. for a minimum price of $37,500. The property was sold in 1969 for $18,400. The desire to honor Gratia Countryman by naming a library after her continued. In 1984, the Library Board discussed the renaming of North Regional Library and in 2000, East Lake Library was suggested. Updates to the library Washburn Library soon after opening in 1970 Approaching its 20th anniversary in 1989, the Washburn branch needed to be expanded and updated to meet patrons' needs. The community it served had expanded, including more children living in the neighborhoods, and demand was bustling for materials.\\"40th Anniversary of Washburn Library,\\" Tangletown Neighborhood, October 2, 2010 http://www.tangletown.org/?p=440 In fact, it was the busiest of Minneapolis's 14 neighborhood branch libraries. In 1990, Minneapolis Public Library leadership determined that the library was in need of significant remodeling and approved an expanded footprint of 18,965 square feet, a 28% increase. In serving the neighborhoods of Lynnhurst, Kenny, Armatage, Tangletown, Windom, Field, Page, Hale and Diamond Lake, it was noted in particular that significant after-school use by children warranted improving services and spaces for their use. The space needed to better meet the needs of the community's patrons: deferred maintenance needed to be performed on the building, and technology upgrades were overdue. Leonard Parker and Associates were chosen to develop the plans. In 2014, a six-week long update to the building resulted in an open floor plan, more space for children and teens, new furniture and shelves, including technology tables for the public computers, and more electrical outlets for powering portable electronics. Art at the library Joining the millstone in the external landscape, the update to the Washburn added a sculpture by Ann Wolfe, Mother and Child, and a large and bright whimsical mural by Virginia Bradley on the domed ceiling above the children's area.Hennepin County Library, Art at Hennepin County Library, https://apps.hclib.org/publicart/ References Category:Minneapolis Public Library Category:Hennepin County Library Category:Library buildings completed in 1970 Category:Libraries in Minnesota Category:Public libraries in Minnesota ","title":"Washburn Library"},{"id":"45663178","text":"Jo√£o Carlos (born May 18, 1992 in Ribeir√£o Pires), is a Brazilian football right-back who currently plays for Brusque.Do Porto-PE ao Cruzeiro: Jo√£o Carlos relembra trajet√≥ria at√© chegar ao Santa Honours ;Confian√ßa *Campeonato Sergipano: 2014 References External links * Jo√£o Carlos at Ogol * Category:1992 births Category:Living people Category:Brazilian footballers Category:Clube Atl√©tico do Porto players Category:Cruzeiro Esporte Clube players Category:Botafogo Futebol Clube (SP) players Category:Associa√ß√£o Desportiva Confian√ßa players Category:Serra Talhada Futebol Clube players Category:Santa Cruz Futebol Clube players Category:Esporte Clube Cruzeiro players Category:Campinense Clube players Category:Brusque Futebol Clube players Category:Fluminense de Feira Futebol Clube players Category:Futebol Clube Cascavel players Category:Maring√° Futebol Clube players Category:Floresta Esporte Clube players Category:Campeonato Brasileiro S√©rie B players Category:Campeonato Brasileiro S√©rie D players Category:Association football midfielders ","title":"Jo√£o Carlos dos Santos Torres"},{"id":"45663189","text":"Kathryn C.

The film was released in 1990 and is a biopic on the life of Juana In√©s de la Cruz. It was based on Octavio Paz's Sor Juana: Or, the Traps of Faith. The film premiered at the 47th Venice International Film Festival where it received the OCIC Award - Honorable Mention. The film was selected as the Argentine entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 63rd Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.Margaret Herrick Library, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Plot In Mexico in the 17th century, the Viceroy of New Spain and the newly elected Archbishop discuss how they will rule. The Archbishop sends a letter to the convent where Sor Juana lives informing the abbess that his first official order of business will be to visit their convent and to meet Sor Juana. For the occasion Sor Juana presents a play she has been working on. The Viceroy and his wife, the Vicereine are impressed with Sor Juana's writing. The Archbishop on the other hand is disturbed that the convent is so lax. He secretly meets with a few nuns and persuades them to elect a more formal abbess. In the meantime Sor Juana and the Vicereine grow close. The Vicereine warns Sor Juana to be careful about how she speaks and what she reads and tells her of an auto-da-f√© she witnessed in which hundreds were burned. Other nuns also approach Sor Juana and ask her to run for election to be the abbess, but Sor Juana refuses saying that she is in the middle of writing an epic poem which she cannot give up. When the new abbess is elected she institutes a vow of poverty and tries to take away Sor Juana's books but the Vicereine insists that she keeps them. The Archbishop then attempts to censor Sor Juana's books based on a poem she has written about the Vicereine which he claims is sinful. Sor Juana's books are taken away but when the Viceroy hears of this he demands they be returned to her. The Vicereine tells Sor Juana that as long as she and her husband are in Mexico she will be protected. Sometime later the Viceroy learns that he has lost favour with the King of Spain and is to be replaced. Before he leaves he visits Sor Juana and asks that she give the Vicereine permission to take her works with her to be published in Spain. Sor Juana agrees. A political enemy of the Archbishop's encourages Sor Juana to write a rebuttal to one of the favourite theologians of the Archbishop. Sor Juana obliges believing the paper is for private circulation. However the work is published along with an attack on Sor Juana condemning her entire oeuvre. In Spain the first volume of Sor Juana's poems have been published. The former Vicereine tasks a friend to bring a copy to Sor Juana who no longer answers letters and lives in seclusion and poverty in the abbey. When her former friend, a priest, agrees to hear her confession he orders her to do penance by relinquishing all her worldly possessions. As a final act of contrition Sor Juana writes a letter to the head of the church confessing that she lived her life as a pagan and signing it with her blood and the words, \\"I worst of all.\\" Reception The film received positive reviews upon its release with many praising Bemberg's directing and Assumpta Serna's acting. The film is rated highly on IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes, with scores of 7.1 out 10 and 3.6 out of 5, respectively. Frederic and Mary Ann Brussat, film reviewers for the website Spirituality and Practice, call the film ‚ÄúAn illuminating and soulful portrait of Latin America's first great poet, who happened to be a brilliant nun in seventeenth-century Mexico.‚Äù According to the Brussats, the film offers an interesting take on the interactions between women of faith and non-traditional beliefs and practices. In the Austin Chronicle reviewer Marjorie Baumgarten gives I, the Worst of All three stars out five. In her review Baumgarten compares the movie to similar period movies. While she appreciates the depiction of a woman, especially a queer woman, defying conventional wisdom and expressing feminist ideas, she found the anti-religious themes to be too repetitive. The film review staff of Time Out: London sing the film's praises saying, ‚ÄúThe drama is progressively unsettling, particularly as the spiritual malaise becomes manifest in the horrific ravages of the plague.‚Äù The review staff found the movie compelling and attention capturing, presenting a fascinating glimpse into one of the greatest female poets of all time.

The film was also released on DVD and VOD August 27, 2013. Plot The documentary follows Rich Teachout, a businessman who has quit his job in order to focus on cultivating a unique haunted attraction. Together with Janel Nash, the two will work on building and operating the Asylum Haunted Scream park during its first year of operation. The documentary also follows other haunted attractions in the Louisville area. Reception Critical reception has been positive. Mark L. Miller of Ain't It Cool News wrote that the end seems like \\"a five minute filler section out of nowhere\\" but that he \\"loved almost every second of Monsters Wanted\\". Culture Crypt gave the film a score of 75, writing, \\"The story is disjointed at times, and some of the issues are artificially inflated into problems that are resolved quickly. But the film creates a fun portrayal of how disparate personalities with a similar dream find commonality in their passion. And how commitment and community are the key ingredients that bring their unified vision together.\\" Mania.com gave a favorable review, writing, \\"You can't help but admire the dedication that the entire staff has in the face of all the problems they encounter and days which last 20 hours. Cunningham and Laughrey do a great job of letting the people tell the story as they stay back and just record the drama. For any horror or haunted house them park fan, this is a fascinating look inside the industry.\\" Accolades The film won \\"Best Documentary\\" at the 2013 Rhode Island International Horror Film Festival, was an official selection at the 2013 Orlando Film Festival, and was the opening night film at the 2014 Transworld Halloween and Attraction Show.

It was released by Som Livre on October 5, 1996. Like Sexto Sentido (1994) and Luz no Meu Caminho (1995), T√¥ de Bem com a Vida was designed with the aim of appealing to both children and teenagers, as the Xuxa audience continued to follow their work. The album has as its main bet the Ax√©. The rhythms and culture of Brazil are very present in the album in tracks like \\"Quadrilha Da Xuxa\\", representing the June Festival and \\"Vaqueiro Vai Buscar Meu Boi\\", which portrays folklore. T√¥ de Bem com a Vida was the first album by a Brazilian artist to be released simultaneously on TV, radio and internet. The album was certified platinum by Associa√ß√£o Brasileira de Produtores de Discos (ABPD). Production and songs In a climate of celebration due to the 10 years of Rede Globo, Xuxa wanted a happy album that reflected his current state of mind and this was the main inspiration of the album that counts on only two slow songs. The highlight of the album is the mix of Brazilian rhythms and themes. Ax√© came as the biggest bet with songs like T√¥ de well with Life and Xuxax√©, in addition to Carnaxuxa that portrays how is the carnival in the different corners of Brazil. Still in the Culture of Brazil issue, was composed \\"A Caravela De Cabral\\", who talks about the history of the discovery of Brazil and \\"Vaqueiro Vai Buscar Meu Boi\\", which brings a bit of folklore to the album. \\"Ai, Ai, Ai\\" was originally composed for the singer Falc√£o. When Z√© Henrique (songwriter) showed the song to the manager of Xuxa at the time, Marlene Mattos, she decided that the presenter would record the song for the album, arguing that the singer was irreverent and would marry the proposal of the album. The track \\"Brincar De Rimar\\" is a re-recording of Fof√£o, but with the letter altered. In the passage that quotes the character, his name is replaced by that of Xuxa. The song \\"Amiga\\", composition in homage to Marlene Mattos, was recorded without the manager knew. The music video was also recorded as a surprise to the manager. The album was entirely produced by Michael Sullivan. Release and reception T√¥ de Bem com a Vida It was released by Som Livre on October 5, 1996 in CD, cassette and LP being the last released in this format. T√¥ de Bem com a Vida, was certified platinum by Associa√ß√£o Brasileira de Produtores de Discos (ABPD), for more than 700,000 copies sold reached. Promotion T√¥ de Bem com a Vida was well publicized in Xuxa Park, as well as the homonymous music that was sung several times in the program and in the frame Xuxa Hits. In addition to singing some of the songs in his attraction, Xuxa participated twice in Doming√£o do Faust√£o, the first on September 29 and the second on October 6 where he was honored in the framework of the program Confidential Archive. Some of the songs won music videos on the specials of Children's Day and Christmas of 1996, these were: \\"T√¥ De Bem Com A Vida\\", \\"Xuxax√©\\", \\"L√° Vai A Loura\\", \\"Brincar De Rimar\\", \\"Ai, Ai, Ai\\" and \\"A Chuva\\". The \\"Amiga\\" video was only shown in 1998 in one of the editions of Xuxa 12 years. In November 1996, Xuxa began the tour of the album by Brazil that extends until December 1997. The show that happened through several cities, was attended by more than 500 thousand people.

It was announced by then-Egyptian housing minister Moustafa Madbouly at the Egypt Economic Development Conference on 13 March 2015. The city will reportedly be named Wedian, the Egyptian Arabic plural for \\"Wadi\\". The new city is to be located 45 kilometers (28 miles) east of Cairo and just outside the Second Greater Cairo Ring Road, in a currently largely undeveloped area halfway to the seaport city of Suez. According to the plans, the city will become the new administrative and financial capital of Egypt, housing the main government departments and ministries, as well as foreign embassies. On total area, it would have a population of 6.5 million people, though it is estimated that the figure could rise to seven million. Officially, a major reason for the undertaking of the project was to relieve congestion in Cairo, which is already one of the world's most crowded cities, with the population of Greater Cairo expected to double in the next few decades. Cairo, for comparison, has a population of nearly 20 million.  Plans  The city is planned to consist of 21 residential districts and 25 \\"dedicated districts\\". Its downtown is to have skyscrapers and a tall monument said to resemble the Eiffel Tower and Washington Monument. The city will also have a park double the size of New York's Central Park, artificial lakes, about 2,000 educational institutions, a technology and innovation park, 663 hospitals and clinics, 1,250 mosques and churches, a 90,000 stadium, 40,000 hotel rooms, a major theme park four times the size of Disneyland, 90 square kilometers of solar energy farms, an electric railway link with Cairo and a new international airport at the site of the Egyptian Air Force's existing Wadi al Jandali Airport. It will be built as a smart city. It is planned that the transfer of parliament, presidential palaces, government ministries and foreign embassies will be completed between 2020 and 2022, at a cost of US $45 billion. A full cost and timescale for the overall project has not been disclosed. Feedback on former experiences of capital relocation was looked at, for instance by meeting with representatives from Nur-Sultan (then Astana), which replaced Almaty as the capital city of Kazakhstan in 1997.(Russian) Egypt takes over the experience of Astana for transferring capital, Zakon.kz, 14 March 2016. The first government officials were expected to move into their new offices in 2019.Egypt prepares to open its grand new capital - An elephant in the desert, Economist, 25 Jan 2019 Transportation A train to Cairo is being built. The line will start from Adly Mansour Station at Al Salam City on Cairo Metro Line 3, and will split into two branches at Robeiky. One will run northward, parallel to the Cairo Ring Road, to 10th of Ramadan City, and the other will go south towards the New Administrative Capital. Intermediate cities along the train‚Äôs route include Obour, Shorouk, and Mostaqbal. https://www.egypttoday.com/Article/1/82879/Minister-reveals-accomplishment- rates-of-New-Capital-train  Construction  Speaking prior to the official announcement, Egypt's investment minister Ashraf Salman had already mentioned the possibility of a new capital being \\"developed, master-planned and executed by a private sector company\\", at no cost to the Egyptian treasury. It was revealed that the city will be built by Capital City Partners, a private real estate investment firm led by Emirati businessman Mohamed Alabbar. When the project was officially announced in March 2015, it was revealed that the Egyptian military had already begun building a road from Cairo to the site of the future capital. In September 2015, Egypt cancelled the memorandum of understanding (MoU) signed with the UAE's Mohamed Alabbar during the March economic summit, since they did not make any progress with the proposed plans. In the same month Egypt signed a new MoU with China State Construction Engineering Corporation (CSCEC) to \\"study building and financing\\" the administrative part of the new capital, which will include ministries, government agencies and the president‚Äôs office. CSCEC signed agreements with Egyptian authorities in early 2016 and in 2017 and 2018 to develop parts of the project. Egyptian construction company Arab Contractors (in Arabic El- Mokawloon El-Arab) was called for constructing the water supply and sewage lines to the new capital. The company stated that the studies needed were done in August and it is supposed that the project will take 3 months to supply the city with the main services needed in order to prepare it for the construction work. In January 2019, President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi inaugurated Egypt and Middle East's largest cathedral called \\"The Nativity of Christ\\" in the NAC and a mega-mosque called \\"Al-Fattah Al-Aleem Mosque\\" second only in size to Great Mosque of Mecca in Saudi Arabia. Further parts of the city, including the diplomatic areas, were expected to be inaugurated in the fall of 2019.

She was also the first woman to be certified by the American Board of Thoracic Surgery, and the first to be elected to the American Association for Thoracic Surgery. In 1960, at the age of 32, she led the operative team at the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) that implanted the first successful artificial mitral human heart valve replacement, which she had designed and fabricated. She died in August 1992 in Weston, Massachusetts, after a career that included prominent appointments at the NIH, University of California, San Diego, Harvard Medical School, and Brigham and Women's Hospital. Early life and education Nina Starr was born in Brooklyn, New York, in 1928. Braunwald showed early scientific promise when at age 14 she became a member of the American Society of Amateur Microscopers.3\\\\. Benfield JR and Kohman LJ. Mentorship, Women Thoracic Surgeons, and the Thoracic Surgery Foundation for Research and Education. The Annals of thoracic surgery. 78: 1135-6. She received her baccalaureate and medical degrees from New York University, and from 1952 to 1955 she trained in general surgery at New York's Bellevue Hospital, one of the first women to do so. Career Starr Braunwald adjusting a test chamber holding an artificial heart valve. Braunwald completed her training in general surgery at Georgetown University Hospital in Washington, D.C., with a postdoctoral fellowship in the surgical laboratory of Charles A. Hufnagel, inventor of the first artificial heart valve. She joined the NIH National Heart Institute (now the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute) in nearby Bethesda, Maryland in 1958 under the mentorship of Andrew G. Morrow. She was a Staff Surgeon at the National Heart Institute until 1965, and then was named Deputy Chief of the Clinic of Surgery, a position she held until 1968. Braunwald designed and fabricated an experimental, artificial mitral valve prostheses, implanting them in dogs at the National Heart Institute's surgical clinic in 1959. On 11 March 1960, she performed the first successful human implant, in a 44-year-old woman with mitral regurgitation. She then developed a cloth-covered mechanical valve (the Braunwald-Cutter valve), which was implanted into thousands of patients during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Her other significant contributions include the development of the stented aortic homograft (a graft of same-species tissue, in this case, human tissue) for mitral valve replacement, surgical treatment of chronic thromboembolic disease, and pioneering techniques for the use of tissue cultures to discourage the formation of clots when prosthetic valves and circulatory assist devices are in use. In the 1960s, articles in Life and Time magazines described her as one of America's young \\"movers and shakers.\\" In 1962, she received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. Braunwald moved to the University of California, San Diego along with her husband, who was appointed Chief of Medicine while she was appointed Associate Professor of Surgery. While at UC San Diego, Braunwald established a Cardiothoracic surgery training program. She followed her husband once again, in 1972, to the Boston area, where she became an Associate Professor of Surgery at Harvard Medical School. While at Harvard, she was a Staff Surgeon in the Division of Cardiac and Thoracic Surgery at Brigham and Women‚Äôs Hospital, a Staff Surgeon in the Division of Cardiac Surgery at Boston Children's Hospital, and a Consultant in the Division of Cardiac Surgery at the West Roxbury Veterans Administration Medical Center. Braunwald published more than 110 peer-reviewed articles in leading journals such as Circulation, The New England Journal of Medicine, and the Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery. Her work also received media attention, as well as having an impact on cardiac surgery. Following her death, the Thoracic Surgery Foundation for Research and Education established the Nina Starr Braunwald Research Grant, to recognize her commitment to the early academic development of women in cardiac surgery. The award includes two years of research funding support and is given annually to a promising young woman academic cardiac surgeon. This foundation also offers the Nina Starr Braunwald Research Fellowship to provide salary and direct experimental support for women cardiac surgical trainees who wish to learn investigational skills. Similarly, the Association of Women Surgeons provides an annual Nina Starr Braunwald Award to a surgical leader who has demonstrated exceptional support of a role for women in academic surgery.  Personal life  In 1952 she married Eugene Braunwald, her classmate in college and medical school and also a cardiovascular researcher, with whom she had three daughters.

The museum also features major traveling exhibitions and installations throughout the year. The museum began as the Boise Gallery of Art, opening in 1937 through a partnership between the Boise Art Association, the City of Boise and the Federal Works Progress AdministrationThe Idaho Statesman, Julia Davis Park: A Timeline, (Boise, Idaho) 17 June 2007, Pg. 04. as a space for people living in the Boise area to see local artists, traveling exhibitions and artwork on loan. The museum's original Art Deco and Egyptian Revival building was renovated in 1972 and again in 1988 when the name was changed to the Boise Art Museum and the museum increased focus on the development of a permanent collection and educational programming. In 1997, the museum was expanded again to include larger administrative offices, storage, a sculpture court and educational studios. Today the Boise Art Museum is the only AAM accredited museum collecting fine art in Idaho and functions as a center for fine arts in the Treasure Valley. Collection  1934‚Äì1988  Collecting began under the Boise Art Association in 1934, who began amassing their collection before the Boise Gallery of Art had begun construction. The first work purchased by the Association was a painting by Harvey Gregory Pruscheck, for a cost of $100, after the painting was in their exhibition in the Boise Hotel (now the Hoff Building). Another early donation, the oil painting Mustard Field by Fanny Dike Burns, came in memory of the artist after the painting was included in a show in May 1933.The Idaho Sunday Statesman, Boise Art Association Promotes Wide Slate of Activities: Exhibitions, Lectures Enhance Culture of Valley (Boise, Idaho) 26 July 1966, Pg. 13F By 1955, the small collection included works from the artists Helen Aupperle, Reeves Ulher, Olaf Moller, Robert Phillip, Alexis J.

A 1963 donation by Robert V. Hansberger of six oil paintings, then valued at $12,350, was the largest donation the Association had received to date.

According to Ric Collier, the then curator of art, the ideal collection for the Gallery should act as a record of the Gallery's exhibits, should demonstrate the Gallery's commitment to Idaho artists, and should help build the reputation of the Gallery in the field. In 1979, the Idaho Commission on the Arts gave the Gallery $2,000 to buy Idaho art, which they used to buy Last Black Triangle by Boyd Wright, as well as works by David Wharton, Charles Crist, and a commissioned work by Montana artist Dana Boussard. In 1980, the Gallery received donations from both the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters, of a work by Sam Francis, as well as the estate of the wife of Reginald Marsh, of four of the artist's works.Steele, Judy, The Idaho Statesman, Gallery Boosts Permanent Collection (Boise, Idaho) 13 July 1980, Pg. 3D  Since 1988  The Boise Art Museum began actively collecting in 1988 under curator Sandy Harthorn, who helped develop the permanent collection to 1,200 objects in 1991 and to 3,500 by her retirement in 2015.

It was released on September 22, 1997 by Som Livre. It was the last Xuxa album to be released as a cassette. The album follows the style of the three discs previously released, focusing on the children and youth audience, but this time betting more on pop and ax√©. Boas Not√≠cias, was certified platinum disc by Associa√ß√£o Brasileira de Produtores de Discos (ABPD). Background and production After the celebrations of 10 years of Globo TV and the success of the album T√¥ de Bem com a Vida (1996), Xuxa was preparing to debut a new program on Rede Globo, Planeta Xuxa. The production of the new album begins with the ordering of themes for the new evening attraction, thus arises the songs \\"Planeta Xuxa\\" and \\"Libera Geral\\". Including, initially Libera Geral would be the track that would give title to the album. This possibility was worked until July 1997. In addition to bringing a bit of pop, something that had been left out of the previous release, it is possible to note that little by little, Xuxa was bringing back more childish songs to his records like the case of \\"Preste Aten√ß√£o\\", \\"Agora eu Vou Andar (Andar Devagarinho)\\" and \\"Godofredo, o Piolho\\". The ax√© that was high at the time and began to become one of the marks of the albums of the 90s of Xuxa, also influences the album. In addition to \\"Xuxa Lel√™\\" and \\"Libera Geral\\", \\"Diet\\" was included, composition of Carlinhos Brown that would be part of the carnival album that would be released in early 1997, but was canceled. \\"Na Hora em Que Voc√™ Quiser Chegar\\", it is highlighted because it was made up of the blonde's great desire to become a mother. The presenter had been discussing for some time the desire to have a child and out of curiosity, Xuxa discovered in December 1997 that she was pregnant. For Boas Not√≠cias, the singer decided to take quite different pictures. On the day of the rehearsal, Xuxa carried a suitcase with dozens of wigs that were used in the photo essay. The pictures with the brown wig were published in Manchete magazine in 1997 and none of them were used in the album. Another part of the essay was published in the magazine Caras that same year. The album was produced by Michael Sullivan, wears the artistic direction of Aramis Barros, was recorded in the studios: Som Livre and had co-production Z√© Henrique, Marlene Mattos and Xuxa Meneghel. Release and reception Boas Not√≠cias It was released on September 22, 1997 in CD and cassette format. Boas Not√≠cias, was certified platinum disc by Associa√ß√£o Brasileira de Produtores de Discos (ABPD), for more than 500,000 copies sold reached, #15 position among the 50 best-selling albums of Brazil, according to Billboard. Promotion The release of Boas Not√≠cias only really began in August 1997 when Xuxa began to present the album's songs in their shows. \\"Xuxa Lel√™\\", \\"Agora eu Vou Andar (Andar Devagarinho)\\" and \\"Super Hiper\\" (that soon after was discarded from the album) were the first ones shown to the public in Xuxa Park. \\"Libera Geral\\" and \\"Planeta Xuxa\\" were already known by the public for being themes of the same name program and presented in the shows of the second phase of the Tour T√¥ de bem com a Vida. Still in August, a single was distributed to the radios of all Brazil with the songs \\"Boas Not√≠cias\\" and \\"Serenata do Grilo\\". Entitled Xuxa 97, the single received this name because the album still did not have a definite name. On September 28, 1997, Xuxa held a free concert at Parque do Carmo in S√£o Paulo to announce the launch of Boas Noticias. The presentation was attended by more than 200 thousand people. After the event, more songs from the album will be included in the set of the Tour T√¥ de bem com a Vida and the singles are performed at Santa's Arrival in Porto Alegre. The following month, the Queen of Children stars in a Children's Day special that featured music videos: \\"Xuxa Lel√™\\", \\"Amarelinha (Pulando, Pulando)\\", \\"Serenata do Grilo\\", \\"Boas Not√≠cias\\" and \\"Ora√ß√£o de um Novo Mil√™nio\\". Much of this special, just as his video were recorded in Fortaleza, Cear√°. In addition to the videos, a show was held at Beach Park where the blonde introduced some of the songs from her most recent release. The song \\"Meu Xamego\\" also won a music videos that year, but recorded for the Christmas special, as well as the discarded \\"Celeiro do Mundo\\". Still in the week of the children's day, Xuxa decided to make a live edition of Planet Xuxa on the eve of the holiday. The blonde sang some of the songs that were already known by the audience and distributed CDs to the audience. Also from the live edition, the release of the disc was incorporated into the scenario of the Planeta. The photos of the rehearsal for the Xuxa Dance album that adorned the scenery were replaced by pictures from the rehearsal for Boas Not√≠cias, photos of the children's day special and the show T√¥ de bem e a Vida. In addition to the floor that was changed to an image with the label of the new release and a red strip written Boas Not√≠cias. On the Queen's official website, the songs \\"Planeta Xuxa\\", \\"Libera Geral\\" and \\"Amarelinha (Pulando, Pulando)\\" were made available in two versions: those of the album and those specially made for the TV show. Unlike previous albums, the Boas Not√≠cias tour only took place the following year. The show premiered on February 20 in Santos, S√£o Paulo on Gonzaga Beach. The show brought together about 100,000 people on the scene. In addition to the concerts, music videos and performances, the commercial album was shown several times in the programming of Rede Globo in 3 different versions: two versions of 30 seconds and one of ten seconds. In all of them, Xuxa images were displayed singing the working songs of the disc in their programs.

The sequencing of reference genomes, in particular the Human Genome Project, has revolutionized human genetics, molecular biology, and clinical medicine. Genome-wide association study results have led to the association of genes with most Mendelian disorders, and over 140 000 germline mutations have been associated with at least one genetic disease. However, it became apparent that inherent to these studies is an emphasis on clinical outcome rather than a comprehensive understanding of human disease; indeed to date the most significant contributions of GWAS have been restricted to the ‚Äúlow-hanging fruit‚Äù of direct single mutation disorders, prompting a systems biology approach to genomic analysis. The connection between genotype and phenotype (how variation in genotype affects the disease or normal functioning of the cell and the human body) remain elusive, especially in the context of multigenic complex traits and cancer. To assign functional context to genotypic changes, much of recent research efforts have been devoted to the mapping of the networks formed by interactions of cellular and genetic components in humans, as well as how these networks are altered by genetic and somatic disease. Background With the sequencing of the genomes of a diverse array or model organisms, it became clear that the number of genes does not correlate with the human perception of relative organism complexity ‚Äì the human proteome contains some 20 000 genes, which is smaller than some species such as corn. A statistical approach to calculating the number of interactions in humans gives an estimate of around 650 000, one order of magnitude bigger than Drosophila and 3 times larger than C. Elegans. As of 2008, only about <0.3% of all estimated interactions among human proteins has been identified, although in recent years there has been exponential growth in discovery ‚Äì as of 2015, over 210 000 unique human positive protein‚Äìprotein interactions are currently catalogued, and bioGRID database contains almost 750 000 literature-curated PPI's for 30 model organisms, 300 000 of which are verified or predicted human physical or genetic protein‚Äìprotein interactions, a 50% increase from 2013. The currently available information on the human interactome network originates from either literature-curated interactions, high-throughput experiments, or from potential interactions predicted from interactome data, whether through phylogenetic profiling (evolutionary similarity), statistical network inference, or text/literature mining methods. Protein‚Äìprotein interactions are only the raw material for networks. To form useful interactome databases and create integrated networks, other types of data that can be combined with protein‚Äìprotein interactions include information on gene expression and co- expression, cellular co-localization of proteins (based on microscopy), genetic information, metabolic and signalling pathways, and more. The end goal of unravelling human protein interactomes is ultimately to understand mechanisms of disease and uncover previously unknown disease genes. It has been found that proteins with a high number of interactions (outward edges) are significantly more likely to be hubs in modules that correlate with disease, probably because proteins with more interactions are involved in more biological functions. By mapping disease alterations to the human interactome, we can gain a much better understanding of the pathways and biological processes of disease. Studying the human interactome Analysis of metabolic networks of proteins hearkens back to the 1940s, but it was not until the late 1990s and early 2000s that computational data-driven genomic analyses to predict functional context and networks of genetic associations appeared in earnest. Since then, the interactomes of many model organisms are considered to have been well characterized, notably the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Interactome and the Drosophila interactome. High throughput experimental approaches for discovering protein‚Äìprotein interactions typically perform a version of the two-hybrid screening approach or tandem affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry. Information from experiments and literature curation are compiled into databases of protein interactions, such as DIP, and BioGRID. A more recent effort, HINT-KB, attempts to amalgamate most of the current PPI databases, but filtering systematically erroneous interactions as well as trying to correct for inherent sociological sampling biases in literature curated datasets. Smaller human interactome networks have been described in the specific context of important drivers of many different disorders, including neurodegenerative disorders, autism and other psychiatric disorders, and cancer. Cancer gene networks have been particularly well studied, due in part to large genome initiatives such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). A large portion of the mutational landscape including intra- tumoural heterogeneity has been mapped for most common types of cancers (for example, breast cancer has been well studied), and many studies have also investigated the difference between active driver genes and passive passenger mutations in the context of cancer interaction networks. The first attempts at large-scale integrative human interactome mapping occurred around 2005. Stetzl et al. used a protein matrix of 4500 baits and 5600 preys in a yeast two hybrid system to piece together the interactome, and Rual et al. performed a similar yeast-two hybrid study verified with co-affinity purification and correlation with other biological attributes, revealing more than 300 connections to 100 disease-associated proteins. Since those pioneering efforts, hundreds of similar studies have been conducted. Compiled databases such as UniHI provide platform for single entry. Futschik et al. performed a meta analysis of eight interactome maps and found that of 57 000 interacting proteins in total, there was a small (albeit statistically significant) overlap between the different databases, indicating considerable selection and detection biases. In 2010, around 130 000 binary interactions in the interactome were described in the most popular databases, but many were verified with only one source. With the rapid development of high throughput methods, datasets still suffer from high rates of false positives and low coverage of the interactome. Tyagi et al. described a novel framework for incorporating structural complexes and binding interfaces for verification. This was part of much larger efforts for PPI verification; interaction networks are typically validated further by using a combination of coexpression profiles, protein structural information, Gene ontology terms, topological considerations, and colocalization before being considered ‚Äúhigh- confidence‚Äù. A recent resource paper (November 2014) attempts to provide a more comprehensive proteome level map of the human interactome. It found vast uncharted territory in the human interactome, and used diverse methods to build a new interactome map correcting for curation bias, including probing all pairwise combinations of 13 000 protein products for interaction using Yeast two hybrid and co-affinity purification, in a massive coordinated effort across research labs in Canada and the United States. However, this still represents confirmation of but a fraction of expected interactions ‚Äì around 30 000 of high confidence. Despite the coordinated efforts of many, the human interactome is still very much a work in progress.

Biography He was born on November 27, 1893 in France to Theodore Marburg, the United States Ambassador to Belgium from 1912 to 1914. He was educated at Oxford University. After graduation he joined the Royal Flying Corps in England. While on a mission to photograph the German lines in 1915, his plane crashed and a strut pierced his left knee, requiring the leg to be amputated.

After the war, Marburg moved to the American Southwest where he purchased a cattle ranch, believing an outdoor life would be good for his health. He married Baroness Gesell de Vavario of Belgium in Southampton, England in April 1916. Unhappy with ranch life, she abandoned him and they divorced on August 15, 1921 in Santa Cruz County, Arizona.

He gained widespread popularity in 2015 thanks to a series of memes from a television interview from June 2007 on Jes√∫s Quintero's show Ratones Coloraos.  Biography  Joya was born in Seville. He had a number of jobs throughout his life, including cooking and unloading sacks of cement. His first appearance on television was in 2000, on Jes√∫s Quintero's show El Vagamundo, where he interviewed on various life situations with his partner \\"El Pe√≠to\\" or \\"el Cu√±ao\\", in a comedic tone. He became recognizable for his high-pitched, wheezing laugh (described in The Guardian as like a \\"dolphin with a 20-a-day habit.\\"), which led to his nickname \\"El Risitas\\" (translated to \\"the giggles\\" in English). He also appeared in the 2005 film Torrente 3: El protector. When he became known internationally by 2015 (see internet meme) he did also perform for companies outside of Spain, for example in a Finnish commercial. In September 2020, Joya was hospitalized and had his leg amputated due to an illness. Ratones Coloraos interview meme In 2002, Joya appeared on Jes√∫s Quintero's show Ratones Coloraos and described an incident when he worked as a dishwasher. He describes leaving some paella pans (paelleras) at night in the ocean to soak and clean, and when in the morning he returned to retrieve the pans, they had washed out to sea with the tide. He frequently interrupts the story with his trademark laugh. The original video was uploaded to YouTube on June 25, 2007, and received over a million views eight years before the meme became widespread. Note: The date value is the video upload date on YouTube. In March 2014, footage from the interview was used by the Muslim Brotherhood to parody the President of Egypt Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. Other parodies were also produced, usually parodying technology and gaming. The most viewed versions of the video subtitled Joya as the designer of the Nvidia GeForce GTX 970 graphics card, a designer of Team Fortress 2, a Valve employee discussing Dota 2, a Canon representative discussing the C300 camera, an Xbox Live employee describing the platform's system, and a cinematographer describing shooting on a Red camera. In March 2015, the meme received its most attention after the launch of the 2015 MacBook, where Joya was subtitled as a designer who worked on the prototype. Within a month of its uploading, the video received over five million views on YouTube. The meme's impact has been compared to parodies of the 2004 war drama Downfall, where several scenes from the film are similarly edited with fake subtitles. Another popular meme was published in April 2015 parodying a political affair in Slovakia known as the Vahostav affair, where Joya was subtitled by popular Slovak stand-up comedy performer Jano Gordulic. In June 2016 it was used to parody the Brexit decision in Great Britain, with El Risitas allegedly having been an advisor to David Cameron in planning the Brexit campaign. (Risitas Parody) Brexit, UK leaves the EU. In November 2018, the meme had yet another success in criticizing Blizzard Entertainment's decision to bring Diablo to mobile devices with the new game, Diablo Immortal, with 350,000 views. In 2019, a zoomed-in still image of his face, named KEKW, was added as a 3rd party emote for Twitch on FrankerFaceZ. As of October 2019, over 10,000 channels on Twitch have enabled the emote.

The royal title had been in abeyance since the death of his maternal uncle Waris Ali Meerza (the third Nawab Bahadur of Murshidabad) in 1969. All the royal title such as Nawab have been abolished by the government of India in 1971.  Early life  Abbas Ali Meerza is the eldest son of Syed Md.

Title  The title would have been passed down to the children of Waris Ali Meerza upon his death in 1969 had they not been either disinherited by their father, predeceased him or had excluded themselves from the succession under Indian law by adopting foreign citizenship. Waris Ali Meerza died in 1969, survived by his three sons and three daughters. According to the Nawab's law, the eldest son of the Nawab was to succeed him, however, Waris Ali's eldest son, Wakif Ali Meerza, was excluded from succession by his father for contracting a non-Muslim marriage and for not professing the Muslim religion. Waris Ali took no steps during his lifetime to establish his succession. Before declaring a successor Waris Ali then died. No clear successor to Waris Ali emerged. The other children of Waris Ali moved to the United Kingdom and became citizens, sacrificing any claim over the title.

It is one of the precursor organizations of the International Astronomical Union. The Union was the brain-child of George Ellery Hale, who had realized the potential value of an international organization to coordinate scientific research and, by virtue of his extensive travels throughout Europe, had many contacts among eminent astronomers and solar physicists. Hale suggested to the National Academy of Sciences of the US the formation of a committee with the aim of forming such an international organization, and, as the committee's chairman, began contacting various scientific academies. His efforts led to a meeting at the St. Louis Exposition of 1904 and included representatives from 16 national scientific societies, but notably not from the Prussian Academy of Sciences, which had declined the invitation. (Instead, German delegates from the German Physical Society were present.) The delegates proceeded to appoint a committee that was to create the Union as a permanent international scientific organization; the new organization had its first constituted meeting at Oxford in England a year later. Further meetings were held in Paris in 1907 and at Mount Wilson in 1910, where the purview of the Union was enlarged to include stellar research, in keeping with Hale's emphasis on the Sun as just one among the many other stars. Shortly after the last meeting in Bonn in 1913, World War I broke out, which effectively put an end to the Union's activities, which would later find continuation after the 1919 founding of the International Astronomical Union.Walter S.

The band released their second and best-selling AOR album, titled Runaway, in 1984. The band experienced several line-up changes during the 1980s and eventually stopped performing in 1987. During the 1990s and 2000s original member Jerry Hludzik continued to record a number of records under the Dakota name, featuring guest musicians, friends and also his son Eli Hludzik. In 2014, original members Jerry Hludzik and Bill Kelly reunited and teamed up with Jon Lorance and Eli Hludzik to record a new Dakota album titled Long Road Home, which was released on October 30, 2015.  Origins  The origins of Dakota can be traced back as far as the early 1970s in North East Pennsylvania, USA, to a band called The Buoys and a million-selling single called Timothy. The song, written by Rupert Holmes, was supposedly about the local Sheppton mine disaster of 1963 and reached the Billboard Top 40 chart on April 17, 1971, remaining on the chart for eight weeks, peaking at #17, as listed in The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits by Joel Whitburn. The Buoys was spearheaded by lead singer and guitarist Bill Kelly and Jerry Hludzik on guitar and supporting vocals. In 1978 Bill and Jerry left the group and teamed up as the Jerry-Kelly band, making use of members from popular local bands. That same year the band was signed to Epic Records under the production team of Danny Seraphine (Chicago drummer at the time), and David \\"Hawk\\" Wolinski of Rufus, to record Somebody Else's Dream, the first and only Jerry-Kelly album. By 1979, with the band's next scheduled release due, Columbia records insisted that the band change its name and after several options were discussed Dakota was chosen. Jerry-Kelly drummer, Gary Driscoll, left the band in early 1980, leaving the band without a drummer. Producers Danny Seraphine and Hawk Wolinski drafted in Rufus drummer, John Robinson, and produced Dakota's first self-titled album Dakota, with the track If It Takes All Night becoming the band's first single to receive regional airplay, peaking at #78 on the Billboard Charts in 1980.  The Game Tour (1980)  Long-time friend of Bill and Jerry, Michael Stahl, who was working with Queen on their 1980 The Game Tour, managed to secure Dakota as the opening act for Queen on their 35-date tour. Dakota's lineup now consisted of Jerry Hludzik and Bill Kelly on guitars and vocals, Bill McHale on bass, Jeff Mitchell on keyboards, Lou Cossa on keys and guitar and new drummer Tony Romano. During the tour a feud between Columbia Records and the band Chicago developed and Dakota's association with Chicago founding member, Danny Seraphine (who produced their first single), led to the band receiving lackluster backing from Columbia Records for the remainder of their time at the label.  Runaway (1984)  After the 1980‚Äì1981 The Game Tour was over, and without tour support, the band lost several members, including Bill McHale, Jeff Mitchell, Lou Cossa and Tony Romano. Auditions for replacements were held during January and February 1982. Keyboard player and guitarist Rick Manwiller, previously from progressive rock band Steph, joined early that year. After working on new material during 1982, Dakota traveled to Los Angeles in early 1983 to record their second album, titled Runaway (MCA-5502) on the MCA label, engineered by Humberto Gatica and produced by Danny Seraphine. The lineup consisted of Jerry Hludzik and Bill Kelly on guitars and vocals, Danny Seraphine on drums and Rick Manwiller on keys. Several guest and session artists also appeared on the album, including guitarists Richie Zito and Paul Jackson, bassist Neil Stubenhaus, Rolling Stones sax-player Ernie Watts, Chicago vocalist Bill Champlin, Chicago keyboardist Robert Lamm and Toto keyboardist Steve Porcaro. Runaway was released in 1984, but in the absence of promotional- and tour backing from Columbia Records the album did not achieve the chart success the band anticipated. In 2002 Runaway was re- released on compact disc and in digital format and soon garnered acclaim from critics and fans alike as one of the most underrated AOR records of the 1980s. In 2011 Swedish based band Houston covered the title track from the Runaway album for inclusion on their Relaunch album. The single was featured in the Red Bull short film Danny MacAskill's Imaginate in 2013.  Hiatus (1987)  Due to the strained relations with Columbia Records, as well as personal differences between band members, Dakota played their final performance of the 1980s at Scranton's Montage Amphitheater in 1987 in front of roughly 17,000 fans. The band stopped performing, while band members pursued personal projects. During the 1990s and 2000s original member Jerry Hludzik continued to record three more records under the Dakota name, featuring a variety of session musicians, friends and also his son Eli Hludzik, achieving success in Europe and Japan.  Reunion (2014)  In 2014 original members Jerry Hludzik and Bill Kelly reunited and teamed up with Jon Lorance and Eli Hludzik to record a new Dakota album titled Long Road Home, which was released on 30 October 2015.

John Andraos 2002 - 2005 - 24 February 1973 in Alamo, California) was a chemist at the University of Chicago who co-discovered the elements curium (1944) and americium (1944-1945). Later he worked at UCLA and at the Lawrence Livermore laboratory in California. He also worked on niobium and nuclear spectroscopy.Ralph Arthur James. Enciclopedia Treccani.it  Scientific career  James was part of the Laboratory of Metallurgy, University of Chicago, the team headed by Glenn T. Seaborg. The laboratory had large amounts of plutonium (discovered in 1940-41) that was being produced in Hanford Site to make nuclear weapons. This allowed them to discover two new elements, although the difficulties for study and isolation were great. In 1944, Seaborg decided to extend the search to heavier elements, and notified chemists Ralph A. James and Leon O. Morgan that irradiasen plutonium and they sent the samples to Chicago for Albert Ghiorso to analyze. By identifying characteristics of emitted alpha particles they found the new elements.  Discovery of curium  Curium (atomic number 96) was discovered in 1944 by Glenn T. Seaborg, Ralph A. James and Albert Ghiorso during World War II in the Chicago Metallurgical Laboratory, as part of the Manhattan Project, by bombing plutonium with helium ions.Curium Elementymology & Elements Multidict.

She is Senior Investigator at the Section on Molecular Genetics of Immunity at the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland and a professor at the University of Maryland, College Park. Personal life Ozato was born in Japan near the beginning of World War II. After the war, the entire Japanese culture was destroyed and left the country in shambles. Along with extreme poverty, Ozato's father suffered from tuberculosis which ultimately fueled her interest in immunology.SPOTLIGHT: WOMEN IN SCIENCE: REFLECTING ON FIVE DECADES OF RESEARCH WITH KEIKO OZATO.\\" States News Service, 7 Feb. 2019.

She has also spoken of the support her mother, \\"a traditional Japanese housewife with no scientific education\\", that gave her choice of career. Ozato is married and has said that her husband is a valued scientific ally. Education and career Ozato received her Ph.D. in Developmental Biology from Kyoto University in Japan in 1973 and then pursued postdoctoral training in developmental immunology at the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington from 1973 to 1975. She was also a research associate at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine from 1975 to 1978 and a visiting associate at the National Cancer Institute from 1978 to 1981. Ozato joined the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development in 1981 to launch an independent research group in molecular immunology and received tenure in 1987. In 1990 her laboratory isolated and reported IRF8 (Interferon regulatory factor 8), a transcription factor critical for host resistance against pathogens in macrophages and dendritic cells; she and her research group demonstrated its centrality to the induction of proinflammatory cytokines and autophagy regulation in these cells. IRF8 also happens to be crucial in the fighting of tuberculosis in the human immune system. In 2014 Ozato also identified the BRD4 protein that binds to acetylated histones, proving that it recruits the elongation factor P-TEFb (CyclinT/CDk9 complex) and regulates many cellular and viral genes. She also discovered that BRD4 remains on chromosomes during mitosis and through that process invokes epigenetic memory. This was a key discovery in understanding the mechanisms in which epigenetic memory occurs. These advancements in the understanding of BRD4 proteins are allowing for advancements in the treatment of blood cancers and inflammatory diseases. She is also a professor at the University of Maryland, College Park, as well as teaching several immunology courses in the NIH graduate program. She has served as President of the International Society of Interferon and Cytokine Research, and is on the editorial board of Molecular and Cell Biology, the Journal of Biological Chemistry, the Journal of Interferon and Cytokine Research, and Immunogenetics. Honors Ozato was awarded the Milstein Award from the International Cytokine and Interferon Society in 2004. In 2012, she received the Order of the Sacred Treasure, Third Class, from the Government of Japan for promoting cooperation and exchange between Japan and the United States in the areas of science and technology.

Life Eisel was born into a Communist (albeit relatively apolitical) working-class family in Lauterbach, a small town roughly 100 km (63 miles) north-east of Frankfurt am Main. He was the eldest of his parents' five children. At the start of 1945 he was ordered to go to nearby Battenberg to join one of the flak units set up to try to reduce the impact of enemy bombing raids on the important railway line there. He did not obey the order, and very shortly afterwards the US army occupied Lauterbach. In May 1945 the end of the war marked a return to multi-party government and Eisel, by then 16 years old, immediately took the opportunity to join the local Communist Party. In 1946‚Äì47 he was working as a truck driver. In 1947, as millions of Germans were moving west, the Eisel family moved east,\\"In the period between the Second World War and 1961, a total of 3.8 million people emigrated from East to West Germany.\\" Laar, M.

Central and Eastern Europe after 1945.\\" Centre for European Studies, p. 58. relocating to what was, between 1945 and 1949, the Soviet occupation zone in what remained of Germany. Fritz Eisel applied to study at the University of Architecture and Fine Arts (as it was then known) in Weimar and was accepted. During his first two years as a student, Eisel's approach to the various abstract exercises and projects he was set by his teacher Hans Hoffmann-Lederer was entirely orthodox. As he himself said, that helped him in some ways, but it also undermined his abstract presentational abilities. That changed, however, in 1949 when responsibility for his further artistic education was taken on by Fritz D√§hn who had transferred to Weimar the previous year from Stuttgart, and Eisel made further progress when D√§hn and Eisel transferred to the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts where Eisel continued his studies from 1950 till 1951. The Soviet occupation zone had become German Democratic Republic in October 1949, and in 1951 Fritz Eisel joined the German League of Visual artists (VBKD / Verband Bildender K√ºnstler Deutschlands). However, he still felt undertrained, and that same year he accepted an offer to attend the Academy of Arts in Leningrad, where one of his teachers was Boris Ioganson, and where he continued his artistic development till 1957. \\"House of Mining and Energy Workers\\" in Hoyerswerda Returning to East Germany, from 1957 Eisel based himself initially in Dresden and later in Potsdam, working as a freelance artist. One of his better known works from this time is his multi-part mosaic in the Potsdam Data Processing Centre. During his Potsdam period Eisel also joined a geological expedition to Mongolia, contributing his skills as a simultaneous translator and as a truck driver. Later trips also took in India and Vietnam. The impact of unfamiliar visual impressions acquired on his overseas visits enabled him greatly to sharpen his eye for portraits and landscapes. In 1970 Eisel took a teaching post at the Dresden Fine Arts Academy, where he obtained a professorship in 1973. In 1975 he was appointed Rector in succession to Gerhard Kettner. That same year, as Academy Rector, he also became a member of the SED (ruling party) leadership group in Dresden. In 1979 he came up for re-election as Rector of the Academy, but he resisted all imprecations to stand for a further term, because of his rejection of plans decided by the party sponsored VBKD (League of Visual artists) and of the Higher Education Ministry requiring changes to the Academy's educational principals. In 1980 Fritz Eisel moved north, relocating to Langen Br√ºtz near Schwerin. The next few years were his most productive as an artist, with more landscapes, portraits and still life paintings. In 1983/84 he created the mosaic wall at the \\"House of Mining and Energy Workers\\" (subsequently renamed as the \\"Lausitz Hall\\") in Hoyerswerda. Between 1985 and 1994 he was also employed as a lecturer at the School of Applied Arts in Heiligendamm. Family connections Fritz Eisel and his wife Christa had two children and four grandchildren. Among them are their daughter, writer and journalist , and grandsons techno-musicians Paul Kalkbrenner and Fritz Kalkbrenner.

Design and development The six-cylinder Renault 6Q and the four-cylinder Renault 4P, both from the early 1930s, shared the same bore, stroke and pistons. The 6Q was built in both unsupercharged and supercharged forms. The centrifugal supercharger was added at the back of the engine, driven off the crankshaft via step-up gearing. It added to the weight and to the length but boosted the performance at altitude to a continuous power of at 2,500 rpm and .

A worker and native of the industrial Jiu Valley, he joined the Romanian Communist Party in 1945 and steadily rose through its ranks, entering the central committee a decade later. Subsequently, he became a close ally of Nicolae Ceau»ôescu, whose rise to power in 1965 he helped facilitate. A significant player in the early years of the latter's rule, he became steadily alarmed by the dictator's excesses and began plotting against him by the late 1970s. He was sent as ambassador to Turkey in 1980, and six years later, upon finishing his service at Ankara, was killed in a suspicious car accident. Biography Background and rise to prominence Born in Lupeni, he was, by profession, a mechanic and locksmith as well as an economist. While living in his native town from 1940 to 1945, he was a day laborer and then a mechanic on a series of construction sites. He attended the general economics faculty of the Bucharest Academy of Economic Studies, the »òtefan Gheorghiu Academy and the Moscow Higher Party School. He joined the banned Union of Communist Youth in 1940, and in September 1945 became a member of the now-legal Romanian Communist Party (PCR, later PMR), where he was initially active within the International Red Aid organization. From 1945 to 1946, he was an instructor and secretary at the Alba County party committee. From 1946 to 1949, while working at the party committee in Cri»ôcior, Hunedoara County, he worked on propaganda and agitation. From 1949 to 1951, by which time a communist regime had been established, he was responsible for organization at the Hunedoara Region party office. In 1951, he was secretary of the Arad Region party committee. From 1951 to 1952, he was organizational secretary for the party in Severin Region. From 1952 to 1956, he was first secretary of the Timi»ôoara Region party committee. In December 1955, he became a member of the PMR's central committee, sitting there until June 1980. From 1956 to 1965, he was a section chief at the central committee and adjunct to its head of organization, Nicolae Ceau»ôescu. Together with Ilie Verde»õ and Petre Lupu, he was involved in continuous party purges, and the three belonged to a group that helped ensure Ceau»ôescu's rise to power and its consolidation after the death of Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej.TismƒÉneanu (1995), p. 119 Certain individuals within this network, among them Patiline»õ and Verde»õ, but also Ion StƒÉnescu and Cornel Onescu, had been schooled in Moscow in the mid-1950s.TismƒÉneanu (1995), p. 49 In 1964, he and StƒÉnescu, working off a list of 160 Romanian communists close to the Soviet government, persuaded them to back away from their espionage activities, with StƒÉnescu handling 90 of the individuals and Patiline»õ the other 70. According to the former, the group not only ceased its collaborationist activities, but also disclosed some 40 other names of Moscow-affiliated figures. In late 1965 or early 1966, after assuming control, Ceau»ôescu tasked Patiline»õ, an expert on political files, to compile documents related to the involvement of Alexandru DrƒÉghici in Lucre»õiu PƒÉtrƒÉ»ôcanu's execution;TismƒÉneanu (2003), p. 196 this was part of a wider effort to sideline his rival DrƒÉghici. \\"Cum l-a salvat Maurer pe DrƒÉghici de la pu»ôcƒÉrie\\", Jurnalul Na»õional, 14 February 2004 Between 1965 and 1970, Patiline»õ was the central committee member in charge of the Securitate secret police and the Romanian Army. When students at the University of Bucharest demonstrated on Christmas Eve 1968, he and Mayor Dumitru Popa initially avoided using force, seeming to defuse the crisis but later taking measures against the ringleaders. Ceau»ôescu believed the protest should have been forcibly dispersed from the start, and sharply criticized his subordinates for their approach.Burakowski, pp. 408-09 Patiline»õ was a member of the defense council from April 1969 to December 1972. Following the late 1971 arrest of General Ion »òerb on charges of spying for the Soviet Union, Patiline»õ was removed from supervision of defense and security affairs.Robin Alison Remington, \\"Balkanization of the Military: Party, Army and Peoples‚Äô Militias in Southeastern Europe\\", in Balkanistica, vol. 5/1979, p. 32 He then held two ministerial posts within the government: Forest Economy and Construction Materials (January 1972 - December 1977) and Mines, Petroleum and Geology (December 1977 - December 1979). He may have been named to the latter position because Ceau»ôescu changed his mind about his handling of the Christmas Eve incident. His predecessor, Constantin BƒÉbƒÉlƒÉu, had shown himself unable to handle the Jiu Valley miners' strike of 1977, during which he was taken captive, and it is possible that Ceau»ôescu recalled Patiline»õ' superior ability in managing crises. By mid-1979, Ceau»ôescu, shaken by the defection of Ion Mihai Pacepa, was keeping close surveillance on numerous high-ranking figures, Patiline»õ included. Thus, the Securitate reported that he was having affairs with numerous women, which included sexual encounters in his ministerial office; that he enjoyed fine alcoholic drinks and expensive gifts; and that he trafficked bear pelts to Germany. Conspiratorial activity and death In the late 1970s, as Ceau»ôescu grew increasingly despotic, Patiline»õ was the most significant of several important figures who began considering ways to remove the leader, including through assassination. He began serving as Romania's ambassador to Turkey in June 1980.Dobre, p. 452 In 1984-1985, he reportedly held discussions with the Soviet ambassador to Turkey regarding the possibility of obtaining Soviet aid in mounting a coup to depose Ceau»ôescu.Siani-Davies, p. 169 According to testimony offered by military officer Nicolae Radu in 1995, a plot for Ceau»ôescu's arrest existed in autumn 1984, and Patiline»õ handled the procurement of arms for the conspirators, whose plan was foiled by an informer. It is believed that Patiline»õ was scheduled to play a vital role in any post-Ceau»ôescu government. In October 1986, after completing his ambassadorial mission, Patiline»õ was driving his car from Ankara to drop off his car at Istanbul. As he passed on the road through Kƒ±zƒ±lcƒ±korman village in Sakarya Province, he swerved suddenly and hit a truck head-on.\\"Romanian Ambassador Killed in Traffic Accident\\", Associated Press, October 9, 1986 The accident was considered suspicious;TismƒÉneanu (2004), p. 28 Gheorghe Apostol claimed that Securitate agents slipped a drug into his whisky glass prior to departure. Lavinia Betea, \\"Zvonurile 'epocii de aur'\\" , Jurnalul Na»õional, January 15, 2007 Nevertheless, no proof exists that the death constituted an assassination ordered from above. His house in the nomenklatura-populated PrimƒÉverii neighborhood, where he had dwelt since 1966, passed to Ion DincƒÉ. Paula Mihailov Chiciuc, \\"Ciocoii vechi »ôi noi\\" , Jurnalul Na»õional, February 20, 2006 Within the central committee, he was a member of the secretariat (July 1965 - November 1974), an alternate member of the executive committee (August 1969 - November 1974) and an alternate member of the political executive committee (November 1974 - November 1979). He was elected several successive legislatures of the Great National Assembly, representing Maramure»ô County from 1961 to 1969, Sibiu County from 1969 to 1975 and Bistri»õa-NƒÉsƒÉud County from 1975 to 1980. Within that body, he headed the defense committee from March 1969 to 1975. He received the Order of the Star of the Romanian People's Republic, third class, in 1964; and the Tudor Vladimirescu Order, second class, in 1966. His daughter Amalia, nicknamed Maia, died in the 1970s as the result of an abortion. According to Vladimir TismƒÉneanu, this took place at Bucharest's Elias Hospital,TismƒÉneanu (2012), pp. 100-01 where relatives of the party elite could obtain the procedure in spite of its being banned. However, the son of Paul Niculescu-Mizil, Serghei, has stated that the devotion of Maia's father to Ceau»ôescu prevented her from accessing Elias, and that her death resulted from a clandestine abortion. \\"Decretul lui Ceau»ôescu a ucis-o »ôi pe fata unui nomenclaturist\\", Evenimentul Zilei, November 22, 2007 When the ban was imposed in 1966 and Alexandru B√¢rlƒÉdeanu voiced his opposition, Patiline»õ had promptly accused him of having a mistress. \\"Din timpul lui Mini-Max\\" , Jurnalul Na»õional, February 13, 2005 Years later, B√¢rlƒÉdeanu described Maia's death as divine punishment for Patiline»õ' slavish devotion to Ceau»ôescu, including on the abortion issue. This sentiment reportedly began turning to hatred following the loss of his daughter. Emil Berdeli, \\"Sex, spionaj »ôi poli»õie politicƒÉ √Æn 'Epoca de aur' (II): Cabinetul ministerial, cuibu»ôorul de nebunii al complotistului\\", hosted by Reporter Virtual According to Pacepa, the event also played a role in his demotion to the minor position of Forestry Minister. Patiline»õ was in Cairo at the time of the abortion, and Nicolae and Elena Ceau»ôescu, enraged that a close aide would break a cherished law of theirs, ordered Pacepa to send a special airplane to bring him home. They immediately summoned and verbally abused him, with Elena being especially harsh. The grief-stricken Patiline»õ responded furiously, and was demoted after the funeral.Ratesh, p. 95-6 Notes References *Adam Burakowski (tr.

Early life and education Hart was born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The Hart family business of restaurant design and construction introduced young Bradley to the workings within wood and metal shops, where his interest in the creative process was kindled. At age 11, Hart was enrolled into Thornton Hall, a private art school where he took classical art training including the replication of Renaissance masters works for 20 hours a week.‚ÄúBradley Hart Interview.‚Äù HUNTED PROJECTS.Video: Bradley Hart Studio Visit, HUNTED PROJECTS In 2002, Hart received his B.A. from the University of Toronto, Canada, with a double major in Visual Art and Semiotic Communication Theory and a minor in Cinema Studies. Hart relocated to New York City in 2008, where he lives and works today.  Artistic Style  Hart works mainly with bubble wrap as his unique canvas and creative material. According to the artist, the idea of turning the commonly used packing plastic into art came from his encounter of overly protective museum security guards and a leftover roll of bubble from his first solo show in New York.Reuters, 2014. \\"The New Meaning of Pop Art (Video),\\" March 28.

This layer becomes the next series, titled Impression, which is a natural byproduct of the previous Injection work and yet constitutes an independent body of works on its own. Assemblages Hart recycles at every level of his studio practice. Dried paint from the mixing jars and studio surfaces, such as the floor, palette, the bubble wrap and the drop sheet, is collected and assembled to produce either the Created Waste or the Wasted Paint series. Intention distinguishes the two. For Creative Waste, the artist decisively spills the acrylic in a way that mimics the natural splatters from his previous series. Wasted Paint, on the other hand, is composed solely of accidental spills including those produced in the Created Waste process. Hart related during an interview that \\"[t]he created waste and the waste paint series are created through an emotional response to what I see much like an action painter but for me it is more sculptural than painterly,\\" and that different series provided him with different types of satisfaction.

Tsolakopoulos was born on 1 January 1868 in Nafplio. He enlisted in the Hellenic Army as a volunteer on 15 August 1886, and became an NCO. While a student at the NCO School, he participated in the Greco-Turkish War of 1897. On 9 August 1899 he graduated from the NCO School as an Infantry 2nd Lieutenant.

During the Balkan Wars of 1912‚Äì13 he fought as an officer in the 8th Infantry Regiment, and was wounded in the siege of Ioannina. He particularly distinguished himself during the Battle of Kilkis‚ÄìLachanas in the Second Balkan War. Serving as adjutant of the regimental commander, Col. Kambanis, he concealed the Colonel's death from the troops and took over command of the regiment until the end of the battle. In 1917‚Äì18 he served as commander of the 35th Infantry Regiment at the Strymon sector of the Macedonian front. In 1919 he participated with his regiment in the Allied intervention in the Ukraine, landing at Odessa. He retired in 1920 with the rank of Colonel, and engaged in politics in his home town of Nafplio. Upon his death in 1923, the Greek government promoted him to the rank of Major General.

It lies in the Austrian state of Tyrol. Originally the mountain was known locally as the Metzenarsch, but when in 1854 Marie Frederica of Prussia visited the hunting lodge on the Tegelberg and was having the surrounding peaks pointed out, they called it after In der Kelle, the name of a strip of land at the foot of the mountain, because its original name referred to a Matz, in other words a prostitute, and seemed inappropriate.Pit Schubert: Anekdoten vom Berg, Bergverlag Rother, 2011, pp. 70 f.  Surrounding area  The summit lies just over 2 kilometres as the crow flies northeast of Nesselw√§ngle and 7 kilometres west of Reutte. To the north is the valley of Raintal and, to the south, the start of the Tannheimer Tal. Nearby peaks are: to the south the Hahnenkamm (1,940 m), to the east the Gehrenspitze (2,163 m) and to the west the Gimpel (2,176 m) and the Rote Fl√ºh (2,111 m).  Geology  The Tannheim Mountains are part of the Northern Limestone Alps, whose folding began during the Alpide orogeny in the Lower Cretaceous about 140 million years ago and has not quite finished even today. In the wake of this mountain folding various nappes (Decken) of sedimentary rock (parts of the earth's crust broken off from the subsurface and pushed over one another) were stacked up and reach the surface as the Lechtal Nappe (Lechtaler Decke) in the area of the Kellenspitze. The summit and northern mountainside consist of Wetterstein limestone, whilst the southern flank comprises soft marl of the so-called Partnach beds .Raimund von Klebelsberg: Geologie von Tirol, Berlin, 1935, p. 416 The rock of the Kellenspitze is very crumbly in places and relatively unattractive to climbers as a result.  Bases and ascent  The normal route for the easiest ascent of the Kellenspitze runs up the northwestern mountainside from the col of Nesselw√§ngler Scharte. The base for this route is the Tannheimer Hut at 1,713 metres. From the hut the ascent heads steeply uphill to the north across the scree slopes of the Gimpelkar cirque to the col, then right and upwards requiring climbing at UIAA grade I and, in places II. There are also short sections of cable protection. According to the literature this approach takes a good 2 hours to reach the top. From the opposite side, a route runs from the Otto Mayr Hut in the north up to the same col, taking a good four hours to the top of the Kellenspitze.Dieter Seibert: Allg√§uer Alpen Alpin, Alpenvereinsf√ºhrer.

Built as part of the plan for post-war reconstruction, it was the first example of socialist classicism in the German Democratic Republic. Above the main doorway is a quotation from Bertolt Brecht:  History  The construction of a \\"high house\\" in the garden of Weberwiese was decided as part of the reconstruction plan of the district of Friedrichshain, devastated by the bombings of World War II. The overall design of the new complex was laid by Hans Scharoun, who also personally executed some buildings, taking up the style of the \\"new objectivity\\", typical of the 1920s and 1930s. This choice, however, was strongly criticized at the political level: the government of the newly formed GDR (East Germany) in fact preferred to direct the reconstruction following the principles of socialist classicism, typical of the Soviet Union of those years, advocating a return to \\"national traditions\\". Therefore, the draft of the \\"high house\\", written by Hermann Henselmann in the functionalist style, was completely redesigned, adopting a neoclassical style going back to Schinkel's buildings of the nineteenth century. Built from 1951 to 1952, the \\"high house\\" rose to the symbol of the reconstruction a symbol of reconstruction in the GDR, and came to be a model for similar interventions in Berlin and other cities of the Republic.

It stood on a low, circular mound surrounded by a 2 metre deep, 15 metre wide moat.  History  About 1224 Norman de Leslie received the lands of Caskieben and was doubtless the builder of the Anglo-Norman castle which superseded the old tower (NJ72SE 40). The castle of Caskieben that was enlarged after 1662 by the addition of a Renaissance mansion in front, and renamed Keith Hall, was, however, a fine example of the Z-plan castle, a style which probably originated in the district. Mither Tap has an astronomical alignment with Caskieben, the hill being due west. Dr. Arthur Johnston saidRobert Chambers, Thomas Thomson \\"A Biographical Dictionary of Eminent Scotsmen, Volume 2\\",\\"Arthur Johnston\\", published 1870 \\"the hill of Benochie, a conical elevation about eight miles distant, casts its shadow over Caskieben at the periods of the equinox.\\" This earlier wooden tower was superseded nearby by a 13th-century stone castle also named Caskieben at first, but later renamed Keith Hall. Nothing now remains of a structure, but the mound and moat are still visible.Andy Sweet \\"Caskieben (site of)\\", Caskieben, Retrieved on 13 March 2015 Keith Hall Keith Hall is situated on a sloping escarpment above the fertile valley of the River Urie just to the north of its junction with the River Don in the Aberdeenshire lowlands and is roughly east of Inverurie, and north-west of Aberdeen. The landscape at Keith Hall was designed in 1794 by Thomas White Sr. and includes informal parkland. Today, the grounds features late-19th- and early-20th-century ornamental trees and shrubs situated around a lake with a terraced walled garden. Keith Hall incorporates the original Caskieben Castle which was a Z-plan tower. Between 1696 to 1698, John Keith, 1st Earl of Kintore added wings and distinctive ogee capped towers to create a small mansion. Later, plans for alterations were prepared by William Adam but were not executed. In 1788, John Paterson made repairs to the structure for the 5th Earl of Kintore. Between 1806 and 1812, architect John Smith designed alterations for the residence for the 6th Earl of Kintore. The 8th Earl of Kintore commissioned David Bryce to create additional plans for alterations in 1851, however, the were likely not executed as William Ramage of Aberdeen was paid for work there in 1854. Between 1895 and 1914, further alterations and major additions were commissioned by the 9th Earl of Kintore. Drawings for some of this work were prepared by Sydney Mitchell and James Garve & Sons of Aberdeen. Between 1938 and 1941, the interior was refurbished for the 10th Earl of Kintore and his wife Helena, the American heiress who was the former wife of William Montagu, 9th Duke of Manchester. In 1984, the building was completely restored and divided into eight flats and six houses.

Real assets have an inherent physical worth.Some investment professionals have argued that intellectual property (such as royalties and patents) and insurance (life and annuities) should be included as real assets. Real assets differ from financial assets in that financial assets get their value from a contractual right and are typically intangible. Real assets are categorized into three categories: * Real Estate: REITs, commercial real estate, and residential * Natural Resources: Energy, Oil & gas, MLPs, timber, agriculture, solar, mining, and commodities *Infrastructure: Transportation (roads, airports, railroads), utilities, telecommunications infrastructure Real asset appealing to investors for four reasons: high current income, inflation protection / equity appreciation, low correlation to equity markets, and favorable tax treatment.For example, in the United States, REITs are treated as pass-through vehicles and not taxed at corporate level. In the case of exploration & development for oil and gas, there is accelerated depreciation.  Background  Investing in real assets has existed in since the advent of property ownership. However, public invested only began in 1965, when the first publicly traded REIT (Continental Mortgage Investors) became listed on the NYSE. This REIT structure has become the dominant legal structure to invest in real estate. The first publicly traded MLP occurred 16 years later, when Apache Petroleum Company listed. The MLP structure has become popular for energy and infrastructure. Combined, these two legal structures been critical to the expansion of real assets as a viable asset class because they are pass- through tax structures, unlike a traditional publicly traded C-corp. However, the trade-off is that at least 90% of the income must be distributed to investors (which is attractive for investors but means that the company has limited ability to retain earnings for growth). That being said, there are some real asset companies structured as C-corps. Moreover, after the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, some MLPs and REITs are revisiting their structure. Today, real assets are a massive publicly traded asset class. * There are 71 publicly traded MLPs representing almost $300B in equity * There are 219 publicly traded REITs representing over $1.3T in equity Additionally, there are multiple much smaller sectors that fall in real assets * Renewable energy is estimated to have a market size of slightly more than $1B * The timber REIT market (a subset of the overall REIT market) is slightly larger than $26B  Public Equity Investing in ETFs  Historically investors have gained exposure to this asset via investing in companies or specific strategy (such as REIT or MLP fund). However, in the past few years, several public funds have been started focused on the overall real asset market. The benefit to the individual investor for investing into a single real asset fund to get exposure into the asset class is immediate diversification at a low cost. The two major ETFs in the real asset space are: * Virtus Real Asset Income ETF (Ticker: VRAI)]: This is the dominant ETF in the asset class. VRAI is a diversified portfolio of income-producing real asset equity securities. VRAI does not invest in commodities because they do not generate income. * SPDR SSGA Multi-Asset Real Return ETF (Ticker: RLY): This is an ETF of ETFs, This ETF includes commodities, gold, and traditional fixed income (TIPS). For investors interested in comparing these two ETFs, Indxx did a write-up in October 2019 (https://www.indxx.com/assets/media/press/Real_Asset_ETF_Bake_Off.pdf). On the mutual fund side, real asset funds include Nuveen Real Asset Income Fund, T Rowe Price Real Assets Fund, and DWS REEF Real Assets Fund. In additional several of the largest investment firms have launched private real asset investment strategies for institutional investors. This includes Carlyle, KKR, and Oaktree.

The foundation has raised over $1 million, largely from viral fundraising through universities and video campaigns. The organization also participates in exploratory research initiatives aimed at understanding and advancing towards a cure. Emily's Entourage is named after Emily Kramer-Golinkoff, a 34-year-old woman with CF, who has been the focus of an increased trend of patients participating deeply into research on and advocacy for their own conditions. She was honored at the White House as a Champion of Change for \\"harnessing data to take account individual differences in people‚Äôs genes, environments, and lifestyles into account to improve patients‚Äô health.\\" Personal background Kramer-Golinkoff was born on January 9, 1985. At six weeks old, she was diagnosed with CF. At a young age, her mother, Liza, would pound on her chest for 45 minutes to loosen the mucus in her lungs.\\" Today, her lungs function at about one third of the normal lung function. Emily undergoes a daily regimen of three-to-four hours of \\"airway clearance and breathing treatments\\" in addition to taking approximately 30 pills and four shots of insulin. Kramer-Golinkoff has a rare form of CF with a high prevalence among Ashkenazi Jews. Emily's mutation belongs to a larger category called nonsense mutations, which affect approximately 10% of CF cases worldwide and account for up to 30% genetic diseases more broadly. She graduated in 2003 from Lower Merion High School in Ardmore, Pennsylvania. She graduated cum laude from the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg School for Communication and then completed her master's degree in bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine in 2009. Emily's Entourage Emily's Entourage was founded by Emily, her friends, and her family in December 2011 when Emily and her family sent a video to their friends and family and it raised over $40,000 in one week. College campuses around the country have joined the movement by forming official clubs on campus and throwing annual fundraising benefits. Local groups, such as Lower Merion School District often volunteer with Emily's Entourage. By May 2015, Emily's Entourage had raised over $1 million.

She works on painting, sculpture, graphic design and installations. She learned the rudiments of art in Liceo di Brera, in Milan. After studying graphic design in San Sebastian, she graduated in fine arts at the University of Salamanca. Esperanza Zabala has taken part in many individual and collective exhibitions.  Painting  Esperanza Zabala's paintings can be considered neo-expressionists. Her style could be considered close to Jose Luis Zumeta's, German expressionists', CoBrA's or Basquiat's. Her paints, which at a first glance seem to be semiabstract, hide figurative images. She uses deep and powerful colours, and mixes oil, acrylic and other medias in her works. Sometimes, she uses embroidered bed sheets instead of regular canvas.  Sculpture  Her sculpture covers topics such as feminism, body, sex, religion, death and fashion. She has taken three main lines. On the one hand, works based on objects, toys, religious images or everyday items. Through this work invites the social analysis, criticism and reflection of quotidian -fashion, consumerism, etc.. Another line is formed by her polyurethane foam sculptures, following the technique she learned from Enrique Marty. Composed by sculptures of people in real size -some of them fragmented- and anthropomorphic pieces of organic textures. These sculptures cover topics such as the process of construction- deconstruction of the body, defragmented body, skin, etc. Some of these works can be related to those by Damien Hirst or Gunther von Hagens. From 2014 she begins to combine sculpture with Wi-Fi technologies and streaming. Through these conceptual works, in addition to treat the network as an artwork, she calls for reflection on the consciousness of the body.  Other disciplines  Among the works of Esperanza Zabala can be found a series of installations and performances of action painting in which she uses her own body as a tool. In those works she prints on paper her body previously smeared with red paint, following lines of work such as Ana Mendieta and Yves Klein. In addition, the artist has also made artist's books and serigraphs.

Zinghmuh is a prominent mountain that ranges from Chunchung village in Hakha Township and Ramthlo village to Falam Township . The highest peak of the range located directly above Ramthlo village in Falam Township is recorded as 8414 feet (2565m) above sea level making it the third highest peak in Chin State, Myanmar after Mt.Khonumthung (10,016 ft) also known as Nat Ma Taung or Mt. Victoria and Mt.Kennedy (8868 ft).  Location  Mt. Zinghmuh lies exactly halfway between the city of Falam and Hakha. It is 22 miles away from both cities. At the foot of this great mountain, there is a village called Ramthlo where many hikers used as base. View of Zinghmuh mountain range  Name  Legend has it that a man named Ram To and his wife first settled in the region circa. AD 1500. Ram To and his wife had migrated to the region from Burma, started building families and community in a place called Faifa. One day, a major landslide killed the whole community except Za Sum and his sister. They were devastated by the loss of their parent and the whole community. When they woke up the next morning, the first thing they see was the beautiful mountain of Zinghmuh which gave them hope and inspiration to live on. When they wake up in the morning, the first thing they see was this mountain. Thus, the mountain is named Zing Hmuh. Zing in a local dialect means MORNING and Hmuh means SEE. It can be translated as the mountain that can be seen every morning. It is also said that the meaning of Zinghmuh is that \\"a place where we see the gods\\". Circa. AD1450, the people of Ramthlo settled in a place called ‚ÄúFaifa‚Äù. While the men were hunting and resting near a lake called ‚ÄúLai‚Äù, they saw a big woman like human on top of the mountain. The next morning they prepared to go home and they took sugarcane from the lake for their children. They started their journey towards home, however, they could not reach home and came to the lake again and again. They believed that the gods from the mountain did not like them taking the sugarcane, therefore, they returned all of their sugarcane where they took it. After this, they all manage to go home. That night a villager had a dream. In his dream the god from mountain came to him and said ‚ÄúMy father‚Äôs name is Tluang Hnin. My mother‚Äôs name is Rai Sia‚Äù. The next day the Ramthlo villagers discussed about what they saw on the mountain and the dream and came to a conclusion that gods were dwelling on top of that mountain. Also, during the era of Pu Za Sum, the Ramthlo villager named Pu Lian Kar lost his beloved wife. He was stricken by grief and went to the top of this mountain hoping to contact with the spirit of his wife. When he got to the mountain he saw a large man like human and asked him ‚ÄúWhat are you doing here Lian Kar .. Please go back to the village‚Äù. Pu Lian Kar was so afraid and went back to the village and told the Ramthlo villagers. Pu Lian Kar experienced had reinforced the belief that gods were dwelling on the mountain. Therefore, the Ramthlo villagers named the mountain as ‚ÄúZing Hmuh‚Äù. The god is locally called as ‚ÄúKhaw Zing‚Äù and the meaning of the mountain is that a place we see the gods or the abode of the gods. Since then, the mountain has been known as Mt. Zing Hmuh.  Ancient Cult and Rituals  Mt. Zinghmuh was once the Chin people's favourite place for cults and worshipping gods/ spirits. It was also a highway for the souls of the dead people on their way to the dead village, locally known as Mithi Khua. Before Christianity came to Chin Hills, the Chin people believed that the souls of the dead went to a place called the city of dead i.e. Mithi Khua. It was believed that the souls of the dead had to pass along the imaginary street of Zinghmun mountain range. It was an imaginary street for living people because mortal people could not see it. Zinghmun Range taken from the ridge Mt. Zinghmuh also served as the abodes of the gods known as Zinghmuh, Lur, Hmar and Mehrol. Rituals was practiced to secure good cultivations, rain etc.... Rituals include the offering of 1 Mithun every three years and 1 Pig every year.  Dar Luan and Lal Ruang Folklore  The folklore related with this sacred mountain being a highway for the souls of the dead on their way to Mikhi Khua is known as Dar Luan and Lal Ruang. This folklore is being passed from generation to generation. There was once a powerful village chief near Mt. Zinghmuh. He had a beautiful teenage daughter called Dar Luan. His wife was pregnant at that time and he hope that a son would be born to him to inherit his wealth and status. One day, his beloved daughter suddenly fell ill and died. He was stricken with grief so much so that he could not even eat. He knew that her soul would pass along the ridge of the Mt. Zinghmuh after ten days of her actual death. It was the belief of Chin people that the soul of a dead person stays on earth for ten days and then after that goes to Mithi Khua. On the night of the 10th day, he went to Mt. Zinghmuh and hid himself in a place where he considered to be the most likely places traversed by Dead Soul's Highway. He also placed some ashes on the path so that he could see the foot print of her daughter. Some hours after nightfall, he heard the sound of khingte i.e. the string of tiny ornamental brass bells worn by Chin girls around their hip and ankles, coming toward him from one direction. He quickly recognized that it was the ringing of his daughter's khingte as he always heard them when she used to walk briskly when she was alive. The sounds came nearer and nearer to him but he could not see his daughter, nor could he see anything. When the sound reached the spot on the pass where he had spread a layer of ash, he saw a footprint which he quickly recognized as the footmarks of his daughter. Just before the ringing of khingte disappeared, he sprang from his hiding place and gripped the empty air. But instead of catching his daughter, he had caught a huge and fearsome caterpillar, the size of a human. Being in his arms, and the big caterpillar was struggling to free itself from his grip. But knowing that it was his daughter he refused to let go his grip, but held it still firmer. A moment later, the caterpillar turned itself into a huge serpent. Though, the serpent tried to free itself from his grip while at the same time trying to strangle him the man continued to tighten his grip. At last, realizing that there was no use in continuing the struggle, the serpent turned itself into his daughter Dar Luan. ‚ÄúMy dearest Dar Luan, I have caught you. You must come back to me‚Äù said the man. ‚ÄúDaddy, that is impossible. You know that I have died. And the only thing left for me is to go to Mithi Khua‚Äù Dar Luan replied. \\"My dearest daughter, either you must come back to me and your mother, or I will die here myself and follow you to Mithi Khua‚Äù replied the man. ‚ÄúDaddy, I will tell you what we must do. Since, I have died it is absolutely impossible for me to return to you and my mother. But I will tell you of one thing that will make you very happy. In a few days my mother will give birth to a son whom you shall name Lal Ruang. This Lal Ruang will grow up to be a great warrior, a great hunter, and a great ruler, and his fame will spread to all the corners of Chinland. His worth to you will be greater than thirty big villages. Rejoice that you will be the father of such a great son. As for me, I must go on and proceed to Mithi Khua. Since living persons and dead persons cannot live together again, there is nothing that we can do, but part company‚Äù said Dar Luan. ‚ÄúMy beloved daughter, I would rather have you back than all the riches on earth. But since you say that it is impossible, so be it‚Äù said the man. He then reluctantly released his grip. His daughter vanished before his eyes. He could now see her footmarks going away from him while at the same time hearing the ringing of her khingte. Her footprints went further and further away until he could see them no more. The ringing of her khingte also went farther and further away until he could hear them no more. Broken hearted, the man returned home. On the very night he reached his house, his wife gave birth to a son. Following the last instructions of their departed, they named him Lal Ruang. Lal Ruang became a great ruler.  White Cross  Now, the religion of Chin State is predominately Christian and Cross became an important symbol for the region. A white cross now stands at its peak erected by the people of Falam and Ramthlo. Christians hold prayer services annually on and near the mountain. The peakof Mt. Zinghmuh  Survey  The elevation of 8,414 ft (2564.5m) was first determined by the British surveyors after the colonization of Chin Hills in 1890. During the survey, mules were used to transport supplies and materials to mark the elevation.  Route Description   Ascending  It can be ascended directly from Ramthlo village to the peak of the Mt. Zinghmuh. There is only one path leading to its peak which is clearly visible. The path is mainly used by hunters and locals to find woods, flowers and forest products. A steady climb until the ridge of the Mr.Zinghmuh. Just before hitting the ridge, there is a short section of cliff which is quite difficult to overcome as the cliff can be slippery. From the ridge, Hualngo Hills, Zahau Hills, Hakha District and nearby villages such as Ramthlo, Tlangzar, Dokthek can be seen. The wind can be so strong at the ridge which is 8000 ft above sea level. After the ridge, the peak of Zinghmuh with a white Cross can be seen. Along with the cross, a path is clearly visible from a distance. The distance is approximately 1.5miles from Ramthlo village to its peak. With a decent pace, it could take 2‚Äì3 hours.  Descending  Some people returned to the village following the ascended route. Many people continued to walk past the peak towards Laiva Dam and come to the village of Tlangzar. The distance is approximately 4‚Äì5 miles.  Memorials Stones  Mt. Zinghmuh is one of the best places in the northern Chin State to see landscapes and plant species. It was a chance to enjoy the most memorable 360-degree views of Chin Hills. Many people regard the visiting the Mt. Zinghmuh as once in a lifetime opportunity, thus they want to mark their footprint on the hills. There are many small memorial stones across the mountain ranges. Memorial stones near the White cross  Flora  Zinghmuh mountain is relative rich in flora and fauna. The mountain is home to a beautiful Rhododendron, locally known as Sokhlei and known by the Burmese as Taungzalat. The species found on Zinghmuh mountain is known as R.Forrestii. The white rhododendron can also be found near the peak. A light blue colour shape like a ball, locally known as Bingbi flower, flooded the hills around April and May time. There are also many type of orchids in the mountain which the local sell it to Burma. The most famous plant on the mountain is Bergenia ligulata, known by the Burmese as Natsay Gamone (·Äî·Äê·Äπ·Ä±·ÄÜ·Ä∏·ÄÇ·Äô·ÄØ·Äî·Äπ·Ä∏). Trading this Bergenia ligulata has been the main source of income for many locals. Bingbi Flower found on Zinghmuh Mountain Range  Sanctuary Plan  The plan for sanctuary on Zinghmuh mountain areas is yet to be implemented by the Myanmar central government. Proposal had been made, however, the plan was objected by nearby villages. As it stands, the plan for sanctuary is yet to be resolved.  Record  The first person to ascend to the peak of Mt.Zinghmuh with a Dream Honda 125 motor bike is Salai Bawi Bawi Vanbawilian from Falam. He ascended with his 125CC motorbike on 20 October 2013.

He created the first transfusion service in the world in Barcelona in 1936 at the beginning of the Spanish Civil War. Previously there were blood banks, where donated blood to be transfused was stored. Dr. Duran i Jord√† created a methodology that would serve to collect massive blood donations and be transfused distance, in this case the front lines of the Spanish Civil War. This method was subsequently applied in World War II.  Personal life  Duran was born in the Barcelona district of Barceloneta, April 25, 1905, within a middle-class family originally from Martorell. His father was a merchant with concerns about the culture and sport worried that the youngest of five children, Frederic, had an education. He had originally planned an elementary education, but the child's ability impressed his teachers who persuaded his father to allow him first attend high school and then go to college. There were discrepancies between father and son regarding the final choice, Frederic was attracted by the chemical but eventually the paternal pragmatism prevailed and enrolled in medicine in 1922. He received his degree at age 23 in June 1928. During his degree, his interest of chemistry led him to laboratory tests, and while he was an intern at the Department of Surgical Pathology Dr. Antoni Trias Pujol in the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona and began working in that area. He began in the Clinical Analysis of Gastroenterology and later became supernumerary optional clinical analysis of the City of Barcelona and directing laboratory analysis of the Instituto Frenop√°tico Corts, a position he held until the end of the Civil War. In February 1939, at the end of the Spanish Civil War, Duran i Jord√† had to leave in exile. He was lured to London, UK by the British Red Cross (invitation to which very few people have access, and necessary migrate to the country) and like Josep Trueta became part of a numerically small but qualitatively enormous 'Catalan diaspora' in Great Britain. The British Red Cross, through Janet Vaughan, knows Duran's work and in the imminence of the 2nd World War they were willing to create a service like the one he organized in Barcelona. Then, he moved to Manchester where he worked as a Laboratory Technician at Ancoats Hospital while sorting the bureaucracy to enter the Medical Register. Once that was sorted, he devoted to pathology and became the director of the department of pathology at Booths Hall Children's Hospital, Manchester and the Monsall Hospital. He died of leukemia on March 30, 1957 at the Manchester Royal Infirmary, at 51 years of age.  Career   Precedents  To understand the importance of the work of Duran i Jord√† is necessary to place it in its historical context. The discovery of main blood groups by Karl Landsteiner (not yet the Rhesus factor) in the early twentieth century, began the scientific period of transfusion therapy, hitherto surrounded by a halo of superstition and fraud. To do it is obvious the need for human blood: the first solution is to perform the transfusion of donor arm to arm the receiver. In the early 1920s, was established in London, which subsequently Transfusion Service Blood Red Cross in Greater London would be called: a group of people who have been subjected to a physical examination, were has determined his blood group and have ruled out syphilis. Will be called when a hospital transfusion needed: the first year just received 13 petitions, but in the decade of the 30 attending more than 3 000 calls annually. And always in an absolutely altruistic. At the same time he start working on a method to thin the blood and to allow transfusion: a Belgian researcher Albert Hustin published in April 1914 a method using sodium citrate; November 15 of the same year Dr. Luis Agote performed in Buenos Aires the first transfusion with blood anticoagulated with citrate. Later Richard Lewisohn of Mount Sinai Hospital in New York in 1915 established the proportion of better tolerated by the receiver citrate 0.2%. Despite being known citrate anticoagulation, its use is not widespread and during World War II, at most, a few hundred transfusions and always in an \\"almost\\" directly were performed: citrate donor blood was extracted and immediately transfused to the recipient. Early attempts to preserve blood for transfusion were made in Russia. The doctor Sergei Yudin first used in 1930 in Moscow Sklifosovsky Institute, a specialized emergency hospital, blood transfusion corpse coming to create a small reservoir with citrated blood kept at 4¬∞C. By 1938 he had injected blood from this source 2 500 people, of which seven died and 125 experienced mild reactions such as fever and chills. In 1937 Dr. Bernard Fantus, a doctor at Cook County Hospital in Chicago, created a service to collect blood donations in a glass jar and store citrate cold after analysis. He called Blood Conservation Laboratory, but due to its operation of depositing and removing, soon received a name quickly became popular: Blood Bank. But five months earlier had already been created in Barcelona the first transfusion service designed to collect blood, keeping and carrying to be transfused distance and that was the work of Frederic Duran i Jord√†.  The Barcelona Transfusion Service  At that time in Barcelona were made primarily direct transfusion arm in arm with syringe Jub√©. Dr. Ricardo Moragas published in 1935 had been made in the Blood Transfusion Service of the Hospital de Sant Pau in Barcelona, 128 transfusions all directly from family 83 times in 29 donors hospital and 16 donors 'professionals'. Direct transfusions sometimes required the surgical exposure of the arm vein which hindered further donations / transfusions. At that time only Gr√≠fols Dr. Jos√© Antonio Roig performed indirect citrated blood transfusions in transfusora fl√©bula that he designed. A glass vessel where the donor's blood was collected in citrate and subsequently infusing the receiver by injecting air into the glass container. Was technically complicated realization and use an outward storage circuitry does not allow more than a few hours due to the risk of bacterial contamination. When the Civil War broke Dr Duran joins Hospital 18 located on the mountain of Montju√Øc to collaborate in the care of the wounded who filled every hospital in the city. There it was observed that sometimes the amount of blood that had to be transfused was greater than could be provided by direct donor transfusion. Also receives a letter from his two companions Wenceslao Dutrem and Serafina Palma, featured on the Aragon front, where bemoan about the lack of blood for the wounded. This letter make him to decide to leave the hospital and with the support of the Medical Service Republican Army to create a service able to provide the necessary blood for transfusion of both military and civilian casualties. The Transfusion Service was initially located in premises of the Hospital 18 de Montju√Øc and a group of collaborators was incorporated, some of which were essential in the development, starting almost from 0, having to develop the special technology and methodology for the new service like Alfred Benlloch Llorach and Enric Margarit Aleu. Feverish activity begins in early August that makes the first batch of seven litres of blood and sent to hospitals on the Aragon front in mid-September. Subsequently, in order to meet the growing demand and facilitate access by donors to the extractions, the Transfusion Service moved to the center of the city, Calle Mallorca 216, between Balmes i Enrique Granados on February 5, 1938. The service was visited by numerous foreign medical specialist, among them Dr Norman Bethune after his arrival to Spain in November 1936. Dr Bethune develop a similar service in Madrid afterwards. Dr. Duran also presented the innovations of to many foreign countries, including Czechoslovakia and Britain, including a film in English for that purpose.  The Duran Method  In the first visit of potential donor, a name, address and medical history was recorded. If there were no grounds for exclusion, extraction where the blood group was determined and the test was performed Wasserman-Bordet was performed for syphilis. If all tests were correct it was reported the following week for extraction. Initially only blood group O was mined, would go into combat and blood group A was reserved for the city hospitals, where transfundir√≠a prior determination of the blood group of the recipient. The extractions were done fasting, with an interval of three weeks to a month. The amount of blood collected was between 300 and 400 ml, which was mixed with a 10% citrate solution 4%. With the donor lying on a stretcher, venipuncture area (usually the elbow) was cleaned with iodine and alcohol and delimited with sterile drapes. Extraction was performed via a needle in a Duran modified Erlenmeyer flasks 500 mL continuously agitated to promote mixing of blood and anticoagulant, with the help of a vacuum system. Subsequently, the sterility of the blood contained in the flask was checked by withdrawing a sample was seeded on agar tubes and the supernatant is used to recheck the blood group of the flask. However, errors in blood grouping because, among other things, the quality of the reagents were prepared in the same service, it is advised to perform before transfusion biological test Ochlecker: inject 5-10 ml blood, wait 10‚Äì15 minutes and continue transfusion if there had been no symptoms. If extraction is believed to be correct, the blood of six donors from the same group was mixed in an Erlenmeyer flask of two litres, by passing it through a filter consisting of silk fabric with a pore size of about 250 microns. This is managed to remove clots and aggregates which might have formed during bleeding. Initially the blood, once mixed, was placed in glass jars shaped ball 300 ml with a rubber stopper through which passed a glass tube. When it was time to use, blood was flowing injecting air into the vial through the rubber stopper with a pear. Thanks to the collaboration of Dr. Cullell of Pujol-Cullell Laboratorios this method was later replaced by a sterile closed glass vessel under pressure with an arc. Tubes were called Rapide, a patent that Dr. Cullell had bought a Madrid engineer. The Rapide system allowed without any transfusor apparatus and only with the needle and filter connected carrying bottles, transfusion be held even in the firing line. Blood bottles were stored at 2 ¬∞C up to 15 days before use is checked that there is a clear interface between the red cell and plasma package and it maintained its yellowing. Bottles with hemolytic supernatant were discarded. If the appearance of the bottle was right, it was heated in a water bath prior to administration to the patient. Dr. Jos√© Vives Ma√±√©, after making over 130 transfusions with Duran method concludes: \\"Duran method has the advantage of being quick and easy method. The results we have obtained oblige us to be his strongest supporters, because we are convinced that the opposite is irreplaceable \\". A four-ton truck Diamon two generators Mr. Vidal, who was engaged to transport fish from the north, suitably conditioned allowed in late August 1936 for the first time in history transport blood transfusion at a distance of about 300 km. Weekly shipments were made to the front, and trying to keep a stock of 35 litres of blood in each hospital. During the 30 months worked, the Transfusion Service Barcelona recorded about 28,900 donors, performed more than 20 000 donations, and processed and prepared for transfusion 9 000 litres of blood. Later Frederic Duran i Jord√† fled to Britain in 1938, and worked with Dr Janet Vaughan at the Royal Postgraduate Medical School at Hammersmith Hospital to create a system of national blood banks in London. With the outbreak of war looking imminent in 1938, the War Office created the Army Blood Supply Depot (ABSD) in Bristol headed by Lionel Whitby and in control of four large blood depots around the country. British policy through the war was to supply military personnel with blood from centralized depots, in contrast to the approach taken by the Americans and Germans where troops at the front were bled to provide required blood. The British method proved to be more successful at adequately meeting all requirements and over 700 000 donors were bled over the course of the war. This system evolved into the National Blood Transfusion Service established in 1946, the first national service to be implemented.  Contributions  Contributions to medicine doctor Duran i Jord√†, pioneer of modern blood transfusion service, are admirable; more so if one takes into consideration the circumstances and limitations of the moment. * The best way to treat the blood was not take from hospital to hospital, but to create a large and stable organization to provide such service. Currently is still committed to centralization. * He quickly saw that investigations currently betting on blood drawn from corpses, were misguided. It was essential to use living donors. Today volunteer donors. * Promotion of blood donation. The call for donor appeals made through radio, concerts, etc. * Duran determined that blood collection should be fasting. Today is not the case: we must have done digestion. * It also found that among mining and extraction, should spend a period of three weeks currently have to wait 60 days. If you're a woman you can donate 3 times a year and if you are male, 4. * Filtration of blood, always in closed systems under vacuum to avoid contamination. As today, but more advanced techniques. * Ignoring for the moment the existence of the Rh groups, the doctor had the brilliant idea of mixing the blood of six donors from the same group to minimize the risks. At present, each patient receives the same blood type. * Keep cold blood, at a temperature of between 2 and 4 degrees. Still remains so. * Dur√°n-Jord√† ended the transfusion arm to arm and fostered the current autoinjectable. * Perfected glass container was used to store the blood. Used transparent and neutral glass with two compartments, one at the bottom, with a capacity of 400 cm2 containing blood and other, at the top, ultra filtered air carrying two atmospheres pressure. Nowadays plastic bags, sterilized totally, which serves to store the blood components are used. * Hinted utility transfusion of blood fractions (plasma, platelets ...) * The first mobile unit to transport blood was enabled world, a refrigerated truck of a fish dealer. Now, the mobile unit is equipped with trays of butanediol to control the temperature of blood donations.  Corollary  Frederic Duran i Jord√† was a pioneer in the field of hemotherapy since it first created in history a transfusion service in the modern sense. He carried out thanks to its analytical and practical thinking and known for its ability to surround a team that made it possible to create, from almost nothing, the necessary technology. The technology over the years has become obsolete, but the principles and theoretical foundations on which it introduced, such as ensuring the absence of bacterial contamination of blood units continue in full force.

Elisabeth Rohde studied classical archaeology, ancient history and art history at Berlin University, where she graduated in 1945, with a dissertation entitled Theseusdarstellungen in der griechischen Vasenmalerei von den Anf√§ngen bis zum vierten Jahrhundert (Depictions of Theseus in Greek vase painting from the Beginning until the Fourth Century). From the beginning of her academic career, her work was connected with the Antikensammlung Berlin. Rohde initially worked with Carl Bl√ºmel and after 1945 worked as a labourer packing up the artworks of the Pergamonmuseum for transport to the Soviet Union. In 1955 she rearranged the Hellenistic architecture gallery, filling the gap left by statuary taken to Moscow by laying out the Hephaistion mosaic in their place. Two years later, she took part in the re-erection of the Pergamon altar after the Soviet Union returned most of the museum's art to the DDR. With Bl√ºmel, she rearranged the presentation of the altar in line with the latest scholary consensus. After Bl√ºmel went into retirement in 1961, Rohde became the acting Director of the collection. She was inconvenienced by the construction of the Berlin Wall, since she lived in Berlin-Charlottenburg in the west part of the city. Since she knew that a similar career was not open to her in West Germany at that time, she remained at the Antikensammlung and commuted daily between West and East Berlin. In 1971, Rohde was finally appointed full Director. She never allowed herself to be controlled by the DDR politically; her research remained free of DDR-speak and she was even able to close the Antikensammlung to their indoctrination. Furthermore, she maintained contact with her colleagues in the western part of the city. At her retirement in 1982 she received a special permanent visa for the DDR. Her successor was Max Kunze. Rohde focused on the Pergamon altar, its historical and art historical significance, worked on the friezes and the Greek vases of the Berlin Antikensammlung and the Schlossmuseum Gotha.

The station was originally built and operated by the C√≥rdoba Central Railway and then added to Ferrocarril Mitre network. It is currently operated by two companies: State-owned Trenes Argentinos (for passenger services) and private Nuevo Central Argentino (NCA) that runs freight trains on the line. History Station's restaurant hall. Ticket offices. In 1863, the government of Argentina granted British-owned company Central Argentine Railway, led by engineer William Wheelwright, a concession to build and exploit a railway line between the cities of Rosario (a major port in southern Santa Fe, on the Paran√° River) and C√≥rdoba (a large city near the geographical center of Argentina, and the capital of the province of the same name). The grant included a clause to populate the lands along and around the railway that were given to the company by the national state. The construction works started in April 1863 with the establishment of the terminus in Rosario, at Rosario Central Station. The line, a broad gauge railway, reached Villa Mar√≠a, C√≥rdoba, in September 1867 and the works ceased. Minister Rawson expressed dissatisfaction at the paralysis of the works while passengers also protested against poor conditions of the service. The works for the Rosario Central station and other intermediate stations had not begun. The company alleged that they could not continue the extension of the line until the pending lands were given. In September 1867 the Government authorized a new disbursement of funds for $1,500,000 to conclude the pending works. Finally in March 1870 the railway reached the city of C√≥rdoba and it was officially inaugurated by then President of Argentina Domingo Sarmiento on April 13. The CAR was the longest railway system at that time and the first to join two provinces. In 1948, British and French-owned railways in Argentina were nationalised by the Juan Per√≥n's administration. The Central Argentine Railway line was added to Mitre Railway network, being subsequently operated by State-owned company Ferrocarriles Argentinos that ran services to C√≥rdoba station. When the entire Argentine railway network was privatised in the early 1990s by the Carlos Menem's presidency, passenger services to C√≥rdoba were closed. Nevertheless, the station continued to be operated by private company Nuevo Central Argentino (NCA) that had been granted concession to operate freight services on the line. The station building (constructed in neoclassical architecture style and in perfect state of preservation) was declared Historic Heritage of C√≥rdoba in 1995. Passenger trains were reactivated by private company Ferrocentral, that reestablished services from C√≥rdoba to Villa Mar√≠a (in August 2004) and from Retiro (Buenos Aires) to C√≥rdoba in April 2005. In November 2014, the Government of Argentina (through the State-owned company Trenes Argentinos S.A.) took over the services to Rosario (norte), Tucum√°n and C√≥rdoba, leaving Ferrocentral inactive.

First released for Microsoft Windows on 4 July 2014, it is a realistic interpretation of pool and snooker, and is the sequel to Cue Club. The game has received continual updates since launch, including an online multiplayer mode, the addition of a first-person camera with 3-dimensional (3D) tables and bars, and a wide selection of larger table sizes. Gameplay Breaking in 8-ball pool, 2D view Cue Club 2 can be played in either top-down view (2D mode) or a first-person view (3D mode). Game control options include mouse input, keyboard, game-pad or a touchscreen device. Several game rules are available including eight-ball (including both US and European rules), nine- ball, ten-ball, six-ball, seven-ball, snooker, speed pool, and killer. The rules of eight-ball, ten-ball and killer can be customised to reflect many different variants. There are three variations of snooker: a full game with fifteen reds, and shorter games with either ten or six reds. Players choose from a selection of game modes such as Practice, Single Player Quick Game, Two Player, Three Player, Four Player, Tournament, Bar Challenge and Multiplayer mode. The game is set in a fictional club featuring a range of themed bars and theatre venues, and each is host to a selection of unique opponents of varying difficulty. Upon starting the game the player is required to log in by entering their name, after which they are given a membership card to access the first bar. There are two main parts to the game. The first is to complete the Bar Challenge, where the player chooses the game rules in each match and aims to progress through the stages by beating computer-controlled opponents one by one. There are fifteen characters in total, complete with imagery, and dressed in casual clothing. After defeating all the opponents in a bar, the player is awarded a membership card to the next bar where the difficulty level increases. When all the bars have been unlocked and the opponents defeated, the player is presented with the Bar Challenge Trophy. 3D Snooker mode in Penthouse Bar The second part to Cue Club 2 is the Tournament mode. Sixteen players compete in a tournament, and for this game mode opponents are dressed in formal competition attire. Progress is initially easy, but gets harder as weaker players are eliminated and more skilful opponents are encountered. There are four rounds in total (first round, quarter-final, semi-final and final), and the number of frames played can be set anywhere from Best of 3 up to Best of 35. Since matches can potentially take a long time to complete, games can be saved at any point to resume later using one of the numerous save-game slots. If the player succeeds in winning a tournament they are awarded a Tournament trophy. There is one trophy for each of the ten game modes available. Other accolades and awards can be gained for accomplishing things such as high snooker breaks and racking up fast times in speed pool. There are twenty total trophies to collect. The game is completed when all opponents have been defeated in Bar Challenge mode and all ten tournaments have been won. Upon successful completion of the Bar Challenge, which is arguably the largest and most challenging aspect of the game, a victory sequence is played. New features Cue Club 2 expands on the original game with new artwork, additional characters, table designs, cues and ball sets. Both the size and design of the cues and balls can be modified. The table cloth, pockets and rails can also be customized, along with the speed of the table cloth. The method of cueing may also be adjusted. Additionally, players are able to choose from a selection of colored chalk. The developers state that the physics engine has been overhauled and the A.I. of the computer opponents significantly improved. Two new bonus games have been added, including a revised Slam mode, where balls can be swung round on a length of cord, and a Detonator mode where the balls explode on impact (this mode was formerly a \\"cheat\\" option in the original Cue Club). Players can save shots and replay them at a variety of speeds, and also save and replay their highest snooker breaks and speed pool times. Matches can also be saved mid-game and resumed later, allowing for tournaments and longer games to be completed in multiple sittings. A selection of nine new soundtracks were composed for the title, serving as background music to complement game play. In an attempt to stay true to its roots the developers retained recognizable styling elements from the first game, but made several important technical improvements to enable support for widescreen, ultra widescreen, and touchscreen monitors, in addition to 1080p High Definition graphics and 4K displays. The software is capable of supporting multiple resolutions depending on the user's current desktop settings, and adaptive scaling ensures that there is no stretching or image distortion, irrespective of the aspect ratio. Full screen anti-aliasing is also supported, as well as multiple refresh rates ranging from 60 Hz up to 240 Hz. Online multiplayer In September 2016, the developers added an online multiplayer feature (in addition to the standard offline modes), allowing players to compete over the Internet. Winning matches increases the player's 'reputation score', and when sufficient points have been gained the multiplayer trophy is awarded. The online mode also incorporates an in-game text chat facility. 3D camera In June 2017, a first-person camera view was added to the game, along with 3D tables and bars. Players can quickly switch between top-down and first-person mode, which leads to a more realistic playing experience whilst still offering a full view of the table. The various themed bars are also represented in 3D (Cue Club, Basement, Cocktail and Penthouse), with an option to customize the look of the Cue Club bar. Larger table sizes In April 2018, a selection of bigger tables were introduced, including 6, 7, 8 and 9ft pool tables, along with 8, 9, 10, 11 and full size 12ft snooker tables. Whilst the larger tables would be more challenging to play on, the developers were keen to further increase the realism of the simulation and provide more configurable options for the players, in both offline and online multiplayer modes. New venues In February 2019, four new theatre venues were added: Cue Club, Basement, Cocktail and Penthouse theatres. These venues feature an interactive and lively audience who respond to good shots with cheering and applause, and sigh when fouls are committed. Theatres are used to host tournament matches, and can also be selected for quick matches, multiplayer and practice play. Alternative control system In June 2020, a new control system was introduced for mouse and keyboard, and also game controllers. The method, called 'fast aiming' allows the player to set up shots more easily and without the need to press and hold buttons to adjust the aiming target. The previous control method was preserved for players who prefer to use the original system, with an option provided in the menus. Table wear In September 2020, cloth wear was added as a selectable menu option. There are four levels available, which introduce chalk marks, burn marks and general wear and tear in progressively increasing amounts. Players are still able to select a new table cloth, which is the default option. Critical response In November 2015, gaming website MouseNJoypad.com awarded Cue Club 2 a score of 81%, recommending the game over any other pool simulator currently on the market.

Overview Drones are used by the military in situations where manned flight is considered too risky or difficult. The United States Air Force has drones that range from small intelligence drones to surveillance drones and large spy planes. The drones are unmanned, but they have a pilot. Trained crew steer the craft through cameras that send back what they see. The military began using these crafts to strike suspected militants in Pakistan's tribal areas under President George W Bush, but the use of drones has almost doubled since the Obama administration took office. The year before the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, drone funding stood at around $284 million. By the fiscal year 2016, the Pentagon spent close to $3 billion on drones. Since their start 3,900 people have been killed in 422 strikes in Pakistan, where the drones are controlled by the Central Intelligence Agency. The controversy of drones stems from the American people's concern of using advanced technologies to kill an enemy in foreign countries.  Opinion in the United States  The US public has broad, nonpartisan support for drone strikes, likely due to the perception that they limit risk to US troops. Monmouth University Poll on July 25‚Äì30, 2013 asked 1,012 adults nationwide the question \\"How much have you read or heard about the use of unmanned surveillance aircraft, sometimes called drones, by the U.S. military overseas: a great deal, some, just a little, or nothing at all?\\" 29% replied a great deal, 31% some, 25% just a little and 15% said nothing at all (margin of error of 3.1) The same group of people were asked the question \\"How confident are you that FEDERAL law enforcement agencies will use drones appropriately: very, somewhat, not too, or not at all confident?\\" 11% said very confident, 36% somewhat confident, 18% not too confident, 31% not confident at all and 4% unsure (margin of error of 3.1). In a poll was taken by Fox News in February 2013 with a margin of error of 3, the majority of Democrats, Republicans and Independents approve of the use of drones to kill a suspected foreign terrorist on US soil. They also collectively disapprove of killing a suspected terrorist who is a US citizen on US soil using drones. The same group of people were asked the question \\"Do you think the president of the United States, on his own, should be able to authorize the use of deadly force, such as a drone strike, to kill a suspected terrorist who is a U.S. citizen on U.S. soil?\\" This question was asked while Barack Obama was in office. The public answered by 32% of people saying yes, 63% of people saying no, and 5% of people saying they were unsure (margin of error of 3). In February 2013, Fairleigh Dickinson University's PublicMind poll conducted a study to measure U.S. public opinion on the use of drones. The study was conducted nationwide, and it asked registered voters whether they \\"approve or disapprove of the U.S. Military using drones to carry out attacks abroad on people and other targets deemed a threat to the U.S.?\\" The results showed that three in every four (75%) of voters approved of the U.S. military using drones to carry out attacks, while (13%) disapproved.Fairleigh Dickinson University's PublicMind, (February 7, 2013). Public says it's illegal to target Americans abroad as some question CIA drone attacks (press release) Another poll in February 2013 conducted by the Huffington Post was more equivocal: 56% of Americans support using drones to kill \\"high-level terrorists\\", 13% support using drones to kill \\"anyone associated with terrorists\\", 16% thought no one should be killed with drones, and 15% were not sure. A 2015 poll conducted by Jacquelyn Schneider and Julia Macdonald for Center for New American Security qualified some of this perceived support for drone strikes by giving respondents a chance to choose between drones, manned, neither platform, or both to conduct air strikes. They found that, while the American public was more likely to support unmanned than manned air strikes by approximately 10-15 percentage points, this support for unmanned was much less pronounced than previous polls suggested. In many cases the U.S. public supported air strikes from both manned and unmanned at similar rates.  International opinion  Outside America, support for drones is far lower. A Pew Research study of 20 countries in 2012 found widespread international opposition to US drone killings. One reason for this is that there is a shortage of media coverage for drone strikes and the procedure involved with them. This can cause a sense of unease pertaining to the use of drones.Debating Drones, in the Open by David Carr, The New York Times, February 10, 2013 The web aggregator blog 3 Quarks Daily in partnership with the Netherlands-based Dialogue Advisory Group hosted a symposium on drone attacks in 2013.Opposing Perspectives on the Drone Debate by Bradley Jay Strawser, Palgrave Macmillan [2014], References drone Category:Drone strikes conducted by the United States ","title":"Public opinion about U.S. drone attacks"},{"id":"45665155","text":"Hypnotized, released in Britain as A Quack Hypnotist, is a 1910 American silent short drama produced by the Thanhouser Company. The film focuses on May Smalley and Jack, who loves her, who attend a traveling show that comes to their little town. The show consists of a hypnotist and a Hindu magician and proves to be a popular show, but the hypnotist who is becomes interest in May. The hypnotist lures May away by telling her that he has a message for her from the spirit world and later gets her to leave town with him. Jack knocks the magician down and takes his costume and follows the hypnotist and May back to their hotel, where he rescues her. Aside from William Russell's role in the film, the production and cast credits are unknown. The film was released on December 30, 1910, it was met with positive reviews. The film is presumed lost.  Plot  Though the film is presumed lost, a synopsis survives in The Moving Picture World from December 31, 1910. It states, \\"May Smalley is a simple little country girl with whom Jack, a youth whom she has known since childhood, is very much in love. When a traveling show, consisting of a hypnotist and a Hindu magician comes to the opera house in her little town, the two young people are among the other interested spectators who flock to see the performance. May's youth and beauty attract the hypnotist, who plans to lure her away from her home. He sends May a message that he has a communication for her from the spirit world. Against the protest of Jack, her escort, May goes behind the scenes after the performance to meet with the great hypnotist, who fascinates her with his wiles. The hypnotist is an unscrupulous villain, and seeing that May is thoroughly impressed with his few tricks and considers him quite superhuman, he induces her to follow him when he leaves the town. How Jack proves himself to be a youth of resource as well as courage, the important part he played in May's deliverance by the Hindu fakir, is well told by the picture. Finally the hypnotist is shown in his true light. May is disillusioned, and comes to decide that Jack is just about the kind of protection she needs in a world of uncertainty.\\" According to a reviewer, Jack comes up to the stage where the Hindu magician is and knocks him down. Jack takes his costume and follows the hypnotist and May to the hotel where he rescues her.  Cast  *William Russell as the hypnotist.  Production  The writer of the scenario is unknown, but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan. He was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. The film director is unknown, but it may have been Barry O'Neil or Lucius J. Henderson. Cameramen employed by the company during this era included Blair Smith, Carl Louis Gregory, and Alfred H. Moses, Jr. though none are specifically credited. The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions. According to Bowers the cast credits are unknown, but many 1910 Thanhouser productions are fragmentary. Though a production still shows William Russell in the film. In late 1910, the Thanhouser company released a list of the important personalities in their films. The list includes G.W. Abbe, Justus D. Barnes, Frank H. Crane, Irene Crane, Marie Eline, Violet Heming, Martin J. Faust, Thomas Fortune, George Middleton, Grace Moore, John W. Noble, Anna Rosemond, Mrs. George Walters. This film was an example of the use of the character names Jack and May, which were to be repeatedly used by Lonergan in various productions. Bowers writes, \\"It developed that Lloyd F. Lonergan, ... liked these names, and during the years to come used them again and again. One can imagine that it must have become a studio joke to decide who was to play Jack and who was to play May. In actuality, names such as Jack and May were used in printed synopses to keep track of who was who, but such names were usually not mentioned in the film's subtitles. Patrons watching the picture in a theatre had not the foggiest idea whether the hero was named Jack, Bertram, or Ezekiel.\\" The first usage of the two leading character roles was in Dots and Dashes. Release and reception  The single reel drama, approximately 1,000 feet long, was released on December 30, 1910. The film was released in Britain under the title A Quack Hypnotist on April 26, 1913. The film likely had a wide national release, known advertising theaters include those in Arizona, Pennsylvania, and Kansas. Some theaters did not provide the production credits, complicating identification with Selig Polyscope's Hypnotized. The film received a positive review in the Moving Picture World which said, \\"It is a good story, well told, and the audience seems intensely interested in it.\\" The New York Dramatic Mirror offered a review that neither commended or criticized the production in its summary review of the film.

Developed by Mark Roberts Motion Control, Milo is for those who require the quality that studio systems can offer in a portable system. Milo is the world's best portable system because of its rigidity and being fast enough for live action shooting. It can be ready to shoot within 35 minutes of arrival on the set. It has a huge range of options including different length arms and different types of track rail. Milo provides axes for Track, Rotate, Lift, Arm Extension, Head Angle (Outer Arm), Pan, Tilt, Roll, Camera, Zoom, Focus, and Iris, while the overall system can control many more axes for model movers and the like. Milos are used daily in locations all over the world, for feature films, commercials and music promos. The rig is designed to be easy to move around a location or studio space with its integrated floor wheels. It can be transported whole when travelling by road. For longer trips it is designed to be easily taken apart into 7 main pieces (excluding rails) by just 3 people. Re-assembly from flight cases is a very fast and simple process and once trained can be done by 3 people in well under an hour, to be ready with the first shot. The Milo uses our Flair motion control software for all its functionality and Flair integrates with various 3D and CGI packages using a variety of file formats and methods. Exporting moves from the Milo to a CGI platform can often be done directly or using our MC Tools software or an FBX file format very simply and without fuss. Alternatively complex moves designed in CGI software such as Maya can be previzualized in our special CGI interface ‚Äì IKTRIX ‚Äì during pre-production or by the SFX/Post-production house and then be transferred directly to the Milo to execute on set or at a later date. Although the arm of the Milo swings in an arc about the centre of the rig, straight line moves are achievable vertically, horizontally or in any direction, through the use of the ‚ÄúTarget Tracking‚Äù feature in the computer software. For example, during a vertical straight line move, the track automatically compensates as the arm swings up to produce a perfectly straight lift. The Milo's geometry allows it to perform moves from ground level (or below) to a maximum height of 4.1 meters (13.5 ft.) with a minimum of image shake. The extending arm enables the system to be shortened for delicate close ups or lengthened for greater reach. Note that the Milo Long Arm now gives a lens height of over 6 metres.

By extension, it also indicates cheese that is consumed or commercialized at this stage of production. In a broader sense, it can be referred to fresh cheese made of ewe's milk, cow's milk or a mixture. Originally Tuma was only made from ewe's milk, but nowadays the usage in combination with cow's milk is generally accepted. The four stages of maturation of the Pecorino cheese are: * Tuma (directly from the curd) *Primosale (addition of salt and maturation for one month) *Secondo sale (maturation for at least another four months) * Pecorino stagionato (any maturation period longer than five-six months) Cheese products can be consumed at any of those stages and are usually referred to by the last stage completed. Tuma is a typical product of southern Italy, especially Sicily, being particularly common in the interior areas. Since it is produced from the curd without the addition of salt, it has to be consumed within one, maximum two weeks or it will spoil. In France, Piedmont and the Aosta Valley there is a type of cheese, produced with different methods, that has a similar name: tomme or Tome in French and tuma or toma in the local dialect.

He appears to have established his power over that city during the period of confusion which followed the death of Agathocles (289 BC), about the same time that Hicetas obtained the chief command at Syracuse. War soon broke out between the two despots, in which Phintias was defeated near Hybla.There were at least three, and possibly as many as five, cities called Hybla in ancient Sicily. It may never be known where this battle took place. But this success having induced Hicetas to engage with a more formidable enemy, the Carthaginians, he was defeated in his turn, and Phintias, who was probably in alliance with that power, was now able to extend his authority over a considerable part of Sicily. Among the cities subject to his rule we find mention of Agyrium, which is a sufficient proof of the extent of his dominions. He at the same time made a display of his wealth and power by founding a new city, to which he gave his own name Phintias, and whither he removed all the inhabitants from Gela, which he razed to the ground. His oppressive and tyrannical government subsequently alienated the minds of his subjects, and caused the revolt of many of the dependent cities. But he had the wisdom to change his line of policy, and, by adopting a milder rule, retained possession of the sovereignty until his death. The period of this is not mentioned, but we may probably infer from the fragments of Diodorus, that it preceded the expulsion of Hicetas from Syracuse, and may therefore be referred to 279 BC.Diodorus Siculus, XXII Exc. There are extant coins of Phintias, from which we learn that he assumed the title of king, in imitation of Agathocles. They all have the figure of a boar running on the reverse, and a head of Apollo or Diana on the obverse. Those which have been published with the head of Phintias himself are probably spurious.

Ashkenazi wielded considerable influence, most famously helping bring about the Jews‚Äô readmission to Venice in 1573.  Early Life and Migration  Ashkenazi was born in Udine to Jewish parents of German origin. He studied medicine at the University of Padua and trained as a rabbi... Following the expulsion of the Jews from Udine in 1556, Ashkenazi traveled to Cracow, Poland to serve as chief physician to King Sigismund II Augustus.Arbel p78. In 1564 Ashkenazi left for a post as court physician in Istanbul.  Court Physician in Istanbul  In Istanbul Ashkenazi rose to prominence, befriending the Venetian Bailo Marcantonio Barbaro and the Ottoman Grand Vizier Mehmed Sokollu. He and his brother also became involved in the wine trade between Crete and Poland, centered in Istanbul, as did many Jews of the time.Arbel, p. 82-86. The outbreak of the Ottoman-Venetian War in 1570 turned Ashkenazi into a key intermediary party between Turkey and Venice. Ashkenazi held two posts during the war: royal physician to Sokollu‚Äôs wife and official physician to the Venetian community in Istanbul. He carried out secret orders from the Grand Vizier intended to bring about peace, preventing arrests of military leaders and carrying messages between the two sides. Together with the Grand Dragoman Ali Bey, Ashkenazi drafted the peace treaty that ended the war in 1573. Ashkenazi was instrumental in choosing a successor for the Polish King Sigismund II Augustus, who left no heir upon his death in 1572. Polish law required an election be held. The candidates included the Russian tsar Ivan the Terrible; the German emperor Maximilian II; the Pope‚Äôs nominee, a minor Catholic prince; and the French prince, Henri of Anjou. The entire Europe balance of power was in limbo. Despite ostensibly belonging to the Polish gentry, the choice of the next Polish king effectively rested in the hands of the Ottoman Porte, whose sphere of influence extended into Poland. A French ambassador traveled to Istanbul to win the endorsement of Turkish leaders. He met with Ashkenazi, convincing him a French king of Poland was necessary to maintain the balance of power; in turn, Ashkenazi persuaded the Grand Vizier to back Henri. After Henri ascended the Polish throne, Ashkenazi sent the king his congratulations, writing, ‚ÄúI have rendered your majesty most important service in securing your election: I have effected all that was done here.‚Äù  Readmission of Venetian Jews  In 1572, the Venetian Doge, Alvise I Mocenigo, called for the re-enforcement of the 1556 decree of expulsion, inciting many Jews to leave and igniting a contentious debate in the Senate. The Jews‚Äô involvement in foreign trade and pawn-broking made them vital economic assets to the Venetian city-state. Moreover, some Venetian citizens objected morally to the replacement of Jewish banks with the Christian Monte di Piet√†, an up- and-coming institution in Venetian towns. At the same time, others argued that Jewish expulsion was a matter of moral necessity, citing the banishment of Jews from Spain and Portugal.Arbel, p.87. Back in Istanbul, Ashkenazi used his contacts to exert political pressure on the Venetian authorities on the issue of Jewish expulsion. Through an arrangement with Jacopo Soranzo, a Venetian official in Istanbul, Ashkenazi had arranged for some expelled Venetian Jews to come to Turkey. Soranzo returned to Venice shortly afterward to warn the Senate of the threat inherent in that arrangement. The Jews living presently in Turkey, he explained, who had been expelled earlier from Spain and Portugal, now manufactured weapons for the Ottoman forces to use against Venice. To add onto them Jews expelled from Venice could be costly or even dangerous. Ashkenazi made similar arguments to Barbaro, who relayed them to the Doge in his dispatches on the Ottoman situationArbel, p. 88-89 These factors doubtless contributed to the Senate‚Äôs decision to readmit the Jews in December 1573. But it would be fallacious to attribute full credit to Ashkenazi. Another proposal presented to the Venetian Senate earlier that year suggested the Jews expelled from Spain and Portugal be permitted entry, provided they lived in ghettos. While that proposal did not pass, it served to remind the Senate of the economic importance of the Jews and likely contributed to their ultimate readmissionArbel, p. 92.  Ambassador to Venice  Following the Polish election, the Porte named Ashkenazi envoy to Venice. Controversy flamed on both sides about the appointment of a Jew. In Turkey, Sokollu vouched for the doctor‚Äôs political acumen, while in Venice Barbaro sung Ashkenazi‚Äôs praises. After some debate, Ashkenazi won the seat and travelled to Venice in May 1574. The Venetian authorities and Jewish community showered Ashkenazi with gifts upon his arrival. As Ottoman ambassador, his track record proved mixed. Ashkenazi successfully negotiated a dispute over the borders of Dalmatia,Arbel p. 93. but failed in his advocacy for the formation of a Venetian-Ottoman military alliance. While in Venice he also helped a group of Jewish merchants petition for compensation for the property they lost after leaving Venice because of the banishment decree. The petition succeeded and the merchants were compensated; many nonetheless chose not to return to VeniceArbel, p. 94.

The policy was adopted after reviewing time and round statistics for six prior years and finding a trend of spellers using more time. Although Jamaica's contestant had won the prior year, the second student outside the United States to ever win the bee, Jamaica was excluded from this year's bee under a new rule that all qualifying bees could not occur before February 1, to allay concerns that some spellers could get a greater head start on preparing for the national bee.

He was educated at Marlborough College and then, initially intending to pursue a career in the Royal Engineers, at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. In 1913 he relinquished his cadetship and entered Magdalene College, Cambridge. Career Morshead's studies were interrupted by the outbreak of the First World War, in which he saw active service on the Western Front and Italian Front as a commissioned officer in the Royal Engineers. During the war he was awarded the Military Cross, invested as a Companion of the Distinguished Service Order, awarded the Italian War Merit Cross and was Mentioned in Despatches five times. He subsequently returned to Cambridge where he read Modern Languages. Upon graduating he became librarian of the Pepys Library.

He was Hungarian Ambassador to Belgium and Luxembourg from 2000 to 2004. He was a member of the Constitutional Court of Hungary between 2007 and 2010. He served as Hungarian Ambassador to France from 2010 to 2014. He was Minister of Justice in the third and fourth Orb√°n cabinets, from 6 June 2014 to 30 June 2019. Biography Tr√≥cs√°nyi is a lawyer, former judge, a diplomat and university professor. He specializes in constitutional law, European law and comparative law. Studies and academic career He began his university studies in 1975 at the Faculty of Law of the Attila J√≥zsef University of Szeged (J√≥zsef Attila Tudom√°nyegyetem, since 2000 University of Szeged). In 1977, he joined the Faculty of Law and State Sciences of the Lor√°nd E√∂tv√∂s University (E√∂tv√∂s Lor√°nd Tudom√°nyegyetem, ELTE) in Budapest. He graduated in 1980. He began working as a research associate in the Hungarian Parliament Library and then became a collaborator of the Institute of Legal Studies of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences (Magyar Tudom√°nyos Akad√©mia, MTA). Admitted to the bar, he was hired as a lawyer in 1985 in Budapest, but remained a collaborator at the MTA. In 1987, he became an assistant at the Department of Constitutional Law at the University of Szeged. From 1989 to 1990, he is a fellow at the Catholic University of Louvain and works with Professor Francis Delp√©r√©e. Tr√≥cs√°nyi obtained his doctorate in 1991 with a thesis on the administrative jurisdiction in comparative law. In 1991, he co-founded the law firm Nagy & Tr√≥cs√°nyi with P√©ter Nagy in Budapest. Throughout his later years in politics, his law firm has remained involved in representing clients in relation with governmental matters. Tr√≥cs√°nyi was appointed lecturer in the Constitutional Law Department of the University of Szeged in 1992 and chaired the departmen from 1994 to 2010. In addition to these activities, he also held the position of Associate Dean of the Faculty of Law of the University of Szeged. Since 2000, he has been an accredited professor at Szeged University and for many years held the position of Secretary of the International Association of Constitutional Law. Between 2005 and 2007, he chaired the Committee for International Relations of the Budapest Bar Association. In 2004 he became director of the Center for European Studies at the University of Szeged. Between 2005 and 2008, he worked as an associate professor at Universit√© Lyon-III. In 2013, he initiated the creation of the Centre universitaire francophone at the University of Szeged. Judicial and diplomatic career Tr√≥cs√°nyi served as Ambassador of Hungary to Belgium and Luxembourg (2000-2004) and to France (2010‚Äì2014). He was also a member of the Venice Commission of the Council of Europe (2005-2013) and a member of the Hungarian Constitutional Court (2007‚Äì2010). Political career On 6 June 2014, Tr√≥cs√°nyi was appointed Minister of Justice in the Third Orb√°n Government. As Minister, he initiated legislations that the Juncker Commission brought to the European Court of Justice to scrutinize whether they harmonize with the EU laws or not. Among the norms introduced during his tenure were the criminalization of NGOs providing legal assistance to asylum seekers, the amendments to the higher education law that made the Central European University relocate its headquarters from Budapest, and the norms that created legal environment for establishing border transit camps where asylum seekers are detained before a decision is made about whether they are allowed into the country or not. A draft law introducing special administrative courts in charge of corruption cases was finally put on hold as the membership of the Fidesz party was suspended in the European People's Party. With Tr√≥cs√°nyi's approval, Hungary chose to extradite two Russian arms-dealers who had previously arrested in a joint operation of the US and Hungarian police, to Russia rather than to the US. Hungary also granted immediate asylum to disgraced former prime minister of North Macedonia Nikola Gruevski, who was convicted in his native country of corruption, while refusing asylum to people fleeing from conflicts abroad. The developments in Hungary under his tenure as Justice Minister raised severe concerns as regards the erosion in the rule of law in the country. The European Parliament called for an Article 7 procedure to be opened against Hungary for serious breach of the founding EU values during his mandate. Tr√≥cs√°nyi was the lead candidate of the Fidesz party list at the 2019 European Parliament election, when he was elected a Member of the European Parliament (MEP). Tr√≥cs√°nyi has been nominated as EU commissioner from Hungary on 9 September 2019. He had previously considered the vice- presidency of the European Parliament‚Äôs Committee on Constitutional Affairs. He was offered the portfolio of Commissioner for European neighborhood policy and enlargement. His nomination was criticized by several Balkan scholars and observers, taking account of his role in undermining the rule of law in Hungary. Von der Leyen defended the choice stating that Hungary's objectives \\"are clear regarding the integration of the Western Balkans, which are in line with the political agenda of the new European Commission\\". Tr√≥cs√°nyi had to be confirmed as Commissioner-designate in October by the European Parliament during a committee meeting in the committee on foreign affairs, where he could face strong opposition by Socialists, Greens and Liberals. Commissioner designates have to be assesed by the committee responsible for legal affairs as well, a committee of the European Parliament responsible for legal political affairs, its members being members of parliament, representatives, in form of a procedure assessing conflict of interest. On 26 September 2019, it was reported that Tr√≥cs√°nyi will be questioned by the European Parliament Legal Affairs Committee about their declarations of interests due to potential conflict of interests. The JURI committee sent a letter with its decision on the potential conflict of interest on the 26 September to the president of the European Parliament, David Sassoli, adopted by 11 votes to 9 stating that his personal finances in connection with his law firm, he founded before becoming Minister of Justice and due to concerns - without presenting a court judgement or any official document - in relation to extradition of Russian suspects to Russia based on a court judgement during his time as the Hungarian minister of justice. President Sassoli, however, asked for clarification on the matter and decided, that in this form, the suggestion of the JURI committee was not based on proper evidence and the decision had to be clarified. The president asked the JURI committee to either state where the conflict of interest lies and recommend how the candidate could solve it or conclude that the candidate is unable to become a European commissioner. Tr√≥cs√°nyi published a statement on his Twitter account later that day, stating that he will take all legal steps against the decision. The JURI committee - not being able to give a justified recommendation - issued a letter rejecting his nomination with 12 votes to 9 on 30 September 2019 and stating that the candidate is unable to fill the position of commissioner designate due to a \\" _possible_ conflict of interest\\" \\\\- still not based on evidence. Thereafter, President-elect Von der Leyen asked Prime Minister Viktor Orb√°n to propose a new candidate. Orb√°n nominated Oliv√©r V√°rhelyi, Hungary's Permanent Representative to the EU, instead of Professor Tr√≥cs√°nyi. Francois-Xavier Bellamy, French member of the European Parliament stated that the procedure against L√°szl√≥ Tr√≥cs√°nyi was \\"politically and ideologically motivated\\" and that it was completely against the law and against the mission of the JURI committee. Views Defending the Orb√°n government's immigration policy, Tr√≥cs√°nyi stated that \\"Central Europe is very reluctant to accept multiculturalism, especially since it does not seem to work so well in Western Europe\\". He believes that the issue of migration is decisive, \\"because it affects the composition of the population of the country, and therefore the type of society in which we will live, not only today but in twenty years.\\"L√°szl√≥ Tr√≥cs√°nyi, La r√©ponse du ministre de la Justice hongrois aux critiques contre son pays, lefigaro.fr, 30 septembre 2015Migrations : les pays de l‚ÄôEst se rebiffent, lemonde.fr, 25 septembre 2017 He is critical of the idea of the migrant quotas floated by the European Union that would impose embracement of foreign populations on the EU countries that deny participation in the redistribution of the illegal migrants who arrived in the more economically developed parts of the EU in search of a better standard of living. In his opinion, this obligation may affect the national sovereignty and the constitutional identity of the Hungarian State.Laszlo Trocsanyi : ¬´La Hongrie entend d√©fendre ses fronti√®res¬ª, entretien, lefigaro.fr, 8 mars 2018 Private life L√°szl√≥ Tr√≥cs√°nyi is married and has three children.Bibliography of L√°szl√≥ Tr√≥cs√°nyi, kormany.hu - Official website of the Hungarian Government References External links * *Government - Ministry of Justice - The Minister (in English).

He was at first a slave in the service of Anaxilas, tyrant of Rhegium, but gradually rose to so high a place in the confidence of his master, that Anaxilas at his death (476 BC) left him guardian of his infant sons, with charge to hold the sovereign power in trust for them, until they should attain to manhood. The administration of Micythus appears to have been both wise and vigorous, so that he conciliated the affections of his subjects, and held the government both of Rhegium and Messana, undisturbed by any popular commotions. One of the principal events of his reign was the assistance furnished by him to the Tarentines in their war against the Iapygians (473 BC), which was terminated by a disastrous defeat, in which 3000 of the Rhegians perished, and the fugitives were pursued by the barbarians up to the very gates of the city. But notwithstanding this blow, shortly after (471 BC) he was still powerful enough to found a new colony, the city of Pyxus, or Buxentum, as it was afterwards called. It was from jealousy of Micythus that Hieron, tyrant of Syracuse, who had been on friendly terms with Anaxilas, was induced to invite the sons of that monarch, who were now grown up to manhood, to his court, urging them to require of their guardian the surrender of the sovereign power, as well as an account of his administration. But on the return of the young princes (467 BC), Micythus immediately complied with their request. And after rendering an exact account of the period of his rule, he resigned the supreme power and departed with all his private wealth to the Peloponnese, where he settled at Tegea, and resided there the rest of his life in honour and tranquillity. He is also mentioned by Pausanias (who calls him Smicythus) as having distinguished himself by the number of statues and other offerings that he dedicated at Olympia.Herodotus, VII 170; Diodorus Siculus XI 48, 52, 59, 66; Pausanias V 26. ¬ß¬ß 4, 5; Strabo VI p. 253; Macrobius Sat.

It was described by Warren in 1896. It is found in north-eastern India. The wingspan is 22‚Äì25 mm for females. The forewings are fawn colour, but the costal edge is yellowish from the base to the middle. The lines are ferruginous, starting from dark brown costal spots. The first at one-fourth, oblique outwards, angled on the subcostal, then straight and vertical or slightly oblique to the inner margin beyond one-third. The second line from the costa at the middle, runs outward along the subcostal vein for two-thirds of the distance to the apex, then sharply angulated, incurved opposite the cell and outcurved below it, reaching the inner margin straight at four-fifths. The submarginal line is strongly denticulate and blackish. The marginal area is dark grey, with some irregular black marks before the fringe, which is chestnut with a pale basal line. The apical one-third of the costa has a chestnut streak, the apex itself with one or two snow-white spots. The cell-spot is large, blackish, followed obliquely below it by four small white spots edged with black, and sometimes altogether black. The hindwings are fawn colour, in the females with the costal area ochreous and in the males with an ochreous tint suffusing the wing and leaving only the inner and anal margins fawn colour. There is a curved postmedian line, abbreviated in the males, reaching to the ochreous costal part in the females, which also has a short antemedian line on the inner margin which is wanting in males.Novitates Zoologicae 3: 335 References Category:Moths described in 1896 Category:Drepaninae ","title":"Nordstromia humerata"},{"id":"45665595","text":"Nordstromia ochrozona is a moth in the family Drepanidae.

Personal life Anne Margaret Coke was born at Holkam Hall on 25 January 1779 to Thomas Coke, 1st Earl of Leicester of Holkham, and Jane Dutton. Anne had an older sister, Jane, born in 1777, and a younger sister, Elizabeth born in 1795, one year after Anne was married. Jane was married by that time, too. Her mother was an abolitionist, spent her allowance on donations to the poor and theater tickets for her servants. Jane Dutton also believed in the importance of a good education for her children. At the age of 15, Anne Margaret Coke was married to 27-year-old Thomas Anson, 1st Viscount Anson, in September 1794. He was a member of parliament, worth ¬£22,000 () per year, and heir to Shugborough estate in Staffordshire. The Duke of Sussex said that he was a \\"true manly, noble, splendid fellow, possessing much of the real English character, sound sense, and although perhaps hurried away a little too much by country sports, has a great deal of good in him.\\" According to Susanna Wade Martins, Anne was described as \\"thin, excitable, energetic, never quiet, constantly getting into quarrels, but always ready to help others. Dawson Turner described her as a woman of sweet character and a pleasing personality. Anson gave birth to eleven children, four by the time she was 20 years of age. She died 23 May 1843 in London. Artist Susanna Wade Martins in Coke of Norfolk (1754‚Äì1842) states that Anne was likely taught to draw by Thomas Gainsborough in Norfolk and London. One of her paintings of a milk girl was made after one of Gainsborough's paintings. She was said to have made a painting of a nest of owls that was considered \\"very well done\\" by Benjamin Haydon. Mrs. Powys, who visited Shugborough in 1800, stated that competent works by Anson were in every room of the house, including three full-length paintings of her children.

During the partitions of Poland era, there were borders between the Congress Poland (August√≥w Voivodeship) and Lithuanian lands of the Russian Empire (Kovno Governorate and Vilna Governorate). From the Union of Lublin (1569) to the partitions, there was no Polish-Lithuanian border, as both countries were a part of a single federated entity, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. In medieval times, the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania shared yet another border.Stephen R.

This meant that all passport checks were removed along the border in December 2007. Military significance To the military planners of NATO, the border area is known as the Suwalki gap (named after the nearby town of Suwa≈Çki), because it represents a tough-to-defend flat narrow piece of land, a gap, that is between Belarus and Russia's Kaliningrad exclave and that connects the NATO-member Baltic States to Poland and the rest of NATO. This view was reflected in a 2017 NATO exercise, which for the first time focused on defense of the gap from a possible Russian attack. Former border crossings Former border crossing Ogrodniki‚ÄìLazdijai In the period 1991‚Äì2007, there were three road and one rail border crossing between Poland and Lithuania. On May 1, 2004, when both Poland and Lithuania joined the European Union, this border became an internal border of the European Union. On 21 December 2007, Poland and Lithuania acceded to the Schengen Agreement. After this, crossing the border became easier, as EU internal borders are open to all traffic with little need for control. There are still, however, occasional customs and police controls against smuggling of restricted goods, which however affect only about 1% of travelers.

Fennie () is an American scientist. He is currently a professor at the School of Applied and Engineering Physics at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. Fennie is a physicist and materials scientist. He is best known for winning a MacArthur Award in 2013. Early life Craig √ìg grew up in working- class neighborhoods of Philadelphia (Olney and NE) and attended Archdiocese primary (Incarnation of our Lord, known as \\"Inky\\") and high school (Archbishop Ryan High School). He took nearly a decade off before going to graduate school. During this time he was in an Irish-American punk band and worked several jobs including being a bouncer. His family came from T√≠r Eoghain, Tuaisceart √âireann, near Loch Neagh. His father (Craig M√≥r) was a steamfitter, originally from Lackawanna, NY. His mother is from Minersville PA. Work Fennie's work combines elements of physics and chemistry in order to invent new materials with desirable properties. From Throwing Rocks and Punk Rock, to Designing Rocks atom-by-atom \\"Throwing Rocks ...\\" is the title of the general audience, public talk that Craig has been giving ever since his unusual path to where he is today was revealed after being named a MacArthur Fellow. It is a play on the fact that as a kid in Olney, throwing rocks was what Craig did for fun, then as a teenager & young adult moving onto punk rock, to the fact that today he works mostly on complex oxide materials (most geological rocks are such materials). The main message of the talk is that there are real obstacles to learning STEM fields, but these obstacles aren't what most people think. Craig discusses both external obstacles (particularly for those from backgrounds where the realities of daily life itself presents challenges to learning) and internal obstacles (not believing you can \\"do it\\"). He points out that physics/math/etc is difficult, it is supposed to be, and it is hard for everyone at first (some people are just better at hiding this fact). He asks a question, \\"Why is it that no one questions the fact that to excel at sports it takes practice, practice, practice; Yet when it comes to education, students and their parents (and too many educators) have an attitude that if you \\"get a bad grade\\" in a subject you must not be good at it and you should study something else? Too often in such cases this external obstacle, this interpretation of a bad grade, conditions our internal response to the point of wanting to avoid the subject, i.e., developing a dislike of the subject, or creating the internal obstacle of not believing one can do it.\\" Craig's key point is that in learning a STEM field it is exactly the failures, and how we respond to them, in which we truly learn. He argues this is exactly the same as in sports. To make his point explicit, Craig calls upon the words of skateboarding legend Rodney Mullen from his TED Talk entitled \\"On getting up again: Rodney Mullen at TEDxOrangeCoast\\",. Craig wonders out loud how is it that a skateboarder knows better how to excel at STEM fields than most STEM educators and tells the audience that everyone needs to watch Rodney's talk. Quoting Rodney Mullen, in skateboarding \\"... we fall and get back up, ... every fiber in him, tells him don't do it again ... this act of getting up again shapes us.\\" Craig argues that the feeling that overcomes us when we get a bad grade on a test is the same biological response as the skateboarder who fell, i.e., don't do it again, this hurts! But if we get back up and try again (and if we fail again, try again), puts one on a path towards breaking our internal obstacles to learning STEM.

It is the sequel to the 2012 film The Man with the Iron Fists. The film stars RZA, Sahajak Boonthanakit, Pim Bubear, Ocean Hou, Grace Huang, Andrew Lin and Khiri Steven Lowenstein. The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray on April 14, 2015. Plot Thaddeus is on his way to the monks at Wu Chi Temple on a quest on inner peace when he is attacked by the brother of Silver Lion and his henchmen. Thaddeus manages to defeat them all but receives a near fatal wound from claw of Silver's brother. He succumbs to his wounds and is seen drifting on a log down a river. A narration tells about a spring of chi, the Golden Nectar flowing from the mountains that were protected by monks and the Gemini Twins. Lord Pi raided the temple in an attempt to gain control of the Golden Nectar but was defeated. His ghost is rumored to roam the mountains, still looking for the Nectar and stealing chi from anyone he encounters. Meanwhile, in Tsai Fu village, a man is burying his daughter and demands that the killer be found. He challenges the mayor and Master Ho, the silver mine owner. All the men proceed to the mine to work where Master Ho is shown to be an oppressive task master, frequently maiming and killing underperforming workers. Most of the village men seek to rebel but Li Kung talks them down. Another girl is killed but nothing is done. Li Kung's brother challenges Master Ho's man, Duyan, to a fight and wins. However, he is later found dead in the mines. Meanwhile, Li Kung's daughter, Innocence, finds Thaddeus floating in the river and tends him to health. His presence is hidden from the village and he is moved to the old blacksmith's residence. Li Kung and his men find a hidden cave with a fountain which Kung drinks from. The cave is rich in silver but they hide the existence of the cave from Master Ho. Li Kung, infuriated by the death of his brother, challenges Master Ho's clan to a fight. He asks Thaddeus to build weapons for the village but Thaddeus claims he is on a path of peace. He promises to forge better mining tools but whatever the tools are used for are not Thaddeus' responsibility. Li Kung defeats two of Master Ho's men and Kung is threatened with the safety of his family. He replies by challenging Master Ho himself. However, on the way to the fight, a masked man cuts Kung badly. He proceeds with the fight in spite of his injuries and Master Ho aims punches to open the wound. As Ho is about to defeat Kung, Thaddeus arrives and saves his life. They are recaptured and sentenced to hanging the next morning. That night, his fellow miners aided by the bow wielding Mayor, rescue them. Thaddeus chooses to build the crippled Mayor iron legs, like his iron fists so he can join in the rebellion. Li Kung reveals to the abbot of temple of the Golden Nectar that Master Ho wants to mine under the well and steal it. The abbot reveals that they did not kill Lord Pi because he was of royal blood but they ensured that he would never be able to steal the Nectar again. The monks join forces with the villagers against Master Ho and the Black Beetles to protect the source of the Golden Nectar. The battle begins in the morning when the Mayor is revealed to be Lord Pi. His legs were cut off so he would not be able to try for the nectar again. After drinking from the spring, he steals the chi out of Innocence and kills her. After defeating the abbot, Lord Pi fights Li Kung, but together with Thaddeus, Kung manages to defeat and kill Lord Pi. Kung bathes his daughter in the river and is resuscitated. Thaddeus continues on his journey while the village is being rebuilt. Kung becomes Mayor and the villagers protect the source of chi.

The term is a portmanteau of the game series Metroid and Castlevania. Metroidvania games use game design and mechanics that are similar to games from these two series. Specifically, the term derives from the Castlevania title Castlevania: Symphony of the Night and many of the games in the franchise which come after it, which are generally considered to contain certain aspects of gameplay comparable to that of the Metroid series of games. As such, the term is used to invoke gameplay concepts and mechanics similar to that of these two series. Koji Igarashi, the assistant director for Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, is credited with establishing key principles of Metroidvanias through his work on other Castlevania games. Metroidvania games feature a large interconnected world map the player can explore, though access to parts of the world is often limited by doors or other obstacles that can only be passed once the player has acquired special items, tools, weapons or abilities within the game. Acquiring such improvements can also aid the player in defeating more difficult enemies and locating shortcuts and secret areas, and often includes retracing one's steps across the map. Through this, Metroidvania games include tighter integration of story and level design, careful design of levels and character controls to encourage exploration and experimentation, and a means for the player to become more invested in their player character. Metroidvania games typically are sidescrolling platformers, but can also include other genre types. Though popularized on consoles during the 1990s, the genre saw a resurgence starting in the 2000s due to a number of critically praised, independently developed games. History While not the first game of its kind, Metroid (1986, Nintendo Entertainment System) is generally considered the most influential game in the Metroidvania genre. Nintendo's goal for the title was to create a non-linear adventure game to set it apart from other games at the time, requiring the player to retrace their steps while providing permanent power-ups in contrast to how other adventure games only offered power-ups with temporary effects. The series was popular, and future titles refined the exploration approach while adding more story elements to the title such as with Super Metroid (1994, Super Nintendo Entertainment System). Koji Igarashi is credited with establishing defining features of the Metroidvania genre. During this time, the gothic horror-themed platformer series Castlevania was gaining popularity. The original Castlevania (1986, NES) featured discrete levels that the player completed in a sequential manner. It was followed by Vampire Killer (1986, MSX)Jeremy Parish, Famicom 25th, Part 17: Live from The Nippon edition, 1UP.com, August 1, 2008Kurt Kalata and William Cain, Castlevania 2: Simon's Quest (1988) , Castlevania Dungeon, accessed 2011-02-27 and Castlevania II: Simon's Quest (1987, NES) which experimented with non-linear adventure gameplay, before the series returned to the more linear style of the original Castlevania. Series lead Koji Igarashi found that as they continued to produce sequels to cater to fans of the series, experienced players would race through the levels, while new players to the series would struggle with some stages. To try to make a title that would be more widely appreciated across play levels and extend the gameplay time of the title, Igarashi and others on his team looked toward the ideas used by The Legend of Zelda series into the development of Castlevania: Symphony of the Night (1997, PlayStation); such ideas included a large open world to explore, the need to acquire key items to enter certain areas, and the ability to improve the player-character as one would in console role- playing games. The change proved popular with players, and subsequent games in the series would follow this formula. With the releases of Super Metroid and Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, the formula these games presented would form the foundations of what are considered Metroidvanias today. Castlevania: Symphony of the Night had also become a critical and financial success over time, establishing that there was a desire by players for Metroidvania-style games. While both series continued to develop titles in this format, the concept of Metroidvanias started to gain more traction when other parties began to develop games in the same style. Cave Story (2004, Microsoft Windows) was developed by Daisuke Amaya as a homage to Metroid and other classic games; the game was critically praised showing the scope of what one person could do, and highlighted another take on the Castlevania and Metroid games, as well as vitalizing the 2D platformer genre as a viable indie game format. Shadow Complex (2009, Xbox 360) by Chair Entertainment was developed based on the premise that Super Metroid was \\"the pinnacle of 2D game design\\". The game received highly positive reviews, and remains one of the best-selling downloadable titles on the Xbox 360 service. Due to games like these, the Metroidvania genre began to take off in both publisher-driven and independent games development. While the word \\"Metroidvania\\" is commonly used presently to describe games in this genre, or games that have elements of this genre, the origins of the term are unclear; Igarashi notes that he did not coin the phrase, though grateful for the invention of the term. Igarashi noted that with Symphony of the Night the goal was to have exploration closer to the top- down Zelda approach, but with the side-scrolling nature, it was compared more to Metroid, and believes this is how the portmanteau came about. A similar portmanteau \\"Castleroid\\" is sometimes used as well for describing this genre. Video game journalist Jeremy Parish, who manages the Metroidvania.com site that has attempted to catalog all known Metroidvania games, acknowledges he helped to popularize the term but had learned it from his former co-worker at 1UP.com, Scott Sharkey, who had used the term to describe the games in the Castlevania series that had adopted some elements from the Metroid series. Gameplay concepts In Guacamelee!, the player gains the ability to temporarily turn their human character into a chicken, allowing them to pass through low-height corridors and discover secrets. The term 'Metroidvania' is most often used to refer to a platforming game that features a single large, interconnected map, generally with discrete rooms or sections. Not all areas of this map are available at the start, often requiring the player to obtain an item (such as a weapon or key) or a new character ability to remove some obstacle blocking the path forward. Often, this item is protected by a boss character, providing story-driven challenges throughout the game. Maps are non-linear, and often require the player to traverse the map multiple times during the course of the game. Weaker monsters will inhabit other parts of the level, re-spawning when the player revisits those rooms, and often can be defeated to gain health, ammunition, or experience points. Larger games generally feature save points as well as the ability to transport the player quickly between certain rooms on far sides of the map, eliminating tedious backtracking in the later parts of the game. Access to new abilities can also open up shortcuts that reduce travel time, as well as discover secrets that help to improve the character's abilities. For example, gaining access to double jump or wall jump abilities can give players more mobility, while obtaining the ability to transform into a smaller object can let the player slip through narrow corridors. As such, the genre focuses on exploration of a large world map, and advancement of the player-character abilities over time. Metroidvanias are sometimes referred to as \\"platform adventure games\\" due to this scope. Metroidvania is generally associated with game levels/maps that are laid out as two-dimensional side scrollers, with the player character moving left, right, up and down through the level. These games typically are rendered using two-dimensional graphics, but can include 2.5D-rendered games using 3D graphics engines but limiting player movement to two dimensions, such as the aforementioned Shadow Complex. The exploration and character development concepts of Metroidvanias can be used in other genres, though these games typically are not categorized as Metroidvanias. For example, the Metroid Prime trilogy is a first-person adventure that builds on the same style of exploration play as Metroid. Dark Souls is a third-person action role-playing game loosely considered a Metroidvania featuring \\"soft locks\\" ‚Äì obstacles in the form of boss characters that are difficult but not impossible to defeat when the player-character is starting out, and become much easier to defeat with increased experience and abilities. The third-person action/brawler Batman: Arkham series also uses similar concepts as a Metroidvania, with Batman collecting new gadgets to access new areas. The 2017 Prey was developed as a first-person-perspective immersive sim but using Metroidvania level design concepts to require the player to traverse the setting multiple times as they gain additional tools and abilities. Igarashi described what he believed were key elements in the genre. These include designing maps that encourage exploration but which still guide the player on a main path through the game and providing means where the player can be aware of where they are in the game world at any time. This can be accomplished by graphical themes through the game's world, visually unique milestones at key game point, overall map and player status information screens, and the means of moving around the map quickly. Russ Frushtick from Polygon observed that many modern Metroidvanias not only have these qualities, but also find a means to tell a narrative through the world's environments without necessarily relying on cutscenes or dialog. In a 1UP.com video discussion between Parish, Sharkley, and Chris Kohler of Wired in 2007, the three discussed some older games that had elements associated with Metroidvanias but would not be considered true Metroidvanias, including games like Castlevania II: Simon's Quest (1987), Legacy of the Wizard (1987), Adventure Island IV (1994). They argue that such games, while having 2D platforming gameplay and power-up based progression systems, lacked good level design, which at their time had not been well-refined in the industry, and provided little or no information relayed to the player to help them to know where to go next, exemplified by the cryptic clues from Simon's Quest. The three also agreed that as games transitioned from 2D to 3D, the true meaning of \\"Metroidvania\\" had become diluted, as 3D-based games can hide facets of Metroidvanias. Analysis The popularity of the Metroidvania genre is stated to be tied to the ease with which platformer games can be learned and mastered, while giving the player a character that they can grow over the course of the game. Many developers of independent Metroidvania titles cited the exploration as a core element of the genre that draws in players, working off the natural human instincts to explore, and giving the players the sense of discovery and self-control during the game. Donald Mustard of Chair Entertainment, the creators of Shadow Complex, stated that a good Metroidvania helps the player come to epiphanies that enables them to progress in the game, describing an example of a ledge that is initially too high to reach, and as the player acquires abilities, will discover how they can reach that ledge on their own. From a developer's standpoint, the Metroidvania genre provides benefits to the developer. The genre encourages tight connection between level design and game story, and can give developers opportunities to create an immersive world for the player. Level design of such games can also be challenging as to make sure the challenge to the players of the game is fair and enjoyable, and achieving this goal can be seen as a sign of a success for a developer. Thomas Mahler of Moon Studios, who developed Ori and the Blind Forest, said that it was important to design a cohesive world with memorable settings for a Metroidvania, since \\"players remembering the levels is part of the core design\\". Large-scale development in this genre requires one change in the player's abilities to be tested more rigorously throughout all of the levels. Ori and the Will of the Wisps executive producer Daniel Smith said, \\"I don't think people generally consider how difficult it is to make a Metroidvania game. Everything is so interconnected that if you change one aspect of the game, it's just inevitable that it's going to influence the rest.\\" References External links * Metroidvania.com and Metroidvanias.com: Lists of Metroidvania games Category:Video game genres Category:Video game terminology ","title":"Metroidvania"},{"id":"45665899","text":"Head & Hands, also known as √Ä Deux Mains, is a nonprofit organization based in Montreal, Quebec.

She was the former dean of the faculty of architecture and planning and head of the department of architecture, Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET). She was the first woman to be appointed as the Vice-chancellor of BUET. She held the position since September 2014 until her death in May 2016.  Early life and education  Ekram was born on August 6, 1950, in Dhaka, to Ekram Hussain and Qamrunnessa Hussain. She had three sisters, Kamela Akhter Ishaque, Morsheda Karim, and Masuda Ahmed.http://contextbd.com/life-aspiration-work-and- contribution-interview-of-professor-khaleda-ekram/ Ekram received her Bachelor of Architecture degree from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology in 1974. Her final year thesis project was titled \\"Tourist Resort at Cox‚Äôs Bazaar, Chittagong\\". She pursued higher education in urban planning and design in the United States, where she earned her graduate degree (MURP) from University of Hawaii in 1980. Her thesis title was \\"Revitalization of Residential Areas of Old Dhaka\\". In 1992, she completed post-graduate courses in Architecture and Development at Lund University in Sweden.  Career  Ekram began her career in 1974 as a junior architect at Bastukalabid Limited in Dhaka. She also worked for Parikalpak Sangstha Limited, for a brief period in 1975. In the same year, she began her four-decade-long teaching career with the Department of Architecture of BUET. She first joined as a lecturer and then became assistant professor in 1977. Her areas of interest included housing, community development, urban design, urban planning and gender issues. After graduating from the University of Hawaii in Urban and Regional Planning, she worked as assistant architect planner at Honolulu-based Michael T. Suzuki & Associates, from December 1980 to May 1981. She also worked at East West Center and contributed in community service projects in Honolulu. Upon coming back to Bangladesh, she resumed her assistant professor role in BUET and became associate professor in 1986 and professor in 1995. She went on to become the head of the department in 1997 and the dean of the faculty of architecture and planning in 1999. On September 11, 2014, the Education Ministry of Bangladesh appointed Ekram as the first female vice-chancellor of BUET. She was also the second female to hold the position of VC in the history of the nation. However, only two days after her appointment, Teachers' Association of BUET raised their opposition against the new VC, alleging that seniority has been violated in her appointment. They argued that BUET VCs were appointed based on their seniority and Khaleda Ekram was the 26th senior-most professor in BUET and hence was not eligible for the post. Eventually, the controversy died down and Ekram was able to serve 20 months out of her 4-year term until she became seriously ill in 2016. Within this short period of time, she proved her administrative skills and was credited with bringing back the academic discipline by reducing 'session jam' of BUET. She also patronized and facilitated many extra-curricular activities for the students in an attempt to improve their college experience.

Kerr (1946 ‚Äì February 4, 2015) was an American wildlife biologist and conservationist. He founded the High Desert Museum in Bend, Oregon. Kerr lead the museum for sixteen years, helping it develop and expand to become one of Central Oregon's most popular tourist attractions. The museum‚Äôs bird of prey center and a high desert conservation award are named in his honor.  Early life  Kerr was born in Portland, Oregon in 1946. He was a third generation Oregonian. At the age of 12, he became interested in falconry when a teacher brought a live falcon to class. That experience sparked a broader interest in wildlife and nature in general. In high school, Kerr raised a wolf cub as a biology project. He attended Oregon State University, where he graduated with a bachelor's degree in biology and a minor in journalism\\"Welcome\\", High Desert Museum, www.highdesertmuseum.org, Bend, Oregon, accessed February 7, 2015.Hammers, Scott and Dylan J.

After graduating from Oregon State University, Kerr went to work at Portland‚Äôs Washington Park Zoo (now called the Oregon Zoo). He later took a job with the Nature Conservancy as a wildlife biologist. In the late 1970s, Kerr moved to Central Oregon with the idea of creating a museum with living animals exhibited in their natural environments.  High Desert Museum  In 1974, Kerr founded the Western Natural History Institute. After five years of fund raising, he persuaded the Brooks-Scanlon Lumber Company to donate of timberland for a nature museum site. The property was located south of Bend just east of U.S. Route 97. Construction of the museum began in May 1982. The museum building was completed and opened its doors to the public later that year. Originally, the museum was called the Oregon High Desert Museum. However, the museum's name was later changed to the High Desert Museum to highlight the fact that the high desert environment stretches across a large part of the western United States. Kerr directed the museum for sixteen years. During his tenure, the museum grew rapidly. It was one of the first museums in the United States to merge indoor and outdoor wildlife exhibits with an interactive living history program. In 1989, a new high desert history wing was added to the museum. It became the Earle A. Chiles Spirit of the West Center, providing space for a series of western history dioramas as well as several rooms for temporary exhibits. In 1991, another wing was built to house an extensive collection of Native American artifacts donated to the museum by Doris Swayze Bounds. By that time, the museum was hosting approximately 100,000 visitors annually.\\"Ailing founder unable to work at Bend museum\\", Eugene Register-Guard, Eugene, Oregon, July 8, 1996, p. 3C.\\"Donald M. Kerr leaves an impressive legacy\\", The Bulletin, Bend, Oregon, February 8, 2015, p. F2. In the early 1990s, Kerr served on the board of directors for the Mid- Oregon Indian Historical Society as well as Oregon‚Äôs State Parks and Recreation Commission. In 1999, Oregon State University honored Kerr with the university‚Äôs Distinguished Service Award for his vision and leadership in establishing the High Desert Museum.  Illness and death  In 1995, Kerr was infected with a viral form of encephalitis. The source of the infection was probably a small cut from the talons of a great horned owl that Kerr had been working with near the museum. After the infection, Kerr had trouble communicating and then began losing muscular coordination. He never recovered, eventually becoming an invalid. A year later, Kerr step down from his position as the museum's president due to his illness. While he was unable to participate in the High Desert Museum's day-to-day operations, Kerr remained interested in the institution and its mission. Kerr died on February 4, 2015 in Bend, Oregon. A public memorial service for Kerr was held at the High Desert Museum on March 7, 2015.  Legacy  In 2001, the museum named its new $1,200,000 birds of prey center in his honor.\\"High Desert Museum Facilities Timeline 1982-2010,\\" High Desert Museum Interpreter's Guide, High Desert Museum, Bend, Oregon, 2013.

It was notable as a publisher of inexpensive paperback books which were written, illustrated, published and printed in Australia, and sold to commuters at bookstalls in railway stations and elsewhere in New South Wales. History The company was founded as the Sydney Bookstall Company by Henry Lloyd (ca.1847 ‚Äì 24 September 1897) of \\"Linden Hall\\", Annandale, New South Wales around 1880 as a newsagent. Its first foray into publishing may have been racebooks (form guides or programmes) for the Hawkesbury Race Club around 1886. A. C. Rowlandson (15 June 1865 ‚Äì 15 June 1922) joined as a tram ticket seller in 1883 and built a strong interest in the business, which he bought from Henry Lloyd's widow. The greatest part of the company's business consisted of retailing local, interstate and overseas periodicals, postcards (Neville Cayley produced a series) and stationery from its eight city shops and fifty-odd railway stall outlets, but was important as one of Australia's most successful book publishers and retailers of locally produced paperback books. Considerable effort was put into the artwork of the paperbacks, both on their brightly colored covers and the illustrations within. Artists who contributed included J. Muir Auld, Percy Benison, L. H. Booth, Norman Carter, H. W. Cotton, John P. Davis, Ambrose Dyson, Will Dyson, Tom Ferry, A. J. Fisher, Harry Garlick, C. H. Hunt, Ben Jordan, Harry Julius, George W. Lambert, Fred Leist, Norman Lindsay, Lionel Lindsay Percy Lindsay, Ruby Lindsay, Vernon Lorimer, David Low, Hugh Maclean, Frank P. Mahony, Claude Marquet, R. H. Moppett, Charles Nuttall, G. C. Pearce, James Postlethwaite, L. L. Roush, James F. Scott, Sydney Ure Smith, D. H. Souter, Percy Spence, Martin Stainforth, Alf Vincent and Harry J. Weston. On Rowlandson's death, Reg. Wynn (ca.1866 ‚Äì 17 December 1925) took over as managing director, and W. A. Crew was circulation manager. The company erected a large building at the corner of Market Street and Castlereagh Street. Reg. Wynn was succeeded by Paul Dowling. With the onset of World War II, imports of comic books was severely restricted, which opened the market, previously swamped by the U.S. and British houses, to anyone who could provide a quality product, and NSW Bookstall was ideally placed to publish and distribute such work. Tony Rafty, Will Donald, Tom Hubble, Noel Cook and Terry Powis were among the more successful artists, and the partnership of Brodie Mack and writer Peter Amos (real name Archie E. Martin) produced some excellent work for NSW Bookstall.Ryan, John Panel by Panel : an illustrated history of Australian Comics Cassell Australia 1979 By 1949, the opportunity provided by wartime shortages no longer applied, and Australia was once again flooded with excess overseas production.

She pursued legal action for enforcement of Japan's Equal Opportunities law and obtained recognition from the government that maternal harassment is illegal. She was a 2015 winner of the US State Department's International Women of Courage Award. Biography Sayaka Osakabe was born in Japan in 1978. She was working as a magazine editor when she became pregnant. Rather than approve shorter working hours, her boss tried to pressure her to quit her job. After suffering two miscarriages, Osakabe asked for approved leave of absence should she become pregnant again and was denied. Osakabe quit her job under duress and pursued her case with a labor tribunal. In June, 2014, she won her case and formed a support group called Matahara Net, using a portmandeau of the English words \\"maternity and harassment\\" to create the name, which has now become a legal term. The World Economic Forum ranks Japan 104th in the world in workplace equality and official labor statistics show one in four working women have experienced maternity harassment. Though Japanese law guarantees women the right to seek less physically demanding roles during pregnancy and allows 14 weeks of maternity leave or parental leave, for either parent, in conjunction with childbirth, many women fail to utilize the guarantees due to perceived job insecurity. On 18 September 2014 Matahara members attended a trial at the Supreme Court in support of another woman undergoing a similar situation. The woman was demoted by her hospital employer during her pregnancy. A lower court ruling found that it was \\"in the scope of the hospital authority over personnel issues to remove her from her supervisory position,\\" but Japan's Equal Employment Opportunity Law specifically bans demotion due to pregnancy. In a landmark ruling issued 23 October 2014, the Supreme Court of Japan overturned the lower court verdicts and ruled that demotion or other punitive measures based on pregnancy violate the Equal Employment Opportunity Law. Osakabe continues her efforts with Matahara Net promoting the empowerment of women. Her goal is to change public policy and social perception so that all women, rather than an elite few, will have equal work opportunities.

The company was liquidated in 1969. Company history Monte-Sano was founded in 1915 by Vincent Monte-Sano sr. as a women's custom tailoring establishment. Although the Fashion Institute of Technology states that Pruzan joined the house in the 1950s, at which point it became \\"Monte-Sano & Pruzan,\\" one source suggests that Monte-Sano and Pruzan co-founded in 1924, and a number of 1940s articles indicate that the firm was widely known and advertised as Monte-Sano & Pruzan well before the 1950s. via=Newspapers.com In the 1940s the firm became a ready-to-wear house supplying department stores such as Bonwit Teller and Saks Fifth Avenue, although it retained a reputation for superior quality and hand-finishing. Their collections were notable events in the American fashion world. A July 1947 show, falling at the end of the 9th New York press week, was described as \\"well worth waiting for,\\" and reinvigorating the exhausted journalists with new enthusiasm. Seen as particularly significant was the use of draping to define silhouette, rather than padding. In 1966, Monte-Sano and Pruzan were still described as a \\"renowned\\" firm. Monte-Sano Sr. died before 1960. At this time, a guest column by Monte-Sano junior and Pruzan for The Philadelphia Inquirer reported that Monte-Sano's son, also called Vincent, had taken over his father's duties. The junior Monte-Sano was also a talented fashion designer who had been associated with the firm since at least 1940, having established his own business on 1 January 1939. Pruzan retired in 1966, and the firm Monte-Sano & Pruzan was liquidated in 1969. The firm's archives from 1926-1968 are held by the Fashion Institute of Technology. Monte-Sano Jr. acted as a spokesman for the fashion industry throughout the 1960s and by 1971 had become President of the New York Couture Business Council, an organization which promoted the American fashion industry. In 1975 it was noted that Monte- Sano junior ran two companies specialising in coats and raincoats, called 'Main Street' and 'Bond Street.' Awards Along with Clare Potter and Omar Kiam Monte-Sano jointly won the Coty Award in 1946. The Coty jury, chaired that year by Wilhela Cushman of Ladies' Home Journal, cited Monte-Sano's dress-like (rather than tailored) coats and suits as of particular significance, noting their use of white wool and officer styling. Monte-Sano also won the Neiman Marcus Fashion Award in 1952, and the Silk Salute Award in 1954. In 1952, the firm took on a French emigre, Jacques Tiffeau as a pattern- cutter while financing his evening tuition. Tiffeau eventually became chief stylist for Monte-Sano & Pruzan, and in 1958, he and Pruzan's daughter Beverley Busch launched a parallel fashion label, Tiffeau & Busch. Tiffeau went on to win several awards whilst working for both fashion houses concurrently, including a Coty Award in 1960, a 1962 Cotton Fashion Award, and the 1964 International Designers Award, along with his own Neiman Marcus Fashion Award in 1966.

(Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division), revolving around the character of Phil Coulson and his team of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents as they deal with Skye's new abilities, while Lance Hunter learns of a new S.H.I.E.L.D. faction, and Grant Ward reappears with the unpredictable Agent 33. It is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), sharing continuity with the films of the franchise. The episode was written by Brent Fletcher, and directed by Jesse Bochco. Clark Gregg reprises his role as Coulson from the film series, and is joined by series regulars Ming-Na Wen, Brett Dalton, Chloe Bennet, Iain De Caestecker, Elizabeth Henstridge, Nick Blood, and Adrianne Palicki. Maya Stojan guest stars Agent 33, while recurring guest star Edward James Olmos is introduced. \\"Love in the Time of Hydra\\" originally aired on ABC on March 24, 2015, and according to Nielsen Media Research, was watched by 4.29 million viewers. Plot Former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent 33 was brainwashed by Hydra leader Daniel Whitehall, electrocuted while wearing a nanomask that disguised her as S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Melinda May, and now permanently looks like May, but with a large scar and distorted voice. When Whitehall was killed by S.H.I.E.L.D. Director Phil Coulson, Agent 33 ran away with former Hydra agent and S.H.I.E.L.D. mole, but now free agent, Grant Ward. The two of them kidnap the inventor of the nanomask, who does his best to repair 33‚Äôs, leaving her with the ability to either turn off the mask, or transform it into the appearance of anyone she sees, though turning it off means revealing the scar, and turning it on gives her May‚Äôs voice. Using this technology, 33 and Ward infiltrate the US air force base of Brigadier General Glenn Talbot and break out former high ranking Hydra operative Sunil Bakshi, who had captured 33 for Whitehall originally. Agent Mack introduces Lance Hunter to the leaders of ‚Äúthe real S.H.I.E.L.D.‚Äù, an organization formed by S.H.I.E.L.D. agents who mistrusted former director Nick Fury‚Äôs secrets, and who fear the potential harm caused by Coulson being resurrected by Fury using alien DNA, and Agent Skye having developed incredible abilities thanks to contact with an alien substance. They don‚Äôt want Coulson, whose behaviour they call ‚Äútroubling‚Äù since his resurrection, to be in charge of S.H.I.E.L.D. Hunter‚Äôs ex-wife, Agent Bobbi Morse, agrees that Coulson ‚Äúhas been compromised‚Äù. Morse later attempts to apologize to Hunter for not telling him about the other S.H.I.E.L.D., as they had recently been rekindling their relationship, and then allows him to escape. Agent Anne Weaver calculates that it will take Hunter 12 hours to reach land from the aircraft carrier that serves as their base, and Morse says that it will take only 6 hours for her to take Coulson‚Äôs base. Unaware of everything that is happening, Coulson takes Skye to a safe house after May admits that Skye should be removed from S.H.I.E.L.D. Coulson gives Skye a pair of gloves designed by Agent Jemma Simmons that are intended to negate her abilities, which create earthquakes. Coulson explains to her that though she may have new powers, she is still the same person to him. He then returns to S.H.I.E.L.D., leaving Skye to adjust to her new status quo. In an end tag, 33 and Ward learn of her past, including that her name is Kara, before brainwashing Bakshi themselves.

Featuring an uninterrupted seven minute long shot, the episode garnered critical acclaim from critics and fans and is considered one of the best episodes of Always Sunny. Contrary to popular belief, the episode is not a tribute to Birdman, but in fact, pays homage to HBO's True Detective.  Plot  Charlie gets tipped off that the health inspector is coming to do a surprise inspection of Paddy's Pub, alerting Frank and rushing back to the bar, only to discover the gang is in the midst of an ill-fated chicken and air mile steak scam. Dennis is painting a sign for Carmine's: A Place for Steaks and Dee and Mac are attempting to wrangle chickens for the fraudulent scheme. Charlie deduces that the gang plans to contaminate steaks with chicken feathers by rubbing live chickens all over them. While the plan is underway, Frank reveals he flushed his shoes down the toilet. Charlie begins barking orders to the gang, demanding they move all of the chickens into the back office. Charlie works on digging Frank's shoes out of the toilet and hides the glory hole in the men's bathroom. The bar suddenly loses power due to the vacuum sealer being used for the scam. Charlie tells Dennis to use the machine to package lemons and limes. Charlie and Dee go to the basement to test the carbon monoxide detector. To Dee's horror, it begins going off ‚Äî Charlie explains he blocks the vents to fill the basement with hazardous gases to clear out the rodents. The steak delivery truck arrives and the gang learns that Dee has inadvertently ordered considerably more steaks than they had planned. Charlie has Dee pretend Paddy's Pub is a real restaurant, orders Mac and Dennis to remove the Carmine's sign and gets Frank to move the truck out of the way while the delivery man is distracted. Charlie leads the delivery man to the back alley under the conceit that it's patio seating. When the health inspector arrives, Dennis poses as a bartender while Charlie confidently gives her a tour of the premises. Through a series of quick- thinking gambits, he's able to successfully pass off the bar as being in a clean and orderly condition. The rest of the gang was also able to successfully get the delivery driver to take back the chicken feather-filled steaks. Charlie is excited about getting a passing grade, but the rest of the gang reveals that they care more about the scheme than passing. Production Charlie Day's Charlie Kelly is the central figure in \\"Charlie Work\\". Day also co-wrote the episode. The episode was written by Charlie Day, Glenn Howerton and Rob McElhenney. Howerton said the production team was \\"pretty inspired‚Äù by the bravado of True Detective and found an episode that's served by the approach. The episode's similarity to Birdman with jazz score and continuous tracking shot was entirely coincidental. \\"We did it like Birdman, even though we didn‚Äôt know about Birdman,\\" director Matt Shakman observed. The ten minute continuous long shot took a lot of preparation and technical effects to pull off. \\"It was a huge logistical challenge...It's a lot of visual effects to kind of merge things‚Äîthe front of the pub is a location in downtown L.A., the interior is a set on stage at Fox and some of those sets don't even link up,\\" Shakman explained. \\"So we had to come up with some trickery and we redesigned our sets so that certain things could be done in the flow.\\" \\"The sets on stage are only one level, so every time we go to the basement, there is a camera trick.\\" Shakman noted. \\"Some are simple‚Äìwhere we pan past the brick wall and hide the cut or go through a pool of darkness‚Äìor where we are more ambitious and use green screen (coming back into the bar from the basement for instance was a blend of a shot that panned into a green screen with a shot of the keg room that continued the motion),\\" Shakman noted. \\"The stage sets that are contiguous are the bathroom, main pub interior, back office, and keg room. The bathroom wasn‚Äôt originally connected but we made it connect for this episode. For this episode we also built a partial back alley on stage. There‚Äôs a back alley location in downtown L.A. that we usually go to. We used the real downtown location for when the delivery guy is first seated and Charlie sees DeVito running away. I wanted that to be the actual place so the audience wouldn‚Äôt doubt the veracity when we used the stage set for later scenes: Charlie arguing with Dee about moving the dumpster and checking in with the inspector in the alley. Going from the interior bar set to the real alley required some green screen and a few camera tricks‚Äìgoing into a wall as Charlie passes, and then coming off the wall on location to reveal the real exterior alley, etc.\\" Reception \\"Charlie Work\\" is considered to be one of the best Always Sunny episodes. As of September 27, 2017 the episode held an IMDB user rating of 9.8, the highest for the series. \\"On a technical level, it's a marvel, as well as a creative look at the genuine odd jobs that Charlie does behind the scenes to protect his friends' livelihoods...\\" observed Rolling Stone's Noel Murray. Matt Fowler of IGN gave the episode a 10, saying \\"Charlie Work\\" \\"was one of the best episodes the show's ever produced. A fast, frantic laugh-fest featuring outstanding work from Charlie Day.\\" Dennis Perkins of The A.V. Club also praised the episode, saying that \\"Charlie Day's ability to let Charlie's demons peep through his excitable dialogue is one of Sunny‚Äôs chief assets, and Day's performance here is pure exhilaration as he wrangles: crates of chickens, 4000 steaks, a clogged toilet, a disabled carbon monoxide detector, a hungry and confused truck driver, a repeatedly blown fuse, a painted Frank blowing a recorder, Mac grunting and apologizing at just the right time, and two separate carjackings to make everything turn out all right.\\" References External links * Category:It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia episodes Category:2015 American television episodes ","title":"Charlie Work"},{"id":"45666321","text":"Anastasios (Tasos) Nerantzis (; born 3 October 1944) is a Greek attorney and politician. A co-founder of the New Democracy party, he was a long-standing member of the Hellenic Parliament, governor of Samos and Lesbos prefectures, and held various posts as deputy minister in the first Karamanlis government (2004‚Äì07). Having dropped out of the Hellenic Parliament in 2014, he remains Secretary-General of the Interparliamentary Assembly on Orthodoxy. Biography Born and raised in Nikaia near Piraeus, Nerantzis was the Greek junior champion of 1958 in table tennis and a leading member of the Greek scout movement. In 1961, he got involved with right-wing National Radical Union's youth organisation EREN. Studying law at Athens University, he was elected chairman of the Student Union of Nikaia and Korydallos. Following the 1974 collapse of the Greek military junta Nerantzis became a founding member of New Democracy and with the first election was rightaway elected a member of the Hellenic Parliament representing the suburban Piraeus B constituency. From 1978 until 1981, he would serve as the parliament's Secretary-General, and in 1994, he was elected a member of New Democracy's Central and Executive Committees. He didn't return to parliament before November 1989, but would remain a Member of the Hellenic Parliament for seven consecutive terms, from 1993 until 2014. Under prime minister Kostas Karamanlis, Nerantzis held various vice-ministerial posts. Deputy of Development minister Dimitris Sioufas, he was involved in the Turkey‚ÄìGreece gas pipeline completed in 2007. In the 2007‚Äì09 period, he was the 3rd Deputy Speaker of the Hellenic Parliament representing his party's parliamentary group. A long-standing delegate of the Hellenic Parliament to the Interparliamentary Assembly on Orthodoxy (I.A.O.), Nerantzis in 2010 was elected Alternate Secretary. In 2012 he was promoted to the post of the transnational organization's Secretary- General. Following a 2010 visit to the Armenian Orthodox, separatist Nagorno- Karabakh region, the government of Azerbaijan declared him a persona non grata. Positions and controversy Compulsory voting In the 2000‚Äì2004 term, Nerantzis was a member of the Committee for the Revision of the Constitution. In the debate on abolishing administrative sanctions to enforce compulsory voting, he was cited to be the only member objecting to the abolition on the grounds that this would render compulsory voting, which he strongly defended, a pure \\"academicism, a light that does not shine, a fire that gives no heat.\\" Nikoloudis Report When in his last parliamentary term (2012‚Äì14), Nerantzis was elected president of the parliament's Special Permanent Committee on Institutions and Transparency, he was involved in several controversies. After he had been criticized for procedural irregularities in late 2013, in early 2014 he was accused by the opposition for withholding the \\"Nikoloudis Report\\" from the parliament. The report named after Cassation Court investigator Panagiotis Nikoloudis listed 413 persons indicted for tax evasion and money laundering, including a number of local and regional government officials. While Nerantzis first argued that the list didn't specify names and that no members of the Hellenic Parliament were affected, Syriza MP Zoi Konstantopoulou's public attacks finally forced him to reveal the list. Homophobia controversy In a parliamentary debate in September 2014, Nerantzis railed against the adoption of an anti- discrimination bill aimed at protective rights for same-sex couples. \\"Since the third century marriage has been defined only between man and woman. As such, there is no place for civil unions in Greece.\\" he said, comparing homosexuality with paedophilia and brothels \\"allowing bestiality\\".

The film stars Logan Marshall-Green, Tammy Blanchard, Michiel Huisman, and Emayatzy Corinealdi. The Invitation premiered March 13, 2015, at the SXSW film festival, and began a limited release on April 8, 2016, and through video on demand, by Drafthouse Films. Responding to an invitation from his ex-wife, a man brings his girlfriend to a dinner party. There, he relives the trauma of their child's death and becomes suspicious that his ex-wife has ulterior motives for inviting him.  Plot  Will drives with his girlfriend Kira to the Hollywood Hills home of his ex- wife Eden, who is hosting a dinner party with her new husband David. Will and Eden divorced after the accidental death of their young son Ty. Eden met David at a grief support group, and this would be the first time their friends have seen the couple in over two years. David and Eden's other dinner guests are Tommy, Tommy's boyfriend Miguel, and friends Ben, Claire, and Gina. Gina mentions that her boyfriend Choi is running late. Eden introduces Sadie, a girl she and David met while in Mexico who is now staying with them. Throughout the evening, Will wanders his former home and relives memories, including Eden's attempted suicide. In the kitchen, Will witnesses Eden slaps Ben when he makes a joke about her ideas on expelling pain. Eden and David's friend Pruitt arrives and Will notices that David locked the front door. Will later goes for firewood and sees Eden hiding a pill bottle through her bedroom window. David and Eden tell their guests about a group they joined, along with Pruitt and Sadie, called \\"The Invitation\\" that works through grief using spiritual philosophy. David shows everyone a video in which group leader Dr. Joseph comforts a dying woman as she takes her last breaths. The group play a game of \\"I Want\\" where Eden kisses Ben, and Pruitt confesses to accidentally killing his wife and doing time in prison. David tries to convince an unsettled Claire not to leave, and Will challenges him. Claire leaves, accompanied by Pruitt, whose car is blocking Claire's. Will watches Pruitt take Claire out of sight to talk to her, and David confronts Will about being too suspicious. Peering through a cracked door, Will sees Sadie make odd faces into a mirror, when suddenly Sadie makes eye contact with Will. She follows him outside and propositions him by the pool. Will discusses with Tommy about the odd atmosphere in the house, while Tommy assures him it's natural to feel strange revisiting the house and Will is brave for even showing up. He returns to the party while Will stays outside. Will finally gets a cell phone signal and finds a voice mail from Choi indicating that he was at Eden and David's doorstep before the other guests. Presuming that David and Eden must have done something to Choi, Will publicly confronts the couple about their strange behaviour and links to the cult. Choi enters unexpectedly, explaining that he was called away by work. Will is embarrassed, but the others assume his residual grief over Ty's death is causing him to behave irrationally. Will finds a laptop with information about The Invitation with an ambiguous message from Dr Joseph. David lights a red lantern in the garden and pours drinks for the guests to toast, but Will smashes the glasses, fearing they are poisoned. Sadie attacks Will who inadvertently knocks her unconscious in the scuffle. Gina, who had sipped her drink before Will's intervention, collapses and dies. David, Pruitt, and a recovered Sadie attack the guests, killing Miguel, Choi, and Ben. Will, Kira, and Tommy flee and hide in the house. Will overhears David telling Eden that what they are doing is the only way they can leave the earth and be freed from their pain. Will retrieves a fireplace poker from Sadie while she lies dying, having been fatally wounded by Tommy. Pruitt finds and attacks Will and Kira. The couple overpower him, and Kira beats him to death. Eden shoots Will, then shoots herself in the stomach. Tommy attacks David, stabbing him with a knife. Eden apologizes to Will and asks him to take her outside. Kira, Will, and Tommy help carry the dying Eden into the garden, where they hear sirens and see helicopters flying above. Will sees nearby homes with the red lanterns. Will realizes that Los Angeles is erupting in chaos as other cult members throughout the city carry out plans similar to David and Eden's.  Cast   Production  In May 2012, it was announced that Luke Wilson, Zachary Quinto, Topher Grace and Johnny Galecki had initially been scheduled to star in the film, with Karyn Kusama directing from a screenplay written by Phill Hay and Matt Manfredi, and XYZ Films producing the film alongside Martha Griffin, Manfredi and Hay. In July 2014, it was revealed that production on the film had concluded, with Logan Marshall-Green, Michiel Huisman, Emayatzy Corinealdi, Lindsay Burdge, and John Carroll Lynch starring. The Invitation is the second feature to be financed by Gamechanger Films. Kusama was influenced by the slow reveal of Let the Right One In and the unraveling family reunion in Festen. She cited the film's theme as \\"a metaphor for what the nightmare of anxiety really is, which is this irrational sense that people are trying to hurt you somehow\\". Release The film had its world premiere at South by Southwest on March 13, 2015. Shortly after, it was announced Drafthouse Films had acquired distribution rights to the film. The film went on to screen at the London Film Festival on October 9, 2015, and was released on April 8, 2016, in a limited release and through video on demand.  Reception  The Invitation holds an 88% approval rating on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes based on 103 reviews, and has an average rating of 7.57/10. The critical consensus reads: \\"The Invitation makes brilliant use of its tension-rich premise to deliver a uniquely effective ‚Äì and surprisingly clever ‚Äì slow-building thriller.\\" On Metacritic, the film holds a rating of 74 out of 100, based on 21 critics, indicating \\"Generally favorable reviews\\". Justin Chang of Variety wrote, \\"This teasingly effective thriller represents director Karyn Kusama's strongest work in years.\\" Josh Kupecki of The Austin Chronicle said, \\"There are some very interesting ideas about grief, depression, and how we cope with life-changing events in this modern world, but ultimately, the film doesn't offer anything new to the 'dinner party from hell' subgenre.\\" Dominick Suzanne-Mayer of Consequence of Sound rated it A‚àí and wrote, \\"In so many words, The Invitation is supremely well-crafted,\\" while Samuel Zimmerman of Shock Till You Drop said, \\"The Invitation is a startlingly adult thriller that, unlike Eden and her guests, is willing stare down the weight our lives can bear.\\" Peter Martin of Twitch Film intoned, \\"The sincerity and craft on display notwithstanding, the movie achieves a limited, unsettling level, and then stops right there,\\" while Drew Tinnin of Dread Central rated the film 4/5 stars and wrote, \\"The Invitation works so well because it taps into our general distrust of the world around us and how our survival instinct has been muted and ignored in order to maintain the appearance of being polite.\\" Matt Donato of We Got This Covered rated the film 2.5/5 stars, writing, \\"The Invitation is a slow, SLOW burn that fails to find the winning ingredient that makes for a perfect dinner party thriller.\\" Heather Wixson of Daily Dead rated it 4.5/5 stars and called it \\"some of the most assuredly confident and nuanced work from [Kusama] to date and one of the most devastating horror films I‚Äôve seen in years.\\"  References   External links  * * Category:2015 films Category:2015 horror films Category:2015 independent films Category:2015 thriller films Category:2015 horror thriller films Category:American films Category:American horror thriller films Category:American independent films Category:English-language films Category:Films about cults Category:Films directed by Karyn Kusama Category:Films scored by Theodore Shapiro Category:Films set in Los Angeles Category:Films shot in Los Angeles ","title":"The Invitation (2015 film)"},{"id":"45666414","text":"Andrusia Lake is a lake in Beltrami County, Minnesota, in the United States.

He had contributed two chapters to the third edition of John Kraus' classic book, \\"Antennas for All Applications\\", published in 2002. Munk received a masters degree in electrical engineering from the Technical University of Denmark and a Ph.D. in electrical engineering from The Ohio State University (OSU) in 1954 and 1968, respectively. He joined the ElectroScience Laboratory in 1964, where he was a professor and later, professor emeritus, until he died.

It was announced on August 2014 and was made available on the same month. In contrast with other dual sim Samsung models, this phone is a part of the high-end \\"S\\" series, this is why it is marketed as a part of the \\"Galaxy S\\" family. Despite being called as a direct successor to the original S Duos 2 phone, external and physical design of the model is identical to the original model, except for the menu button which is now replaced by the recent apps button and also placing emphasis on internal upgrades such as upgraded processor and an updated Android operating system. It is currently available in many Asian countries. Specifications Hardware and Design The design of the S Duos 3 is the same as the design of the S Duos and S Duos 2. It a bit less rounded shape body with chrome finish edgesut the same polycarbonate chassis, faux metal trim and a removable rear cover, with premium texture finished. The S Duos 3 is available in Black, and White frost color finishes. The S Duos 3's screen is a 4.0-inch 233p TFT LCD panel, which is the same as that of the S Duos 2, but does not allow for automatic brightness and gamut adjustments due to lacking an ambient sensor like its predecessor. It also has the lack of Proximity Sensor.  Camera  The Galaxy S Duos 3 has a 5-megapixel camera with LED flash and a 0.3-megapixel front-facing camera. The rear camera has 7 shooting modes and can record video in 720p. Unlike entry-level dual SIM models from Samsung, the S Duos 3 like S Duos 2 is active on both SIMs all the time so it is ready to receive calls on either SIM when a call is not already in progress. Optionally it can receive two calls simultaneously, but this requires divert-on-not- reachable to be set up on each number and is subject to availability from the carrier and may incur additional charges. A limitation of the phone is that only one SIM can be active on UMTS (and therefore data) at a time and so it may be unsuitable for certain combinations of networks. The S Duos 3 also contains a 1500mAh Li-Ion removable battery. It lasts 4‚Äì5 hours of heavy usage and just over 3 hours of gaming. Software The S Duos 3 ships with Android 4.4.2 KitKat and Samsung's Updated TouchWiz Essence UX software. The S Duos 3 adds some of Galaxy S4's features such as Samsung proprietary widgets used by models bearing the same version of the OS. Custom ROMs such as AOSP 5.1 and CyanogenMod 12.1 by itigr, are available for updating to Android 5.1.1 Lollipop.

Later it was reorganized and was sent to Extremadura, to one of the last combats of the Civil War in 1939 before the Spanish Republic was defeated by the rebel faction. History First phase and debacle in Aragon The 225th Mixed Brigade was established in August 1937 in Eastern Coastal Spain. Its mission was the Coastal Defence (Defensa de Costas) of the Peninsular shore between Santa Pola and Vinar√≤s in the present- day Valencian Community. The command of the unit was assigned to Infantry Commander Alejandro S√°enz de San Pedro Albarellos, former Captain of the Infantry Regiment Guadalajara 10 (Regimiento Guadalajara n¬∞ 10) which was garrisoned in Valencia at the time of the July 1936 coup. At the end of February 1938 the 225th Mixed Brigade was placed under the 72nd Division of the XVIII Army Corps of the Levantine Army (Ej√©rcito de Levante) which was being reorganized close to the Teruel front line. On 11 March 1938, at the time of the during the rebel offensive in Aragon, the brigade was sent to cover the Escatr√≥n and Caspe sector. During the Nationalist attacks in this arid area of Aragon the 225th Mixed Brigade was so badly shattered and had suffered such grievous losses, that it was no longer operational and had to be disbanded by the high command. Reorganization and end in Extremadura Shortly thereafter the 225th Mixed Brigade was reorganized in Libros, by the Turia River, within the 64th Division of the XIX Army Corps. The brigade's new commander was Militia Major Juan Serrano Jim√©nez, for its former commander S√°enz de San Pedro was promoted to the command of the 64th Division. The 225th Mixed Brigade was sent to defend the western end of the Eastern Front, where there was a lull in the battles against the rebels, until 25 July when the Spanish Republican strategic operations saw a shift with the onset of the Battle of the Ebro. On 17 December the brigade was transferred westwards to Extremadura in preparation of the Battle of Pe√±arroya, one of the last battles of the war. It was in cantonment in Jamilena and Torredonjimeno and placed in the 72nd Division of the General Reserve of the GERC or Group of Central Region Armies (Grupo de Ej√©rcitos de la Regi√≥n Central). In the ensuing battle the 225th Mixed Brigade was active both within and outside of the pocket, reinforcing the thrust of the XXII Army Corps. Between 17 and 23 January 1939 it launched a series of bold attacks in the Sierra de Mesegara and Sierra del Torozo ranges of La Serena area that made the brigade suffer a very high number of casualties. The much battered 225th Mixed Brigade remained in the Extremaduran Front until the end of the war though.

The aim of the operation, as the previous one, was to encircle Aleppo and cut rebel supply lines into the city, thus besieging rebel-held areas.  The operation  Battle for the north-eastern approach On 7 December, the Army captured the Breij area, on the northeastern outskirts of the city, and advanced towards the al-Owayji area to the west and the al-Enzarat area to the south.24 fighters of the Islamic battalions and 20 members of the regime forces killed in Aleppo today The next day, the Army moved around Handarat and captured the al-Hajal and al- Majbal districts overlooking Hanano, Haydariya and Duwayr al-Jandul. After this, government forces entered the Baya‚Äôadeen district, taking up positions in its southern part. On 11 December, government forces recaptured territory in the Stone Quarries in the southern part of Breij they lost the previous week. The military further advanced past the Stone Quarries and pushed south towards the Hanano district. The fighting over the previous seven days left more than 60 rebels dead, according to a military source. The next day, the Army captured the Wood Factory near the Jandoul roundabout, and established positions near the Saraya Night Club. By the end of the day, the military reportedly had fire control over both the Ba'edin and Jandoul roundabouts on the Castello Road. On 14 December, the Army advanced into and captured the al- Mallah area, with further attempts by the military to capture the area west of al-Mallah and thus finally cut the Castello Road. Two hours later, according to a pro-government source, the Army captured the neighboring Mara‚Äôashli Farms. Government forces also advanced and captured the southern and western parts of the Handarat city district, closing in on Handarat hill which overlooks the Castello Road. 34 rebels and nine soldiers were killed during the day. The advances brought government forces within a few hundred meters of surrounding Aleppo. More fighting the next day left 14 rebels dead, as the Army captured a hill overlooking the rebel supply line. On 17 December, 16 soldiers were killed in fighting in the al-Mallah area where the rebels captured eight buildings, while the Army recaptured Aghob hill and the al- Fawaz area of Breij. Al-Arabiya reported government forces were close to capturing Handarat hill and completing the siege, while the pro-government Al- Masdar News agency reported the troops had already captured all of the remaining hills along the Castello Road and were focusing on the main roundabout. At the end of the day, the military made another advance in the Handarat area and by 19 December had captured all or a part of the Handarat district. On 22 December, the rebels recaptured the industrial plants in the northern part of the Handarat district, however they lost it again one week later after an assault by Army and Hezbollah troops. By 1 January 2015, the military had captured 16 plants in the Al-Shahel area of the Handarat district. Rebel counter-attack On 5 January, the rebels recaptured the Majbal (Sawmills) area of al-Brej after fighting that killed or wounded no less than 20 soldiers. They also captured the southern entrance of the stone quarries known as al-Misat, forcing government troops to retreat to the north. Later, it was reported the rebels managed to seize the al-Manasher al-Breij area and were trying to advance and take control over al-Brej Hill with which they could seize the military supply road from the Aleppo Central Prison to the Handarat and al-Mallah areas. The next day, the rebels reportedly took control over the al-Akhdar Mosque, a mill and the al-Tawattor al-Aali area of al-Brej. On 8 January, the Army and pro-government militias conducted a counter-attack against areas seized by the rebels in previous days. On 22 January, the rebels reportedly advanced in al-Mallah and Sifat areas and two days later took control over some positions on al-Brej Hill. They also managed to advance in the al-Brej area. On 3 February, the rebels captured al-Misat hill at the north-eastern entrance to the city. However, the next day government forces recaptured the area after opposition fighters were forced to retreat due to heavy artillery fire. Army assault on the northern villages On 16 February, a large military armored convoy arrived in Aleppo, as reinforcements from Hama, to complete the siege of the city. The next morning, government forces launched an offensive from Sifat. The battle started after hundreds of government fighters infiltrated the three villages of Bashkuwi, Ratian and Hardatain before dawn and encircled rebel positions in them. At 06:00 hours, the fighting started and in less than half an hour the Army and NDF captured Hardatain, while resistance continued in the other two villages. Still, around noon, both Bashkuwi and Ratian had also been captured and the Army blocked the main rebel supply route leading into Aleppo city. During the attack, according to the SOHR, 36 civilians and 13 rebels were massacred by the Army and Hezbollah. The Army then advanced from Ratian towards Bayanoon and was fighting on the road between the two villages. At the same time, the military launched a push in two areas of Aleppo city itself and advanced, capturing many buildings in the Zahraa district. Fighting also reached the village of Ma'arasta, west of Hardatain, and the Army captured the village of Dwer al-Zaytoun. At this point, the rebels launched a counter- attack to recapture the ground they lost and Hardatain was contested once again, while clashes continued near Ratian. The initial advance brought government troops to within four kilometers of the government-held towns of Nubl and Al-Zahraa, which had been besieged by rebel forces for almost two years. In the evening, a group of 80 soldiers managed to reach the two towns. The offensive aimed to completely surround Aleppo within a week. Early on 18 February, the rebels recaptured Ratian, or at least most of it, while fighting continued around Bashkuwi and Hardatain. Later, a military source reported the Army captured Kafr Tunah, east of Dwer al-Zaytoun. The next day, the rebels recaptured most of Hardatain. However, clashes in the village continued and government fighters were resupplied by helicopters. Fighting was also still ongoing near Ratian and Bashkuwi and in Dwer al-Zaytoun. On 20 February, according to SOHR, the rebels captured the Al-Mallah area, while clashes persisted around Bashkuwi, Ratian and Hardatain. According to Al Mayadeen, the Army still controlled most of the area, with rebels capturing only two out of 48 farms at Al-Mallah. Later, SOHR reported more fighting at Al-Mallah, while in the evening the rebels fully secured Hardatain. On 21 February, correspondent Elijah J. Magnier confirmed that all villages but Bashkuy were recaptured by the rebels, with preparations being made by the Army to inject more troops into the battle. At the same time, the Army activated the front south of Aleppo city by transferring troops from the province of Hama. The Army captured Al-Qalba‚Äôat village in the Khanesser area and a number of buildings at the Al-Zaytuni Chicken Farms near Mount Azzan. The four-day battle in the northern countryside of Aleppo left 152 soldiers and 131 rebels dead,101 killed (17‚Äì18 February), 17 killed (19 February), 13 killed (20 February), total of 131 reported killed while 67 soldiers and 40 rebels were captured. Rebel assault on Handarat On 9 March, opposition forces launched an assault on Handarat, north of Aleppo, after reportedly noticing confusion in the ranks of government troops following the February fighting. It was initially reported opposition forces captured Handarat, north of Aleppo. However, later it was reported by opposition sources the rebels managed to capture only 40‚Äì50% of the village, while the Army remained in control of the northern portion of Handarat. A military source stated they still controlled 80% of Handarat. On 18 March, after almost 10 days of fighting, the military fully expelled the rebels from Handarat and re- established control of the village. They then reportedly pushed back into the eastern part of al-Mallah farms. According to a military source, 76 government fighters and 304 rebels were killed during the previous two weeks of fighting at Handarat and Bashkuy. The next day, government forces also recaptured al- Madafa hill and a farm around Handarat, as well as the Halabi Farms and Nuqat al-Isamat, west of Handarat. On 20 March, the military reportedly captured the Al-Ghannam Farms, west of the Halabi Farms. On 23 March, fighting erupted around Dwer al-Zaytoun and Bashkuy after a Turkish suicide car-bomber from the al-Nusra front detonated himself in the area. The rebels reportedly advanced near Dwer al-Zaytoun.Aleppo: Jabhat Al-Nusra Suicide Bombing Leads to Fierce Clashes in the Northÿ¨ÿ®Ÿáÿ© ÿßŸÑŸÜÿµÿ±ÿ© ÿ™ŸÅÿ¨ÿ± ÿπÿ±ÿ®ÿ© ŸÖŸÅÿÆÿÆÿ© Ÿàÿßÿ¥ÿ™ÿ®ÿßŸÉÿßÿ™ ÿπŸÜŸäŸÅÿ© ŸÅŸä ÿØŸàŸäÿ± ÿßŸÑÿ≤Ÿäÿ™ŸàŸÜ ŸàŸÖÿ≠Ÿäÿ∑ ÿ®ÿßÿ¥ŸÉŸàŸä ÿ¥ŸÖÿßŸÑ ÿ≠ŸÑÿ® By the end of March, the government offensive was considered to had fizzled out.Syria rebels take strategic town of Idlib  See also  * Battle of Aleppo (2012‚Äì2016)  References  Category:Aleppo in the Syrian Civil War Category:Military operations of the Syrian Civil War in 2014 Category:Military operations of the Syrian Civil War in 2015 Category:Military operations of the Syrian Civil War involving Hezbollah Category:Military operations of the Syrian Civil War involving the Syrian government Category:Military operations of the Syrian Civil War involving the Free Syrian Army ","title":"Operation Rainbow (Syrian Civil War)"},{"id":"45666755","text":"The French ship Sophie was a slave vessel launched at Nantes in May 1790.

A small, muscular man, Idzikowski had developed a strong classical ballet technique and was capable of performing virtuosic feats.Beaumont (1926), pp. 2, 4 (technique). With the Diaghilev company, he first assumed roles made famous by Vaslav Nijinsky,Oxford Reference: \\"Though unusually short he was a dazzling virtuoso with an extraordinary jump, and took over many of Nijinski's roes... .\\"Garafola (2005): L√©onide Massine was also a \\"a replacement for Nijinsky\\" (p.60). Massine the dancer \\"took over Nijinsky's roles in Petrouchka, Cl√©op√¢tra, Sch√©h√©razade, and L'Apr√®s-midi d'un Faune\\" (p. 185). its former star performer and a world celebrity.Moore (2014), p.5: \\"Vaslav Nijinsky, possibly the greatest genius of twentieth century dance\\".Cf. Nijinska (1981), pp. 472-487: Nijinsky's departure from Ballets Russes in 1913. Thus, in choreographer Michel Fokine's ballets Idzikowski danced: the role of Harlequin in Le Carnaval; in Petrushka, the title role; and in Le Spectre de la Rose, the Spirit.Beaumont (1926), p.2: Idzikowski's first roles at Ballets Russes: Carnaval, Petrushka, Rose.Stanislas Idzikowski at Cecchetti website: his roles.Balanchine (1954), per Nijinsky's roles in Le Carnaval p.79, Petrouchka p.268, Le Spectre de la Rose p.356. Yet their interpretive approach could differ. As Harlequin, Nijinsky expressed a \\"spirit of subtle mockery and cynical worldly wisdom\\". While Idzikowski, according to Beaumont, danced the part with a \\"mischievous certainty, but always good natured\\".Beaumont (1926), p.3 (quotes per Harlequin in Le Carnaval). > These roles \\"previously seemed the particular property of that great genius > Nijinsky. Few things are more unnerving to a dancer than to execute a dance > which the public is accustomed to see performed by someone else.\\"Beaumont > (1926), p.2 (quote per Nijinsky).David Adams: At first many saw Idzikowski > as \\"the understudy to Nijinsky, but [he] was as good, in every way, as the > great man himself.\\" Idzikowshi was particularly celebrated for his phenomenal elevation and dazzling batterie.Beaumont (1926), pp. 2, 4, 5: classical ballet technique.Oxford Reference: technique.Grant (1950, 1982), elevation p.45 (\\"the height attained in springing steps [jumps]\\"), batterie pp. 22-23 (\\"legs beat together, or one leg beats against the other\\"), beats p.23 (\\"during a jump by striking the calves sharply together\\"). As before him Cecchetti in 1890, and Nijinsky in 1907, Idzikowski in 1921 performed as the Blue Bird in the pas de deux from The Sleeping Beauty of Tchaikovsky.Balanchine (1954), pp. 336-354: The Sleeping Beaty; at p.353: Nijinsky in 1911 in the pas de deus [as the Blue Bird]; at 336, 475: Idzikowski as Blue Bird in London 1921; at 348: the Blue Bird role.Nijinska (1982), pp. 207-210: Nijinsky as Blue Bird in 1907 at Maryinsky Theatre, Sankt-Peterberg; Cecchetti as Blue Bird in 1890.Beaumont (1926), p.4: Idzikowski and La Belle au Bois Dormant, p. 3: La Princesse Echant√©e.Garafola (1989), pp. 342-344, at 343 (Lydia Lopokova and Idzikowski in The Sleeping Princess), cf. pp. 408-409.Greskovic (2000), p.71, the 1890 choreography for Cecchetti's Blue Bird was likely devised by the dancer- teacher himself.\\" Cf. 291-292, 425. \\"[His] most famous role was the Blue Bird in The Sleeping Princess of 1921\\" premiering in London.Koegler (1977), quote. Possessed of a strong sense of comedy and drama, he also became known for the character roles he created in the ballets of L√©onide Massine, including the role of the Cat in Kikimora (1916), Battista in Les Femmes de Bonne Humeur (1917), the Spark (Dandy) in Le Tricorne (1919), the Snob in La Boutique Fantasque (1919),Massine (1968), pp. 135-136. The choreographer Massine provides this description of a scene from the ballet La Boutique Fantasque where toys come to life. Idzi played the 'snob': > \\"When he was given a slice of melon, Idzikowski, in a brilliant extempore > piece of miming, ate it as if playing on a mouth-organ. To shatter his > conceit I made the melon-seller knock him over with the barrow, but > springing into the air, he came to rest with a bow and one hand raised to > twirl his mustache.\\" Balanchine (1954), p.58, describes the same scene in another version: a melon hawker slices a piece for the snob who soon \\"trips over the hawker, only to rise again in a mechanical miracle.\\" and Corviello in Pulcinella (1920).Beaumont (1926), pp. 3-5 (the five ballet roles).Garafola (1989), pp. 406-408 (the five ballets, plus The Sleeping Princess). Kikimora in 1917 incorporated into Contes Russes (p.406) aka Children's Tales (p.336).Oxford Reference (the five ballets). Among his other original roles was the Cock on his perch in Le Renard (1923), choreographed by Bronislava Nijinska.Baer (1986), p.74 (Le Renard, music by Igor Stravinsky), cf. pp. 29-30. For Ballets Russes' Les F√¢cheux (1924), \\"Stanislas Idzikowski the bravura dancer [was] cast by Nijinska as Lysandre the dancing master.\\" Yet because a dispute arose over the costume's wet dye, Diaghilev asked Nijinska to dance this amusing character, originally created by Moli√®re (Baer, p.41).Garafola (1989), p.409: Nijinska as the Fox, Idzikowski as the Cock, in Le Renard (1923). Having briefly left Ballets Russes in 1924, Idzikowski in 1925 rejoined the company.Oxford Reference. He and Lydia Lopokova left He danced with Alexandra Danilova in its production of Jack in the Box, with music by the late Erik Satie, choreography by George Balanchine.Koegler (1977), p.277: Jack in the Box.Garafola (1989), p.409: \\"Jack in the Box\\" with Danilova and Idzikowski.The Balanchine Catalogue website. He created the role of the Puppet.Kochno (1970), p.243, Jack in the Box. When Sergei Diaghilev unexpectedly died in 1929, however, the ballet world lost not only the gifted impresario, but also his company as \\"the Ballets Russes collapsed\\".Garafola (1989), pp. 157 (quote). Diaghilev's death caught the company \\"unawares\\" and resulted in its \\"demise\\" (p.376).Koegler (1977), p. 50: For 20 years Diaghilev led \\"the ballet of his time in all its forms, until his death in 1929, after which [his] company dissolved.\\" Soir√©es de Paris, Vic-Wells, other posts Lydia Lopokova in 1922 In 1924, both on leave from Ballets Russes, Idzikowski appeared with his frequent dance partner Lydia Lopokova at the London Coliseum.Oxford Preference: \\"He left the [Ballets Russes] company in 1924 to dance with Lopokova at the Coliseum and with Comte de Beaumont's ‚ÄòSoir√©es de Paris‚Äô.\\"The New York Times obituary: paired with Lopokova.Cf., Garafola (1989), p.216: Coliseum. She also was drawn to Soir√©es de Paris, a new dance enterprise organized by √âtienne de Beaumont.A Beaumont different from the co-author of Cecchetti book. It was a potential competitor of Diaghilev. \\"Artistic considerations\\" caused Lopokova to respond \\"with enthusiasm to Massine's offer of a place in his new company.\\" Idzikowski also signed. Massine at Soir√©e de Paris wrote choreography for new ballets, including Mercure. Picasso designed decor. Staged in Paris, it was the Soir√©e's first and only season.Garafola (2005), pp. 171 (quotes), 172 (\\"Stas\\", too), 173-178 (Massine), 175, 176, 177 (\\"Stas\\"). Soir√©es de Paris was similar to Ballets Su√©dois, both being newly founded competitors of Ballets Russes (pp. 171, 177).Kochno (1970), pp. 256-257 (re Mercure). Though friends Diaghilev looked on \\"Beaumont as a rival\\". Besides his closest collaborators, \\"The leading dancers of the new company were Lopoukhova and Idzikowski and the ballet master was Massine, all deserters from his own group\\" (.p.256). Soir√©es was short-lived; Mercure then entered Diaghilev's repertoire (p.257).Massine (1968), pp. 158-160, 162. For Soir√©es de Paris, Massine wrote five ballets (p.158), including Mercure (p,159-160). He fails to mention competition with Diaghilev's Ballets Russes.Koegler (1977), p.491: Les Soir√©es de Paris of 1924. \\"As a guest artist with the Vic‚ÄêWells Ballet in the early 1930s, Mr. Idzikowski lent the prestige of his name to the struggling young company that is now Britain's Royal Ballet.\\"The New York Times obituary: quote re Vic-Wells.Oxford Reference: Idikowski as 'guest artist' at Vic-Wells. He developed the lead male role in Les Rendezvous, a ballet-divertissement choreographed by Ashton, mounted in 1933. \\"The leading pair of 'lovers' was performed by Alicia Markova and Stanislas Idzikowski.\\"Grekovic (2000), p.88 (quote re Les Rendezvous).Balanchine (1954), pp. 309-310: Markova and Idzikowski.Koegler (1977), p.439: Idzikowski in Les Rendezvous. The Vic-Wells company was directed by de Valois, an 'alumnus' of Ballets Russes.Garafola (1989), pp. 376-377: Diaghilev alumni. For Vic-Wells, Idzikowski also performed his well- known Blue Bird role in the revised, one-act Aurora's Wedding, and his Harlequin in Carnaval.David Adams, \\"Stanislas Idzikowski\\".Cf., Baer (1986), pp. 28, 29: Nijinska's 1922 choreography of the one-act ballet Aurora's Wedding from the five-act The Sleeping Princess. From 1928 to 1930 Idzikowski had managed and directed his own ballet company.Oxford Reference: Stanislas Idzikowski. He later associated with the commercial production of films: The Gods Go a-Begging (1934),Cf., Koegler (1977), p.224. Carnival (1935), and Peg of Old Drury (1935).Stanislas Idzikowski at IMDb (3 films). For several years starting in 1939, Idzikowski served as ballet master for Mona Inglesby's International Ballet.The Independent obituary: Mona Inglesby. Book with Beaumont on Cecchetti Cecchetti, c.1900 In 1918 Enrico Cecchetti (1850-1928), by then a renowned dancer, ballet master and pedagogue,Homans (2010), pp. 241-242. Cecchetti had \\"taught most of Diaghilev's [Ballets Russes] dancers' (pp. 291-292).Balanchine (1954), p.471. opened a school in London. Idzikowski, his former student, joined a group of friends and associates in strongly advocating his 'Russo-Italian' method of training students. At Cecchetti's urging, Idzikowski then started to work with the maestro,Cf. Massine (1968), pp. 167-168 (Idzikowski and Cecchetti re the book). and later with the balletomane Cyril W. Beaumont, to preserve and codify the Cecchetti method of teaching. Until then it had been largely developed and handed down orally.\\"Cyril Beaumont\\" at Cechetti website: method's evolution dated back to 1820s and Carlo Blasis. Demonstration of basic positions and exercises were made by Cecchetti and by Idzikowski, with commentary, which were then drawn by Randolph Schwabe and reduced by Beaumont to a written text. The collaboration resulted in the co-authorship by Beaumont and Idzikowski of a technical manual, completed in 1922.Beaumont and Idzikowski (1922, rev'd 1932; reprint 2003).\\"Cyril Beaumont\\" at Cechetti website: a more detailed and slightly different narration of book's composition.\\"Enrico Cecchetti\\" at Cecchetti website.The New York Times obituary: book.Balanchine (1954), p.475: 1922 book. > \\"[E]ach pupil is constructed differently, both physically and > temperamentally, so that each requires adaptations of the lesson in order to > supply his own particular needs.\\" > \\"What then ar the qualifications of an experienced professor?

Later, the London dancer Celia Franca became a dance student of Idzikowsky.Ambrose & Franca (1954, 1974), p. [vii]: \\"This book is dedicated to M. STANISLAS IDZIKOWSKI as a small token of our respect, esteem, and affection by Celia Franca (his grateful pupil), and Kay Ambrose (his sincere admirer).\\" Franca became the first artistic director of the National Ballet of Canada and co-founded the National Ballet School of Canada; both institutions use the Cecchetti method. In 1922 Beaumont moved to found the Cecchetti Society,\\"Cyril Beaumont\\" at Cechetti website. which merged with the ISTD in 1924.Koegler (1977), p.110. As ballet teacher in London Acting as ballet master he had instructed performers in various ballet companies. From 1933 he had taught, eventually from his own dance studio in London. There he was accompanied on piano by his longtime partner Wanda Evina (1891-1966). Since 1916 they had been romantically linked. Evina was British, a professional dancer, and an accomplished pianist.Sokolova (1960, 1989), Wanda Evina: girlfriend of Stanislas in 1916, p.86; Ballets Russes dancer, pp. 102, 136, 229.\\"Stanislas Idzikowski\\" at (Cecchetti website) by Scott. \\"Madame Evina danced with Idzi in the Diaghilev Company\\" and later became the pianist at his studio.

She remembered him as a guest teacher during her early years at Sadler's Wells under Ninette de Valois, which would have been in the mid 1930s: > \\"My favorite was Stanislas Idzikowski, affectionately known as Idzi, a > brilliant dancer who had been with the Diaghilev Ballet. He was diminutive, > dapper, and precise, speaking rather good English with a clipped Polish > accent. Severe but never unkind, he knew exactly what he expected of his > students and explained clearly how to achieve it.\\"Fonteyn (1975, 1976), p. > 52. Following the death of Madame Evina, he retired from ballet at age 72.\\"Stanislas Idzikowski\\" at (Cecchetti website) by Adams. Descriptions of Idzikowski \\"He is quiet, though animated in conversation, but moody and sensitive in the highest degree.\\" \\"In stature he is short... . His torso and limbs are those of an athlete. The muscular development of his calves and thighs is extraordinary. ... [His] cheek bones high... , wavy hair... almost white... , [with] deep set, blue eyes.\\"Beaumont (1926), pp. 2-3. \\"He taught class in a suit with the stiff color, the vest, and spats and street shoes. With all this, he could still do a double tour en l'air and land in a perfect fifth.\\"David Adams, \\"Stanislas Idzikowski\\". \\"How describe those difficult steps performed with an ease which makes them appear elementary to the ordinary spectator, while the professional onlooker, swayed between astonishment and rapture, can scarce believe the evidence of his eyes.\\"Beaumont (1926), p.4, re the ballet Les Sylphides.

She was \\"one of the most widely read women in France\\", and one of the country's most popular women novelists. Biography Born in Pierrebrune, a hamlet of Sainte-Orse, Dordogne in 1841, she transformed \\"Pierrebrune\\" to \\"Peyrebrune\\", making it her family name. She was the daughter of Fran√ßoise Th√©r√®se C√©line Judicis and Georges Johnston, a wealthy local land-owner. She went to Paris after the war of 1870, and she made her literary debut in the magazine Revue des deux Mondes, where many of her novels were serialised. In Paris, she met Ars√®ne Houssaye, who, after having read her Marco manuscript interceded on her behalf with the magazine editor Fran√ßois Buloz. Peyrebrune wrote for several women's magazines and she also published a number of novels. Intellectually she had interests in both scientific, philosophical and masonic ideas. She opposed capital punishment and her feminism was characterized as \\"undeniable and contradictory\\". Peyrebrune published fourteen works in the 1880s with the firms Calmann-L√©vy, Charpentier, Dentu, Ollendorff, and Plon. For many years, she served as on the all female jury for the Prix F√©mina literary prize. In 1909, she was one of the 40 members elected by the readers of F√©mina to represent \\"A Female Academy\\". Peyrebrune's nom de plume started with \\"Georges\\", after George Sand because Peyrebrune held her work in high regard. The writers Camille Delaville and Rachilde were her friends. Peyrebrune married Paul Adrien Numa Eimery, from Chancelade, signing the marriage license \\"G. Johnston de Peyrebrune\\"; it was an unhappy marriage and there were no children.

An expert on bryophytes, she published 130 scientific papers on liverworts, hornworts, orchids, and wetlands. She became the first woman faculty member of the Massey Agricultural College (now Massey University) in 1945, and in 2003 the herbarium at Massey was renamed the Dame Ella Campbell Herbarium in her honour. Following her retirement from teaching in 1976, she continued to research and publish for another two decades, finally retiring in 2000 at the age of 90. Early life and education Campbell was born in Dunedin to Orr Campbell, a building contractor, and Agnes (n√©e Kinder) Campbell, the eldest of five children. Her mother had studied pharmacy at the University of Otago and her mother's sister Jane was one of the first women to attain a medical degree in New Zealand. Campbell attributed her interest in botany to walks that she had taken with her father as a child; she was also influenced by a family friend, botanist Helen Kirkland Dalrymple. Histiopteris incisa fern After graduating Otago Girls' High School, Campbell took a two- year course at Dunedin Teacher's Training College. At the same time, she enrolled at the University of Otago. She received her Diploma in Teaching in 1930. In 1931, she entered the department of botany at the University of Otago to study under John Ernest Holloway. She earned her master's degree in botany with first-class honours in 1934. Her thesis, \\"The embryo and stelar development of Histiopteris incisa\\", was published in Transactions of the Royal Society of New Zealand in 1936. Career Upon graduation, Campbell taught at Waitaki Girls' High School in Oamaru for a year and then became an assistant botany lecturer at Victoria University of Wellington. In 1936 she returned to the University of Otago, now working alongside Holloway. She remained until 1944, when Holloway retired. She learned to speak German and delivered a lecture in that language at the Berlin Botanical Garden. In March 1945 Campbell became the first woman faculty member of Massey Agricultural College (now Massey University). She lectured on plant morphology and anatomy and led research field trips to Himatangi Beach, Kapiti Island, and Tongariro National Park. Research projects included investigating mycorrhiza related to orchids and research on bryophytes, particularly the taxonomy and morphology of hornworts and of thalloid liverworts. She also conducted international field work, such as trips to the University of Cambridge, Singapore, India and Nepal; Australia; Mayasia; Japan; the United States; and Canada. Equisetum arvense foliage In 1976 the University of Otago awarded Campbell the degree Doctor of Science and she officially retired that year. However, she remained at the university in an honorary capacity and continued her research. Major publications during this period included work on the Metzgeriales and Marchantiales orders of liverwort, and several works on New Zealand hornworts that included an examination of details visible only under scanning electron and transmission electron microscopes. In 1978 Campbell published her finding that the Equisetum arvense (field horsetail) growing on nursery land in Palmerston North was an invasive species, after years of others thinking that it was an ornamental plant. She also conducted research into the unique flora of peat bogs. By her 80th birthday, Campbell had published many scientific papers on liverworts (37), orchids (14), wetlands (5), and other topics (10).

He graduated from Lee High Schoolhttp://lmhsupdates.blogspot.com in 1974 and received an associate degree in electrical technology from Hudson Valley Community Collegehttp://www.hvcc.edu in Troy, NY, becoming a licensed electrician and starting his own business, James M. Graham Electrical Co., in Lee.

He was ordained a priest on 11 May 1985 at St. Michael's Cathedral in Springfield, Massachusetts, by the Most Rev. Joseph Francis Maguire, then Bishop of Springfield. He served as assistant pastor at Our Lady of Sacred Heart in Springfield, and at St. Patrick's Church in Hadley, Massachusetts. During his time as a parish priest with the Diocese of Springfield, Father Graham also served as Chaplain to the Massachusetts State Police.\\"Father James Graham dies; founded 1st AIDS respite\\", Waterbury Republican, 5 July 1997 AIDS Ministry In 1989, he won support of then Archbishop of Hartford, John Francis Whealon, to establish the Archdiocese's Office of AIDS Ministry (OAM), headquartered in the Farrington Building on the Green in Waterbury, the first in the nation set up with a Roman Catholic priest as its full-time director. He started with a $4,000 grant from the Archdiocese and raised funds through private donations, grants and bequests as the operation expanded. The goal was to provide housing and medical care for terminally ill persons with AIDS, as well as assisted living facilities for HIV-infected individuals who otherwise might live on the streets or be shuttled between hospitals as their disease progressed. It was at this time, when the ministry was just beginning, that CBS Sunday Morning did a feature story about Father Graham and his work. Father Graham canvassed Connecticut hospitals administering the sacraments to AIDS patients and offering bereavement counseling to family members. He visited parishes throughout the archdiocese to raise AIDS awareness and to teach tolerance, compassion and caring towards people with HIV-disease and AIDS. In at least two instances, Father Graham assumed legal guardianship over individuals who were too ill and without kin, to make decisions on their behalf for their care. The tagline of Father Graham's ministry was \\"Celebrate the Living Years\\". At the time, hope for living normal lives with HIV-disease was almost unheard of. AZT treatment was still in its infancy and the disease was still a virtual death sentence. \\"Celebrate the Living Years\\" became Father Graham's rallying cry of encouragement to people living with HIV-disease and AIDS. Through his ministry, Father Graham was able to recruit countless volunteers to help realize the goal of creating and operating the hospice that grew out of the OAM and became The Sts. Martin & James Respite. Sts. Martin & James Respite Between the summer of 1989 and the end of 1990, the Respite took occupancy of a compound of former mansions of old Waterbury's Chase family, known as Rose Hill, and other proximate buildings that had previously been medical offices, on Prospect and Grove Streets in Waterbury, Connecticut. The space allowed the plan for the Respite to evolve into a model multi-stage facility, including independent-living apartments, a 24-hour staffed hospice, a clinic for testing and walk-in medical care, a communal dining hall and professional kitchen, offices and staff quarters, a chapel, and assured dignity in death with a church funeral and burial in a cemetery of the Archdiocese of Hartford. In November 1989, Father Graham traveled to the Vatican to attend the first-ever international conference on AIDS, \\"To Live: Why?\\", hosted by the Pontifical Council for Pastoral Assistance to Health Care Workers under the direction of then Archbishop Fiorenzo Angelini. At the conference, Father Graham gained notoriety for speaking up for a British former-priest who had not been allowed to speak because he had AIDS himself. Out of Father Graham's efforts to have the man heard, he was appointed by Archbishop Angelini as the director of the International Christian AIDS Network (ICAN), which ideally was envisioned to be a funnel through which efforts in AIDS research, care, and other news would be shared with concerned medical, hospitaler, nursing, scientific, and religious parties throughout the world. An ICAN Newsletter was published in four languages and distributed around the globe twice in 1990-91. The initial long-term goal for ICAN was to establish and build Respites in hard-afflicted areas of Africa. The Sts. Martin & James Chapel was fashioned out of the basement of one of the old mansions which over the years had degraded to becoming a shooting gallery for area heroin addicts. Father Graham and a team of volunteers transformed the space into a chapel with a slate floor and exposed brick walls. The pastor of an area church donated an unused pulpit and tabernacle, Father Graham found a solid hickory pedestal and marble top for the altar at an architectural refuse company‚Äîall were incorporated into the design. The kneeling angel sculpture which stood sentinel at the tabernacle holding aloft the sanctuary lamp, would much later be reassigned as the monument on Father Graham's own grave. The Sts. Martin & James Chapel, named for Saint Martin de Porres and Saint James the Greater (James, son of Zebedee), was consecrated by Archbishop Whealon on 3 January 1990. Every Sunday from then on, Mass would be celebrated in the Chapel in memory of all persons who had died of AIDS around the world. In June 1990, Archbishop Angelini paid a visit to the Respite from Rome during which the main hospice residence was christened and named \\"The Archbishop +Fiorenzo Angelini Residence\\" after him. Local television covered the event and the Archbishop was quoted as saying that the Respite had become \\"a model to follow for offering shelter and physical and spiritual care‚Äîfor all\\". The Archbishop presented Father Graham with a Sterling silver stalk of wheat, handcrafted in Rome, which was later affixed to the door of the chapel's tabernacle. In November 1990, Father Graham returned to Rome for the Pontifical Council's conference on The Human Mind, where Archbishop Angelini presented Father Graham to Pope John Paul II who commended him for his work. Unfortunately, after investing much money to renovate the buildings, a financial dispute with the real estate firm that owned the Rose Hill properties forced the Respite to find other accommodations. Eventually, the annual budget for the operation of the Respite compound and professional care for its residents exceeded $500,000, all of which Graham had to raise through donations, grants, bequests, etc.\\"Father James Graham dies; founded 1st AIDS respite\\", Waterbury Republican, 5 July 1997 A Waterbury industrialist offered the historic Elton Hotel on the Green, which was listed for sale through his agency. A lease agreement was reached to retain the Angelini Residence from the Rose Hill property, but all else was moved to the Elton Hotel by March 1991. An architect volunteered to assist in transforming the building into a complex of 24-hour care, assisted living, and secure facilities for incarcerated persons with advanced HIV or AIDS who would be sent from the area's prisons, as well as a chapel and offices and apartments for the permanent staff. Weekly Masses would henceforth be held at Our Lady of Lourdes Church nearby on South Main Street. But, as the organization was financially struggling to stay afloat, by the end of 1991 Father Graham abandoned the hotel in favor of operating only the Angelini Residence. While all of this was happening, through it all, Father Graham had secretly been battling his own medical nightmares, advanced HIV-disease and MS (multiple sclerosis). The Angelini Residence remained open until October 1992, when Graham finally decided to close its doors. His lack of energy because of his own affliction, lack of money and the state takeover of many of the Respite's tasks led him to focus in another direction.\\"Father James Graham dies; founded 1st AIDS respite\\", Waterbury Republican, 5 July 1997 Last years and death Father Graham retired to Baltimore and in his last years lobbied in Washington, with corporations and the U.S. Congress, to increase Medicaid assistance to needy AIDS patients and assist in the development of nursing homes throughout the Northeast, in Massachusetts and Connecticut.\\"Father James Graham dies; founded 1st AIDS respite\\", Waterbury Republican, 5 July 1997 Through the Corporal Works Foundation, which Graham helped to establish, he continued his fund-raising efforts to help AIDS- related organizations. He became the chaplain at the Human Virology Research Institute at the University of Maryland, which was headed by Dr. Robert Gallo, a Waterbury, Connecticut native and internationally renowned AIDS researcher.http://www.ihv.org/ Father Graham died in Baltimore on 3 July 1997 at the age of 41, ultimately of advanced MS deterioration and HIV complications, but after suffering from an infection related to the injection port he had been incorrectly fitted with.http://articles.courant.com/1997-07-06/news/9707060152_1_needy-aids- patients-multiple-sclerosis-respite His funeral was held on 9 July at St. Peter's Church in Great Barrington, Massachusetts and he was buried at nearby St. Peter's Cemetery, with the kneeling angel that once guarded the tabernacle in the Sts. Martin and James Respite Chapel. Legacy In retrospect, Father Graham is to be remembered as a pioneer in the war against AIDS, answering the call and filling the need for love and compassion towards persons with HIV/AIDS at a time when they were a marginalized segment of society and had little but their own demise to look forward to.

Process DIMAR MP and member of the central committee of DIMAR, Spyros Lykoudis, stated his preference for a broader SYRIZA-DIMAR-PASOK coalition. Panos Kammenos, leader of Independent Greeks (ANEL) stated he favored a broad alliance of anti-bailout parties, excluding Golden Dawn. Following the rumors of a third bailout, Kammenos attempted to convince maverick ND and PASOK MPs to bring down the government. Dimitris Koutsoumpas, leader of the Communist Party (KKE), reiterated the party's stance against cooperation with other parties, stating alliances or partnerships must be done in terms of social movements, \\"not from the top down, where leaders sit down and find, one, two, three things they agree on and sign a program. Those alliances have been shown to have many bad side effects for the labour movement.\\" Bloomberg Businessweek suggested that SYRIZA's choice for coalition partner would reveal its intentions toward negotiations with the Troika. If SYRIZA forms the government with The River, then it could \\"signal that Tsipras wants to avoid a showdown with the troika lenders\\" as [To Potami leader Stavros] \\"Theodorakis strongly opposes such a confrontation and says he wouldn't partner with Syriza unless Tsipras promised to keep Greece in the euro currency\\". If SYRIZA partners with Independent Greeks, it shows a desire to fight with the Troika, given the parties shared anti-austerity ideology. However, that is the only policy that the two parties share. Shortly after the election, Stavros Theodorakis, leader of The River, was expected to meet with Alexis Tsipras in the next 48 hours. However, on 26 January 2015, Tsipras and Independent Greeks leader Panos Kammenos surprisingly agreed to form an \\"anti-austerity coalition\\". Yanis Varoufakis, expected to be appointed Minister of Finance, said they would \\"come to Frankfurt and Berlin and Brussels with [...] a plan to minimise the cost of that Greek debacle to the average German. We must be very careful not to toy with fast or loose talk of Grexit. Grexit is not on the cards.\\" Government formation agreement As of 26 January, the written government formation agreement between ANEL and Syriza - outlining policies and the working program of the government - was yet to be announced. The list below feature the most important pledges made by Syriza in its election campaign, as it is expected all of them will be adopted without any change by the government agreement: * Statement by Alexis Tsipras: A Syriza led government will respect Greece‚Äôs eurozone member obligation to maintain a balanced budget, and will commit to quantitative targets. However, the new government will claim its right to decide on its own how to achieve those quantitative targets, and rule out austerity as a tool to be used. * Statement by Alexis Tsipras: \\"A Syriza government will not respect the agreements signed by the previous government. The day after the election, there will be no memorandums, no troika.\\" Chief of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, replied that if Greece canceled its Troika program, it wouldn't be eligible for the quantitative easing funds the bank planned to inject into the economies of all eurozone states during the next 18 months, as the rule is, that such injections were conditional on either having government bonds with credit ratings above junk bond status (investment grade) or alternatively a completed Troika program review needs to find the state in full compliance with its Troika program. Tsipras clarified, the aim of a Syriza government would be - after having torn apart the existing bailout programme - to negotiate a new programme with its eurozone lenders in place by July 2015 (emphasizing Syriza would only negotiate with representatives of European Union institutions and not the Troika officials \\\\- meaning the IMF would be excluded to take part), which would make Greece eligible - from the date of signing such new agreement - to benefit from ECB's QE programme. * Statement by Yanis Varoufakis: \\"Greece should not receive any more loans as it needs to break its ties with borrowed money, and if Syriza wins an overall majority in the election, Greece should ask for two weeks to prepare its proposals and then submit a request to be given a leeway to reach an agreement with Greece's partners by June 2015. The cost of a Grexit would be too heavy for Greece as well as Europe.\\" * Statement by Alexis Tsipras (ahead of election): Beside of refusing to comply with the previously negotiated terms in the bailout agreement, Syriza will at the same time demand a \\"write down on most of the nominal value of debt, so that it becomes sustainable\\". Statement by Yanis Varoufakis (1 day after election): \\"We will create a rational plan for our debt restructure so that austerity ends; [We are not talking about writing off 50% of the nominal debt] - this [earlier statement] was just a bit of posturing from our side ahead of the negotiation. What really matters is, that we now sit down and discuss a way in which the haircut to our debt is minimized. We do not want to pay back less than we can, but what we are saying is, [that] this debt repayment schedule, as we have in the moment, is complete unrealistic and utterly disconnected from Greek growth. What we want to do is, that we want to bind our repayment to our growth. We want to make our creditors partners to our recovery not our misery. Grexit is not on the cards\\". * Statement by Yanis Varoufakis: \\"We are going to destroy the basis upon which [the oligarchy] has built for decade after decade a system and network that viciously sucks the energy and the economic power from everybody else in society.\\" * Statement by Alexis Tsipras: \\"Syriza will implement measures to ease burden on Greece's middle class, including abolition of the ENFIA property tax, raising the tax-free threshold to 12,000 euros and settlement of overdue taxes.\\" * Statement by Alexis Tsipras: \\"Syriza will establish an anti-corruption task force accountable to the Prime Minister. Yanis Varoufakis expanded this pledge one day after the election by stating: \\"We will come up with genuine reforms that we need to implement in Greece, in order to put an end to both bureaucracy, corruption and tax immunity.\\" * Statement by Alexis Tsipras: \\"Syriza will switch the defunct public broadcaster ERT back into operation. * Other Syriza election pledges were to: Raise the minimum wage, reverse earlier implemented pension cuts and public sector pay cuts, cut power prices for low income families, cut taxes, and expand the number of government jobs. * The following ANEL demands to be a part of the government - were accepted by Syriza: \\"To form an investigative committee in Parliament to look into the circumstances that led to Greece being forced to sign its first troika bailout in 2010 (including how the country‚Äôs debt spiraled)\\", granting ANEL veto right against any proposal to reach an agreement with the Republic of Macedonia on a composite name, putting on hold any plans for separation between the Church and state, and letting ANEL decide the government's stance on defense matters (by appointing Panos Kammenos as Minister of Defense).

History 1959‚Äì1973: Adam Yacenda In late 1958, Las Vegas Sun managing editor, Adam Yacenda grew tired of Sun owner Hank Greenspun and other executives interfering with the daily operations of the paper and resigned in order to found a paper in his hometown, North Las Vegas. On March 26, 1959, the first issue of the weekly North Las Vegas and Moapa Valley Times was published, named for the two areas it aimed to serve. (Greenspun also claimed he was the founder and owner of the new paper, but lost the battle and Yacenda was eventually declared the rightful owner.) The paper initially cost 10¬¢ and was published weekly. The front page headline of the first issue read \\"No. Vegas Growth Looms\\", hinting at what would be the paper's early purpose ‚Äì promoting growth in North Las Vegas. The second issue carried the paper's statement of purpose: \\"A Newspaper Dedicated to Serving the People\\". The Valley Times quickly surpassed its rival North Las Vegas News, published by Greenspun, and in November the News suspended publication to join forces. Greenspun agreed to provide printing services for the Valley Times going forward. The paper continued to grow rapidly and the name was soon shortened to simply Valley Times. In 1963, the Valley Times changed to twice weekly publication. In 1973, it went to thrice weekly publication. Explaining the growth years later, reporter Bruce Hasley remarked \\"[Yacenda] really understood how to make a small community paper succeed ... getting as many names of local people in the paper as we could.\\" 1973‚Äì1984: Bob Brown Facing health issues, Yacenda decided to sell the paper in 1973. On November 1, Bob Brown purchased the Valley Times through his newly formed Las Vegas Valley Publishing Company. The sale was officially announced on the front page of the November 7 issue. In the article, Brown praised Yacenda for \\"building the Valley Times against tremendous odds\\" and promised \\"a number of personnel additions and political changes at the paper,\\" but assured his readers the paper would remain politically independent. Under his leadership, the paper expanded to daily publication in April 1975. The move made Las Vegas together with New York City the only U.S. cities with three competing daily newspapers. Brown soon hired longtime Las Vegas journalists A.D. Hopkins and Bruce Hasley to lead his staff. The Valley Times aimed to cover the gaming industry heavily, viewing it as the political and business core of the Vegas community. He hired reporters to dig deep into the industry and top reporter Ned Day uncovered mob connections at the Argent-owned casinos of Stardust, Fremont, and Hacienda, which were run by Frank Rosenthal. He also uncovered Kansas City-based mob connections at Tropicana. The paper became a \\"must read\\" for politicians and the gaming industry, despite the fact its daily circulation peaked at around 10,000 copies compared to 69,000 for the Las Vegas Review- Journal and 43,000 for the Las Vegas Sun. In financial trouble, the Valley Times became involved with the mob itself. According to a 1979 expose by the Reno Evening Gazette, Brown switched the paper's editorial position in 1976 from criticizing the state government for not being hard enough on Rosenthal to supporting him. From 1976 to 1977, the Valley Times' received $368,000 from ad man Jerry May for fake ads that never ran. Brown kept 10% for the Times, passing the rest back to May who funnelled the money to the mob in Chicago. May was convicted of money laundering in 1984 for his involvement in the scheme. After he was elected governor in 1978, Robert List went public with accusations that Brown and Rothenthal had attempted to extort him. He said Brown has promised to withhold unfavorable stories in exchange for a gaming license for Rosenthal. Brown denied the accusations and List declined to aid the FBI in investigating the claim, citing the hectic final days of the campaign season. Shortly after the election, the Valley Times published stories about List receiving comps from Stardust while working as attorney general. List subsequently repaid $3,200 to the casino. Brown stopped paying payroll taxes and filed for bankruptcy. The IRS seized control on Times assets, including its buildings and printing presses, in July 1982 as the paper owed $200,000 in back taxes. Although he won the assets back in court, Brown was not able to turn around the struggling paper before his death on June 8, 1984. After Brown's death, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court appointed Berkeley Bunker as trustee. He ordered the paper to close down and its last issue was published on June 22.

It is now defunct, and its master key was released by the developers. In its early forms, TeslaCrypt targeted game-play data for specific computer games. Newer variants of the malware also affect other file types. In its original, game-player campaign, upon infection the malware searched for 185 file extensions related to 40 different games, which include the Call of Duty series, World of Warcraft, Minecraft and World of Tanks, and encrypted such files. The files targeted involve the save data, player profiles, custom maps and game mods stored on the victim's hard drives. Newer variants of TeslaCrypt were not focused on computer games alone but also encrypted Word, PDF, JPEG and other files. In all cases, the victim would then be prompted to pay a ransom of $500 worth of bitcoins in order to obtain the key to decrypt the files. Although resembling CryptoLocker in form and function, Teslacrypt shares no code with CryptoLocker and was developed independently. The malware infected computers via the Angler Adobe Flash exploit. Even though the ransomware claimed TeslaCrypt used asymmetric encryption, researchers from Cisco's Talos Group found that symmetric encryption was used and developed a decryption tool for it. This \\"deficiency\\" was changed in version 2.0, rendering it impossible to decrypt files affected by TeslaCrypt-2.0. By November 2015, security researchers from Kaspersky had been quietly circulating that there was a new weakness in version 2.0, but carefully keeping that knowledge away from the malware developer so that they could not fix the flaw. As of January 2016, a new version 3.0 was discovered that had fixed the flaw. A full behavior report, which shows BehaviorGraphs and ExecutionGraphs was published by JoeSecurity.  Shut down  In May 2016, the developers of TeslaCrypt shut down the ransomware and released the master decryption key, thus bringing an end to the ransomware. After a few days, ESET released a public tool to decrypt affected computers at no charge.

Biography Paul was one of four daughters of pioneering New Zealand publisher Blackwood Paul and artist and writer Janet Paul. Paul attended Marsden College from 1959 until 1962, then Waikato University in 1963, studying History, French and English. In 1964 she travelled to London with her family for a year, studying at the Sir John Cass School. On returning to New Zealand she completed a BA at Auckland University in 1968; in 1967 she enrolled at Elam School of Fine Arts, studying under teachers such as Colin McCahon, Greer Twiss and Tom Hutchins, and alongside fellow students Christine Hellyar, Marte Szirmay and Leon Narbey. She graduated with a Diploma of Fine Arts in 1969. After graduating from Elam Paul moved to Dunedin, where in 1971 she married fellow artist Jeffrey Harris. In 1973 Paul and Harris spent a year in Wellington, where their first daughter was born; in 1976 a second daughter was born, who died of a heart defect at the age of eight months. A son was born in 1978 and a fourth child in 1982. Art historian Jill Trevelyan notes that 'Although Paul faced practical difficulties in reconciling the roles of mother and artist, she refused to see them as mutually exclusive. ... Paul was able to turn her domestic situation to her own advantage in her art, as her many tender and exquisite studies of her children attest.' Paul's first solo exhibition was held in 1968. In 1975 she was included in the exhibition Six Women Artists in Christchurch. In the publication accompanying the exhibition she stated: > As a woman painting is not a job, not even a vocation. It is a part of life, > subject to the strains, and joys, of domestic life. ... Painting for me as a > woman is an ordinary act ‚Äì about the great meaning in ordinary things. In 1983 Paul received the Frances Hodgkins Fellowship at the University of Otago. The following year, after the end of her marriage, she moved briefly to Wellington and then settled in Whanganui, where she lived for the rest of her life, not discounting time spent working in various New Zealand cities, including a year in Wellington when she held the Rita Angus Residency in 1993. The first major survey of Paul's work was shown at the Sarjeant Art Gallery in 1989. In 2003 Paul collapsed while bathing in a thermal pool in the Polynesian Spas in Rotorua. She died in hospital two days later. Jill Trevelyan writes 'An inventory of her studio revealed some 5000 artworks, many of which had never been exhibited, drawings, photographs and films. She also left a body of work as a poet and prose writer, including a wealth of published material.' Paul's obituary in the New Zealand journal Art New Zealand noted that 'she worked for love-not for money, neither for status nor fame. And so, during her public life as an artist ‚Äì just on 34 years ‚Äì Paul existed on the margins of the art world: where she lived, how she practised, and what she believed in.' The obituary also commented on the range of her work and interests: 'painting and drawing, photography, film-making, poetry, publishing, architectural history and critical writing, as well as related commitment to the women's movement, human rights, building preservation, environmental protection and a fierce opposition to laissez-faire genetic engineering.' Photographic historian Peter Ireland, writing on an exhibition of Paul's photographs in 2013, noted > Apart from a few dedicated collectors her work was never much sought after, > and for several reasons. It was usually small, often on paper and > domestically related. She worked across a range of mediums ‚Äì painting, > drawing, photography, film, poetry, publishing ‚Äì and in the market‚Äôs view > that‚Äôs not versatility but a perceived lack of focus. And she was her own > worst enemy in terms of promotion. Although she exhibited regularly she > shied away from any promotional endeavour, and, typically perversely, seemed > to actively discourage it. Legacy A tribute exhibition, Beauty, Even, was organised by the City Gallery Wellington the following year and toured to other North Island locations. A survey focused on her drawings was organised by the Mahara Gallery on the Kapiti Coast in 2006 and also toured. The Hocken Collections at the University of Otago staged an exhibition of Paul's work paired with poet Cilla McQueen, Picture/Poem: imagery of Cilla McQueen & Joanna Paul in 2015. The exhibitions focused on works produced in the 1970s and 1980s when the two were resident in Dunedin; most of the works by Paul were drawn from the Hocken's collections. In early 2015, three of Paul's films featured in a two person exhibition with contemporary artist Ziggy Lever commissioned by Ramp Gallery Hamilton. Curated by Paula Booker and titled 'Thinking Feeling' the moving image exhibition considered the affective dimension of Paul's detailed and often dream-like non-narrative film works. The exhibition occasioned an eponymous catalogue by Ramp Press and also travelled to The Physics Room Contemporary Art Space, Christchurch. In 2015 Solomon Nagler and Mark Williams curated Six Artists respond to the work of Joanna Margaret Paul, a collection of short films responding to Paul's poems, by artists Nova Paul, Rachel Shearer, Sonya Lacey, Miranda Parkes, Shannon Te Ao and the collective Popular Productions. This programme of work was screened at the Artists' Moving Image Programme of the BFI London Film Festival 2015., where curator Mark Williams also gave presentation about Paul's practice. Paul's work was included in Fragments of a World: Artists Working in Film and Photography 1973‚Äì1987, curated in 2015 by Dr Sandy Callister for the Adam Art Gallery. The exhibition brought together the work of artists (Paul, Alexis Hunter, Jane Campion, Rhonnda Bosworth, Minerva Betts, Popular Productions and Janet Bayly) who early in their careers explored photography and film, from a feminist perspective. The exhibition travelled to Michael Lett Gallery in Auckland in 2016. In December 2016 film maker and curator Peter Todd, also of the BFI, presented a screening of her films 'Through a Different Lens / Film Work by Joanna Margaret Paul' at the Close-Up Film Centre in London. The programme, which had previously screened in New Zealand, would later screen at The Cinema Museum London and in Australia and Europe. Todd wrote an accompanying essay and writer and academic Eleanor Woodhouse would review the programme in her essay The Transcendent and Domestic in Joanna Margaret Paul‚Äôs Films. In 2019 New Zealand born artist Kate Davis, Peter Todd, and academic and writer Sarah Neely would present Margaret Tait & Joanna Margaret Paul: People and Places at the Glasgow Film Festival.

Although it is rare in cultivation, it is an attractive garden plant due to its soft foliage and white flowers which fade to pink or red. It is similar to Melaleuca scabra with which it has often been confused. Description Melaleuca urceolaris grows to a height of about spreading to or more with its low spreading branches. Its leaves are arranged alternately, mostly linear, long and with a covering of small soft hairs giving the leaves a greyish-green colour. The flowers are arranged in heads up to in diameter, at or near the ends of the branches, with 2 to 12 flowers in each head. The flowers appear from August and November and are initially white to cream or lemon-yellow but age to pinkish or red. The stamens are arranged in bundles of five around the flower, with 9 to 15 stamens in each bundle. The base of the flower is hairy and long. The fruit are woody capsules, long. M. urceolaris leaves and flowers M. urceolaris fruit Taxonomy and naming Melaleuca urceolaris was first formally described in 1867 by George Bentham in Flora Australiensis. The specific epithet (urceolaris) is derived from the Latin urceus meaning \\"urn\\" or \\"pitcher\\" referring to the shape of the fruit. Distribution and habitat Melaleuca urceolaris occurs in the Arrino-Jurien Bay-Gingin districts in the Avon Wheatbelt, Geraldton Sandplains, Jarrah Forest, Mallee and Swan Coastal Plain biogeographic regions.

The film was adapted from Oliver Goldsmith's 1766 novel The Vicar of Wakefield, but covers only part of the plot and deviates significantly from the book to allow the story to be told within the confines of a single reel of film. The film begins with the vicar and his family heading to a picnic with Squire Thornhill, during the course of which the vicar notices Thornhill's interest in his daughter, Olivia. The vicar warns his family that Thornhill is a degenerate young man, but Olivia is seduced and elopes with Thornhill. Secretly, Thornhill arranges a fake marriage ceremony to capitalize on his sexual desires while avoiding the responsibility that would come with the union. Olivia learns the marriage was fake and that she has duped into a form of consensual prostitution with Thornhill, but escapes and returns home. Thornhill decides to take his revenge by having the vicar incarcerated for his debts. While in prison, the vicar learns that the marriage was in fact legitimate; Thornhill's uncle, Sir William, then forces his nephew to apologize to Olivia and fulfill his obligations. The identities of most of the cast are known, but the role of director, often erroneously credited to Theodore Marston is not. The film was released on December 27, 1910 and met with positive reviews. The surviving print is in the Nederlands Filmmuseum and has been released on DVD.  Plot  The Thanhouser production is an adaptation of only part of the novel. The film departs significantly from the original plot, such as in the omission of the double-wedding scene. It begins with Dr Charles Primrose, the vicar of Wakefield, attending a picnic with his landlord Squire Thornhill. The vicar does not like Squire Thornhill, who is reputed to be a degenerate young man, but he has no reservations once he sees Thornhill's interest in his daughter, Olivia. The next scene shows Squire Thornhill convincing Olivia to elope with him, so the two can be married. But Squire Thornhill has no intention of marrying her, and commissions a farmer to arrange a fake wedding ceremony. The farmer accepts, but shakes his fist in anger at the squire after he has departed. Squire Thornhill leaves in a carriage with Olivia, whose departure is soon reported to the rest of the family. Stricken with grief, the vicar heads off to reclaim his wayward daughter. At the end of the marriage ceremony the farmer receives his payment, and the squire and Olivia embrace. The vicar arrives shortly afterwards, but after failing to persuade his daughter to return home with him leaves in despair. Olivia learns later that the marriage was a sham, but continues to live in Thornhill's house until he offers her as a prostitute to an acquaintance of his. Olivia flees in a rage and returns home, where she is reunited with her family. Thornhill, now out for revenge, has the vicar arrested and thrown into jail for unpaid debts. Olivia goes to meet her father in prison, and upon exiting the farmer who had arranged the marriage between Olivia and Thornhill appears and gasps in shock. The vicar explains that Olivia is his daughter, and the farmer reveals his role in the plot, but that out of hatred for Thornhill he procured the services of a real priest to officiate at the wedding. The farmer heads to Thornhill's house and reveals that the marriage was in fact legitimate. Thornhill's uncle, Sir William, forces him to take responsibility for his actions and beg Olivia's forgiveness. Olivia accepts Thornhill's apology and the couple embrace and kiss. Although not in the surviving print, the synopsis concludes with \\"Sir William then discloses his identity and asks for the hand of Sophia [another of the vicar's daughters]. The vicar is released from prison, and he and his family look forward to a future of happiness and plenty.\\"  Cast  *Martin J. Faust as the vicar of Wakefield *Frank H. Crane *Anna Rosemond *William Garwood *Marie Eline *Bertha Blanchard *Lucille Younge *William Russell  Production  The film was adapted from Oliver Goldsmith's novel The Vicar of Wakefield. The complex plot was broken down to a single-reel adaptation by Edwin Thanhouser and/or Lloyd Lonergan. Edwin Thanhouser's wife Gertrude assisted with the scenarios and editing of the films, but it is not specifically known if she contributed to this production. The film's director is unknown, but it may have been Barry O'Neil or Lucius J. Henderson. Credit is sometimes given to Theodore Marston, an error that apparently originates with the American Film-Index 1908‚Äì1915. Film historian Q. David Bowers consulted one of the co-authors of the book, Gunnar Lundquist, and confirmed that the credit of Marston as director was in error. Marston worked with Path√©, Kinemacolor, Vitagraph and other companies, but there is no record of him working with Thanhouser. This error has persisted in several works including The Complete Index to Literary Sources in Film. Cameramen employed by the company at the time the film was made include Blair Smith, Carl Louis Gregory and Alfred H. Moses, Jr., but the role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions. This production is unique for having the cast members known, because most of the credits in Thanhouser's 1910 productions are fragmentary.  Release and reception  The single-reel drama, approximately 1,000 feet long, was released on December 27, 1910. The film likely had a wide national release, theaters are known to have shown the film in Pennsylvania, Kansas, Indiana, and South Dakota. The film received positive reviews from trade publications including The Moving Picture World, which praised the acting and the execution of the film as an education for audiences by exposing them to literary masterpieces. The New York Dramatic Mirror reviewer was less enthusiastic, writing that \\"The production gave a very praiseworthy portrayal of the period, but a moving picture needs such different treatment from a novel that its interpretation in a picture is bound to lose much of the original interest. The acting was in every way adequate, although not great.\\" The Complete Index to Literary Sources in Film lists this film as the first adaptation of the Vicar of Wakefield. It was followed by identically titled adaptations, including Path√© Fr√®res's The Vicar Of Wakefield in 1912 and the Kinematograph Trading Company's The Vicar Of Wakefield in 1913, Ideal Film Company's The Vicar Of Wakefield in 1916. The Thanhouser Company reproduced The Vicar of Wakefield in 1917. The two Thanhouser films differ in more than just length, as the feature-length adaptation shows the progression of motion pictures from \\"essentially static tableaus, each announced by a title card, to a series of scenes and sequences analyzed by editing, most notably with vivid close-ups of the great stage actor Frederick Warde.\\" A surviving print held in the Nederlands Filmmuseum was the source of the modern re-release of film. It is 13 minutes 20 seconds long and features a new original score composed and performed by Raymond A. Brubacker. The film was released on DVD as Volume 4 of the Thanhouser Classics Video Collectors Set. It was also released as part of the Treasures from the Desmet Collection at the EYE Filmmuseum.

Surviving gangrape in 2012 On the evening of February 6, 2012, Jordan met 5 youth (Kader Khan, Md. Ali, Nasir Khan, Ruman Khan and Sumit Bajaj) for the first time at a nightclub in Park Street who offered to drop her home, when she was leaving. Soon after, she was gang-raped by the five in a moving car and later, dumped near Exide Crossing, opposite the Calcutta Club. Around 3.30 am, she boarded a taxi to her residence in Behala. Revealing her identity While the media and police initially ensured an information blackout of the victim's name, as is customary in India, she later publicly revealed her identity as 37 year old and a mother of two, in order to encourage other survivors to speak out. After revealing her identity, she said, \\"Why should I hide my identity when it was not even my fault? Why should I be ashamed of something that I did not give rise to? I was subjected to brutality, I was subjected to torture, and I was subjected to rape, and I am fighting and I will fight.\\" At the time of her death, three of the five men accused of raping Jordan inside a moving car had been arrested and were on trial, although they denied the charges. The remaining two, including the main suspect, had not been arrested. The names of the accused are main accused Mohommad Ali and Kader Khan (The then boyfriend Of Nusrat Jahan) who are absconding, and Nasir Khan, Ruman Khan (Ruman Khan alias Tussi) and Sumit Bajaj who are in custody. Outcome of case One of the prime accused was Kadir Khan, the then boyfriend of Bengali television star Nusrat Jahanwho later went on to become a member of parliament from Basirhat. Khan was picked up by West Bengal Police from a hideout in Noida 5 years later. As of 2020, he remains in prison. The other accused, Naser Khan, Ruman Khan and Sumit Bajaj, were arrested in February 2012. On 10 December 2015, the city sessions court, Kolkata found all five of the accused guilty. The accused were convicted under 120 (B) (Criminal conspiracy), 506 (criminal intimidation), 323(Voluntarily Causing Hurt), 34(Common intention),376(2)(g)(Gang Rape). The three accused in custody (Naser, Ruman and Sumit) were sentenced to 10 years of imprisonment, months after the victim died of encephalitis. Four years after the incident, prime accused Kader Khan and Muhammad Ali were arrested on 30 September 2016 in Noida, brought back to Kolkata and produced before the court.In mid-June, 2020, Sumit Bajaj was released 20-months before his sentence ended, for 'good behaviour'. Social impact The case was widely debated in the media, with some political and social commentators casting aspersions on Jordan's character, and quickly became a political issue. Suzette Jordan with her cat When Jordan originally reported the crime, the Chief Minister of West Bengal, Mamata Banerjee, called her a liar and accused her of trying to embarrass the government, a position that provoked national outrage. Later activism Jordan became a women's rights activist and briefly worked as a counsellor for a helpline for victims of sexual and domestic violence. She spoke up against the humiliation and discrimination against victims, for instance when she was denied entry into a Kolkata restaurant. She made use of the media, appearing in a talk show, Satyamev Jayate hosted by actor Aamir Khan, as well as through Facebook to highlight societal issues. Family life and death Jordan had two daughters. On 13th March 2015 she died at the age of 40, of meningoencephalitis.

Departed 26 December 1852 The Highland and Island Emigration Society was a charitable society formed to promote and assist emigration as a solution to the Highland Potato Famine. Between 1852 and 1857, it assisted the passage of around 5,000 emigrants from Scotland to Australia. The Society's work was both praised for providing a solution to the famine in Scotland, and criticised for providing landlords with an easy mechanism for the Highland Clearances. The formation of the Highland and Island Emigration Society In 1846, the Highland Potato Famine caused a crisis in the Highlands and the islands of Western Scotland, an area already struggling with overpopulation and the upheavals of the Highland Clearances. The deaths from starvation were so high that, in 1848‚Äì1849, the government delivered shipments of oatmeal to locations along the western coast to give to starving families. Relief measures were supervised by Sir John McNeill, himself a highlander. In 1846, in his role as chairman of the Board of Supervision for the New Poor Law of Scotland, he toured 27 of the most distressed parishes. As the famine continued, many, like McNeill, began to doubt that relief was a sustainable solution to the problem. His view was shared by others. For example, in Skye, one of the hardest hit areas, the local clan chief, Norman McLeod, bankrupted himself between 1846 and 1849 providing relief to his people. In 1849, he was obliged to leave Skye and move to London, working as a clerk earning three pounds a week. He became convinced that emigration was the only solution and eventually joined the London Committee of the Highland and Island Emigration Society. Similarly, Thomas Fraser, Sheriff Substitute of Skye, who had worked there since 1846 organizing relief, came to believe that emigration was the only hope. In 1851, McNeill published a report to the Board of Supervision summarizing his views and proposing the \\"large-scale emigration of the 'surplus' population as the only way forward\\". This view was strongly shared by Sir Charles Trevelyan, Assistant Secretary to Her Majesty's Treasury in London. He saw emergency food supplies as a \\"useless palliative\\" and thought that emigration to Australia would provide the relief needed. By April 1852, Trevelyan had founded the Highland and Island Emigration Society, with McNeill, following a meeting at the Freemasons' TavernFreemasons Tavern in Great Queen Street, Covent Garden. They had a strong and useful ally in Sir Thomas Murdoch, chairman of the Colonial Land and Emigration Commissioners. MacMillan attributes the success of the Society primarily to this powerful trio: Trevelyan and Murdoch for Treasury and Emigration, and McNeill as the chief administrator of Poor Relief in Scotland. Despite having the appearance of an independent philanthropic organisation, the Society has been labelled a quasi-governmental organisation by historian Tom Devine. Evidence cited to support this view include the close involvement of senior civil servants in the Society, the Emigration Advances Act of 1851 which provided loans to landlords to pay their share of emigration costs and all overseas mail from the Society using the Treasury's mail facilities. The existence of the Society allowed a course of action that would have cost more as a government operation and went against the ruling party's political ideology. Skye was the area selected for the Society's first operations, with Australia as the ultimate destination. Australia was chosen because the Highlanders' experience as shepherds and cattle drovers would be valued there. By the time the Society closed, Skye was the origin of 59% of all its emigrants (59% = 2818 people). The next commonest starting points were Harris and a combined total for Mull and Iona - each providing 6% of the overall number. The rules of emigration In its first pamphlet, published in May 1852, the Society set out its rules for emigrants: # The Emigration will be conducted, as much as possible, by entire families, and in accordance with the rules of the Colonial Land and Emigration Commissioners. # Passages to Australia are provided by the Commissioners, from Colonial funds, for able- bodied men and women of good character ... on production of a stated quantity and description of clothing, and on payment of a deposit ... # The Society will advance the sum necessary to make good whatsoever may be deficient for these purposes ... The emigrants will he required to repay to the Society the whole of the sums advanced to them, which will again be applied in the same manner as the original fund. # The owners or trustees of the properties from which the emigrants depart will be expected to pay one-third of the sum disbursed on account of the emigrants by the Society. The last rule, which required landlords to partially fund the emigration of their tenants, has been criticized. Richards: \\"the operations of the ... Society were clouded by its allegiance with landlords wanting to divest themselves of small tenantry who were no longer economic\\". Prebble: \\"Helped by the Highland Emigration Society and by the Commissioners for emigration ‚Äì the one finding the money and the other the ships ‚Äì the lairds of the Isles were now clearing their estates with sickening haste.\\" British Government support The British Government provided funds through the Colonial Land and Emigration Commission. This was the agency that had already been tasked with sponsoring emigration to Australia, but which did not favour families, preferring to select young single adults. Trevelyan set about changing this policy, using his close association with the chair of the Commission, Sir Thomas Murdoch. The British Government also passed the Emigration Advances Act of 1951, which provided a mechanism for landlords to borrow money to pay their share of emigration costs. The provision of HMS Hercules by the Board of the Admiralty was at a lower cost than would be usual. Popular support for the emigration plan \\"Scenes on board an Australian emigrant ship\\" from Illustrated London News in 1849 In 1852, popular support for emigration was widespread. The Society's pamphlet of May 1852 announced that its patron was Prince Albert and asked the public for donations. The list of benefactors included The Queen (¬£300), Prince Albert (105), three Scottish Dukes (¬£100 each), Members of Parliament, the Australian Agricultural Company, and numerous clergy. Yorkshire manufacturers, fearing a labour shortage affecting the supply of wool from Australia, were keen to subscribe large amounts to the Society. The London Committee, which in addition to Trevelyan himself, included other influential individuals such as Thomas Baring, Baron Rothschild, and W. G. Prescott, Governor of the Bank of England, wrote personal letters to prominent Scots in Bombay, Calcutta and Madras asking for funds to help ... > this final effort to put an end to the misery that is breaking the spirit > and degrading the character of our Highlanders, now that an absolute > necessity of removing them has coincided with such an opportunity of > providing for them elsewhere as never has, and perhaps never will, occur > again. Support also came from the governments in the various Australian colonies, including ¬£3,000 from South Australia in 1853, and ¬£3,000 from Tasmania in 1854, on condition that a certain number of emigrants were sent there. Criticism of the Society's emigration plan The Society's emigration scheme was sometimes exploited by landlords, leading to some of the notorious forced evictions that figure in the history of the Highland Clearances. For example, in 1854, Donald Ross published a pamphlet entitled \\"Real Scottish Grievances\\" in which he describes some of the results of the activities of what he refers to as \\"a body calling itself the Highland and Island Emigration Society\\". Trevelyan must have been aware of these incidents because many were widely reported. However, when a correspondent suggested that the emigration was being used to \\"facilitate the landlord's clearances\\", the Chairman replied \\"They will no doubt gain by the removal of the unemployed population, but the people will gain far more. This is essentially a popular movement.\\" Trevelyan's correspondence reveals a low opinion of the \\"Celtic race\\" (despite his own Cornish, and therefore Celtic, ancestry) that was not uncommon for the times. These views influenced the operation of the Society. According to Kent: > The active principles on which the Highland and Island Emigration Society > was founded, and which it consistently espoused, were a mixture of liberal > political economy, ill-disguised racism and a grudging form of charity. The sometimes conflicted nature of the Society and its operations is reflected in MacMillan's comments on the nature of Trevelyan: > Trevelyan's own personality is enigmatic, with its undertones of racial > prejudice and authoritarianism. He could defend his emigrants against the > criticisms of Robert Lowe and the critics of his schemes in New South Wales, > but he could also contemplate with satisfaction \\"the prospect of flights of > Germans settling here in increasing numbers ‚Äì an orderly, moral, industrious > and frugal people, less foreign to us that the Irish or Scotch Celt, a > congenial element which will readily assimilate with our body politic\\". He > certainly believed that he was benefiting both Britain and the Highlanders, > for he wrote on another occasion, \\"The Irish and Scotch, especially the > latter, do much better when they have a fresh start in other countries, and > become mixed up with other people, than when they stay at home\\". Operations Page from HIES records summarising operations Apart from being unusual in the way it funded emigrants, the Society was also unusual in the application of its first Rule ‚Äì emigration by family. This was in contrast to the usual pattern of immigration at the time which was single men, couples, or small families. The families selected by the Land and Emigration Commissioner's agent in Scotland, acting on behalf of the Society, were extended, sometimes to three generations. Families that satisfied the Society's criteria were selected and assigned a family number. Between 1852 and 1857, 29 ships carried 963 families sponsored by the Society, comprising around 5,000 emigrants. The family-centred policy was slightly modified in 1853 when the Society sought to increase the proportion of single females. This met requests from Australian businesses and the colonial government. The Society's ability to meet this demand was used in negotiations with key individuals in Australia. The result was an increase in single females from 18% to about 25%. Those selected to emigrate with the Society were the poorest from each community. The majority were not crofters, but cottars and squatters. Many had to be provided with clothing in order to leave their homes. Only in 1853 were better off applicants accepted, due to a shortage of those willing to emigrate in that year. The very poor were often those most reluctant to leave their homes and the slightest (and most temporary) of improvements in their circumstances would rapidly reverse any decision to go. The voyages could be dangerous with passengers dying of typhus, scarlet fever and smallpox. For example, out of 615 immigrants (not all sponsored by the Society) on the 1852 voyage of the Ticonderoga, 168 died including 82 children under seven. However, other voyages went smoothly; a well-documented one is that of the Sir Alan McNab, which sailed from Liverpool in 1854, where: > Only trifling sickness occurred, chiefly diseases of the throat and glands, > which the Surgeon thought might have been caused by the ship's being lined > with salt to preserve its timbers. In 1852, its first year of operation, 17 ships carried Society emigrants to Australia. There were only 4 ships in 1853 ‚Äì \\"Economic conditions in the Highlands had improved slightly, and the people were reluctant to emigrate.\\" In 1854, the number of ships rose to five but then operations were disrupted by the Crimean war. In 1855, only two ships left with Society emigrants, none in 1856, and only one, the last, in 1857. End of the Society The pressure for emigration to Australia was eased by improved economic conditions in Scotland after 1854 and a decrease in the demand for labor in Australia. Between 1855 and 1857, only 544 Highlanders were sent to Australia by the Society. Emigrants arriving in Australia. Sydney Cove, 1853 Trevelyan took a long view on the Society's legacy. Writing to McNeill in 1852, he stated: > Five hundred years hence, a few of the most aristocratic families of the > great Australian Republic will boast of being able to trace their ancestors > in the Highland Emigration Book of 1852‚Äì53. The records of the Society were placed in the Register House in Edinburgh. According to MacMillan, \\"It is to Trevelyan's sense of history and his concern for the safety of documentation, characteristics of a great civil servant, that we owe the remarkable survival of the central records of the Society.\\" As well as providing valuable insight into this turbulent period of Scottish history, the Society's documentary legacy has allowed researchers to track the fate of many of the Society's emigrants. As Trevelyan envisaged, many Australians today owe their existence to the work of the Society. Without the Society their ancestors may never have left Scotland, maybe not even survived the harsh conditions of the time.

MQ-9 Reaper in flight (2007) Certification aspects One of the main barriers to rapid full-scale growth of commercial unmanned aircraft is the concern for safety. As myriad certification agencies scramble to keep up with the unique demands of this fast-growing industry, one thing is clear ‚Äì where applicable, pertinent certification standards for manned aircraft are starting to apply. For the complex electronics that provide communication and control of these systems, this means a swift move towards compliance with DO-178C and DO-254 for software and hardware development. In most cases, the unmanned aircraft can only be operated as part of a system, hence the term ‚Äúunmanned aircraft system‚Äù or UAS. The UAS consists of an unmanned aircraft (UA), a remote pilot station and the command, control and communications links that join them; as such, safety considerations address all of these elements. In 2011, the International Civil Aviation Organization of the United Nations published Circular 328 ‚Äì this document states a UAS should demonstrate equivalent levels of safety as manned aircraft and thus meet relevant government rules for flight and flight equipment. Within the United States, the Congress passed a bill in 2012 that mandated the FAA create a plan for allowing UAS into commercial airspace. Subsequently, the FAA issued ‚Äúthe Integration of Civil Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) in the National Airspace System (NAS) Roadmap‚Äù. , obtaining an experimental airworthiness certificate for a particular UAS is the only way civil operators of unmanned aircraft are accessing the National Airspace System of the United States. FAA Order 8130.34, Airworthiness Certification of Unmanned Aircraft Systems, establishes procedures for issuing this certification, and as such establishes guidance standards for certification aspects of development and operation, which may be addressed by adoption of such standards as ARP4754A, and DO-178C. The FAA roadmap is, in essence, maturation of the acceptance of UAVs from this ‚Äúexperimental‚Äù aircraft certification to requiring the same standard airworthiness type certification of manufacturing design as is now required of conventional manned aircraft. By country The European Union sees benefits and challenges for civilian drones, and in 2014 proposed a set of regulations to control the effects of drones on peoples' safety, security and privacy.Kallas, Siim. \\"European Commission calls for tough standards to regulate civil drones\\" European Commission, 8 April 2014. Retrieved 9 April 2014. Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Advisory Group was set up in 2015 by the United Nations‚Äô civil aviation arm to draw up global rules and regulations for the safe use of unmanned aircraft. The team comprises countries such as the United States, France and China, as well as industry bodies like the global pilots' association. In December 2017, the International Air Transport Association (IATA), a global airline trade body, pressed governments to ensure enforcement of regulations to curb reckless and dangerous flying of recreational drones. Australia In 2013 a Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) spokesman said that those operating remotely piloted aircraft should keep them at least 30m away from structures, buildings and people, and to check with the local council where they could be used. Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) regulations require that UAVs be at least 30m from people and shouldn't be operated in a way that creates a hazard. Brazil In 2017https://www.anac.gov.br/assuntos/legislacao/legislacao-1/rbha-e- rbac/rbac/rbac-e-94, the National Civil Aviation Agency regulated the operation of drones through the Brazilian Special Civil Aviation Regulation No. 94/2017 (RBAC-E No. 94/2017). ANAC's regulation complements the drone operating rules established by the Airspace Control Department (DECEA) and the National Telecommunications Agency (ANATEL). Canada In 2016 Transport Canada proposed the implementation of new regulations that would require all drones over 250 grams to be registered and insured and that operators would be required to be a minimum age and pass an exam in order to get a license. These regulations were introduced in 2019. France Overflights of nuclear power plants are illegal in France, with a punishment of a year in prison and a fine of ‚Ç¨75,000 if an aircraft comes within 5 km horizontally or 1 km vertically of a plant. Hong Kong, China While no-fly zones have been declared in Victoria Harbour, country parks, the airport, military sites, prisons and in government-run leisure facilities, it was reported that rules were rarely enforced or observed. The Hong Kong government is proposing to introduce regulations that will broadly follow American standards, which might require all drones above a certain weight to be registered. Information would then made available to law enforcement authorities, and failure to register and tag a drone could be punishable by a US$250,000 (HK$1.95 million) fine or up to three years in jail. A short public consultation on the matter is set to be conducted by the first quarter of 2018, and to finish by mid-2018.

Drone Regulations: Flying Drones to be legal in India from December 01  Indonesia  In 2015, the Indonesian Ministry of Transportation's Directorate General of Civil Aviation published a rule that regulates the usage of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles in the Indonesian Airspace. The rule states that UAVs should not fly above the altitude of 150m and should not fly inside restricted or prohibited area, and areas around airports. UAVs that require altitudes higher than 150m would require a written authorization from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation. Additionally, UAVs equipped with imaging equipment should not fly within 500m from the border of restricted or prohibited area, and if the UAV is involved in imaging activities, the operator should have written permission from the local government. Special UAVs equipped with farming equipment such as seed spreader or insecticide spray should only operate in farmland, and should not operate within 500m of housing area.Ron Bartsch; James Coyne; Katherine Gray; 2016. Drones in Society: Exploring the strange new world of unmanned aircraft. Taylor & Francis. p. 60. . Instead of NFZ (No-fly zone) and No-Drone Zone (Airspace around airport at radius of 5 miles), there is a local regulation called KKOP (Kawasan Keselamatan Operasi Penerbangan). Refer to one of Indonesian Remote Pilot Certified and Activist, Arya Dega, the KKOP is a UAV restricted area that not included in NDZ or NFZ. I.e.: Presidencial Palace, Government Building, some of Hospital, and Military Facility. Japan On 11 September 2015, an amendment to the Aeronautical Act was issued to introduce safety rules on unmanned aircraft (UA)/drones. The new regulations came into effect on 10 December 2015. According to the Civil Aviation Bureau in Japan, the term ‚ÄúUA/drone‚Äùs refers to any airplane, rotorcraft, glider or airship which cannot accommodate any person on board and can be remotely or automatically piloted (excluding those lighter than 200 grams, inclusive of the battery weight.) Any person who intends to operate a UA/drones in the following airspace is required to obtain special permission from the Minister of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism. *(A) All airspace above or around airports, heliports and aerodromes. (airspace above the OLS, obstacle limitation surfaces.) *(B) All airspace 150 meters above ground/water surface. *(C) All airspace above Densely Inhabited Districts (DID), which are defined and published by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications. (i.e. urban area and suburb, so only rural area is allowed) When no permission is required from the minister, or obtained permission by extremely troublesome procedures, anyone should operate UA/drones in the daytime and within Visual Line of Sight (VLOS). Video telecontrol or automated flight is prohibited. A 30-meters operating distance have to be maintained between the UA/drones and persons or properties on the ground/water surface. UA/drones should not be operated over event sites where many people gather. UA/drones should not carry hazardous materials such as combustible or explosives (except one for power source). Objects should not be dropped off from UA/drones other than touching down the ground. These restrictions can be granted by special permission from the minister. Furthermore, for security reasons, anyone cannot levitate any flying object including UA/drones, aeroballoons, gliders, flyboards and jet packs within about 300 meters from the National Diet Building, the official residents of speakers of the House of Representatives and the House of Councillors, the Prime Minister's Official Residence, the Kasumigasekis, the Supreme court, Tokyo Imperial Palace (including Akasaka Imperial Residences), the main offices of political parties, the diplomatic mission offices, the nuclear power plants and nuclear related facilities as well as buildings used for inter-governmental political forum such as Group of Seven temporarily. UA/drones will be radio-controlled, so one should follow the Japan Radio Act exactly. Flying UA/drones above some parks, coasts and ports including Tottori Sand Dunes is restricted by the by-laws in some prefectures of Japan. Like many other civilized countries, it is a kind of trespass to fly UA/drones indoors, near above the dwellings, or near above its surrounding soil without the permission of a person with legitimate rights. Malaysia Any person in charge of a small unmanned aircraft with a mass of 20 kilograms or less may fly the aircraft without approval from the Department of Civil Aviation Malaysia as long as ‚Äúhe is satisfied that the flight can safely be made‚Äù. Myanmar In November 2017, Myanmar sentenced three journalists and their driver to two months‚Äô imprisonment for operating a drone near parliament while shooting a documentary. While Myanmar has no specific law on drones, individual authorities have tried to restrict the use of such equipment over their premises. The Philippines In 2015, the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP) announced that owners or operators of unmanned aircraft vehicles (UAVs) who will operate the drones for commercial purposes must register with the CAAP, and secure a certification. Commercial uses include filming, aerial mapping, surveying and other revenue purposes. For operations specifically for model, sports, hobby and recreational activities, authorisation from the CAAP is not required. All operations of UAVs in Philippine airspace have to comply with the general guidelines stated in Philippine Civil Aviation Regulations Part 11.11.1.2 (General UAV Operations). The UAV must be flown: * 30 meters beyond a person who is not directly associated with the operation of the UAV; * An altitude not exceeding 400 feet Above Ground Level (AGL); * Outside 10 km radius from the Aerodrome Reference Point (ARP); and * The UAV shall stay clear of populated area unless an approval from the CAAP has been granted.  Republic of Ireland  In 2012, the Irish Aviation Authority published a document setting out safety requirements for any unmanned aerial system. The IAA policy is that unmanned aerial systems may not be flown without the operator receiving a specific permission from the IAA. New regulations, including a registry of UAVs over 1 kg were introduced in December 2015.  Singapore  In Singapore, laws were passed in Parliament in May 2015 to allay concerns over safety, security and privacy surrounding unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The Unmanned Aircraft (Public Safety and Security) Bill outlines regulations for the safe flying of drones and enforcement action against errant users. For instance, permits are required to fly drones above 7 kg, or within a 5 km radius of an aerodrome. Before conducting any outdoor activities, operators should ensure that the UA is flown within the permitted areas. The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) website provides a map delineating prohibited areas, danger and restricted areas, areas within 5 km of an airport or an airbase and protected areas. In general, permits are not required for recreational or research uses of UA in Singapore, as long as the operation of the UA is in line with CAAS‚Äô operating conditions. Situations where recreational or research uses of UA require a permit are when: * The total mass of UA including payload exceeds 7 kg (Operator permit and Class 1 Activity Permit required) * UA is flown higher than 200 feet above mean sea level (Class 2 Activity Permit required) * Within restricted, danger, protected, prohibited areas and within 5 km of an aerodrome / airbase (Class 2 Activity Permit required) Regardless of UA weight or location of UA operations, an operator permit and a Class 1 Activity Permit is required for operations that are non-recreational or non-research in nature. The permit application form can be found on the CAAS website. Depending on the nature of the flight or UA used, other possible permits that may be required from other agencies include: *Singapore Police Force (SPF) for aerial photography and/or overflight of security-sensitive locations *Info- communications Media Development Authority (IMDA) of Singapore for use of radio frequencies and power limits other than in IMDA's guidelines for short range devices.  South Africa  In April 2014, the South African Civil Aviation Authority announced that it would clamp down on the illegal flying of UAVs in South African airspace. They also stated that as they had not authorised any such flights, existing ones were being done illegally. A growth in the use of UAVs had prompted the SACAA to integrate them into South African airspace, but until regulations were in place, people operating them could be fined up to R50,000 and face up to 10 years prison. Following discussions between the South African Civil Aviation Authority and key role players such as operators, manufacturers and other airspace users, a set of draft regulations were submitted to the Minister of Transport for review and approval. The regulations were accepted by Dipuo Peters, the South African transport minister, and put into effect 1 July 2015. The regulations are called the Eighth Amendment of the South African Civil Aviation Regulations, 2015 http://www.caa.co.za/Remotely%20Piloted%20Aircraft%20Systems/Amendment%20of%20CAR%20-%20February%202015.pdf The new regulations focus strongly on safety aspects with UAVs not being allowed to fly higher than 120m or closer than 50 meters to a person or group of people without prior approval from the SACAA. Airspace restrictions also apply above and adjacent to: * Nuclear plants * Prisons * Police stations * Crime scenes * Court of law * National key points Manned aircraft always have the right of way and the passing of UAVs close to such aircraft are strictly prohibited. Pilots are required to tune into the air traffic services in which they are flying and all flight activity are required to be recorded in a logbook. Public roads may also not be used for take-off and landing. Another safety aspect prohibits UAVs to be used in adverse weather conditions where visibility will be impaired. Separate approval is required where line of sight is unmanageable or for night flying. Current regulations do not allow UAVs to be used for deliveries or for the transportation of goods. From a hobbyist point of view UAVs cannot tow other aircraft, perform aerobatic and aerial displays or be flown in a formation. UAV pilots are required to have a CAA approved and valid pilot licence and a letter of approval which is valid for 12 months. Any incidents should be reported to the relevant authorities, especially if serious damage or injury was caused. South Korea Under the local law as of 2016, drones are banned from many places in the country, especially from the northern parts of Seoul, where key government offices are clustered. Areas around military installations and nuclear power plants are also no-fly zones. Thailand All type of drones, except toy drones that are under 250 grams, have to be registered with the Civil Aviation Authority. The regulations cover nearly all forms of drone use from commercial and recreational to scientific. Drone users who failed to register their drones by 9 January 2018 could face up to five years in jail or a 100,000 baht (US$3100) fine. United Kingdom In August 2012, The U.K.'s Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) stated that it will require non-military drones larger than 20 kg to be able to automatically sense other aircraft and steer to avoid them. As of 2013, the CAA rules are that UAV aircraft less than 20 kilograms in weight must be in direct visual contact with the pilot, cannot fly within 150 meters of a congested area or within 50 meters of a person or vehicle, and cannot be used for commercial activity.Sclesinger, Fay (16 March 2013) \\"Animal activists to use drones in fight against illegal hunting\\" The Times, Page 17'; subscription required In July 2018, the CAA rules were updated to make it against the law to fly above and to make it against the law to fly your drone within of an airport or airfield boundary. On February 20, 2019, The Department for Transport announced a new legislation to extend the ‚Äòno-fly‚Äô zone around airports, banning drones from flying within of runways. United States The US Federal Aviation Administration has adopted the name unmanned aircraft (UA) to describe aircraft systems without a flight crew on board. To operate a UA for non-recreational purposes in the United States, according to the FAA users must obtain a Certificate of Authorization to operate in national airspace. The FAA may permit the use of UAs for commercial or business purposes in response to individual exemption requests. In December 2015 the FAA announced that all UAVs weighing more than 250 grams flown for any purpose must be registered with the FAA. The FAA's Interim Rule can be accessed here. This regulation goes into effect on December 21, 2015 and requires that hobby type UAV's between 250 grams and 55 pounds need to be registered no later than February 19, 2016. The FAA's registration portal for drones can be accessed here. Notable requirements of the new FAA UAV registration process include: * Effective December 21, 2015, if the UAV has never been operated in U.S. airspace (i.e. its first flight outside), eligible owners must register their UAV's prior to flight. If the UAV previously operated in U.S. airspace, it must be registered by February 19, 2016. * In order to use the registration portal, you must be 13 years of age or older. If the owner is less than 13 years old, then a parent or other responsible person must do the FAA registration. * Each registrant will receive a certificate of aircraft registration and a registration number and all UAV's must be marked with the FAA issued registration number. * The FAA registration requires a $5 fee, though the FAA is waiving the fee for the first 30 days of the new registration period - until January 20, 2016. The registration is good for 3 years, but can be renewed for an additional 3 years at the $5 rate. The new FAA rule provides that a single registration applies to as many UAVs as an owner/operator owns or operates. Failure to register can result in civil penalties of up to $27,500, and criminal penalties which could include fines up to $250,000 and/or imprisonment for up to three years. To show problems with the FAA process, in August, 2015 an attorney was able to get FAA approval for a commercial drone that was actually a battery powered paper airplane toy. Its controllable range is 120 feet (37 meters) and maximum flight time is 10 minutes. It is too underpowered to carry a camera.Lawyer gets FAA to approve paper airplane The December 2015 registration specifically excludes paper airplanes, Frisbees, and other flying objects that are not true UAVs. In addition to FAA certification, the regulation of usage of UA systems by government authorities in the United States for law enforcement purposes is determined at a state level. Uruguay In 2014, the government regulated UAVs. Machines under 25 kg do not require any operating licence, and have a maximum flight altitude of 120 meters within visual line of sight. Machines up to 260 kg must be registered, require an operator permit, and may have above 120 meters with permission from air traffic control. Machines above 260 kg are classified as aircraft, and require a full pilot licence.Aumentan \\"pilotos\\" uruguayos de drones, la mayor√≠a \\"irregulares\\" - Juan Pablo de Marco, El Pa√≠s, 26 December 2017 See also * References External links * UK CAA Regulations and Overview * South African Civil Aviation Authority * Civil Aviation Association of Singapore UAV ","title":"Regulation of unmanned aerial vehicles"},{"id":"45667609","text":"Paul Narita is a fictional character from the NBC Daytime soap opera, Days of Our Lives portrayed by Christopher Sean. Paul was created under head writers Gary Tomlin and Christopher Whitesell and introduced in November 2014 as a famous baseball player getting surgery on his shoulder. Paul flirts with every woman he sees but is eventually revealed to be the closeted ex-boyfriend of Sonny Kiriakis (Freddie Smith), whom Paul considers to be the love of his life. Though the surgery proves successful, Paul is unable to pitch again and finds comfort in the arms of journalist Will Horton (Guy Wilson) ‚Äì who has convinced Paul to come out in a magazine article. In addition to maintaining his image, Paul is afraid to come out fearing his family would not accept him. The series then introduces Paul's mother, Tori (Hira Ambrosino) who supports him even though she is afraid of the public backlash. In April 2015, Paul is revealed to be the son of long running character, John Black (Drake Hogestyn). The character of Paul was an immediate hit with fans and critics alike. Christopher Sean became a \\"breakout star\\" and Sean received critical acclaim for his portrayal. The romantic pairing of Paul and Sonny which became known as 'PaulSon' was an instant success with the audience and quickly became a big fan favorite, despite Paul coming in between the supercouple of Will and Sonny (WilSon). BuzzFeed said Paul as a gay Asian-American in daytime is a \\"groundbreaking\\" character. Storylines  2014‚Äì2015  Famous baseball player Paul Narita comes to Salem to undergo shoulder surgery as a patient of Daniel Jonas (Shawn Christian). Paul flirts heavily with hospital employees Abigail Deveraux (Kate Mansi), Theresa Donovan (Jen Lilley) and his physical therapist Jordan Ridgeway (Chrishell Stause). Paul checks into the hospital under an assumed name to hide his identity from the press. The surgery proves successful and Paul starts physical therapy. During his recovery, Paul has a brief fling with Theresa and they even make plans to go on a date despite Paul being on bed rest. However, Paul is shocked when he runs into his ex-boyfriend Sonny Kiriakis (Freddie Smith). Though Paul still has feelings for Sonny, Paul is not ready to come out and Sonny urges him to move on. Paul has already agreed to an exclusive interview with SONIX magazine about his return to baseball with journalist Will Horton (Guy Wilson). Paul invites Will to his private hotel room for the duration of the interview process. After Christmas, Paul learns that while he will regain normal use of his arm, he can never pitch again and he vents his frustrations to Will. To make matters worse, Paul is a free agent and now has no shot at being picked up by another team. Will convinces Paul to use the article instead to tell the world about his career ending injury and be a lesson to other players. Paul reaches out to Sonny and reveals he is ready to come out so they can be together only for Sonny to reveal he is married. However, Sonny encourages Paul to go forward with coming out. Will is quite shocked when Paul flirts with him as they share a bottle of champagne on New Year's Eve. Thanks to Derrick (Spencer Neville), a flirtatious bellboy, Paul learns Sonny tried to visit him on New Year's Eve. Paul believes Sonny has changed his mind about being together and Sonny admits that he briefly considered asking Paul for a loan to help keep his club afloat. Paul knows they still have a connection but Sonny urges him to move on. Knowing Paul is holding back, Will wants to do a follow up interview. Taking his cue from the flirting, Will asks Paul if he is gay. Paul responds by kissing Will and they sleep together on January 8, 2015. Will immediately regrets their tryst and goes to shower when Sonny stops by to return Paul's first home-run baseball. Paul lets him keep the ball and tries to rush him out of the room as Will turns off the shower and Sonny realizes Paul was with someone. Paul believes he has ruined his chances with Sonny. Will then asks Paul to consider coming out in the expos√© to be a role model to kids and athletes like him but Paul hesitates. Paul informs Sonny that his career is over and Sonny tries to comfort Paul then calls him out for still being afraid to go public about his sexuality. After much hesitation, Paul finally agrees to come out in the interview and he even opens to Will about the man he loved that proposed to him. Paul tells Will that he hasn't told his family about his plans to come out yet and Will urges him to make sure they hear it from him. Paul agrees but wants to wait until the article's publication is out of his control fearing his mother might talk him out of it. Later, Paul calls his mother Tori (Hira Ambrosino) and his grandfather Hiro (Yoshio Moriwaki) inform them that he is coming out. Tori admits that she was always aware of Paul's sexuality but thought it would be safer if he stayed in the closet. Paul and Tori are nervous about telling the very old and traditional Hiro and they're relieved when he also supports Paul. Days before the article is published, Paul donates blood to the hospital. Paul is shocked to learn that Sonny was stabbed and Sonny's mother Adrienne (Judi Evans) thanks him because his donation saves her son. Paul later starts therapy sessions with Marlena Evans (Deidre Hall). Paul makes plans to leave town but he wants to see Sonny before he leaves. He presents the article and a furious Sonny reveals that Will is his husband and kicks him out of his hospital room. Though Paul is unaware of the connection, Will believes Paul told Sonny about the affair to break up his marriage. Paul tries to confide in Marlena, but she refers him to another doctor when she reveals that she is actually Will's grandmother. Paul is ready to leave town when John Black (Drake Hogestyn) asks him to participate in a charity benefit for underprivileged kids. Paul agrees to stay and Tori makes him promise to leave town immediately after the charity benefit. John witnesses a close moment between Paul and Sonny and orders him not to interfere in Will and Sonny's marriage. Paul and Will's affair is publicly exposed during Will and Sonny's anniversary celebration in the town square. John accuses Paul of seducing Will and then going after Sonny unaware of their history. Sonny later informs Paul that Tori is hiding the truth about his paternity and Paul confronts her at Sonny's club where he and John come to the realization that they are father and son. Paul goes back to San Francisco and John follows. His grandfather encourages Paul to build a relationship with John and Paul agrees. Paul is hesitant about returning to Salem not wanting to cause trouble for Sonny. However, Sonny's father Justin (Wally Kurth) endorses a relationship between Sonny and Paul as he believes Paul can make his son happy. Paul is very honest about his feelings for Sonny which upsets Will. Later, Will's grandmother Kate Roberts (Lauren Koslow) offers Paul a job as the spokesperson for a new men's fashion line for MAD World Cosmetics‚Äîon Justin's behalf. Paul agrees to walk away from the offer if Sonny is uncomfortable but Sonny encourages him to take the job. Paul continues to bond with John and his half-brother Brady (Eric Martsolf) who has recently welcomed his son, Tate. Paul tries to comfort Sonny when Will is strangled and believed dead, and feels guilty for contributing to the destruction of their marriage. Paul lands another modeling gig when Kate, Theresa and Nicole Walker (Arianne Zucker) take over John's former fashion house, Basic Black and he ends up working opposite Gabi Hernandez (Camila Banus) ‚Äì Will's ex-girlfriend. Paul encourages John to search for his biological parents and helps obtain information from one of Paul's former classmates.  2016‚Äì2018  Paul supports his father and meets his half-sister Belle (Martha Madison) when Brady is involved in a near fatal car accident and receives a heart transplant. In March 2016, Paul is kidnapped by the mysterious Yo Ling (Tobin Bell) who reveals himself to be John's presumed dead biological father‚ÄîTim Robicheaux. Yo Ling has brainwashed Paul in an attempt to force him to do his bidding, but John rescues him with the help of Eduardo Hernandez (A Martinez). In May 2016, Paul is hospitalized with a severe fever and quarantined at the hospital, where it is revealed that Yo Ling has injected Paul with a bio-toxin to cause havoc. Paul, Gabi, Arianna and several others are near death when the doctors produce a successful antidote. Paul later goes to work for John as a private investigator and in the summer of 2016, Paul is reunited with Sonny, who has returned to town. In September 2016, Paul takes a bullet for John when his longtime foe Orpheus (George DelHoyo) crashes Brady's wedding looking for revenge. Though he recovers, Paul is injured again when Orpheus and his accomplices detonate several bombs in town. Sonny revives Paul and gets him to the hospital. In 2017, Paul gets engaged to Sonny, and they plan a double wedding with Chad DiMera and Abigail Deveraux. In October 2017, Ben Weston (Robert Scott Wilson) crashes the wedding to announce that Will is still alive. Though Chad and Abigail do get married, Sonny insists on waiting to see if the news about Will is true. Paul joins Sonny and Will's family in the ensuing hunt to find out if Will is alive, which takes them all to Memphis. When Paul sees Will (now Chandler Massey) serving in a bar there, he initially tells no one, because he is afraid to lose Sonny to Will. When he does confess to Sonny, Sonny dashes off to find Will. Will has total amnesia, and does not remember Sonny, Paul, or any of his family. When he learns he has been lied to about who he is, he comes home to Salem. Amnesiac Will finds himself attracted to Paul. When Will learns that he cheated on Sonny with Paul, he rushes to Paul's apartment to ask Paul about it, and kisses Paul. Paul, who wants to keep his relationship with Sonny, is not invested in Will remembering his former life. This makes Paul even more attractive to Will, who appreciates his lack of expectations since he is under pressure from his loved ones to remember his past. Sonny, however, is very keen for Will to remember him and their love, and breaks up with Paul so he can pursue Will. Will does not want to be married to a man he does not remember, so he divorces Sonny and begins pursuing Paul. Paul, still in love with Sonny, initially rejects Will's advances, but in truth, he is very sympathetic to Will's situation of having no memory of his life and family, and he extends the hand of friendship to him. They become good friends, and when Paul suspects his father John of poisoning Sonny's uncle, Steve Johnson (Stephen Nichols), Paul and Will investigate together. Their adventure brings them close, and Paul develops feelings for Will. They start dating, and fall in love. Paul selflessly tries to help Will regain his memories by injecting him with an experimental serum. Will assures Paul repeatedly that he loves only Paul now, and regaining his memories will not change his love and total devotion to Paul. However, when his memories do return, Will finds that he cannot ignore his deep love for Sonny. Meanwhile, Paul saves Sami from being shot by Kristen DiMera (Stacy Haiduk), but he falls out a window and lands three stories down. In critical condition, Paul is saved in surgery, but he is paralyzed from the waist down. Will professes his love to Sonny, which is overheard by a furious Brady. He demands that Will not abandon Paul when he needs all the support they can give him. Will does not tell Paul that his memory has returned, and ultimately decides to stay with Paul. When Will does reveal that he has his memories back, he reassures Paul that nothing has changed between them, but Will and Sonny are tortured by their decision to stay apart. Will and Paul are moving into a new apartment together when Brady tells Paul that Will is in love with Sonny. Paul confronts Will, who admits that it is true. A devastated Paul decides to return to San Francisco, where a new program may be able to restore his ability to walk. Development Casting and creation In February 2014, the series put out a casting call for an actor between the ages of 24 and 35 to play the role of Micah, who was initially supposed to be African American. There was initial speculation that the series was looking to recast the role of Cameron Davis, a role previously played by Nathan Owens. In September, the producers reissued the casting call for the same role looking for a fully Hispanic or partly Hispanic actor. The character would start out as a recurring role with the potential to become contract. Shortly after, the casting notice was reissued for Hispanic or Asian actors to fill the role. In October 2014, several reports surfaced that actor Christopher Sean had been cast in the role of baseball player Paul Narita and would debut on November 7, 2014. A former Mr. Asia USA, Sean was known for his appearances in the web series, The Lizzie Bennet Diaries, Hollywood Heights, The Mindy Project and Hawaii Five-O. Sean's previous experience in daytime included two episodes of The Bold and the Beautiful in 2010. Of the casting process, Christopher Sean said, \\"It's pretty crazy the way it worked out.\\" He continued, \\"But in essence, they didn't know what they wanted, and luckily, I was chosen.\\" Sean further explained \\"It was a really big casting call.\\" According to casting director Marnie Saitta, \\"it came down to a group of Asian boys, a group of black boys, a group of white boys, and there was a large amount of all of them.\\" They narrowed the search down to three actors, one from each race. The three actors did a network test opposite Freddie Smith who played Sonny. Even then, the producers were still not sure of what direction to go. During his second callback, Sean was asked if he was comfortable with playing a gay character, which he was. However, Sean was very unfamiliar with the genre and questioned if he was making the right choice by taking the role. Sean's manager assured him the role would stir up controversy as a gay professional athlete in the closet. Sean quickly realized what the role could do for him as an actor. \\"This is bigger than me. If they actually do choose me, I'd be honored,\\" he said. However, it was Sean's ability to speak Japanese that helped him book the role. At the request of the casting director, Sean sent in a video of himself speaking Japanese. Sean's agent then informed him that he had been booked. Archetypes and characterization Unlike most of the archetypal portrayals of Asian men on television of the time, Paul is not lacking in sex appeal. Ira Madison III from BuzzFeed said \\"Asian-American men on television have long been relegated to sidekick status\\" and the character of Paul goes against that trend. He is \\"meant to have sex appeal and his love life plays out on screen\\" Madison continued. Paul is the first character of his kind‚Äîa gay Asian-American male character in a lead role‚Äîin daytime. Madison also noted that \\"Paul didn't have to abandon his Japanese ancestry to have the spotlight\\" but Days instead \\"embraced it\\" by having Paul come out to his grandfather in Japanese. Christopher Sean likened his character's sex appeal to that of Steven Yeun's Glenn Rhee on The Walking Dead. When Paul's connection to Sonny was revealed, \\"[Paul] became one of three prominent gay Asian characters on broadcast television,\\" along with Oliver Hampton (Conrad Ricamora) on How to Get Away With Murder and Brad Cooper (Parry Shen) on General Hospital. However, the character of Paul is the only series regular. Madison said Paul can easily be compared to the Oliver Hampton character, but the difference is that Paul's sex scenes actually drive story. The initial casting notice described the character as \\"charismatic confident and charming without even trying. Ladies want to date him and men want to be him. He gives off a very well rounded confident vibe but there is pain in his past that keeps him guarded.\\" The second casting described the character as \\"charming and honest, which makes women just melt at his feet. He's got plenty of courage, which creates a wild and thrilling aura.\\" The final casting notice called for a Hispanic or Asian actor with \\"fantastic looks and killer charm making him irresistible. He is masculine and charming but authentic so as not to come off as a 'playa' or slick.\\" Christopher Sean described Paul as being \\"aware of his emotions\\" and \\"intelligent.\\" Sean also described Paul as \\"extremely charismatic.\\" Because of his success as an athlete, Paul is \\"accustomed to and enjoys the spotlight.\\" Paul \\"loves to play with everyone.\\" He's got some \\"real spunk\\" Sean said. Paul is \\"all about being respectful and honorable.\\" However, Christopher Sean admitted that Paul can be so honest, that it raises suspicion among those around him. Coming out and triangle While there was initial speculation that Paul would be a love interest for Theresa Donovan (Jen Lilley), it was quickly revealed that Paul was the closeted ex-boyfriend of Sonny Kiriakis (Smith). When it comes to Sonny, \\"His intentions are as honorable as he possibly can make them\\" said Sean. Paul is questioning whether he can actually have a future with Sonny, considering the past they have shared. During an interview, Paul discusses a \\"lost love\\" with journalist Will Horton (Wilson). At the same time, Paul is very cautious about who he allows into his inner circle despite advances from bellboy Derrick (Spencer Neville) and he still has lingering feelings for Sonny. Paul wants to keep a low profile fearing his sexuality could not only cost him his career, but also cause a rift in his family. In an interview with Daytime Royal Online, Christopher Sean explained that sexual orientation was \\"taboo\\" in the Japanese culture. Though they were supportive, Sean revealed he had to have his own \\"coming out\\" of sorts when he told his family about the role. It was even more nerve-racking for the actor because of his dad who is in the military where the subject is very much \\"taboo.\\" In an interview with Michael Logan for Soap Opera Digest, Christopher Sean said he was shocked when he learned from co-executive producer Lisa de Cazotte that Paul's relationship with Will would become sexual. He was worried about how fans would react to Paul causing trouble for such a popular couple like Will and Sonny. Meanwhile, Sean himself immediately questioned Paul's motives in sleeping with Will. However, \\"Paul is not the villain in this triangle,\\" he said. \\"The only thing Paul is guilty of is wanting a human connection,\\" Sean continued. \\"He wants love\\" the actor declared. When Paul loses his ability to play baseball, he reaches out to Sonny‚Äîwho rejects him because he is married‚Äîand then he reaches out to Will. When Paul and Will's affair occurs on January 8, 2015, not only does Paul not know Will is married, he is also unaware that Will is married Paul's \\"only love\\" Sonny. Sean described the scenes as \\"pretty hectic\\" and \\"very sexual.\\" He continued, \\"There's lovemaking and then there's sex -- and Paul and Will are having the latter.\\" By revealing that he is gay, Paul accomplishes his intended goal of being a \\"role model.\\" After their tryst, Paul develops a \\"mutual respect\\" for Will because Will helps him with coming out. Paul develops a certain \\"admiration\\" for Will. When it comes to Paul's feelings for Will, Sean explained \\"it's one of those things, as an adult, you experience somebody, and you know whether or not it works.\\" Despite their history, Paul and Will make the choice to \\"move forward and be professional.\\" At the same time, Paul still longs for a future with Sonny, but Sean admitted they'd have to work through their differences once the about the affair comes out. But Paul has \\"true love\\" for Sonny. As far as Paul is concerned, \\"Sonny is his other half.\\" When the article comes out and Paul, Sonny and Will finally connect the dots, it gets \\"rocky.\\" Though Paul is all about \\"honor,\\" with Will and Sonny at odds, Paul has a little bit of hope for a future with Sonny. Paternity Shortly before Christopher Sean's debut as Paul, Serial Scoop also reported that the series was looking to cast the role of Paul's mother, Tori Narita. In January 2015, it was announced that Hira Ambrosino had been cast in the role of Tori Narita. With Tori's arrival comes speculation about Paul's paternity. While Sean refused to confirm or deny the rumors, he looked forward to potentially working with the veterans of the cast. In an interview with TheBacklot.com, Christopher Sean said \\"there's going to be quite the plot point introduced with [Tori] coming.\\" While Sean was aware of the coming paternity storyline and its outcome due to the show taping episodes six months ahead, Sean wanted to maintain \\"tunnel vision\\" to \\"focus on what Paul knows only.\\" Tori immediately encourages Paul to leave Salem, but he refuses. Paul loves and respects his mother, but he has to live his life. However, Paul has no clue that his father actually in Salem. During an interview with TV Insider released in April 2015, Drake Hogestyn officially confirmed that John and Paul were indeed father and son conceived during John and Tori's brief affair years earlier. John would become a priest sometime after the affair which is why Tori keeps quiet. With the revelation of his paternity, Paul finally gets the chance to \\"fill that void\\" left by him growing up without a father.

It was built in 1789 by John Clark, a local textile mill owner and clergyman. It passed through successive generations of the Clark family until it was sold by auction in about 1920 to Wiltshire County Council, who used it firstly for Children's Services and later as flats. The house became a hotel in 1978. John and Catherine Clark Reverend John Clerk Reverend John Clark (1746‚Äì1808) was born in Frome, Somerset in 1746. His father John Clark (1702‚Äì1780) had business interests in several fields. He owned a brewery in Frome, a clothier business in Trowbridge and also had half shares in several ships.Beckinsale, R. P. \\"The Trowbridge Woollen Industry\\" Wiltshire Record Society, Vol 6, 1951, p. ix. The Clark clothier firm in Trowbridge was almost exclusively concerned with the manufacture of cloth from fine Spanish merino wool. John took over this business and greatly extended it. It stretched from Rockley in Wiltshire to Kintbury in Berkshire, where he had a dye house, and to the many villages in the Avon Valley near Trowbridge. He frequently went to London to sell his cloth. He became interested in religion and was the first pastor of the Tabernacle Church in Trowbridge, which he helped to establish. He also was interested in music and was described by one historian as a \\"man of deep piety, a musician of no mean order and a fair poet. He was versed in astronomy and had his own observatory at his residence Polebarn House, where he also built and installed an organ.Goodrich, P. J. 1932 \\"Goodrich and its times\\", p. 67 John married Catherine Norris in 1779 in Bath. John's father died the following year in 1780 and he and his brother Joseph inherited considerable wealth.

P. \\"The Trowbridge Woollen Industry\\" Wiltshire Record Society, Vol 6, 1951, p. x. In 1801 when his nephews came of age he made them apprentices in the firm and agreed to give them a substantial amount of money after three years if they wished to go into partnership with each other. They did this and formed the company J and T Clark which was a successful clothier business in Trowbridge for many years.

His second in command was Maj P. Drotsky and the RSM P. Snyders. In the late 1990s, the SA Department of Defence decided to group various environments together, elements, which it felt belonged together such as the environments of telecommunication, information technology (IT), registries, documentation services, libraries and electronic warfare, in other words, all forms of communication. This led to the establishment of the joint-service Command and Management Information Systems Division (CMIS Division) on 1 April 1999, its task being to deliver communications and info systems for the entire SANDF.

She worked for the Signals Intelligence Service throughout World War II, during which time she played an important role in deciphering the Japanese cryptography machine Purple, and later worked on the Cold War-era Venona project.  Career  Feinstein discovered a passion for mathematics at a young age and aspired to become a math teacher. She graduated from the University at Buffalo summa cum laude in February 1936 with a mathematics degree. Unable to find a teaching job, she took a position as a statistical clerk at the Railroad Retirement Board. Her high score on a civil service mathematics test in 1939 got the attention of William F. Friedman, who hired her to work as a junior cryptanalyst for the Army's Signals Intelligence Service (SIS). For eighteen months, she worked with other SIS codebreakers to analyze the encryption system used in the Japanese Type B Cipher Machine, code named Purple by the SIS She played a key role in cracking the cipher, discovering cyclical behavior in the code on September 20, 1940. This enabled the construction of an equivalent machine by the SIS which in turn enabled the interception of almost all messages exchanged between the Japanese government and its embassies in foreign countries. Purple-encoded reports from Hiroshi Oshima, the Japanese ambassador in Berlin, were a main source of intelligence about Axis plans. She was later assigned to the Venona project, trying to decode encrypted messages sent by the Soviet KGB and Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU). She made a significant breakthrough in November 1944, which allowed American cryptographers to recognize when an individual one time pad cipher was (improperly) reused.

The father of India's capital markets took Nathwani under his wings at a time when Reliance was planning the world's the largest single location greenfield refinery at Moti Khavdi near Jamnagar. Nathwani helped in realizing Dhirubhai's dream, literally. He played a pivotal role in removing hurdles in land acquisition and facilitated setting up of the refinery. That was the turning point of his life. The task was herculean. But, Nathwani worked round the clock in rural areas of Jamnagar, dealing with farmers, developing personal rapport with each of them to help Reliance acquire 10,000 acres land. The most important thing was that the land was acquired with consent of all the farmers. Having tested his potential in Jamnagar, Reliance bosses relocated Nathwani at Ahmedabad and entrusted bigger responsibilities and assignment to operate on a bigger canvas in 1997.

It was designed by Francis Drummond Greville Stanley and built from 1881 to 1924 by Southall & Tracey. It is also known as Queensland National Bank. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Queensland National Bank Limited, Brisbane, circa 1887 This large masonry building was constructed 1881-1885 as the new Head Office for the successful and influential Queensland National Bank. The burgeoning gold mining industry of the early 1870s created a mood of optimism and a desire for increased development capital, free from inter-colonial and overseas control. Seizing on this mood, eight prominent local businessmen and politicians formed the Queensland National Bank (QN Bank) in March 1872. Immediate widespread support of the bank exceeded expectations and the continuing patronage of powerful political figures ensured its prominence. When Thomas McIlwraith, a Queensland National Bank director, became Premier in 1879, he swiftly transferred the Queensland Government accounts to the Bank. In December 1872, the Queensland National Bank, which was leasing Warry's Store in Queen Street, purchased the North Brisbane School of Arts land and building at the corner of Queen and Creek Streets for the sum of , as the site for the bank's new Head Office. The bank's lease on Warry's building was not to run out until June 1879 and in the meantime, the School of Arts Committee leased back its original building from the bank. Choosing an appropriate design for the new building proved to be a long and complicated process. Francis Drummond Greville Stanley, the Queensland Colonial Architect, informed the QN Bank in 1877 that he intended to go into private practice, and the bank's board of directors asked him to design the new head office. However, Stanley did not resign at that time, and the Bank engaged Reed and Barnes of Melbourne to design the building. In August 1878 a plan was adopted with some alterations. More than eight months later, however, Reed and Barnes were requested to sell the plans so Stanley could carry out the design on a reduced scale. With a cheque for 100 guineas for their services, Reed and Barnes reluctantly took their plans back rather than sell them. In the same month, Stanley presented his plans to the bank with a cost estimate of . Tenders were called for the erection of the building in February 1881 and Messrs Southall and Tracey were successful with a cost of . Clerk of Works for the project was John Daniel Heal, publican, building contractor, stonemason and ex-Mayor of Brisbane (1879). Foreman of works for Southall and Tracey was longtime employee William Relf. The foundation stone was laid in July 1881 but delays for want of building materials, particularly the New Zealand stone, extended the construction period by almost 18 months. It was completed by August 1885. Queensland sandstone, mainly from the Murphy Creek quarries, (specifically selected by Alexander Innes, stonemason and late foreman of the quarries) was used in the construction of the building. New Zealand Oamaru limestone was imported for the Corinthian columns of the Queen and Creek Streets frontages. The mantle pieces and the marble for the entrance hall were purchased by Lt-Colonel Edward Robert Drury, the bank's general manager, while he was in the United Kingdom during 1883-84. The upper floors provided a lavish suite for the manager, while the lower floors accommodated banking chambers and offices. Drury also selected much of the furniture still extant on the bank's upper floors. A passenger lift was installed in the 1890s and electricity replaced gas for the building lighting around the same time. Manuel Hornibrook, Master Builder, was contracted for the carrying out of extensive additions and the remodelling of the banking chamber during the early months of 1924. Honour boards were installed in the bank after World War I and World War II, to commemorate employees who served in the wars. Despite the 1890s economic depression and a major political scandal late in the same decade, the QN Bank prospered, retaining the Queensland Government accounts until 1920. Competition with nationally based banks saw a profit decline during the next two decades. The QN Bank merged with The National Bank of Australasia Limited in 1947 and its successor, the National Australia Bank, now owns the premises. In recognition of the bank's decision not to redevelop the site during the 1970s, the National Trust of Queensland presented it with the John Herbert Award 1975-76. In 1981 considerable refurbishment and restoration of the building took place. Subsequently, only minor works have been carried out. In 2006, the National Australia Bank sold the building to Trinity Group (later known as Unity Pacific Group). Trinity Group refurbished the bank building (known as The Chambers) and constructed an adjoining 8-storey office building (known as The Tower) at the rear of the building at 88 Creek Street, replacing a 1920s extension. The architects were for the project were Donovan Hill and the work was carried out under the supervision of conservation architect Robert Riddel. The Tower was completed in 2008. Trinity used the buildings as its national headquarters, leasing the banking chamber on the ground floor back to the National Australia Bank and as well as offering other office tenancies. In 2016, Primewest purchased The Chambers and The Tower for $37.4 million from Unity Pacific Group. In December 2019 the University of Queensland purchased The Chambers and The Tower at a total cost of $47.4 million. The buildings will form part of the university's Brisbane CBD campus.  Description  Banking chamber, 1922 Glass ceiling in the banking chamber, circa 1889 Office, circa 1889 The former Queensland National Bank building is a three-storeyed brick structure with sandstone facings, built in the Classical Revival style which was common in bank architecture of the period. The building has a distinct Palladian influence with careful classical detailing and giant order columns. It is built on a corner, and the two facades are dominated by bays of Corinthian columns which rise through the upper two storeys. This portion of the Queen Street facade protrudes in the form of a porch while the similar colonnade on Creek Street is recessed. The ground floor level has a plinth with arched openings set between groups of pilasters. Recessed behind the balconies of the upper-level central bays are more openings. Local sandstone was mainly used as the wall facing material and the pilasters, and locally grown cedar for the main entry doors, while the giant order Corinthian columns are imported Oamaru limestone. These columns rise from the first floor balcony. The pediment which originally surmounted the Queen Street facade was replaced by a brick and concrete oblong in 1915. The building has a high degree of integrity externally and internally including original furnishings. It has many grand spaces including the Banking Chamber with its glazed roof and supporting columns, the Formal Dining Room, and the Board Room. The lift with its surrounding stair is a major feature of the building. First and Second World War Honour Boards are located to either side of the entry and face into the main banking chamber (see First World War Honour Board, National Australia Bank (308 Queen Street)).  Heritage listing  Aerial view, Queen Street to the left, Creek Street to the right, 2020 National Australia Bank was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The former Queensland National Bank head office is important in demonstrating the pattern of Queensland's history, being a major symbol of the economic growth in Queensland of the 1880s and a reflection of the close relationship between the Queensland National Bank and the Queensland Government at that time. The Honour Board is important in demonstrating the evolution of Queensland's history, being a reflection of a sentiment that saw its expression in the public chronicling of the names of all servicemen. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The former Queensland National Bank head office demonstrates a rare aspect of Queensland's history, being a substantial and important 1880s commercial building in the Brisbane central business district which has retained a high degree of external and internal intactness, including much of the original furniture and fixture. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The former Queensland National Bank head office is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a substantial commercial building in the Classical Revival style, distinguished by the quality of its detailing and materials. The Honour Board is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a commemorative memorial erected by an employer in honour of employees who saw active service during the First World War and of the elaborate memorial metalwork carried out by Sydney firm Wunderlich Ltd. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The former Queensland National Bank head office is important in exhibiting a range of aesthetic characteristics valued by the community, in particular its streetscape value on a prominent corner in Brisbane's central business district and its expression of the elan and the solidity which the Queensland National Bank attempted to project in the early 1880s and its high degree of external and internal intactness. The Honour Board exhibits in the elaborate art metalwork an aesthetic quality valued by the community. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The former Queensland National Bank head office has a special association with the life and work of prominent Queensland architect, FDG Stanley, being one of the finest works attributed to him and with the Queensland National Bank's first General Manager, Lt-Colonel ER Drury, being evidence of his power and influence both in the bank and in Queensland in the last quarter of the 19th century.

Early life Bryant was born on 27 June 1920 in Bristol, South West England. At age four, her father died and she emigrated to Melbourne, Australia, with her mother, who was a professional singer. In 1932, the family relocated to Sydney after Bryant's mother remarried. As a teenager, Bryant was featured on the local radio show The Youth Show. Career Bryant began her career as an actress playing minor characters in film as The Broken Melody (1938) and Gone to the Dogs (1939). Her film breakthrough came when she played the lead character in Forty Thousand Horsemen (1940), which was the \\"first Australian film to win international success\\". Reportedly discovered by screenwriter Elsie Blake- Wilkins, she was described by the film's director Charles Chauvel as \\"the most important film personality discovered in Australia since Errol Flynn\\". In June 1941, while in Singapore promoting Forty Thousand Horsemen, Bryant fell in love with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer sales manager Maurice \\"Red\\" Silverstein (died 1999), and they got married a few days later in Sydney; the couple would go on to have three children. She became pregnant with her first child in 1942 and had to withdraw from her role as Carol Beldon (later played by Teresa Wright) in Mrs. Miniver. Bryant was initially chosen to play the female lead in Jungle Captive (1945). However, due to a combination of factors, including her inability to find a babysitter for her then two-year-old son, her disengaged attitude, and her falling sick during production, Bryant was ultimately replaced by Amelita Ward. Later years In her later years, Bryant spent her time campaigning for humanitarian aid. She founded the Foundation for the Peoples of the South Pacific (FSP) together with her husband and Australian Marist priest Stan Hosie in 1966; at the time of her death, the organisation had some sixty branches worldwide. Bryant and Hosie were awarded the Humanitarian Service Award by Hillary Rodham Clinton in 2000. Bryant died on 3 October 2005 in Seattle, Washington, aged 85.

It was established in 1858, and in 1982 merged with the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney to form National Australia Bank. History In 1858, Alexander Gibb, a Melbourne gentleman, enlisted Andrew Cruickshank, a local merchant and pastoralist, to raise the capital to establish National Bank of Australasia with headquarters in Melbourne. The legal work establishing the bank was performed by a predecessor of King & Wood Mallesons. Cruickshank became its first chairman while Gibb left after being passed over for the position of General Manager. The bank opened its first branch in South Australia the same year. Expansion to other Australian states followed, with branches opening in Tasmania (1859), Western Australia (1866), New South Wales (1885) and finally Queensland (1920). An early branch established in Mauritius (1859) closed within a year, but a London branch (1864) was established to handle financing and payment for Australian exports of wool, gold and other commodities, and imports to Australia, was more successful. National Bank of Australasia was one of many banks that closed its doors during the banking crisis of 1893. Director John Grice was active in the crisis, from which the bank re-emerged as a public limited company, incorporated on 23 June 1893. For the next half century, growth was stimulated by a number of acquisitions: * Colonial Bank of Australasia (est. 1856) in 1918, bringing additional branches in Victoria and New South Wales. * Bank of Queensland in 1922, with branches in Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria. The Bank of Queensland was itself result of the merger in 1917 of Royal Bank of Queensland (est. 1886) and Bank of North Queensland (est. 1888). * Queensland National Bank (est. 1872) in 1948, with branches in Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria. * Ballarat Banking Company (est. 1865) in 1955 The bank opened a representative office in Tokyo in 1946, later upgraded to a branch in 1985. The bank's overseas interest expanded more rapidly in the 1970s. It opened a branch in Singapore in 1971, and representative offices in Jakarta (1973) and Hong Kong (1974). It took minority interests in merchant banks in these locations at the same time, and in Hong Kong established a 50‚Äì50 joint venture merchant bank with Mitsubishi Bank and Trust, but withdrew from these arrangements in 1984. Its first US presence was established in 1977 with a branch and an agency in Los Angeles that closed in 1993.

He was the first general manager of the Queensland National Bank which played a major role in Queensland finance in the late 19th century. Early life Edward Robert Drury was born in 1832 in Brussels, Belgium, the son of the Rev. William Drury (chaplain to the British Embassy in Brussels and tutor of Leopold II of Belgium) and his wife Anne (n√©e Nicholas). Drury immigrated to Australia in 1852. Business career Drury was employed by the Bank of Australasia in 1853. In 1860 he was promoted to manager of their Brisbane branch. In 1872, he was appointed the general manager of the new Queensland National Bank, a role he held until his death in 1896. He was the President of the Australian Association of Bankers from June 1894 to June 1895. Drury was professionally and personally committed to promoting development of the colony of Queensland. In both his banking role at the Queensland National Bank and his personal business activities, he was very involved with investment in mining, agriculture and land development. In addition to his banking career, he was the Consul for Belgium for which he was made a Knight of the Order of Leopold. Military career When the Crimean War broke out in 1854, Drury was one of the first to volunteer for the New South Wales Volunteer Rifles. On 15 November 1860, he received his commission as captain. He excelled at rifle shooting and won a silver medal in an 1854 Queensland competition of the National Rifle Association of England. He was a founder of the Queensland Rifle Association. In 1876 he was gazetted as a major in the Queensland Volunteer Artillery. In 1884 he was promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel and took command of the field artillery. In 1891 he became a Colonel and served as Commandant of the Queensland Defence Force on a number of occasions. In 1885, he was made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George for his contribution to colonial defence. He was one of the oldest officers on the active list. Later life Edward Robert Drury died at his holiday home Saltwood at Shorncliffe on 3 February 1896 aged 63 years following an illness of 10 days. He was survived by his wife and eight children (four sons and four daughters). On the following day (4 February 1896), his body was carried on a special train from Sandgate railway station to Brisbane's Central railway station where a full military guard waited. The streets were lined with spectators; indeed, the police had difficult keeping order at the railway station due to the extent of public interest. The military procession then slow-marched from the railway station through the streets of the Brisbane CBD to the Toowong Cemetery where he was interred. The procession was led by many branches of the defence forces, followed by his coffin on a gun carriage and his riderless war horse, after which came the carriages of the many mourners accompanied by military bands playing solemn tunes. Legacy His holiday home Saltwood is now listed on the Queensland Heritage Register. The family home \\"Hawstead\\" he built in 1876, originally perched on the edge of the Brisbane River in New Farm, Bowen Terrace. According to Brisbane City Council, this home was cut in half and removed from its original dwelling place in 1969 to make way for high rise apartments. It is unknown where the house was relocated to until 2002 when it was brought to acreage at Ajinby Close, Thornlands. It was rejoined, re-stumped and renovated. It stands proud today as a family home, cared for with many of its original features remaining intact. The home is not able to be Heritage listed as it was removed from its original site.

Against his best friend, Cee's, warnings, G-low takes a chance and joins forces with Slice. With a car full of illegal drugs, Slice intentionally runs a red light and they are picked up by the police. During his interrogations, G-low begins to second guess himself and the interrogation tests his mettle and takes a toll on him. Meanwhile, during his detainment, Slice conspires with cop Detective.

Feeling the pressure of being incarcerated and interrogated, G-low allows himself to be blackmailed by Det. Jones and agrees to pay him $5,000, and then plans to run. Slice figures that G-low will run, leave Sharon behind, and then he can blame G-low for the missing drugs when it comes time to answer to their supplier's inevitable inquiries about his missing drugs and money. And, of course- Slice figures he could win back Sharon, even though he has a very jealous live-in girlfriend, Lisa.

This is when G-low learns that there were three kilos in the car- not two like he originally thought. It dawns on G-low that Slice has set him up. As he's coming out of Rico's apartment, he runs into Slice who realizes the cat is out of the bag. Up until now, neither detective was aware that his partner has a non-kosher relationship with their respective detainees, which feeds into the distrust between Slice and G-low. Slice figures out that there's something fishy and pays Detective Monroe a visit to get the rest of the drugs Monroe was holding, and to kill him. His next target is G-low. G-low now has more problems than he ever expected. Sharon leaves him in the midst of the chaos and he is still left to deal with a crooked cop, who upped the ante on him, and a former business partner with a major personal vendetta against him.

A common name is Rusby's primrose. This species was first collected by Henry Hurd Rusby in the Mogollon Mountains in the New Mexico Territory of the time (now the state New Mexico), Edward Lee Greene used these specimens as the holotype with which to describe P. rusbyi in 1881. The species occurs from the southern Rockies in the United States through Mexico probably down to northern Guatemala. In the USA it occurs in Arizona and New Mexico. Although the range in the USA appears to be split into disjunct populations, this may be an artefact of ignoring the Mexican distribution. Some plants from the Sandia Mountains of New Mexico have a longer corolla than the calyx, unlike the nominate type; these were described as Primula ellisiae in 1902 by Theodore Dru Alison Cockerell from a 1900 collection by Charlotte Cortlandt Ellis in the area of her family's ranch. However, individual plants with this phenotype grow together with plants having the normal form flowers, and no genetic distinctiveness was found between forms.

It is located about 2,830 light-years (870 parsecs, or nearly km) from Earth in the constellation Cygnus. The exoplanet was found by using the transit method, in which the dimming effect that a planet causes as it crosses in front of its star is measured. Characteristics Mass, radius and temperature Kepler-432b is a hot super-Jupiter, an exoplanet that has a radius and mass larger than that of the planet Jupiter, and with an extremely high temperature. It has a temperature of .HEC: Exoplanets Calculator The luminosity of Kepler-432 is 9.2 , when this and the orbital period (for planet b is around 52 days) are put in, yields a temperature of It has a mass of 5.41 and a radius of 1.45 . It also has a relatively high density for such a planet, at 4.46 g cm3. Host star The planet orbits a (K-type) giant star named Kepler-432 A. It has exhausted the hydrogen in its core and has begun expanding into a red giant. The star has a mass of 1.32 and a radius of 4.06 . It has a surface temperatures of 4995 K and is 4.2 billion years old. In comparison, the Sun is about 4.6 billion years old and has a surface temperature of 5778 K. The star's apparent magnitude, or how bright it appears from Earth's perspective, is 13. It is too dim to be seen with the naked eye. Orbit Kepler-432b orbits its host star with 920% of the Sun's luminosity (9.2 ) about every 52 days at a distance of 0.30 AU (close to the orbital distance of Mercury from the Sun, which is 0.38 AU). It has an eccentric orbit, with an eccentricity of 0.5134. Stellar interactions & remaining lifetime Obseverations made on Kepler-432b reveal that its host star is gradually causing the planet's orbit to decay via tidal interactions. As Kepler-432 A is ascending the red giant branch (RGB), it will continue to expand past the orbit of Kepler-432b, likely engulfing it completely. The drag between the stellar photosphere and the gas giant would cause its orbit to spiral inward until it is vaporized by the star after ablation and vaporization take its toll on the planet. In some way, this helps with studying how similar interactions will eventually cause the Earth to be engulfed by the Sun as a red giant, some 7 billion years from now. Discovery In 2009, NASA's Kepler spacecraft was completing observing stars on its photometer, the instrument it uses to detect transit events, in which a planet crosses in front of and dims its host star for a brief and roughly regular period of time. In this last test, Kepler observed stars in the Kepler Input Catalog, including Kepler-419, the preliminary light curves were sent to the Kepler science team for analysis, who chose obvious planetary companions from the bunch for follow-up at observatories. Observations for the potential exoplanet candidates took place between 13 May 2009 and 17 March 2012. After observing the respective transits, which for Kepler-432b occurred every 50 days, it was eventually concluded that a planetary companion was responsible for the periodic 50-day transits. The discovery of the oddball planet was announced on 24 January 2015. See also * Kepler-1520 b ‚Äì similar planet about to be engulfed by its host star.

The US has maintained diplomatic relations with the EU and its predecessors since 1953. The first predecessor of the current mission was the US diplomatic mission to the European Coal and Steel Community in Luxembourg, which opened in 1956. In 1961, the US Mission to the European Communities was established in Brussels, which later became the United States Mission to the European Union, upon the latter's establishment in 1993. History On August 11, 1952, the US became the first non-member state to recognize the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), which was formed on 23 July and consisted of Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and West Germany. The following year, the US sent observers to the ECSC, at which point diplomatic relations with the ECSC were established. A formal diplomatic mission to the ECSC opened in the city of Luxembourg in 1956. In 1961, the United States Mission to the European Communities was established in Brussels, Belgium. The European Communities was the collective term for three supernational European agencies established in the 1950s‚Äîthe ECSC, the European Atomic Energy Community, and the European Economic Community (also known simply as the European Community )‚Äîwhich were merged in 1967 into a body also known as the European Communities (EC). The EC had limited foreign policy roles, primarily consisting of trade relations, which were carried out by the European Political Cooperation (EPC), established in 1970. Relations between the US and EC were formalized through the Transatlantic Declaration in 1990. In 1993, the European Union was established. Relations between the US and EU were defined in the New Transatlantic Agenda (NTA), agreed to in 1995. The NTA set forth four broad areas of cooperation between the US and EU: \\"promoting peace and stability, democracy and development around the world; responding to global challenges; contributing to the expansion of world trade and closer economic relations; and building bridges Across the Atlantic.\\" The NTA was further extended to cover bilateral and multilateral trade in 1998, through the Transatlantic Economic Partnership (TEP). The Lisbon Treaty, ratified in 2009, established the European External Action Service as the EU's foreign policy institution. Since 2013, the US and EU have been engaged in discussions to create a free trade agreement, known as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership.John Peterson Europe and America: The Prospects for Partnership - 2002 Page 7 1134772971 \\"A 'New Transatlanticism' emerged soon after the end of the Cold War as political links between the US and EU were deepened and institutionalized. \\" Mission The mission consists of representatives from the State Department, Office of the United States Trade Representative, United States Commercial Service (part of the Department of Commerce), USDA (Foreign Agricultural Service and Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service), Department of Homeland Security, Department of the Treasury, Department of Justice, Department of Defense, USAID, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Ambassador The diplomatic mission is headed by the United States Ambassador to the European Union; currently, in the absence of the Ambassador, the Charg√© d‚ÄôAffaires is Mark Libby. The previous Ambassador, Gordon Sondland, was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on June 29, 2018 and arrived in Brussels on July 8, 2018. He presented his credentials at the European Commission and to President of the European Council Donald Tusk on July 9, 2018. He was removed by the President on February 7, 2020. Public diplomacy The Mission's Public Affairs Office (USEU PA) is responsible for engaging Europeans in matters of US policies, society, and US-EU cooperation in various fields. To accomplish this task, the office supports exchange programs for professionals and students; organizes conferences with think tanks and NGOs to facilitate dialogue on issues of mutual interest to the EU and US; engage Europeans on US policy issues through social media outreach; and organizes interviews, speeches, and press conferences with Mission staff and visiting US officials and experts.
