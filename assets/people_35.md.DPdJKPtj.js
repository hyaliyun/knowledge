Plot Based on the life of Dame Nellie Melba, the film traces the career of Melba (Patrice Munsel) from the time she left Australia, traveling to Paris to receive vocal training, meets a new suitor, and debuts her talent in Brussels. As her success grows, her former suitor from Australia arrives in Monte Carlo, convinces her to marry him, but then finds himself placed in the position of being \\"Mr. Melba\\". When he leaves her to return to Australia, Melba remains in Europe to continue singing. CastProduction=Development In January 1952, upon completion of the Melba story treatment by Harry Kurnitz, producer Sam Spiegel and his attorney flew to London with the script in-hand to acquire film rights for her story from Melba's estate. In May 1952, Spiegel reported that the film was to be shot on locations in Australia and Britain with Patrice Munsel cast as Nellie Melba. Upon release of the information, representatives of the J. Arthur Rank organization expressed surprise, as they had themselves been planning a film about Melba. They had hoped to get Marjorie Lawrence for their own film and, when unable to do so, had even considered using actual recordings Melba's voice dubbed over that of an actress. They decided to put their plans on hold until they could find a suitable singer/actress for the lead role. In June 1952 Spiegel announced the film would be made as the first in a four picture deal he had with United Artists. Munsel's casting was announced in July.\\"Melba? Role\\", The Washington Post, 13 July 1952: L5. One of Spiegel's early choices for director was Charles Vidor. In July 1952, Spiegel flew to Paris to speak with him. Spiegel then hired Edmund Goulding as director. Pre- production for the film was being done in Paris, and Patrice Munsel and her husband arranged a second honeymoon in that city. At one stage Lewis Gilbert was going to direct. When problems arose with Goulding, Spiegel fired him and hired Lewis Milestone to direct. The change of directors disheartened Munsel, as she had been looking forward to working with Goulding, and she found Milestone to be \\"more traffic cop than auteur\\". She had also anticipated a script that would allow her to play Melba as the \\"gutsy, difficult, strong- minded\\" person she really was, and was disappointed that the Kurnitz script \\"was essentially a plot-less, soft-centered love story built around a long string of opera sequences.\\" Shooting Filming started in August 1952. By September 1952, Patrice Munsel had recorded all her songs for the film, and plans were being made to construct \\"Australian\\" sets on the Wiltshire plains. While Munsel's voice impressed critics, she did not resemble Dame Melba, with the biggest contrast being her American accent. When asked of her role, Munsel stated \\"We are not attempting to re-create Melba. We are simply paying tribute to her as a great singer in a way that will bring popular entertainment to the masses.\\" Theodore Bikel wrote in his autobiography that because of Milestone's background, this was a felicitous choice by Sam Spiegel, as Milestone was an award-winning director with a great touch. There was however, a growing frustration between Spiegel and Milestone, both on set and off. After months of filming with growing tensions, and three days before the last scene was to be shot, a confrontation between the two caused Milestone to walk of the set and not return. Critical response The New York Times reported that the film was essentially one song after another and, listing the numerous works that were shared in the film, wrote \\"Even though jumbled together in an excessive, haphazard way, this massive m√©lange of mighty music is the meager salvation of the film.\\" The reviewer, Bosley Crowther, offered that, while the task of portraying the life of Nellie Melba was laudable as a concept, the \\"storybook tale of an opera singer that Harry Kurnitz has put together is a mere offense to the taste and credulity of an average numskull, and it is assembled and played with little more sense.\\" They disapproved of the plot which portrayed Melba as \\"silly and vapid\\", whose character then \\"comes out flat and gauche\\". They offered the storyline was \\"sticky and banal\\" and \\"overloaded with such obvious twaddle about ambition and success.\\" Conversely, The Spokesman-Review felt the film was a \\"worthy climax to her [Patrice Munsel] spectacular opera and concert career.\\" They wrote that of the many films that attempted to adapt opera to the film media, this one is the best. They acknowledged that while the film was \\"broadly sentimental\\", it was appealing. And that even though the storyline did not factually follow the life of Nellie Melba, \\"it suggests its glory and glamour and completely enthralls the audience.\\" They write that \\"Munsel is magnificent\\", and that even while not being photogenic in the Australian shot scenes depicting Melba's life as a cowgirl, once Melba is brought to Europe, \\"she is most attractive.\\" Listing the many songs sung by Munsel, they made note of the attending audience applauding each, and wrote \\"Her singing is magnificent, and she is an actress of sufficient poise to carry complete conviction.\\" The praised the supporting cast and Lewis Milestone's craftmanship as a director.

From Henry the Navigator's first adventures down the African coast to Columbus's fabled expedition resulting in the discovery of the new world, the figures that catalyzed the European appetite for expansion and imperialism heralded from either Spain or Portugal. However, merely a century earlier, nautical travel for most peoples was resigned to keeping within sight of a coastline and very rarely did ships venture out into deeper waters. The period's ships were not able to handle the forces of open ocean travel and the crewmen had neither the ability nor the necessary materials to keep themselves from getting lost. A sailor's ability to travel was dictated by the technology available, and it wasn‚Äôt until the late 15th century that the development of the nautical sciences on the Iberian Peninsula allowed for the genesis of long distance shipping by directly effecting, and leading to the creation of, new tools and techniques relative to navigation. Christopher Columbus‚Äôs famous expedition, which crossed the ocean in 1492, was arguably the first contact the civilized world had with the newly discovered continent. Financed and sponsored by Queen Isabella of Spain, his journey would open the door to new trading lanes, imperialist appetites, and the meeting of cultures.Paolo Emilio Taviani. Columbus, the Great Adventure: His Life, His Times, and His Voyages (New York: Orion Books), page 12 Portugal and Spain became the world's foremost leaders in deep water navigation and discovery because of their sailing expertise and the advancement of nautical sciences benefiting their ability to sail further, faster, more accurately, and safer than other states. Vast amounts of precious minerals and lucrative slaves were poured into Iberian treasuries between the late 15th and mid to late 17th centuries because of Spanish and Portuguese domination of Atlantic trade routes.Fransisco Bethencourt, Portuguese Oceanic Expansion, 1400‚Äì1800 (Cambridge [England] : Cambridge University Press), page 113 The golden age of Spain was a direct result of the advancements made in navigation technology and the sciences which allowed for deep water sailing. To the population of Europe, trans-oceanic navigation was an almost inconceivably huge idea, yet the world would never be the same because a man with the simplest of tools managed to plot his way across the second largest body of water on the planet. Without those rudimentary yet extremely critical instruments, the ambitions of Columbus, along with his sponsoring state, would have been crushed. The development of nautical sciences, including the augmentation of pre-existing techniques and tools, on the Iberian Peninsula generated new technology and had a direct, visible, and lasting effect on long range ship board navigation. The influence of Prince Henry the Navigator Prior to the 14th century, navigation by European sailors was a crude imitation of what was to come. The technology available was not suitable for anything more ambitious than coast hugging voyages to known landmasses. Captains were limited to technology developed centuries earlier, like the kamal of Arabian genesis, a crude instrument used to measure latitude, and ships with designs which prohibited their use due to the crushing swells, turbulent weather, and material attrition of an open ocean expedition. It was not until Prince Henry the Navigator of Portugal was born in 1394 and gained influence at court through the 15th century that exploration and the development of nautical sciences became priorities under the Iberian governments.Joaquinn Pedro Oliveira Martins, The Golden Age of Prince Henry the Navigator (New York: Dutton), page 62 Having been part of the crusades as a young man, Henry's world became ever larger as he traveled the world under the banner of Christ. Even though a zealous and sometimes violent catholic, he did not disregard tales he had heard of Arabian exploration and lands beyond what was known. He had heard about the voyages of Abufeda and Albyruny, two Arabian geographers, and their recollections of travel along the western coast of Africa and began to wonder where the continents of Europe and Africa ended.Joaquinn Pedro Oliveira Martins, The Golden Age of Prince Henry the Navigator (New York: Dutton), page 68 The prince's mind was constantly intrigued. Henry wished to know how far the Muslim territories in Africa extended, and whether it was possible for him to reach the Orient by sea, both due to his desire to capitalize on the lucrative spice trade and pro-catholic sentiment.Bailey Diffie, Foundations of the Portuguese Empire, 1415‚Äì1580 (Minneapolis : University of Minnesota Press), page 121 Upon returning to Portugal, it was clear that his travels imprinted upon Henry the desire for further exploration and discovery, along with a desire to find a land ‚Äúfree of the Saracen‚Äù, which soon became clear as he took a more visible role in his father's court. Prince Henry the Navigator's overwhelming desire to expand his knowledge of the known world directly led to the advancement of the nautical sciences. Having traveled extensively, it was not revelatory knowledge that the ships and tools available would not be adequate in order to fulfill expansionist and exploratory desires. He realized that his efforts would only be benefited by becoming an expert in, and patron of, the sciences. According to Martins, ‚ÄúHe was a true scientist. He spent whole days and nights studying, experimenting ‚Ä¶ not speculating on the vague fanciful theories of theology or metaphysics, but seeking ever after ‚Ä¶ facts which could be applied to the everyday things of life.‚ÄùJoaquinn Pedro Oliveira Martins, The Golden Age of Prince Henry the Navigator (New York: Dutton), page 65 Reportedly he also lavished gifts upon visitors to court in the hopes of obtaining mysteries of navigation, seamanship, and knowledge of other countries.John Dos Passos, The Portugal Story: Three Centuries of Exploration and Discovery. (Garden City, N.Y. : Doubleday), page 86 The town of a prince The remains of the school at Sagres. Eventually founding a town on the extreme southwest coast at Cape St. Vincent which came to be called the Vila do Infante, or the Prince's Town, Henry attempted to concentrate the available nautical knowledge. Anchored in an area that seemed the gateway to the sea, the town was situated with the strait of Gibraltar to its south, the Mediterranean to its east, and the vast emptiness of the Atlantic to the west.John Dos Passos, The Portugal Story: Three Centuries of Exploration and Discovery (Garden City, N.Y. : Doubleday), page 89 It was a perfect harbor within which to nurse the fledgling ideas of the age of exploration and it was arguably here that the first rudimentary school for nautical navigation was born. The dedication he had towards expanding the available knowledge, techniques, and tools available for exploration brought imperialist desires to the forefront of most major powers‚Äô agenda and catalyzed the age of exploration, trade, empire, and cultural interaction that would follow. During the time of Prince Henry and the following centuries, nautical science became the focus of many of Europe's most prominent experts in mathematics, astronomy, geography, meteorology, and physics. By applying their specific areas of expertise to the problems of seafaring navigation, many of the statutes of sailing and precursors to modern navigation were born. Up until the late 15th century, the most a sailor could rely on was his compass pointing north, his cross-staff, and the few sparsely detailed nautical charts in his possession.Bailey Diffie, Foundations of the Portuguese Empire, 1415‚Äì1580 (Minneapolis : University of Minnesota Press), page 134 More accurate tools were not needed until the use of the caravel, a speedy vessel ideally suited to the ocean, became widespread. As sea travel became increasingly more important, sailors understood that the farther from coast they ventured, the more they would have to deal with currents, wind intensity and direction, star position based upon hemisphere, ship direction and speed.Bailey Diffie, Foundations of the Portuguese Empire, 1415‚Äì1580 (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press), page 118 The problems presented to exploration by the constantly shifting, always dangerous, and vastly infinite nature of the world's oceans were confronted and overcome by the development and application of nautical science. The kamal The earliest known way a sailor could accurately measure his latitude through the use of quantitative methods of navigation was by using a tool known as the kamal. Developed sometime in the 9th century by explorers of Arabian descent, it was used to sight the Pole Star, the only motionless cosmic body in the northern hemisphere, and its height from the horizon in order to determine where upon an east/west grid a ship lays. Its genesis was among the Islamic empires of the pre-modern era, but the kamal managed to be used by a number of different cultures, including India in the 11th century, before it became common among Iberian ship pilots. It was a crude tool that consisted of a bone or wood rectangle with a knotted cord measuring arm's length tied to it.Bailey Diffie, Foundations of the Portuguese Empire, 1415‚Äì1580 (Minneapolis : University of Minnesota Press), page 133 By holding the string in their teeth and sighting the horns of the kamal along the horizon, a sailor could deduce the altitude of the Pole star, and thus his relative latitude, through the number of knots visible. The cross-staff Another pre-existing, but emerged later than the kamal, navigation instrument was the cross-staff. The first working version of a cross-staff was developed for astronomical study in the 14th century and was later converted by Named due to its construction, the cross-staff was a cruciform piece of wood. A sailor or astronomer would sight the long arm along the horizon and the transverse arm would be raised to the position of the sun. Markings along its base represented degrees of measurement which could then be converted to angular measurement and eventually north/south position. But the damaging effects looking directly at the sun for extended periods of time coupled with the varied nature of a ship's deck while under sail made it a very crude and unreliable instrument to work with.Jeanne Willoz-Egnor, Cross- Staff The lack of reliable instruments with which to determine location hindered the efforts of sailors and explorers until the later emergence of more advanced apparatuses. However beneficial the kamal and cross-staff may have been in the early period of exploration, the more difficult part of celestial navigation was determining longitude and here is where problems began. Early exploration, particularly in Portugal, hugged coastlines and thus only latitude was needed in order to determine location, it could merely be cross referenced with position based upon coastal maps, known as portolan charts. Here the kamal was undeniably useful, but once a captain turned his prow to open water the comfort of a coastline was removed and the problems of navigation exponentially increased. The quadrant The design of a simple Mariner's Quadrant Another latitude-divining instrument was the quadrant. Although their functions were the same, they were developed independently for separate use; the kamal was nautical while the quadrant was astronomical. The idea was born with Ptolemy in the 1st century, and was once again pioneered by the Arabs; its intended purpose was to solve trigonometric functions dictating celestial movement. However, the dual sighting mechanism of the period was too complicated, time consuming, and required too many men for practical use aboard a ship, as a result Iberian captains stripped it down to its most basic parts in order for it to be applied to navigation.ThinkQuest: Library, ‚ÄúEarly Navigational Instruments ‚Äù The apparatus itself was either a wood or brass quarter circle with degree measurements painted along its length and a length of string attached to the point to serve as a plumb bob. Serving the same purpose as the kamal, only magnitudes more accurate, it was used by suspending it from the string and measuring celestial degrees along its lower arc. It was not until arriving within Europe that the technology itself was altered and made available to seafarers due to the necessity of accurate latitudinal measurement. Martin Cortes and the astrolabe Astrolabe Jean Naze MBA Lyon 1966-1 Oftentimes the lives of sailors and their captain were completely dependent upon precise plotting of current location and anticipated destination, as a result a number of techniques and instruments were employed in order to ensure the accuracy of a reading. Designed to work in concert with a quadrant, which came to replace the kamal entirely in the 14th century, the mariner's astrolabe also measured the altitude of celestial bodies; however this tool could use the sun as a reference point as well thus allowing for the continual plotting of a ship's course in day or night. It also had the ability to determine latitude in rough seas, an essential ability for long distance mariners due to the unpredictability of the sea; the quadrant and kamal both required calm waters. Mentioned as early as the close of the 13th century, a conclusive guide on its construction and use was not available until 1551 when Spanish cosmographer Martin Cortes de Albacar published what would become one of the first manuals on seafaring navigation. Cortes himself was born in Aragon in 1510.Antonio Barrera-Osorio, Experiencing Nature: The Spanish American Empire and the Early Scientific Revolution (Austin, Texas: University of Texas Press), page 131 Maturing during the fervor of the age of exploration, he devoted his life to the nautical sciences and developed the mariner's astrolabe along with investigating and proposing magnetic deviation and the existence of magnetic poles. He spent the second half of his life from 1530 until his death in Cadiz as an instructor to ship pilots on the topics of both cosmography and navigation. Translated into English as the Arte of Navigation, his book became the backbone of sailing instruction for many of the world's naval powers until the 19th century. Pedro Nunes The astrolabe itself was not the sole product of Cortes, but was improved by a Portuguese mathematician, Pedro Nunes. Born at the outset of the 16th century, he applied much of his life to improving the mathematics of navigation and augmented the astrolabe by including a device he invented known as the nonius.Bailey Diffie, Foundations of the Portuguese Empire, 1415‚Äì1580 (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press), page 143 Its addition to the astrolabe allowed for corrections to be made during swells, the astrolabe's application no longer relied on the intercession of good weather. Publishing his influential Tratado da Sphera in 1537, it included two expos√©s on questions of navigation which were approached, for the first time, through mathematical application. He was later in life invited to court by King John III of Portugal and was named Royal Cosmographer in 1529.Bailey Diffie, Foundations of the Portuguese Empire, 1415‚Äì1580 (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press), page 142 Oceanography was born as seafarers began to investigate the nature of the seas. Henry the Navigator himself, along with his expeditions, took part in studying currents and wind patterns. Information on gyres, currents, tides, and trade winds were all recorded and studied in order to determine if the information could benefit sailors. The patronage of the sciences, particularly those benefiting navigation, by the Portuguese and Spanish crowns propelled their states to the forefront of exploration, discovery, and empire. Abraham Zacuto and the ephemerides Page from Almanach Perpetuum. Once out of sight of the coast, Portuguese and Spanish ship pilots could rely upon the astrolabe and quadrant to determine their location on a north/south reference, however longitude was noticeably more difficult to acquire. The problem was time. Out on the vast stretches of the ocean, it is very difficult to keep track of time once leaving port. In order to calculate longitude a sailor would need to know the time difference between his current location and a fixed point somewhere on earth, usually the port of call. Even if one could determine the time of day while in deep waters, they still needed to know the time at their home port. The answer was the ephemerides, astronomical charts plotting the location of the stars over a distinct period of time. The German astronomer Regiomontanus published an accurate day-to-day Ephemerides in 1474. Published in 1496 by the Jewish astronomer, astrologer, and mathematician Abraham Zacuto, the Almanach Perpetuum included tables for the movements of stars.Nissan Mindel, Rabbi Abraham Zacuto (1450‚Äì1515) Through the use of an astrolabe, also perfected by Zacuto who advanced it from a crude wooden tool to an accurate brass instrument, sailors could determine the time at home. Zacuto himself was born in Spain in 1451 and took refuge in Lisbon during the expulsion of the Jews. He eventually was invited by King John II of Portugal, much like Pedro Nunes, to become the Royal Astronomer, a position he accepted and used to promote exploration, particularly investigating a sea route to India. The nocturnal A nocturnal as costume jewellery. This is a functioning nocturnal, though only about 5 cm tall. It shows the month ring on the outside in brass. The silver colored inner disk shows the time and has an indicator on one edge. In order to accurately record time on board a vessel sundials had been attempted, however the unpredictable nature of swells made the actual reading of the instrument almost impossible. Up until the emergence of the nocturnal, the only way captains could keep track of time was through the use of sand or water clocks, for example an hourglass. However, they required the constant attention for the duration of the voyage in order to reset the cycles on the hour. With the publishing of the Arte of Navigation by Cortes came the first detailed description of the construction and use of a nocturnal, once again an apparatus that relied on the stars. The nocturnal revolutionized long distance seafaring by complementing the use of the astrolabe and ephemerides by now giving sailors an accurate tool with which to discover the time at their position. Both Zacuto and Cortes were respected mathematicians and had determined in their respective publications the trigonometric measurements concerning the degrees of latitude and longitude. If a ship's pilot or navigator used the nocturnal to read their time, and then consulted an astrolabe in concert with astronomical charts they could determine the time distance between themselves and a fixed location. The trigonometry, dictated particularly in Zacuto's work, then allowed a sailor to calculate the degree difference east or west of the fixed position. For instance, if the time variance between port and ship was two hours, a sailor would know that he was 30 degrees east of port, if he was sailing in the Atlantic from the Iberian Peninsula. Cross referenced with latitude, a captain would know his exact location regardless of landmarks or coastline as long as the night sky was clear.Roland I. Maldonado, Navigation on the High Seas Captains could now plot their course accurately and reliably as they extended their travels farther and farther from home. Conclusion However, none of these developments could have come about without a vigorous support of the sciences and the breakthroughs of numerous academics well versed in mathematics, physics, oceanography, and astronomy. Henry the Navigator, the catalyst for Portuguese exploration and imperialism, was himself an ardent and zealous student of the sciences. He may have invited cartographers and astronomers to Sagres in order to improve the science of navigation. The caravel and its deep water design rose to prominence under his patronage of the sciences and exploration. The court of his father was flooded with foreigners enticed by Henry and his appetite for any secrets of navigation they could provide. Although driven by religious motivation forged during the crusades, his influence on Portuguese exploration and patronage of nautical sciences is without doubt. Martin Cortes de Albacar and Abraham Zacuto both published works in the 16th century that became backbones for naval instruction through the end of the 19th century. Cortes's work included detailed instructions on how to both construct and apply an astrolabe while Zacuto's Almanach and the ephemerides published within were critical to the use of a nocturnal, notably by both Vasco da Gama and Pedro √Ålvares Cabral. Without the advancements made in nautical sciences, particularly by Iberian scientists and explorers, trans-oceanic navigation would have not been possible. The earliest periods of navigation within Portugal and Spain employed the use of crude, antiquated, and unreliable instruments. The kamal and cross-staff, while both useful, lacked the ability to be consistently practically applied on board a ship. They were replaced by the trigonometric quadrant and its semi-circle construction. But even that was unreliable at times because a pilot would need calm waters in order to acquire a reading. Eventually it was used together with the astrolabe, which became a critical piece of equipment for navigation after Martin Cortes de Albacar published his Art. Because it could be used day or night, in rough or calm seas, it was cross referenced with the quadrant in order to gain the most accurate reading possible. Finally, the nocturnal and its accompanied values in the ephemerides granted sailors the ability to plot longitude on the open ocean. Navigation across vast stretches of open water was no longer merely as daunting. An expedition leader, the captains, ships, and crews could all be confident that, barring the intercession of the ocean's unpredictable nature, a course could be safely and accurately plotted from a port of call to final destination. Portugal to colonized Brazil, Spain to its holdings in Florida, the challenges of thousand mile and multiple month long excursions could be overcome. In the span of a few centuries, nautical sciences had granted man the ability to circumnavigate the globe by 1521, exploit vast reserves of untouched natural resources, open dialogue with previously unknown cultures, and open lucrative new trading routes; the world had become a much larger place.

It \\"set off\\", or established, Western Yearly Meeting, at Plainfield, Indiana, in 1858, Iowa Yearly Meeting, at Oskaloosa, Iowa, in 1863, Kansas Yearly Meeting (now Evangelical Friends Church Mid-America Yearly Meeting), at Lawrence, Kansas, in 1872, and Wilmington Yearly Meeting, at Wilmington, Ohio, in 1891. Indiana Yearly Meeting established the school that became Earlham College in 1847, White's Institute, first a home for Indians, then an orphanage, and later a home for delinquent youths, in 1850, Quaker Haven Camp in 1926, and Friends Fellowship Community, a retirement home in Richmond, Indiana, in 1964. Indiana Yearly Meeting's membership has been in a downward trend since the 1910s, but average attendance at worship has remained steady. Currently, Indiana Yearly Meeting is the only North American yearly meeting in Friends United Meeting in which average reported attendance at worship exceeds membership. Indiana Yearly Meeting remains one of the key financial supporters of Friends United Meeting. The membership as reported in the 2013 minute book consists of about 2,300 persons in nearly fifty congregations. While many Quaker yearly meetings have suffered serious divisions in their history, Indiana Yearly Meeting suffered no serious fractures and only three minor divisions during the 19th and 20th centuries. In the nineteenth century, this gave the yearly meeting a reputation for being both moderate and evangelical. As such, it was Indiana Yearly Meeting that led the call for more centralization among Orthodox Gurneyite Friends, leading to the calling of the Friends Conference of 1887 and the Richmond Declaration. In 2013, after several years of tension over the issues of homosexuality and yearly meeting authority, Indiana Yearly Meeting released eighteen of its congregations. Fifteen of those released congregations ultimately formed the New Association of Friends. Forty-five congregations and two Latino church plants remained in Indiana Yearly Meeting, affirming the traditional doctrinal statements of the yearly meeting and its statements on social issues, which tend to be biblically conservative and reach to the earliest days of Friends (Quakers). Indiana Yearly Meeting has also accepted congregations that formerly belonged to Western Yearly Meeting. The congregations left Western Yearly Meeting over that body's growing liberalism. Indiana Yearly Meeting has been headquartered in Muncie, Indiana, since 1965. Paid staff consists of a general superintendent, a director of youth and camping ministries, a ministerial advocate, and clerical staff. Yearly Meeting sessions have been held at Quaker Haven Camp, near Syracuse, Indiana, for several years.

In 1940, they began a ten-year longitudinal study that was published as Unraveling Juvenile Delinquency (1950). This resulted in the Gluecks' \\"Social Prediction Tables\\" that gave predictions of the likelihood of juvenile delinquency based upon parameters from when the youths were six years old. In 1953, she became a research associate at a Harvard Law School Research Project that was investigating the causes, treatment and prevention of juvenile delinquency. In 1947, the United Prison Association of Massachusetts awarded her its Parsons Memorial Award. Although Glueck never received a tenured appointment with the faculty, both Eleanor and Sheldon Glueck were awarded honorary Sc.D. from Harvard in 1958. She was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1960. In 1969, Glueck was awarded a Distinguished Alumni Award from Barnard College. She was a trustee at the Judge Baker Guidance Center. She became a fellow with the International Society of Criminologists and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. The couple retired during the 1960s. Glueck accidentally drowned in a bathtub at her home in Cambridge, Massachusetts, at the age of 74.Staff report (September 26, 1972).

He was born at Bridgwater, Somerset. Educated at Millfield School, Paull was a right-handed batsman and an infrequent leg-break bowler. He made his debut for Somerset in a single match against Cambridge University in 1963, scoring 13, and maintained this as his career average throughout his short career. As a student at Hull University over the next three years, he played only in the second half of each first-class season, and in fact appeared in first-class matches for Somerset only in 1964, when he again averaged exactly 13. His highest first-class score for Somerset was just 21 not out, made in the match against Sussex at Glastonbury in 1964. From 1965 to 1967, he played only for Somerset's second eleven in both the Second Eleven Championship and the Minor Counties Championship. Having graduated from Hull, though, he reappeared in first-class cricket for Cambridge University, where he was on a one-year postgraduate course, in 1967 and, as with his earlier career with Somerset, he again averaged just 13 with the bat, though he supplemented that with occasional bowling. In the match against Derbyshire at Ilkeston he scored 37, and this was his highest first-class score. Despite the modest record, he was awarded a Blue and in the match against a much stronger Oxford University he scored 0 and 21 as Cambridge managed to achieve a draw after being made to follow on. Though he played for Somerset's second eleven to the end of the 1967 season, he did not return to first-class cricket.

Franklin kept one copy for himself, depositing the second in \\"our own public library here\\" (the Library Company of Philadelphia which Franklin founded in 1731) and sending the third to the \\"college of Massachusetts Bay\\" (Franklin used the original name from 1636, not acknowledging the 1639 rename to Harvard College in honor of John Harvard).

He was born at Taihape, Manawatu, New Zealand. Cricket career The son of Henry Basil Melvin Groves, an Englishman whose single first-class cricket appearance came in India, Mike Groves was born in New Zealand but brought up in South Africa, where he was educated at Diocesan College, Cape Town. Usually a right-handed middle-order batsman and irregular right-arm medium-pace bowler, he played a single match as an 18-year-old in 1960/61 for Western Province as an opening batsman, scoring 5 and 45. He then came to England and played occasional amateur first-class matches in 1962 before going to Oxford University in autumn 1962 as an undergraduate at St Edmund Hall. Over the next four cricket seasons, Groves played regularly for Oxford University's first eleven cricket team, but in 1963, despite finishing fourth in the university's batting averages with 485 runs at an average of 26.94 runs per innings, he was left out of the team for the University Match and did not win a Blue. His highest score in the season was an unbeaten 74 in the match against Northamptonshire. In 1964, he failed to match either the aggregate or the average, and his only score of 50 or more for the season was 61, but he retained his place through the Oxford season and was awarded a Blue, scoring eight and 10 not out and taking a single wicket, that of Richard Hutton, in the match. Groves played his single full season of first-class cricket in 1965 and had his best year, with 1048 runs at an average of 29.11. He topped the Oxford batting averages with 743 runs at an average of 32.30 and made 69 and 81, his highest score for the university, in the match against Sussex which came immediately before the University Match. In the University Match itself, Groves top-scored for Oxford with 45 in the first innings, but he and fellow batsman Melville Guest were barracked by the crowd for slow scoring, with 15 consecutive maiden overs bowled by the two Cambridge spinners. The slow scoring was uncharacteristic, though Wisden noted that, in an out-of-form batting side and on damp pitches, Groves had not been able in 1965 to bat with the freedom he'd exhibited in previous seasons. After the university term was over, he joined Somerset, and though he began in the second team, for the whole of August he played for the first team, and while there he compiled the highest score of his first-class career, 86, in the match against Derbyshire at Glastonbury. Groves returned for a fourth season at Oxford in 1966 but played only four matches because of examination demands. One of those, however, was his third University Match, and after five consecutive drawn games in this fixture the 1966 match was won by an innings by Oxford, with Groves' unbeaten 80 in 98 minutes on the first day one of the batting highlights, enabling Oxford to declare and give Cambridge an awkward half hour's batting at the end of the day. After the game, Groves again joined Somerset, but this time he played only a handful of second eleven matches and did not feature in the first team, which was having one of its most successful seasons. That was virtually the end of Groves' cricket career, but he appeared over the next 14 seasons in occasional games for either the Free Foresters or the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), and in 1967 and 1968 a couple of those games were rated as first-class fixtures: subsequent matches he played in were not first-class. At the end of the 1968 season, with Somerset looking for a new captain to replace Roy Kerslake, there was a move to co-opt Groves to the post, but it did not happen. Personal life Groves married Catherine Elizabeth Heathcoat-Amory in July 1967. They had two sons before they divorced in 1975.

Born in England, his family emigrated to New Zealand when he was 11 years old. After completing his schooling, he studied art at the Wellington School of Design and at various schools in Europe . He returned to New Zealand and worked as a professional artist for a time before settling in England. He soon developed a reputation for portrait and landscape works. Late in the First World War, he became an official war artist in the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF), with the honorary rank of captain. He executed several works of senior officers of the NZEF and its battles after the war and died in England in 1936. Early life Born 15 January 1872 in Southampton, England, George Edmund Butler emigrated to New Zealand with his parents, Joseph Cawte Butler and Jane Tiller, in 1883, settling in Wellington. After completing his education at Te Aro School, Butler worked for his father and studied art part-time under James Nairn at the Wellington School of Design. Art education Butler enrolled at the Wellington School of Design in 1890. In 1892 he joined the avant-garde Wellington Art Club, founded by Nairn, and soon established a local reputation for his paintings of seascapes. In 1897, Butler went to Sydney with the Wellington art dealer McGregor Wright to study pictures in the National Art Gallery of New South Wales. Between 1898 and 1900, Butler undertook art studies abroad. During a period spent in England, Butler married his first wife, Sarah Jane Popplestone, on 29 April 1899 at Lyndhurst, Hampshire. Butler studied at the Lambeth School of Art, and the Acad√©mie Julian in Paris, where he gained honours. He later studied at the Antwerp Academy, winning a gold medal and laurel wreath in 1900. Art career In 1900, Butler returned to Wellington and exhibited his work in art society exhibitions there and in Christchurch. In 1901 he settled in Dunedin and exhibited there until 1905. While his work won praise at the Otago Art Society exhibitions, he struggled financially as a professional artist. He supplemented his income by giving tuition in drawing and was commissioned to complete a number of portraits of city dignitaries. In 1905 he returned to England and settled in Bristol, teaching art at Clifton College. Butler was elected to the Royal West of England Academy in 1912 after establishing a reputation as a portrait and landscape artist in oils and watercolours. Butler also exhibited at the Royal Academy of Arts, the Royal Scottish Academy, the Royal Academy and the annual salon exhibition at the Soci√©t√© des Artistes Fran√ßais in Paris. War artist alt=A woman in a long dress stands at a roadside looking at a collection of thirty white cross grave markers, surrounded by grass, in a field beside the road. The New Zealand Expeditionary Force War Museum Committee approached Butler to be an official New Zealand war artist because of his reputation as an artist and his New Zealand connections. Appointed with the honorary rank of captain in the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF) in September 1918, he joined the New Zealand Division in France later that same month. He observed a number of military operations, some while under fire, during his time with the division, making drawings in a sketchbook carried for this purpose. These sketches later became the basis for his paintings. After the Armistice, he returned to France and Belgium to sketch the various New Zealand battlefield sites. Demobilised from the NZEF on 31 December 1918, Butler was privately commissioned by Robert Heaton Rhodes and Major General Sir Andrew Hamilton Russell, commander of the New Zealand Division, to do a further series of senior officer portraits and a number of large landscapes of New Zealand battlefield site along the Western Front. It was Rhodes's intention to persuade the New Zealand government to purchase these works. This was agreed to in September 1921 and payment to Butler was approved, including the purchase of a further two large works and 26 smaller paintings recommended by the New Zealand High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, Sir James Allen. These works are now held at the National Archives in Wellington. Second marriage and death Butler never returned to New Zealand after the war and resumed life in England. Following the death of his wife in 1928, he married Monica Susan Boyce in London on 29 April 1929. He died at Twickenham on 9 August 1936. He was survived by his second wife and the two children from his first marriage, Bernice and Brian.

Since its construction in the late nineteenth century, the building has been the location of several businesses, the meeting place for two different secret societies, and the center of the town's commercial district. It has been declared a historic site because of its historically significant architecture. History In the late nineteenth century, Winslow was the home of two different fraternal orders: the Independent Order of Odd Fellows and the Knights of Pythias. Seeing the benefits of co√∂peration, the two lodges worked together to erect a building in downtown Winslow,Arnold, Thomas J. National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination: Palace Lodge. National Park Service, 1982-09-08. at the intersection of Main (now State Road 61) and Center Streets. After the building was finished in 1892, the two lodges used it jointly: their meetings were held on the first story, and they employed the second story as office space. Unfortunately for the lodges, they became encumbered by debt soon after the building's construction, and their financial difficulties required them to sell the building in 1898. Local businessman Logan Robling purchased the property, which he converted into a general store. After his son Monroe Robling left the peddling business, the two men operated it together under the name of \\"L. Robling and Son.\\" They remained in business until 1946, when they sold the property to Monroe's daughter Winifred and her husband, Neil Brown; the Browns operated a grocery store on the property for thirty-five years. Both the general store and the grocery store only occupied the first floor of the building; the second floor was typically used for office space or as apartments. Architecture The Palace Lodge is a rectangular Italianate building; its front faces west toward Main Street, and its northern side is exposed to Center Street. Two stories tall, it is wide and from front to back. The front and side are divided into two and six bays respectively. A distinctive portion of its plan is the northwestern corner of the building, which features a small side angled 45¬∞ from both front and side, instead of the right angle found on the other corners. Customers may enter through any of three doorways: one each in the rear and the middle of the northern side, and one through the angle in the building's northwestern corner. The building is lit by multiple sizes of windows: the first-floor windows facing Center are small and high above ground level, the second-floor windows on both sides are large, and the two first-floor windows facing Main are large and feature prominent transoms. Although the Palace Lodge is built of brick, many of its architectural details are formed from cast iron. The original cast-iron storefront survives on the first floor of the western side of the building, as do the iron brackets that form the cornice over the western front and northwestern corner. Conversely, the northern side is entirely brick, including the cornice and the two prominent chimneys. Inside, the lodge retains its original floor plan: the first floor is a single large room, while six rooms compose the second floor. The walls of the interior rooms are covered with plaster, their floors are a mix of oak and pine, and the interior structure rests upon large beams of oak. Recent history After the closure of the Brown Grocery Store, the Palace Lodge was vacant for a time, but it was purchased by a new owner who began to formulate plans to remodel it to have space both for offices and apartments as well as the traditional shop. Today, the lodge building is home to Outfitters Station, a clothing and leather goods store that was founded in 2007.BBB Reliability Report for Outfitters Station, Better Business Bureau, 2011. Accessed 2011-05-02. The oldest commercial structure in Winslow, the Palace Lodge is the town's best-preserved example of business blocks completed in the late nineteenth century. Because of its unusually well preserved architecture, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984; it was the first property in Pike County to be given this distinction, and it was the only such property until a similar recognition was given to the Patoka Bridges Historic District in 2005.

He has been working as an artist in California since the early 1980s. Frame has been given Grants and Awards from the National Endowment for the Arts, the J. Paul Getty Museum, and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. He has participated in group exhibitions around the world and has had major solo exhibitions at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Long Beach Museum of Art, and the Huntington Library, Art Collections, and Botanical Gardens. After five years of preparation, Part One of \\"The Tale of the Crippled Boy\\", a sweeping project incorporating sculpture, photography, installation, music and film, premiered at the Huntington Library in San Marino, California in March 2011. Life Frame was born in Colton, California. His father, Rudolph Randolph Frame, had only a third-grade education and was a welder and sheet metal worker for the Santa Fe Railway.Seed, John. \\"John Frame: The Intuitive.\\", 3/28/11. His mother, Mildred Louise Frame (n√©e Jones) was a cook in a local middle school. He has two siblings, Robert Wayne Frame (born 1931) and Phyllis Louise Frame Runyon (born 1943). After his graduation from the Colton School District, he attended San Diego State University from 1968 to 1969 and then left Southern California. During the following four years, he traveled through Europe and North America. He held multiple jobs including assistant manager of a discount department store, gas station attendant, bookstore employee, dishwasher, library assistant, and construction worker. From 1970 to 1971 he was employed by the state psychiatric hospital of New Hampshire as a psychiatric aide for the criminally insane. He returned to Southern California in 1972 and completed an undergraduate degree in English at San Diego State University in 1975.Fuglie, Gordon, and Nygren, Edward J. Enigma Variations: The Sculpture of John Frame, 1980-2005. Long Beach Museum of Art, 2005. In 1972 he met Laura Lynn Dierker and they were married in 1977. They have three children: Katherine Lynn (born 1981), Ashley Fayette (born 1985), and Lilian M. (born 1987). From 1979 to 1980, Frame attended the Claremont Graduate School, where he was an assistant in the printmaking department and foreman in the wood shop. He graduated with an MFA. In 1980, John and Laura Frame purchased their first home in Wrightwood, California where Laura had obtained a teaching position in the local elementary school. At the same time John, along with three fellow artists, (Randall Lavender, Eve Steele, and Lynn Roylance) leased a building in downtown Los Angeles, known as the Firestone building, and began converting it to artists' studios. Although this project was never completed, it became the first artist-in-residence complex to come under the Los Angeles live/work residency ordinance for artists. Frame‚Äôs studio was located there from 1980 until 1991. From 1992 until 2001 the artist's primary studio was located in the Santa Fe art colony in downtown Los Angeles. He also maintained a small working studio at his home in Wrightwood. During the years at the Santa Fe colony, his studio became a focal point for many of the figurative artists working in the Los Angeles area including Jim Doolan, Lauren Richardson, Jon Swihart, Peter Zokosky, Enjeong Noh, Brian Apthorp, F. Scott Hess, Cecilia Miguez, Ken Jones, Wes Christensen, Luis Serrano, Stephen Douglas and Stephen Dean Moore, among many others.Pagel, David. A Group Show of Figures Studies More Than the Body, L.A. Times, August 30, 2002. The Los Angeles drawing group met in his studio on a weekly basis between 1992 and 2001 to draw from live models. Frame also originated the Los Angeles collaborative group known as the Bastards.This group consisted of Frame, Jon Swihart, Steve Galloway, Michael C. McMillan, F. Scott Hess and Peter Zokosky. The Bastards completed more than 60 collaborative works and had two exhibitions, one at Hunsaker/Schlesinger gallery in Los Angeles and one at the Davidson gallery in Seattle, Washington. In 2001, Frame closed his studio in the Santa Fe art gallery and moved full- time to Wrightwood, where he continues to live and work. Sculpture Frame spent much of the 1970s studying a variety of art forms, including dance, theater, and literature.Walsh, Daniella. John Frame.

(To Hear the Sirens' Song and Live, the earliest work appearing in his 2005 retrospective show, was created in 1980.) Although Frame received an MFA, he had no formal training in sculpture. His sculptural works were initially roughly-hewn, somewhat coarse studies of the human form. Though the refinement of his technical skill is evident in the stylistic changes in his work over the years, he has remained primarily a figurative sculptor with a humanistic, expressionist bent. His work draws on a tradition of fragmented figuration that dates back to the Renaissance and is visible in works of Rodin, Brancusi, and Giacometti.John Frame. American Arts Quarterly, Spring 2005. (Anonymous Review) This focus represents a conscious departure from the abstract and conceptualist art that was popular when he attended graduate school and that has continued to dominate from an academic point of view. Instead, in addition to the Renaissance, Frame's work has drawn from older traditions, including Greek tragedy and medieval art and spiritual practice (altarpieces, reliquary, morality plays, Italian Commedia dell'arte, and hagiography).Pagel, David.

In the mid-1990s, he began to incorporate found objects into his pieces, a practice he has continued into the present. Thus, he has been said to be a part of the California assemblage tradition. In the late 1990s, Frame's interest in literature began to be reflected directly in his work as he juxtaposed image and text in relief carving. Relief carvings reference, among others, Keats (Here lies one whose name was writ in water) and Blake (Some are born to sweet delight; some are born to endless night). Literary allusions have also appeared frequently in his titles, whose referents include Shakespeare (As water is in water, Poor Tom), the Bible (Noli me Tangere), and Wilfred Owen (All A Poet Can Do Is Warn). In addition to these explicitly referenced sources, Frame cites other artists among his influences, among them writers Emily Dickinson, Leo Tolstoy, Simone Weil, and Fyodor Dostoevsky, and directors Kurosawa, Tarkovsky, and Fellini, and Bergman. (He credits the latter with helping him realize that he was to be an artist.) He has also been deeply influenced by classical music. Frame's sculpture has been described as tragic, theatrical, enigmatic, fragmented, and formally inventive. Critics generally note that his work is concerned, in subject and content, with ‚Äúthe deepest dilemmas of life‚Äù.Ackerman, Gerald M. New Episodes in John Frame‚Äôs Human Comedy, COSI, May 1996. Combining ‚Äúhumanistic concerns with irony, intellect, and psychological insight‚Äù Individual Realities in the California ArtScene, Sezon Museum of Art, Tokyo Japan.

Breaking the Figure, Image Magazine, 2004.Illus. and Cover Illus. His work has been criticized for its approach to gender (his figures are generally perceived as male, though the artist has said that he perceives them as ‚Äúgenderless‚Äù) and sexuality. In particular, his 1995 piece Strapping Boy has proved disturbing for many who feel that its implied narrative is one of sexual abuse. Critic Gerald Ackerman has interpreted the piece thus: ‚Äú[it] gives us an unwelcome and unsettling realization of the ambiguity of both sexuality and affection, and of the troubles their impulsive interweaving can engender‚Äù. These criticisms aside, those who review Frame's work frequently cite that its appeal lies in his propensity to probe the deep questions of life without arriving at easy answers. One critic captures this tension thus: ‚Äú[In Frame's work] the meaning eludes us while the search for meaning captivates us.‚Äù The Tale of the Crippled Boy: Three Fragments of a Lost Tale O-man from \\"The Tale of the Crippled Boy,\\" 2011 In 2005, Frame began to take his work in a new direction. That year, he conceived and began to execute the work that would form his largest exhibition to date. (The work, entitled The Tale of the Crippled Boy: Three Fragments of a Lost Tale was exhibited at the Huntington Library, Art Collections, and Botanical Gardens from March‚ÄìJune 2011.) The installation is unique in the artist's career in that it includes not only thirty-five pieces of sculpture but also sets, photography and animated vignettes, all based around an eclectic cast of sculpted characters, most of whom are fully articulated, with moving fingers, bodies, and jaws. The exhibition also includes an 8-minute documentary on the artist's process, directed by filmmaker Johnny Coffeen. This departure from Frame's past work was not totally unanticipated; David Pagel, in a review of the artist's 2005 retrospective, noted ‚ÄúIf John Frame were in the movie business, he would be a costume designer, stylist, set decorator, prop master, lighting specialist, writer, director, editor, producer, agent and publicist all rolled into one do it yourself lover of every little detail of every little job.‚Äù Pagel, David. A Theatrical World Strangely Like Ours, Los Angeles Times, Feb. 5, 2005. Illus. And, in fact, Frame has completed this project (including music, lighting, and photography) with only the help of a few friends and family members. The work also shares thematic consistency with the artist's previous work, according to curators Kevin Murphy and Jessica Todd Smith, who state, ‚ÄúIn keeping with the work John Frame has created throughout his career, the tale and the art associated with it evoke universal human themes‚Äîthe nature of good and evil, the inevitability of death, and the struggle to find meaning in life‚Äîbut always in a connotative rather than denotative manner.‚Äù The artist anticipates continuing the project, eventually producing a full-length film.

Fishbach finished as the runner-up on Survivor: Tocantins and finished in ninth place on Survivor: Cambodia. He currently blogs for People Magazine and co-hosts the Survivor Know-It-Alls podcast alongside Rob Cesternino.  Survivor = Survivor: Tocantins  Fishbach was cast in the eighteenth season of the U.S. television series Survivor. He was initially a member of the Jalapao tribe, where he quickly made a lasting alliance with J.T. Thomas and Tamara \\"Taj\\" Johnson-George. Although he and his alliance were down in numbers after the two tribes merged, they were able to take advantage of the Timbira tribe's dysfunction and general distrust of each other and avoid being voted out. Fishbach won individual immunity at Final Six. He finished as runner-up, losing to Thomas and receiving zero votes from the jury.  Survivor: Cambodia  In 2015 Fishbach returned for the thirty-first season of the show after fans voted for him to participate in it. He was originally on the Bayon tribe, where he allied with eventual winner Jeremy Collins. Although he was targeted early, a tribe swap in episode three improved his position in the game. After the tribes merged Fishbach frequently tried targeting fan-favorite and challenge beast Joe Anglim. At the Final 11 immunity challenge, Fishbach gave up his chance at immunity and won a secret advantage: the steal-a-vote. At the Final Ten Tribal Council, he received the majority of the votes but was saved when Collins used his hidden immunity idol on him. At the Final Nine Tribal Council, he used his advantage and stole Anglim's vote. He split his votes, voting once for Anglim and once for Abi-Maria Gomes; however his former ally Spencer Bledsoe had flipped on him and voted against him. Fishbach was eliminated in ninth place with a 4‚Äì3‚Äì2 vote. At the finale he cast his jury vote for Collins, who received all ten of the jury members' votes.  Career  Fishbach began blogging for People Magazine in 2009, during the airing of Survivor: Samoa. In this blog he analyzes each episode of Survivor and discusses the strategies and moves of the contestants and awards the player who made the biggest impact of the episode a Fishy Award. Fishbach decided to step down from People in 2019, during the airing of Survivor: Island of the Idols. In 2012, Fishbach began co-hosting the Survivor Know-It-Alls podcast alongside Rob Cesternino. Fishbach and Cesternino were asked to compete together in The Amazing Race 31, but were unable to do so because of Fishbach's wedding.  Personal life  Fishbach was born in New York City in 1979 to parents Constance and Ronald Fishbach. He grew up in Los Angeles where he graduated as valedictorian from Harvard-Westlake School with a 4.25 GPA. He attended Yale University, earning his B.A in English in 2001. Fishbach married Julia Lemle on 9 June, 2018, in Washington. The couple had met in 2014 on the social-networking website OkCupid.

This has enabled women to actively participate in all spheres of Armenian life. Armenian women have attained prominence in entertainment, politics and other fields. Work and business Painting of an Armenian woman (circa 1682) According to the 2011 Grant Thornton International business survey, 29% of top-level managerial positions in Armenia were occupied by women in 2010. However, this figure declined to 23% in 2011. Based on a report by the United Nations, there were 24 female mayors and community leaders in Armenia in 2011; a further 50 women held lower-level administrative positions.Survey: Women In Armenia Forced Out From The Positions Of Top-Managers. Economy: Arka News Agency. Traditional status Although some nationalist feminists from the early 20th century to the present have concocted a view of ancient Armenian society and law as being woman-friendly, there is virtually no evidence for this assertion. The law code of Mkhitar Gos, dating to the 12th century, sought to raise women's status from its former level, however the code explicitly enshrined male domination and forbade divorce, even in the case of domestic violence or marital rape. Its most progressive elements seem to have never been applied in society at large, and in the 18th and 19th centuries both outsider and insider reports overwhelmingly commented on the low status of women in traditional Armenian society. Married women lived as virtual slaves of their husbands' families, although the situation improved gradually with age. During the first year of marriage, they were not permitted to speak to anyone except their husband, and were forbidden from leaving the house. Young Armenian brides created a sign language called Harnseren, which translates to \\"Language of the Bride.\\" It is a gesture based sign language that developed against the rule of silence imposed on married Armenian women. In some villages, these restrictions continued even after the birth of the first child, and may have lasted more than ten years. Female suicide was more common than male suicide, in striking contrast to the situation in the west. In spite of the inferior position of women in Armenian society, the Armenian Apostolic Church allowed women greater opportunities for assuming clerical roles than most other Christian traditions. Unlike the Eastern Orthodox, however, they were strongly opposed to divorce, and as a result the divorce rate in traditional Armenia has always been among the lowest in the Christian world. Violence against women According to the World Health Organization, between 10% and 60% of Armenian women suffered domestic abuse and violence in 2002; the uncertainty of the data was due to the underreporting of domestic violence in Armenia. Underreporting is said to occur because of the treatment of domestic violence as a private family matter. There are no well-established laws against domestic aggression and gender-based prejudice in Armenia. Furthermore, divorcing a husband ‚Äì even an abusive one ‚Äì causes \\"social disgrace\\", with the families of women who file for divorce or report domestic violence being considered to be shamed. Other contributing factors include Armenian women's lack of, or lower level of, education regarding their rights and how to protect themselves from abuse.Domestic Violence Against Women in Armenia. United Human Rights Council (UHRC). 26 May 2010. Political status In May 2007, through the legislative decree known as \\"the gender quota law\\", more Armenian women were encouraged to get involved in politics. That year, only seven women occupied parliamentary positions. Among these female politicians was Hranush Hakobyan, the longest-serving woman in the National Assembly of Armenia. The relative lack of women in Armenia's government has led to Armenian women being considered \\"among the most underrepresented\\" and \\"among the lowest in the world\\" by foreign observers.Itano, Nicole. Quota Law Puts More Women in Armenia's Election. WeNews. 10 May 2007. In addition, Armenian women's place in politics is often located in the private sphere. Often their entry in the public sphere is only valued when they reflect the image of the feminine ideal based on social expectations, which continue to put a barrier on the political, social, and economic accessibility for women.Beukian, Sevan, 2014, Motherhood as Armenianness: Expressions of Femininity in the Making of Armenian National Identity, Studies in Ethnicity and Nationalism, 14 (2):247-269 In 2015, Arpine Hovhannisyan became the first Armenian Woman to hold the position of Justice Minister in Armenia, a role she held until 2017.

Health and welfare In 2010 and 2011, during Women's Month and as part of the \\"For You, Women\\" charitable program, the Surb Astvatcamayr Medical Center in the Armenian capital of Yerevan offered free gynecological and surgical services to the women of Armenia for a full month.

Following the Armenian literary renaissance of the 19th century, and the spread of educational opportunities for women, a number of other writers emerged, among them the 19th-century feminist writer Srpouhi Dussap, considered the first female Armenian novelist.‘±÷Ä’§’´ ’∞’°’µ ’£÷Ä’°’Ø’°’∂’∏÷Ç’©’´÷Ç’∂ (Modern Armenian Literature). Beirut. pp. 134-138. She, like her contemporary, Zabel Sibil Asadour, is generally associated with Constantinople and the Western Armenian literary tradition. Zabel Yesayan, also born in Constantinople, bridged the gap with Eastern Armenian literature by settling in Soviet Armenia in 1933. The literary renaissance and its accompanying voice of protest also had its representatives in the East with poet Shushanik Kurghinian(1876‚Äì1927) of Aleksandrapol (today, Gyumri).

Central Asian cinema can further be divided into three historical periods, Soviet Central Asian film (1919‚Äì1987), a New Wave of Central Asian film (1988‚Äì1992), and the modern period of film of the independent Central Asian countries (1992‚Äìpresent). Cinema of Kazakhstan The cinema of Kazakhstan was recognized as a hub of Soviet documentaries and \\"Eastern style\\" romantics. Almaty, Kazakhstan is the starting place of the Kazakh \\"New Wave\\" of perestroika-era cinema (see Rashid Nugmanov). The independent film in Kazakhstan now is characterized by historical epics, such as Sergei Dvortsevoy's \\"Tulip\\". Cinema of Kyrgyzstan Early Kyrgyz film can be characterized by Russian-language Soviet films, such as \\"The First Teacher\\" by Andrei Konchalovsky. Later Kyrgyz films, such as Beshkempir were filmed in the Kyrgyz language and dealt with themes of urban and rural differences in Kyrygyzstan. Cinema of Tajikistan Tajik cinema in the Soviet era was marked by propaganda and an emphasis on secularism. Since Tajikistan's independence, Tajik cinema has grown into its own. Because of the Tajik Civil War from 1992‚Äì1997, virtually all of Tajik cinema before the new millennium was made abroad. Drawing from cinematic traditions in the East, West, and South (particularly from Iranian cinema), Tajik directors have been able to create influential films about the social and historical conditions of their land. Some major films include Bakhtyar Khudojnazarov's [Kosh ba kosh]. The cinema of Tajikistan is held back by a lack of government funding. Cinema of Turkmenistan Turkmen cinema has historically been highly regulated by the state government and has been reflective of the political trends. Cinema in Turkmenistan was completely abolished by President Saparmurat Niyazov in the year 2000. Several important films were created in the 1990s including Little Angel, Make Me Happy by director Sapar Usmanov. The ban on cinema has now been lifted. Cinema of Uzbekistan Uzbek film has a long list of films produced in the Soviet era and the modern era. The history of Uzbek cinema can be divided into two periods: the cinema of the Soviet Uzbekistan (1924‚Äì1991) and the cinema of the independent Uzbekistan (1991-present). Films of the Soviet period were shot either in Russian or Uzbek. Most critically acclaimed films of the Soviet period include films such as Maftuningman (1958), Mahallada duv- duv gap (1960), and Shum bola (1977).

It was a 28-page handmade book: 4.25\\" x 5.5\\", staple-bound. The interior was color printed, with several high quality black-and-white photographs. The cover had a spine and a full color photograph on the front. \\"Lemon\\" is one of Kajii's few works to have been translated into English. Although he was a relatively unknown writer during his short lifetime who published in a few literary magazines, Kajii's poetic short stories are recognized today as masterpieces in Japan. The eponymous story \\"Lemon\\" is known as his representative work.  Plot  The protagonist, who has diseased lungs, is tormented by strange anxiety all the time. He lost his interest in the stationery store Maruzen, music, and poetry that he had been interested in before. He only continues walking around aimlessly in Kyoto. In one such incident, he visits a fruit shop he likes on a regular basis through Teramati (Kyoto Miyako Naka-ku \\"ÂÖ´ÁôæÂçØ; Eight Hundred Rabbit,\\" closed January 25, 2009). There were rare lemons placed side by side. He bought one lemon that he was interested in; the coldness of the fruit in his hand was just right. After that, he felt uncomfortable, even though he stopped by his favorite shop, Maruzen, he began feeling uneasy. He felt an unchanged feeling of dissatisfaction. Even though he looked at the usual picture albums that he used to like, he put the lemon as a time bomb on the pile of illustrations. Then he imagines the works of fine art flying out of the Maruzen shop, the excitement of blasting a lemon as a time bomb. He was satisfied with what he had done at the end.  Interpretation  This short story describes the feeling of an ailing patient and the mischievous emotions which every person has. Kajii wrote many other works which had a main character with lung disease because the author was affected by tuberculosis himself. His life was a fight against poverty and sickness (he died from tuberculosis at the age of 31). Maruzen was still near Sanjodori, Huyachotori in Kyoto at that time. After \\"Lemon\\" was published, it is said there was no end to people who continued leaving a lemon at Maruzen store in Kyoto (closed in October 2005).

In the four-team semifinal round, the Redmanizers easily won their first two assignments against Tanduay and Filmanbank before losing to Toyota in the battle of unbeaten teams in the first round of the semifinals. Five days later, Crispa sealed a finals showdown with Toyota as the Tamaraws gave away the contest in losing 142-172 to the Redmanizers.

The sites of natural and cultural heritage in Madagascar became eligible for inclusion on the list when that state ratified the convention on July 19, 1983. The first site in Madagascar, the Strict Nature Reserve of the Tsingy of Bemaraha, was inscribed on the list as a site of natural importance at the 14th Session of the World Heritage Committee, held in Banff, Canada in 1990. This was followed by the 2001 inscription of the Royal Hill of Ambohimanga, a historic village and royal palace compound of cultural importance featuring well-preserved 19th-century palaces and numerous other natural and architectural features of historic, political and spiritual significance to the Malagasy people. Most recently, in 2007 the natural site of the Rainforests of the Atsinanana was added to the list, comprising a cluster of six national parks distinguished by their highly endemic biodiversity. A fourth site, the capital of the 19th century Merina sovereigns of Madagascar at the Rova of Antananarivo, had originally been slated to become the nation's first cultural World Heritage Site in 1995 but was destroyed by a fire shortly before the inscription was finalized. In addition to Madagascar's three established sites, a further seven sites are listed as tentative and are under consideration by the UNESCO World Heritage Committee for elevation to official status. Five initial sites were inscribed on the tentative list in 1997: the Betafo Riziculture and Hydraulic Landscape, the Royal Compound of Tsinjoarivo), the Mahafaly Country of Southwestern Madagascar, the Cliff and Caves of Isandra, and Antongona. In 2008, two additional sites were added to the list: Anjanaharibe-Sud Special Reserve (an extension of the Rainforests of the Atsinanana) and the Dry Forests of the Andrefana. UNESCO placed the Rainforests of the Atsinanana on the list of World Heritage in Danger on July 30, 2010 following an increase in illegal logging in the parks since 2009 as a consequence of the 2009-2013 political crisis in Madagascar.

The population was 1,126 at the 2010 census. Founded in 1878, Spring Glen was the first permanent settlement in what is now Carbon County. First settled principally by white Mormon farmers, the community became much more diverse after about 1890, when the development of the area's coal mines brought an influx of immigrants from Southern Europe and other regions. Geography Spring Glen lies along the Price River, just to the south of Helper and southwest of Kenilworth. To the southeast are Carbonville and the county seat, Price. U.S. Route 6 runs past Spring Glen between Price and Helper, and SR-139 branches east from it to become Spring Glen Road, the major street through town. According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all of it land. Climate According to the K√∂ppen Climate Classification system, Spring Glen has a humid continental climate, abbreviated \\"Dfb\\" on climate maps. This climatic region is typified by large seasonal temperature differences, with warm to hot (and often humid) summers and cold (sometimes severely cold) winters. History The first settlers in Spring Glen were a handful of bachelor farmers, starting with James Gay in 1878. Groups of friends and relatives joined the first few homesteaders, mostly independent minded people who were separate from the organized Mormon project to establish what became Emery County. As children began to arrive, a school was started in 1883, but such a public development was the exception rather than the rule. The early settlers were nonconformists, less religious and less social than their counterparts in other Utah settlements, so the community was slow to develop. It was difficult to get the residents to cooperate in any communal projects. The LDS Church organized the first ward here in 1883, but it was not until the winter of 1886‚Äì7 that a company was formed to build an irrigation canal, which was not completed until 1893. The canal company agreed on the name of Spring Glen for the village as well as the company. The Spring Glen townsite was officially surveyed on May 27‚Äì28, 1890. From 1910‚Äì1925 the settlement was called Ewell, in honor of Francis M. Ewell, an 1882 settler who died in 1905. Helper was part of Spring Glen until 1891. Demographics As of the census of 2010, there were 1,126 people living in the CDP. There were 478 housing units, of which 421 were occupied.

In different systems these emanations are differently named, classified, and described, but emanation theory is common to all forms of Gnosticism. In Basilidian Gnosis they are called sonships (œÖ·º±œåœÑŒ∑œÑŒµœÇ huiotetes; sing.: œÖ·º±œåœÑŒ∑œÇ huiotes); according to Marcus, they are numbers and sounds; in Valentinianism they form male/female pairs called syzygies (Greek , from œÉœçŒ∂œÖŒ≥ŒøŒπ syzygoi, lit. \\"yokings together\\"). This source of all being is an Aeon, in which an inner being dwells, known as Ennoea (\\"thought, intent\\", Greek ), Charis (\\"grace\\", Greek ), or Sige (\\"silence\\", Greek ). The split perfect being conceives the second Aeon, Nous (\\"mind\\", Greek ŒùŒøœÖœÇ), within itself. Complex hierarchies of Aeons are thus produced, sometimes to the number of thirty. These Aeons belong to a purely ideal, noumenal, intelligible, or supersensible world; they are immaterial, they are hypostatic ideas. Together with the source from which they emanate, they form Pleroma (\\"region of light\\", Greek ). The lowest regions of Pleroma are closest to darkness‚Äîthat is, the physical world. The transition from immaterial to material, from noumenal to sensible, is created by a flaw, passion, or sin in an Aeon. According to Basilides, it is a flaw in the last sonship; according to others the sin of the Great Archon, or Aeon-Creator, of the Universe; according to others it is the passion of the female Aeon Sophia, who emanates without her partner Aeon, resulting in the Demiurge (Greek ),Lit. \\"half- creator,\\" occasionally referred to as Yaldabaoth, \\"Son of Chaos\\". a creature that should never have been. This creature does not belong to Pleroma, and the One emanates two savior Aeons, Christ and the Holy Spirit, to save humanity from the Demiurge. Christ then took a human form (Jesus), to teach humanity how to achieve Gnosis. The ultimate end of all Gnosis is metanoia (Greek ŒºŒµœÑŒ¨ŒΩŒøŒπŒ±), which is an understanding of the world and higher reality and the knowledge that brings to absolve one of fear of material existence, paving the way to living and experiencing life to its fullest before the soul returns to Pleroma. Aeons bear a number of similarities to Judaeo-Christian angels, including roles as servants and emanations of God, and existing as beings of light. In fact, certain Gnostic Angels, such as Armozel, are also Aeons. The Gnostic Gospel of Judas, recently found, purchased, held, and translated by the National Geographic Society, also mentions Aeons and speaks of Jesus' teachings about them.The Lost Gospel ‚Äì online feature from National Geographic, including Coptic text, English translation, and photos . Valentinus Valentinus assumed, as the beginning of all things, the Primal Being or Bythos, who after ages of silence and contemplation, gave rise to other beings by a process of emanation. The first series of beings, the Aeons, were thirty in number, representing fifteen syzygies or pairs sexually complementary. One common form is outlined below:Mead, p. 231. Scheme of the Aeons The Valentinian system was, until recently, only known through the criticisms of its opponents; however, the discovery of the Nag Hammadi library has given access to Valentinian texts, including sources that have been tentatively identified as written by Valentinus. Tertullian's Against the Valentinians gives a slightly different sequence. The first eight of these Aeons, corresponding to generations one through four below, are referred to as the Ogdoad.Against the Valentinians () Books 7-8. *First generation **Bythos (the One) and Sige (Silence, Charis, Ennoea, etc.) *Second generation **Nous (Nus, Mind) and Aletheia (Veritas, Truth) *Third generation, emanated from Nous and Aletheia **Sermo (the Word) and Vita (the Life) *Fourth generation, emanated from Sermo and Vita **Anthropos (Homo, Man) and Ecclesia (Church)Iren.

Logos is created when Anthropos learns to speak. The first four are called the Tetrad, and the eight are the Ogdoad deities of the Ancient Egyptian pantheon. *First generation **Bythos (the One) and Sige (Silence, Charis, Ennoea, etc.) *Second generation (conceived by the One): **Ennoea (Thought) and Thelesis (Will) *Third generation, emanated from Ennoea and Thelesis: **Nous (or Monogenes) and Aletheia *Fourth generation, emanated from Nous and Aletheia: **Anthropos (Homo, Man) and Ecclesia (Church) *Fifth generation, emanated from Anthropos and Ecclesia: **Logos and Zoe *Sixth generation: **Emanated from Logos and Zoe: ***Bythius and Mixis ***Ageratos and Henosis ***Autophyes and Hedone ***Acinetos and Syncrasis ***Monogenes and Macaria **Emanated from Anthropos and Ecclesia: ***Paracletus and Pistis ***Patricos and Elpis ***Metricos and Agape ***Ainos and Synesis ***Ecclesiasticus and Macariotes ***Theletos and Sophia The order of Anthropos and Ecclesia versus Logos and Zoe is somewhat debated; different sources give different accounts. Logos and Zoe are unique to this system as compared to the previous, and may be an evolved version of the first, totalling 32 Aeons, but it is not clear if the first two were actually regarded Aeons. Sige Pl√©rome de Valentin, from Histoire critique du Gnosticisme; Jacques Matter, 1826, Vol. II, Plate II In the system of Valentinus, as expounded by Irenaeus (i. 1), the origin of things was traced to two eternal co-existent principles, a male and a female. The male was called Bythos or Proarche, or Propator, etc.; the female had the names Ennoea, Charis and Sige. The whole Aeonology of Valentinus was based on a theory of syzygies, or pairs of Aeons, each Aeon being provided with a consort; and the supposed need of the co-operation of a male and female principle for the generation of new ones, was common to Valentinus and some earlier Gnostic systems. But it was a disputed point in these systems whether the First Principle of all was thus twofold. There were those, both in earlier systems, and even among the Valentinians who held, that the origin of things was to be traced to a single Principle, which some described as hermaphrodite; others said was above all sex. And among the Valentinians who counted thirty Aeons, there were those who counted Bythos and Sige as the first pair; others who asserted the Single Principle excluded Bythos from the number, and made out the number of thirty without reckoning him. Thus Irenaeus says of the Valentinians (I. ii. 4. p. 10), \\"For they maintain that sometimes the Father acts in conjunction with Sige, but that at other times he shows himself independent both of male and female.\\" And (I. xi. 5) \\"For some declare him to be without a consort, and neither male nor female, and, in fact, nothing at all; while others affirm him to be masculo-feminine, assigning to him the nature of a hermaphrodite; others, again, allot Sige to him as a spouse, that thus may be formed the first conjunction.\\" Hippolytus supposes Valentinus to have derived his system from that of Simon; and in that as expounded in the Apophasis Megale, from which he gives extracts, the origin of things is derived from six roots, divided into three pairs; but all these roots spring from a single independent Principle, which is without consort. The name Sige occurs in the description which Hippolytus (vi. 18) quotes from the Apophasis, how from the supreme Principle there arise the male and female offshoots nous and epinoia. The name Sige is there given not to either of the offshoots but to the supreme Principle itself: however, in the description, these offshoots appear less as distinct entities than as different aspects of the same Being. Cyril of Jerusalem (Catech. vi. 17) makes Sige the daughter of Bythos and by him the mother of Logos, a fable which he classes with the incests which heathen mythology attributed to Jupiter. Irenaeus (II. xii.) ridicules the absurdity of the later form of Valentinian theory, in which Sige and Logos are represented as coexistent Aeons in the same Pleroma. \\"Where there is Silence\\" he says, \\"there will not be Word; and where there is Word, there cannot be Silence\\". He goes on (ii. 14) to trace the invention of Sige to the heathen poets, quoting Antiphanes, who in his Theogony makes Chaos the offspring of Night and Silence. Ennoea In the attempts made by the framers of different Gnostic systems to explain the origin of the existing world, the first stage in the process was usually made by personifying the conception in the divine mind of that which was to emanate from Him. We learn from Justin Martyr (Ap. I. 26), and from Irenaeus (I. 23), that the word Ennoea was used in a technical sense in the system of Simon. The Latin translation of Irenaeus either retains the word, or renders \\"mentis conceptio.\\" Tertullian has \\"injectio\\" (De Anima, 34). In the Apophasis Megale cited by Hippolytus (Ref. vi. 18, 19, p. 174), the word used is not Ennoia but Epinoia. Irenaeus states (I. 23) that the word Ennoea passed from the system of Simon into that of Menander. In the Barbeliot system which Irenaeus also counts as derived from that of Simon (I. 29), Ennoea appears as one of the first in the series of emanations from the unnameable Father. In the system of Valentinus (Iren. I. i.) Ennoea is one of several alternative names for the consort of the primary Aeon Bythos. For the somewhat different form in which Ptolemaeus presented this part of the system see Irenaeus (I. xii.). Irenaeus criticises this part of the system (II. xiii.). The name Ennoea is similarly used in the Ophite system described by Irenaeus (I. xxx.). Charis Charis, in the system of Valentinus, was an alternative name, with Ennoea and Sige, for the consort of the primary Aeon Bythos (Iren. i. 4). The name expresses that aspect of the absolute Greatness in which it is regarded not as a solitary monad, but as imparting from its perfection to beings of which it is the ultimate source; and this is the explanation given in the Valentinian fragment preserved by Epiphanius (Haer. xxxi. 6), dia to epikechoregekenai auten thesaurismata tou Megethous tois ek tou Megethous. The use of the word Charis enabled Ptolemaeus (quoted by Irenaeus, i. 8) to find in the first tetrad of Aeons, viz., Pater, Monogenes, Charis, Aletheia. The suspicion arises that it was with a view to such an identification that names to be found in the prologue of St. John's Gospel were added as alternative appellations to the original names of the Aeons. But this is a point on which we have no data to pronounce. Charis has an important place in the system of Marcus (Irenaeus, i. 13). The name Charis appears also in the system of the Barbelitae (Irenaeus, i. 29), but as denoting a later emanation than in the Valentinian system. The word has possibly also a technical meaning in the Ophite prayers preserved by Origen (Contra Celsum, vi. 31), all of which end with the invocation . NousEcclesia This higher Ecclesia was held to be the archetype of the lower Ecclesia constituted by the spiritual seed on earth (Iren. I. v. 6, p. 28). In a Gnostic system described by Irenaeus (I. xxx. p. 109) we have also a heavenly church, not, however, as a separate Aeon, but as constituted by the harmony of the first existing beings. According to Hippolytus (v. 6, p. 95), the Naassenes counted three Ecclesiae. It is especially in the case of the church that we find in Christian speculation prior to Valentinus traces of the conception, which lies at the root of the whole doctrine of Aeons, that earthly things have their archetypes in preexistent heavenly things. Hermas (Vis. ii. 4) speaks of the church as created before all things and of the world as formed for her sake; and in the newly discovered portion of the so- called Second Epistle of Clement to the Corinthians (c. 14) the writer speaks of the spiritual church as created before the sun and moon, as pre-existent like Christ Himself, and like him manifested in the last days for men's salvation; and he even uses language which, if it were not sufficiently accounted for by what is said in the Epistle to the Ephesians as to the union between Christ and His church, might be supposed to have affinity with the Valentinian doctrine of the relation between Anthropos and Ecclesia.In the notes to the passages just cited, in Lightfoot's and in Gebhardt and Harnack's editions will be found references to other early writers who have used similar language concerning the church. The author of the Epistle to the Hebrews quotes the direction to Moses to make the tabernacle after the pattern shewn him on the Mount (a passage cited in ), and his argument dwells on the inference that the various parts of the Jewish service were but copies of better heavenly archetypes. This same heavenly tabernacle appears as part of the imagery of the book of the Revelation (, ). In the same book the church appears as the Lamb's wife, the new Jerusalem descending from heaven; and St. Paul's teaching () might be thrown into the form that the church existed in God's election before the foundation of the world. Anthropos As the world is an image of the living Aeon (), so is man an image of the pre-existent man of the . Valentinus, according to Clemens Alexandrinus (Valentini homil. ap. Clem. Strom. iv. 13, 92), spoke of the Sophia as an artist (zographos) making this visible lower world a picture of the glorious Archetype, but the hearer or reader would as readily understand the heavenly wisdom of the Book of Proverbs to be meant by this Sophia, as the 12th and fallen Aeon. Under her (according to Valentinus) stand the world-creative angels, whose head is the Demiurge. Her formation (plasma) is Adam created in the name of the . In him thus made a higher power puts the seed of the heavenly pneumatic essence (). Thus furnished with higher insight, Adam excites the fears of the angels; for even as kosmikoi anthropoi are seized with fear of the images made by their own hands to bear the name of God, i.e. the idols, so these angels cause the images they have made to disappear (Ep. ad amicos ap. Clem. Alex. Strom. ii. 8, 36). Horos According to the doctrine of Valentinus, as described by Irenaeus i. 2, the youngest Aeon Sophia, in her passion to comprehend the Father of all, runs the danger of being absorbed into his essence, from which she is saved by coming into contact with the limiting power Horos, whose function it is to strengthen all things outside the ineffable Greatness, by confining each to its appointed place. According to this version Horos was a previously existing power; but according to another, and apparently a later account, Horos is an Aeon only generated on this occasion at the request of all the Aeons, who implored the Father to avert a danger that threatened to affect them all. Then (as Hippolytus tells the story, vi. 31) he directs the production of a new pair of Aeons, Christ and the Holy Spirit, who restore order by separating from the Pleroma the unformed offspring of Sophia. After this Horos is produced in order to secure the permanence of the order thus produced. Irenaeus (u. s.) reverses this order, and Horos is produced first, afterwards the other pair. The Valentinian fragment in Epiphanius (Haer. 31, p. 171), which seems to give a more ancient form of this heresy, knows nothing of Horos, but it relates as the last spiritual birth the generation of five beings without consorts, whose names are used in the Irenaean version as titles for the supernumerary Aeon Horos. But besides, this Aeon has a sixth name, which in the version of Hippolytus is made his primary title Stauros; and it is explained (Irenaeus, i. 3) that besides his function as a separator, in respect of which he is called Horos, this Aeon does the work of stablishing and settling, in respect of which he is called Stauros. A derivation from is hinted at. The literal earthly crucifixion of the Saviour (that seen by the psychic church, which only believes in the historical Jesus) was meant to represent an archetypal scene in the world of Aeons, when the younger Sophia, Achamoth, is healed through the Savior's instrumentation. The distinction just explained as to the different use of the names Horos and Stauros was not carefully observed by Valentinians. Thus the last word is sometimes used when the function of separation and division is spoken of (Excerpt. ex Script. Theodot. 22 and 42, Clem. Alex. ii. pp. 974, 979), it being remarked in the latter passage that the cross separates the faithful from the unbelievers; and Clem. Alex., who occasionally uses Valentinian language in an orthodox sense, speaks in the same way (Paed. iii. 12, p. 303, and Strom. ii. 20, p. 486). In the Valentinian theory there is a double Horos, or at least a double function discharged by Horos. On the one hand, he discharges as already described, a function within the Pleroma, separating the other Aeons from the ineffable Bythos, and saving them from absorption into his essence. On the other hand, Horos is the outside boundary of the Pleroma itself, giving it permanence and stability by guarding it against the intrusion of any foreign element.

Life  Eduard Sch√ºtt was born in Saint Petersburg, Russia. His father was a skilled cellist, and the family was acquainted with the pianist Anton Rubinstein. At the age of sixteen, Sch√ºtt decided to pursue an artistic career, against the opposition of his father. Rubinstein's influence ultimately convinced Sch√ºtt's father to let him pursue his artistic aspirations.Apel, Lillian (1898). \\"Eduard Sch√ºtt: Artist and Man\\".

Sch√ºtt graduated from the St. Petersburg Conservatory in 1875 with distinction. In 1876, he travelled to Leipzig and studied under Salomon Jadassohn, Ernst Friedrich Richter, and Carl Reinecke. After completing two years of study in Leipzig, he journeyed to Vienna, where he commenced studies with Theodor Leschetizky. Sch√ºtt was favored by Leschetizky, and the two remained close lifelong friends.Apel, Lillian (1898). \\"Eduard Sch√ºtt: Artist and Man\\". Music: devoted to the art, science, technic and literature of music 13: 18. During the following few years, Sch√ºtt concertized in Hungary, Austria, and Bohemia. Around 1882, he composed and premiered his first piano concerto, Op. 7, in several major European cities. From 26 January 1881 to 20 October 1887, he was conductor of the Wiener akademischer Wagner-Verein (Vienna Academic Wagner Society). In 1887, he declined an invitation from Cosima Wagner to become the music director for the Bayreuth Festival. Thereafter, he devoted himself fully to composition and spent a considerable amount of his time at his villa in Meran, which he called \\"Mon Repos\\" (\\"My Peace\\" in French). His primary residence, however, remained in Vienna, where he also did a limited amount of teaching. Throughout his life, Sch√ºtt composed a wide range of works, primarily for the piano, from miniature piano pieces to piano concertos, trios, and suites. He also composed a comic opera.Apel, Lillian (1898). \\"Eduard Sch√ºtt: Artist and Man\\".

The program is in development by Daisuke \\"Pixel\\" Amaya. It is currently in the beta stage of development, since 2006. The program also is capable of opening other sample formats developed by Pixel (ptnoise, ptvoice) as well as some more popular sample formats, such as .wav and .ogg. The primary interface of the program is a piano roll display used to place notes and specify duration, volume, panning, sample, and pitch. The tempo of a song can be set, but it cannot be changed during playback. The .pxtone format also allows the storage of some additional information, such as song comments and song name. Along with Pxtone Collage are included several programs for creating instrument samples (ptnoise and ptvoice format) and a small player application. Included also are DLL and header files for programming with PxTone. History In 1998, Pixel released a small music-writing and playback application known as PiyoPiyo. This format features three melody tracks with customizable wave samples, and a fourth track dedicated solely to drum samples. The editor interface uses the piano roll that would become standard in all of Pixel's future music editors. A considerable flaw with the PiyoPiyo design is that its playback is linked to CPU usage, in that a heavily taxed CPU will cause playback to slow down. Some time later, Pixel developed the Organya format for use in the indie game Cave Story. This format is very similar to PiyoPiyo, with the major difference being support for up to 8 melody tracks and 8 drum tracks for 16 simultaneous sounds. Rather than having the specifications of the waveform editable, Organya uses a built-in library of 100 wave \\"instruments\\" to choose from. Pxtone was developed as a successor to Organya.

Her writing has appeared in Tin House, Fence, BOMB and the fairy tale anthology My Mother She Killed Me, My Father He Ate Me. Early career Nutting attended Bloomingdale High School in Valrico, Florida. She received a bachelor's degree from the University of Florida and a Master of Fine Arts from the University of Alabama. At the University of Alabama, she served as editor of the Black Warrior Review. Nutting has taught creative writing at John Caroll University and the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. She currently teaches at Grinnell College. Writing Nutting is author of the short story collection Unclean Jobs for Women and Girls. The book was selected by judge Ben Marcus as winner of the 6th Starcherone Prize for Innovative Fiction. The book was a ForeWord Book of the Year finalist, as well as an Eric Hoffer Montaigne Medal finalist for thought-provoking texts. Published by now-defunct Starcherone Books, the original edition currently sells for over two hundred dollars on Amazon. Tampa is a novel that combines erotica, satire and social criticism. It claims to address double standards like gender-based expectations of females, regarding beauty and the great extent of mischief that women may be forgiven provided they are young and beauteous. The novel centres on a middle-school teacher who has sexual relations with her students. Nutting was inspired by Debra Lafave, a teacher charged with having sex with her under-age students in 2005. Nutting went to high school with Lafave; seeing someone she knew on the news raised her awareness of the issue of female predators. The book was banned in many bookstores for being too explicit. When asked if it was difficult to come in and out of perspective with a deranged character Nutting replied: \\"It was like going under anesthesia‚Äîonce I was inside it, I felt like I had to make the most of it because it was so difficult to go in and out. I ended up writing in really marathon sessions, 7-8 hours at a time. After I was done each day I had this hangover feeling‚Äî my body felt a grand fatigue even though I‚Äôd been seated the whole time. It took me a while to become verbal again after writing.\\" (Inside Edition). She also explains how her publisher and editors understood that the content needed to be explicit and they didn‚Äôt ask her to tone it down. She contributed to The &NOW; Awards 2: The Best Innovative Writing, &NOW; Books, May 2013.

Andreas Bj√∏rn's shipyard Andreas Bj√∏rn's isle The old, half-timbered workshop building The area now known as Wilders Plads was in the beginning of the 18th century still merely a marshy area north of Christianshavn. In 1735, Andreas Bj√∏rn, obtained permission from King Christian VI to reclaim the area to establish a shipyard in the grounds. It managed to launch 59 ships before his death in 1750, including the naval ship Copenhagen Castle (Kj√∏benhavns Slot) with 44 canons. The oldest building in the area is the half-timbered building at Wilders Plads 10 which was built by Andreas Bj√∏rn in 1736 as housing for workers at his shipyard and workshops for sailmakers. It 52 Strandgade, probably from about 1740, is the former main building of the shipyard. It was originally also used as housing for the most senior employees. Carl and Lars Wilder Bremerholm in 1776 In 1762, it was acquired by Carl Wilder who had made a fortune as a broker and merchant. He added a nail factory to the site before his death in 1764. His son, Lars Wilder, continued running the shipyard until his own death. He died unmarried and left his considerable fortune to the poor. The Wilder Warehouse seen from the harbor The so-called Wilder Warehouse (Danish: Wilders Pakhus) today marks the area's northern boundary with Kr√∏yers Plads. It was built for Carl Wilder by Johan Christian Conradi in 1873. Jacob Holm and B & W In 1814, Wilders Plads was acquired by Jacob Holm. He was a successful grocer and industrialist who was now moving into ship building, founding his own shipyard in the grounds. The northern part of the island was sold to Royal Greenland Trade Department in the late 19th century and Burmeister & Wain took over Jacob Holm's shipyard in 1898. The company had most of its facilities in the southern part of Christianshavn, in the area now known as Christiansbro, but established a branch at Wilders Plads. The White Cut to the left and the Sailmakers' House to the left viewed across Wilders Kanal Social housing Part of the area was redeveloped as social housing in the 1970s and 80s. The first estate was built from 1975 to 1978 and faces the main harbour. It is popularly known as Det Gvide Snit (#The White Cut). A second housing estate facing the canal was completed in 1985. It is known as Den Gule Misundelse' (\\"Yellow Envy\\") and replaced some of Burmeister & Wain's old buildings. Both housing estates are administrated by Lejerbo.

Those particular maps frequently had descriptive legends, which usually consisted of drawings being integrated into the actual map. An example of such a map would be the heavily decorated Catalan Atlas, which was produced in 1375. It was used as a gift to the King of France from the King of the Crown of Aragon.Evelyn Edson. The World Map, 1300‚Äì1492: The Persistence of Tradition and Transformation (Maryland, Johns Hopkins University Press: 2007) p. 55 One other purpose behind maps was propaganda, and in those circumstances they were used to possibly distort or falsify information. The Dutch used a particular map, which was known as the 'Christian knight map' for this purpose during their struggle for independence against Spain. In relation to both Spain and Portugal and their influences on each other in terms of cartography, there was one very significant and fairly obvious example that began to develop in the 15th century. The Portuguese had begun to use scales of latitude on their nautical charts, and once Portuguese cosmographers were being recruited by the Crown of Castile, the same lines began to appear on Spanish charts as well, which eventually developed into what is known as a plane chart.Ricardo Padr√≥n. The Spacious World: Cartography, Literature, and Empire in Early Modern Spain (Chicago, University of Chicago Press: 2004) p. 65 Evolution of the map-making process Evolutionary-wise, the specific measurements used in sea charts began to have a practical impact on world maps beginning in the early 14th century with the inclusion of latitude and longitude. Before hand, cartographic works had been developed through less rational methods than mathematical, such as theology and cosmology, but did include statements of geography and history as well. The beginning of the 14th century also introduced the first atlas, which was created through a series of maps being bound together. The new innovation was not just for show, however, as it had many practical uses due to its improved portability and durability, as well as making it easier for the readers to see. Map-making technique began an alteration through geographical thought. While not every map looked the same, a pattern of features developed through the round shape and typical inclusion of some sort of paradise, and were found on many of the maps of that time.Evelyn Edson. The World Map, 1300‚Äì1492: The Persistence of Tradition and Transformation (Maryland, Johns Hopkins University Press: 2007) p. 165 St. Isidore's T and O map of the world. To better understand the map-making process, a step back in time is required, as Claudius Ptolemaeus, better known as Ptolemy, whose eight-volume work entitled Geography played a large role in the development of cartography once it was translated into Latin in 1406. Ptolemy projected two different types of maps in his text. The first, known as a conic projection, dealt with the latitude parallels consisting of round arcs. The second, known as a pseudoconic projection, consisted of longitude lines being round.Jeremy Harwood. To The Ends of the Earth: 100 Maps That Changed the World. (London, Marshall Editions: 2006) p. 22 Ptolemy's work were heavily influential in Islamic science as well, whose maps were quite similar to the Portolan charts and were partly influential on the Catalan map by Abraham Cresques.Norman J.W. Thrower. Maps & Civilization: Cartography in Culture and Society. (Chicago, University of Chicago Press: 2008) p. 56 In the early 14th century, many of the maps were known as T and O maps, termed because of a circle representing the earth, and within the circle a T-shape to designate the division of different known land masses, which were Europe, Africa, and Asia. This particular style was representative in the well-known Spanish Mappa Mundi which was developed a few centuries beforehand, but was also the first map to actually be printed in 1472. Some of these earlier maps relied heavily on Arabic influence, which is evident in the inclusion of frequent Arabic place names. It is thought that this information could have been gathered through experiences throughout different trade routes. The T-O style of map shows a lack of information regarding the specific details of land masses, but once trade began to flourish, so did the detail in maps.Evelyn Edson. The World Map, 1300‚Äì1492: The Persistence of Tradition and Transformation. (Maryland, Johns Hopkins University Press: 2007) p. 69 Following the simplicity of the T-O style, maps began to grow into a greater, fantasy-inspired style. Where beforehand, the descriptiveness was minimal, maps now included beautiful drawings of angels and mythical creatures, and oftentimes these maps were used to understand what was considered to be the history. In the 15th century, maps began to develop an idea and representation of distinctive frontiers. Where the previous maps had indulged in fantastical depictions, terminology began to show up much more frequently now, such as names for regions and provinces.Jeremy Harwood. To The Ends of the Earth: 100 Maps That Changed the World. (London, Marshall Editions: 2006) p. 32‚Äì51 The influence of an eastern orientation was one of the first things to change from the typical features of maps with the loss of fantastical creatures being depicted and the inclusion of more detailed landmasses, and it is possible that this was happening because Arabic influence was causing maps orientation to move away from the east and more toward the south.Evelyn Edson. The World Map, 1300‚Äì1492: The Persistence of Tradition and Transformation. (Maryland, Johns Hopkins University Press: 2007) p. 202 Portolan charts Portolan chart by Jorge de Aguiar (1492), the oldest known signed and dated chart of Portuguese origin (Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, University of Yale, New Haven, USA) The term portolan is derivative from portolano which translates from Italian into 'pilot's book.' While the orientation of earlier maps was generally in the east, and then it moved southward with the Arabic influence established throughout various trade routes, Portolan charts were oriented to the north to make them easier to read.John R. Short. The World Through Maps: A History of Cartography. (Canada, Firefly Books, ltd: 2003) p.62 Portolan charts began to surface just prior to the beginning of the 14th century, but the division of such a practical creation was very significant in the map-making world. They were specifically used to solve specific problems. Each chart was an individual, which is important in comparison to the typical map, which had to be studied often with some sort of text to accompany it. The development of Portolan charts is thought to have begun due to an increasing overseas trade empire. Portolan charts were produced with a combination of chart and compass, allowing sailors to venture out farther onto the open water without as significant of a fear of the hopelessness of getting lost. The manufacturer of the chart would draw a scaled distance along with compass bearings to create angles in order to connect the different areas. Using the chart, the sailor or navigator would set a course from one point to the next, and then use what are known as rhumb lines, which are lines of longitude that all cross the meridian at exactly the same angle, to translate the desired course onto a compass heading.Ricardo Padr√≥n. The Spacious World: Cartography, Literature, and Empire in Early Modern Spain (Chicago, University of Chicago Press: 2004) p. 61‚Äì62 The charts included descriptive depictions of coastlines, as well as islands, which enabled seafarers who were accustomed to using such navigational tools as the compass to find their way to said coasts and islands at sea. Included on the chart were a series of thick lines that would be used along with the compass to gather ones bearings. Oftentimes the charts did not include any information on inland structures. There were exceptions, but they were few and usually limited to library copies.Malyn Newitt. A History of Portuguese Overseas Expansion 1400‚Äì1668. (Milton Park, Routledge: 2005) p. 7 Not all maps designating information that would be most beneficial to Iberian empires were being produced in Portugal or Spain, and the same applied to the information utilized by the Portolan charts. Other maps were being produced in Italy and in Germany, both of which were incorporating not just geographical ideas, but religious and academic ideas as well. At the same time, they were using the information that Portuguese seamen had ambitiously acquired.Malyn Newitt. A History of Portuguese Overseas Expansion 1400‚Äì1668. (Milton Park, Routledge: 2005) p. 48 The charts of sailing directions expanded as new sailing routes became more prominent, such as what happened when the Canary Islands were initially discovered, followed by the discovery of other Atlantic islands. As was the case with general map- making, some of the charts began to incorporate decorative depictions in them as well. Navigational instruments like these did not just have a significant impact on the idea of space through the Iberian empires, but they also played a role in mobility as well. With the use of practical tools like the Portolan charts, people were able to more successful navigate and respectively move class-wise based upon said success.Evelyn Edson. The World Map, 1300‚Äì1492: The Persistence of Tradition and Transformation. (Maryland, Johns Hopkins University Press: 2007) p. 53‚Äì58 Spanish oceanic and land exploration and navigation Unlike the maps being created in Portugal, those produced in Spain were heavily guarded with an air of secrecy. The Habsburgs heavily guarded the maps and their advanced level of geographical knowledge because they did not want any of their rivals to be able to obtain them in any way to use against them or to use in order to expand their own empires into lands that Spain was eying. The protection of the maps from falling into undesirable hands was done by the prohibition of any of the maps to appear in print. This prevented anybody who was not an active involved person in the business of Spain's empire to view the maps.Ricardo Padr√≥n. The Spacious World: Cartography, Literature, and Empire in Early Modern Spain. (Chicago, University of Chicago Press: 2004) p. 13 With the printing of Spanish maps not just discouraged, but entirely restricted, there are very few that have survived. Cartography was not at all absent from the Spanish empire. Quite the contrary, they were used as an imperial effort to self-represent themselves as an Atlantic or global empire. A majority of this focus was placed upon the Indies and creating a spatial representation of structures that they had yet to examine, but needed to integrate with geographical data that they had already obtained in order to develop maps. As mentioned previously, the revolution of Ptolemy‚Äôs rational thinking was what created such a powerful period in time when it came to cartography, because it was uniting transparency with yet-to-be-realized political function. Spain utilized this through its American empire. At time, through cartography, Spanish culture has been able to elaborate on more than a two-dimensional idea of space, especially in the instances where climates are shown as a 'portion of the sphere.' That being said, outside of cartography, there is a lack of the idea of space in other aspects of the culture.Ricardo Padr√≥n. The Spacious World: Cartography, Literature, and Empire in Early Modern Spain. (Chicago, University of Chicago Press: 2004) p. 40‚Äì49 Americae Sive Qvartae Orbis Partis Nova Et Exactissima Descriptio, 1562 With landmass structures, opposed to the original ocean-focus, becoming more popular on maps, two things began to change when it came to Spanish cartography. First of all, space was being considered in a different light, and secondly, the way maps were drawn began to change as well. Many of these changes were happening in result of the exploration of the New World. Where previously maps had been under close guard, availability began to increase. Not only that, but the significance of cartographic depiction followed a similar trend and geographical connotations were no longer limiting the way maps were developed.Ricardo Padr√≥n. The Spacious World: Cartography, Literature, and Empire in Early Modern Spain. (Chicago, University of Chicago Press: 2004) p. 32 In order to figure the best way to establish control of sovereign land, government officials of Spain began to record, in mass detail, about the territorial land of said establishments. They did not do this without significant prompting, but it still occurred. The information obtained to fill the requirements to take record was often taken from merchants who could provide accurate information based upon experience. Utilizing the significant information allowed for the Spanish empire to develop appropriate policies to incorporate into the expanding areas.Geoffrey Vaughn Scammell. The First imperial Age: European Overseas Expansion c. 1400-1715. (London, Unwin Hyman: 1989) p. 218 While the extreme precautions taken to keep Spanish maps hidden might allude to the fact that maps were not a part of the imperial effort that was not the case. Maps were very much a part of the self-representations of Spain, which was able to show itself as an Atlantic empire through the cartographic lens. Through their efforts and ambitions, which were visually recorded on the relatively few Spanish maps that survived, Spain was able to facilitate a persistence of cultural trends.Ricardo Padr√≥n. The Spacious World: Cartography, Literature, and Empire in Early Modern Spain. (Chicago, University of Chicago Press: 2004) p. 12‚Äì13 Delving deeper into that, a representation of it can be made through the relationship between Spain and America, which is where a geometric rationalization really began to occur through cartography in terms of space. It was in the late sixteenth century when Spain was able to represent this idea through rationalizing the American Empire, which was beginning to spread a bit too thinly.Ricardo Padr√≥n. The Spacious World: Cartography, Literature, and Empire in Early Modern Spain. (Chicago, University of Chicago Press: 2004) p. 39 As time progressed into the 16th century, the development of Spanish maps began to increase, primarily those that were depicting the New World. The actual numerical amount of the maps is unknown, but it isn't thought to have been particularly low. The thing was, however, that they only existed in a manuscript form, and still only certain people were able to get their hands on said manuscript. That is still an improvement from how strictly the Spanish were guarding their maps in earlier centuries, but there was still an air of that protectiveness. For the most part, only people who were involved in the exploration or conquest of the New World were able to obtain the maps. There were a few exceptions to that particular rule that included people who were well-versed in Latin, educational publications for the learned, or being produced for those who were not within the boundaries of the Iberian land. Average readers who wanted to look at such a map would either have to gain access to a black market version or find a woodcut production.Ricardo Padr√≥n. The Spacious World: Cartography, Literature, and Empire in Early Modern Spain. (Chicago, University of Chicago Press: 2004) p. 118 Portuguese oceanic and land exploration and navigation Cartography played a large role in the establishment of the expansive Portuguese trade route, and similarly, the trade route played its role in Portuguese cartography. Maps included certain knowledge obtained solely through the connections Portugal had made through their trade routes in Africa and the East, although many of the maps unfortunately did not survive.Jeremy Harwood. To The Ends of the Earth: 100 Maps That Changed the World. (London, Marshall Editions: 2006) p. 73 Within the first fleets that were sent into the East by Portugal of which there were hopes to develop an economic and trade relationship between the two empires, the leaders of the expedition specifically hired pilots who would be able to gather accurate information in a geographical and navigational sense about the Indian Ocean. There was a map smuggled into Italy in 1502 of Portuguese origin that was documented evidence that the before mentioned pilots were able to gather accurate information, and with that, they created a picture of eastern Africa and western India that was both detailed and valid. As previously mentioned, not only did cartography have a cooperative relationship with the establishment of commerce, but the same applied in a reverse relationship as well. The early expeditions created the well-known Cantino map, but they also were cause of the gathering of information dealing with trade within the Indian Ocean region, which was important in the establishment of Portugal's expansive trade routes.Malyn Newitt. A History of Portuguese Overseas Expansion 1400‚Äì1668. (Milton Park, Routledge: 2005) p. 62 \\"Terra Brasilis\\", Miller Atlas, 1519, French National Library. It is important to note that not all of the information on charts and maps were limited to the seas and oceans, or even the coastlines for that matter. That was primarily the case, but there were exceptions. There were copies of maps that did include information about land areas past the coast, though they were usually reserved for library use. An example of a map that did include land information, as well as trade information that surpassed what was typically on a map, was the Catalan Atlas, which was dated 1375. When the Portuguese explored coasts, for example the coast of West Africa, cartographers and navigators would carefully record progress. They were sure to include the names of the places they encountered, as well as doing their best to draw the coast. Unlike Spain, however, despite the fact that there was supposedly a policy of secrecy attached to these records, it was quite often that as soon as data from the voyages was obtained, it was almost instantly recorded for public use and knowledge. Specifically, cartographers began to include actual definition in the territorial land. Cities, rivers, and mountain ranges all began to show up on some maps, whereas others still just included the bare minimum of the outline of the coast. Building from that, maps began to take on an ornamental value. No longer were the purposes just restrained to the seeking of political and economic knowledge, but they became decorative. Building upon the evolution of cartography, the Portuguese went from simply incorporating the waters they traveled to incorporating land masses such as cities, mountains, and rivers. The Portuguese expanded map-making even further by the introduction of the representation of wind systems in the making of their maps. Once they began to correctly understand the wind systems in both the Indian and Atlantic Oceans, they were able to use that knowledge in order to expand their global trade routes even further, which in turn established an even further spread out empire. While the Portuguese were very innovative in their map-making, they still relied heavily on the cartographical knowledge of others, such as the Arabs, Japanese, and Chinese, when it came down to the actual observing and mapping of the global world. They did obtain their own information, but the maps were visibly a mixture of those observations, as well as other information that they had taken from other experts on cartography. The knowledge and the methods of obtaining information used by Portuguese cartographers drew upon the skill and knowledge of Muslim navigators. That being said, they still would conduct their own evaluations by writing down details they obtained when at port in other areas. The same applied to how they obtained some of their information of the land masses that were beginning to show up more and more in maps, opposed to the former method of just applying information regarding to the seas and oceans.Malyn Newitt. A History of Portuguese Overseas Expansion 1400‚Äì1668. (Milton Park, Routledge: 2005) p. 265 As time progressed into the late sixteenth century, Portugal‚Äôs ocean-based trade routes began to become more widely known. While their maps were not nearly as heavily guarded as those under the Habsburg rule in Spain, they were still kept within Portugal. That began to change when those maps had started to appear abroad. Not only that, but Portuguese navigators began to take positions in other countries, which furthered the spread of the Portuguese Empire in other nations.Malyn Newitt. A History of Portuguese Overseas Expansion 1400‚Äì1668. (Milton Park, Routledge: 2005) p. 203 The Portuguese also attempted to utilize cartography in order to integrate the indigenous people under colonial rule. Displacement of these indigenous populations did occur in under a cartographic lens, but despite that, a representation of imperial space was established.Neil Safier. \\"The Confines of Colony: Boundaries, Ethnographic Landscapes, and Imperial Cartography in Iberoamerica.\\" in James R.

Colors (dark) (light) Championships The Toyota Tamaraws had a manpower build-up at the start of the season by acquiring top forwards Danny Florencio and Estoy Estrada. The Tamaraws capped an incredible year-run by winning two titles. On July 15, Toyota defeated new team Filmanbank, 132-113 in Game four to win the PBA All Filipino crown, three games to one. The Tamaraws won the first two games of the series easily but the Bankers avoided a sweep by taking the third game. After failing to land in the finals berth of the Second Conference, the Tamaraws captured the Invitational championship behind imports Carlos Terry and Bruce \\"Sky\\" King. On December 14, Toyota defeated Tanduay, 108-98 in Game four of the finals series for a 3-1 victory as the Tamaraws won their 5th PBA title. Awards Robert Jaworski was named the league's Most Valuable Player (MVP). Summary The Tamaraws easily made it to the All-Filipino Conference semifinals with 12 wins and two losses at the end of the two-round eliminations and tied with their rivals Crispa Redmanizers. In the semifinal round, Toyota eliminated Crispa, finishing with a 4-2 won-loss record along with Filmanbank, which occupied the first finals berth. The Tamaraws scored a 3-1 finals victory against a Filmanbank squad led by American Billy Robinson and local standouts Larry Mumar and Jun Papa. Toyota brought in two Americans for the Open Conference, 6-10 Bruce King and 6-11 T.J. Robinson. The Tamaraws won six of their seven games in the second round of eliminations with Carlos Terry replacing Robinson. They shove out Royal Tru-Orange to salvage the last semifinals berth. Toyota started with two straight defeats in the semifinal round and were knock off from the finals picture, winning only two of their six outings. Under assistant coach Fort Acu√±a, the Tamaraws swept Tanduay in three games in their series for third place. With their victories against Yugoslavia and Canada in exhibition games, the Tamaraws were again installed as favorites to defend the Invitational crown they won last season, although Danny Florencio was not able to play anymore and Estoy Estrada was not to recover from his slump. Toyota grabbed the first seat of the championship with ease by winning all of its four games in the round-robin among five teams and bested second qualifier Tanduay (3-1) in four games of their best-of-five final series.

It occurred near the mouth of modern Sele River, southern Campania, southern Italy. Background Marcus Licinius Crassus trapped Spartacus in Bruttium by building a system of ditches and walls. After a failed truce, Spartacus gathered his army for battle. He ordered his horse to be brought to him, drew his sword, and slew the animal. He proclaimed to his troops that if he should win the day, he would have many horses to choose from, but if he should lose the upcoming battle and the Romans should win the day, he would not need one. Appian wrote that Spartacus then launched several skirmishing assaults upon the Roman defenders, striking them swiftly and almost with silence. After slaying a number of the Roman guards and penetrating the Roman defenses, Spartacus and about 50,000 rebels managed to slip past Crassus' defenses, while Gannicus and Castus remained behind with the remaining 12,000 soldiers of the rebel army. Battle On the banks of the Sele River, Spartacus' army finally met the Roman legions of Crassus on the open battlefield. The gladiators charged at the Roman ranks, colliding with a wall of shields and swords. Though the rebels fought hard and took down many Roman soldiers, they also suffered heavy casualties in the process. Spartacus rallied his troops and led an advance against Crassus, who was watching the battle from afar mounted on his horse. In the midst of the battle, Spartacus tried desperately to reach Crassus, killing two centurions in the process. Appian wrote that during the battle, Spartacus was severely wounded in the leg and was forced to get down on his knees. Despite his injury, the rebel leader refused to give up and continued fighting, killing several more Roman soldiers before he was finally overpowered and killed. Aftermath At the end of the battle, Crassus and his men were victorious, though they too had suffered some heavy casualties. According to Appian, the numbers of dead on both sides were extremely high and impossible to count. Appian pointed out in his sources that only about 1,000 Roman soldiers fell in the battle, but other historians believe that Roman casualties were much higher than that. Spartacus also died in the battle, but his body was never recovered. Modern estimates suggest the number of rebel casualties were as high as 36,000 killed. Six thousand survivors of the revolt were captured and crucified on Crassus' orders, while 5,000 others who escaped from Crassus' troops were captured and killed by the Spanish legions under Pompey, possibly in northern Italy.

Rise of the far left During the mid-sixties, there was a strong wave of radical leftism in Sweden, sometimes precipitating heavily publicized events like the B√•stad riots and the occupation of the student union building at Stockholm University - though never causing actual fatalities, in either street fighting or domestic political terror acts, as it did in Western Germany and Italy during these years. \\"Solidarity\\" and \\"awareness\\" became watchwords, first in literary and student circles, then in the socialist/syndicalist underground, and finally, in the media and the government. By the early seventies, people and government, led by Prime Minister Olof Palme (s), rose in protest against oppression and war in countries as distant as South Africa and Vietnam (at the end of 1972, Palme famously indicted the American shock bombings of Hanoi and compared them to Nazi war crimes such as the destructions of Lidice and Oradour; the USA responded by calling home her ambassador).Leif Leifland, Frostens √•r (in Swedish) (1997), The Swedish support for the ANC in and outside of South Africa and FNL and the Hanoi government in the Vietnam war were steady not only in words, popular support and help to enter the diplomatic arena, but also in economic (though not military) state subsidies. After Vietnam was reunited in 1975, for instance, Sweden supported the construction of a modern pulp plant at Bai Bang. In 1973, journalists Jan Guillou and Peter Bratt exposed Informationsbyr√•n, a secret agency operating with some assistance of military personnel, but not a part of the military intelligence and not formally run by the military. One of its aims was to gather intelligence on communists and other people regarded as dangerous to national security. While the existence of such a thing, and in particular of its implied links to the Social Democratic party structure, was fiercely denied, the question continued to surface in a number of political scandals over the years, until it became the subject of serious historical discussion, a few state-issued retrospective white papers and political recant. Although some details are a bit hazy (including when and how it began) this \\"internal spying\\" outside of the ordinary state intelligence services, is now considered an established fact. IB in the form unraveled by Guillou and Bratt did not operate, it seems, beyond the mid-seventies. The constitutional practice was changed several times during this decade. In 1971 the Riksdag became unicameral. By the new constitution of 1974 the monarch was divorced from all power of political intervention on their own, the end-point of an evolution that had been going on ever since the early years of the century. There have been no real attempts to abolish formal monarchy, though. Environmentalism and nuclear power The 1970s and '80s saw a rise in environmentalism ‚Äì the ambiguous result of a referendum in 1980 advised government to phase out Swedish nuclear power by the year of 2010. The Chernobyl disaster in 1986 caused considerable radioactive fallout over Sweden. With only the Barseb√§ck nuclear power plant permanently closed, and ten out of twelve reactors still running (as of 2007), this schedule was no longer regarded as realistic, and in the 2006 elections the liberal (Folkpartiet) and the Moderate Party supported not only reversing the decision but building a few fresh nuclear plants. The Green Party was founded in 1981, entered the Riksdag in 1988 and supported G√∂ran Persson's Social Democratic government from 1998 to 2006. Right-wing intermission The 1976 parliamentary elections brought a liberal/right-wing coalition to power after almost half a century of social democrat leadership, and Mr Palme gave way to Thorbj√∂rn F√§lldin (of the Centre Party, a former farmers/landowners party which had incorporated social liberal ideas as well as the burgeoning environmental debate). Over the next six years, four governments ruled and fell, composed by all or some of the parties that had won in 1976, and the questions of energy and of battling the economic recession came to the fore. The fourth liberal government in these years, again with F√§lldin at the helm, seemed somewhat baffled by these problems and had neither the support of a firm majority in the parliament, nor a clear mandate from the non-socialist part of the Swedish electorate. Predictably it came under fire both from the Social Democrats and trade unions, and from the Moderate Party, now heading in an increasingly Friedman-inspired and market liberal direction, and it was defeated in the elections of 1982, with Mr. Palme returning to the PM's seat. During the 1980s there were several incidents of foreign, probably Soviet, submarines violating the Swedish territorial borders. In late 1981 the Soviet submarine U 137 ran ashore inside a restricted zone off the Karlskrona naval base, and became headline news. Though the particular fact was kept secret at the time, nuclear activity, probably from torpedo warheads was detected on board and reported to PM F√§lldin while the vessel was still stuck in the firth. The incident marked a turning-point both in Soviet-Swedish relations and in the discussion in Sweden about defence, the Soviet Union and ultimately the place of Sweden in the arena of the Cold War. Assassination of Olof Palme On February 28, 1986, Prime Minister Palme was murdered as he was walking the streets of Stockholm with his wife. The crime came as a shock‚Äîindeed it is sometimes referred to as a national trauma, or an event by which Sweden \\"lost her innocence\\". The main suspect Christer Pettersson was convicted of the murder, but the conviction was reversed on appeal because the gun was never found. Pettersson died in 2004. Palme was succeeded by his deputy Ingvar Carlsson. Memorial plaque of the Olof Palme assassination.

Persons who are lacking in comfort are uncomfortable, or experiencing discomfort. A degree of psychological comfort can be achieved by recreating experiences that are associated with pleasant memories, such as engaging in familiar activities,Daniel Miller, The Comfort of Things (2009). maintaining the presence of familiar objects, and consumption of comfort foods. Comfort is a particular concern in health care, as providing comfort to the sick and injured is one goal of healthcare, and can facilitate recovery.Katharine Kolcaba, Comfort Theory and Practice: A Vision for Holistic Health Care and Research (2003). Persons who are surrounded with things that provide psychological comfort may be described as being \\"in their comfort zone\\". Because of the personal nature of positive associations, psychological comfort is highly subjective. The use of \\"comfort\\" as a verb generally implies that the subject is in a state of pain, suffering or affliction, and requires alleviation from that state. Where the term is used to describe the support given to someone who has experienced a tragedy, the word is synonymous with consolation or solace. However, comfort is used much more broadly, as one can provide physical comfort to someone who is not in a position to be uncomfortable. For example, a person might sit in a chair without discomfort, but still find the addition of a pillow to the chair to increase their feeling of comfort. Something that provides this type of comfort, which does not seek to relieve hardship, can also be referred to as being \\"comfy\\". Like certain other terms describing positive feelings or abstractions (hope, charity, chastity), comfort may also be used as a personal name. Concepts Rama comforts Sita There are various psychological studies about the feeling of comfort, and they have resulted in a few conclusions. The idea of comfort varies among each person; however, there are a few universal themes of comfort that apply to everyone. Most of these universal themes falls under the physical comfort such as contact comfort, comfort food, and thermal comfort.  Contact comfort  Contact comfort is the satisfaction with someone's touch, like a mother's embrace. This is essential to a child's development. = Harry Harlow study = One of the most famous developmental psychological studies is Harry Harlow's development experiment with monkeys. He separated baby monkeys at birth and raised them with surrogate mothers. There were two types of surrogate mothers, a metal wire one and a one covered with cloth, and each had a nozzle that represented breast feeding. The surrogate mother covered in cloth represented comfort. At the end of the experiment, the psychologist saw that the monkeys would choose the cloth surrogate over the wire surrogate. They concluded that having basics needs is essential, but there is the need of closeness and affection. This experiment justified that importance of comfort and warmth for child development. All the monkeys that grew up from the experiment expressed a behavior of aggression and atypical sexual behaviors.  Comfort food  Comfort foods are foods intentionally consumed to move the eater into a pleasurable state. This could be credited to food preferences and childhood experiences (like a mother's cooking). = Physiological responses = Comfort food are usually chosen because of previous experiences of happiness linked with it. For example, chocolate is held as a popular comfort food as it is follows the pleasurable sweetness and the positive association with gifts/rewards. The time of day also play a role in consuming comfort foods. Most people tend to eat simply because \\"it's lunch time\\" and only 20% of the time is due to actual hunger Popular Comfort Foods = Food preferences = Food preferences splits into two categories, snack-related and meal-related. If a child was exposed to many snacks growing up, he/she would focus on more snack-related comfort foods later on in life. Food preference ranges through male/female, and younger/older. Females and the young demographic prefer snack-related comfort foods, while the male and older demographic prefer meal-related comfort foods.  Thermal comfort  Comfort level average on the temperature Thermal comfort is a satisfaction of the ambient air temperature and humidity. Psychologists devised a study to determine the most comfortable temperature. The study had people answering a survey as the temperature changed around them. From the surveys, psychologist found many people had no opinion of a range of temperature. This was labeled temperature neutrality, which is the rate as the person metabolism is shifting the same rate as the surrounding temperature. The average comfortable temperature is 30 degrees Celsius. Temperatures too hot (35 ¬∞C and above) and temperatures too low (12 ¬∞C and below) are considered uncomfortable to many people. = Thermal neutrality = Thermal Neutrality (Thermal Neutral Zone) is the temperature range where it is neither comfortable or uncomfortable. The human body's metabolism is burning calories at the same rate as the temperature around. This would be around 24 ¬∞C (room temperature), and people have no opinion about the temperature. Thermal Neutrality is often also used in animal raising. For example, farmers maintain the neutral temperature for cattle to prevent cold stress. = Everyday uses = * Floor Surface Temperature - too hot or too cold floors cause discomfort, people wear light shoes or have heated floors. * Ventilation - no proper air flow throughout a room causes the room to be too hot, windows, fans allow a man-made air current, and air conditioning helps with the heat.

With its 78 meters rising up in the sky, the church tower of the \\"Chapelle du Kreisker\\" is the highest in Brittany. The word Kreisker means the downtown. Built in the 14th and 15th centuries on the site of an ancient place of worship, it's one of the major works of Breton religious architecture and a testimony of the flourishing economy of the town in the 15th century with the highest (78 m) and most audacious belfry in Brittany. An essential coastal landmark for navigation, it was for that reason restored and thus saved from destruction on Napoleon‚Äôs order in 1807. Striking circular view from the top (169 steps). History The origin of the chapel goes back to the 6th century. A young linen maid who had worked on a holiday in the honour of the Virgin, despite Saint Kirec disapproval became suddenly completely paralysed. After her repentance the Saint healed her and she gave him her house to be converted into a chapel. The chapel was called \\"Kreis-Ker\\" because it was located in the middle of a village, in the inner suburb of St Pol de L√©on. It is likely that the first chapel was made of wood and it must not have withstood the ravages of the Normans in the 9th century. The tradition related that the English after having burnt the town in 1375, have rebuilt the Kreisker. Some architectural features such as the \\"perpendicular style\\" at the base of the tower are the obvious sign of an influence from across the Channel. Settled on a long-term basis in St Pol de L√©on after the war of succession of Brittany, the English could, indeed, convert the tower into a look-out post turned towards the sea and the surrounding countryside. A guard room in the north porch is a virtually intact example of a conventional accommodation at the end of the 14th century. In the 15th century, after the departure of the English, the tower was crowned by a superb spire and the edifice was slightly modified. The steeple has been saved from demolition by Napol√©on in 1807 thanks to its usefulness for navigation. Throughout the middle ages until the Revolution, the city council used the Kreisker as assembly room. Still today, the chapel and its tower applies a powerful presence on the city. Norman and British influences are visible on the architecture of this classified historic monument. World War I era charity art-postcard miniature painting of the chapel & street scene (east side); 1916 Description The tower rests on 4 pillars each side of a height of 3.20 m. When comparing the light-weight of the pillars to the height of the tower they support, one can hardly understand that this massive structure stands on apparently such a weak foundation. Magnificent specimen of \\"clocher √† jour\\" the granite spire is an octagon pierced by 80 openings which do not let the wind buffet it. The north porch (flamboyant style) is more work than the south porch (contrary to the tradition of the period). From the balustrade that can be accessed by a staircase of 169 steps, one can enjoy a splendid and awesome panorama. The church tower can be accessed in July and August to allow the viewer to enjoy the view on all the region from its top railing. West side The main features of the Kreisker chapel are:-  The north portal  The north portal and porch is carved from granite. The triangular pediment over the porch had held carvings of the coats of arms of many of the chapel's benefactors but these were chiseled away during the French Revolution. At the porch's summit is a statue of the Virgin Mary with child which dates to the 15th century. The external arcade of the porch is decorated with ten statuettes depicting bearded patriarchs. In the Voussoirs are carvings of vine leaves, thistles and cabbages. Inside the porch five niches on either side hold niches but no statues were ever completed to fill them. The porch leads to two doors giving entry to the cathedral and these are decorated with carvings of different kinds of foliage, monsters, domestic animals griffons and chim√®res.

The altar has four twisted columns, magnificently carved, and a painting on canvas of the \\"visitation\\" and a copy of the \\"Albane\\".

Africa has gathered the attention of western tourists, western explorers, and western imperialists from all over. As such, Africa has been heavily influenced over time by western interests.  History = Colonization of Africa  Even before the age of exploration, countries have been acting based on their own personal interests. It was during the late 1800s that the western world really started to explore deeper into the heart of Africa. What the explorers found was an abundance of land and resources. The only thing standing in their way was a group of primitive people with spears, not guns. Through this technological advantage, Europe was able to successfully claim Africa, its people, and its resources as its own. Seeking only to reap the economic and territorial benefits, settlers created quick local governments instead of industrializing Africa. When countries in Africa began to declare their independence, these newly formed countries were left hundreds of years behind the Western world, with corrupt governments in control. 350px  The White Man's Burden  First published in 1899 in McClure's magazine, \\"The White Man's Burden\\" is a poem of obligation by Rudyard Kipling, rallying the Western world to go to Africa in order to save a supposedly condemned culture.\\"The White Man's Burden.\\" McClure's Magazine 12 (Feb. 1899).Images The White Man's Burden portrays imperialism as a justified duty. Kipling suggests that Africa's purpose was to act as a stepping-stone for the white man's advancement.  Berlin Conference (1884)  The Berlin Conference is an example of the Western world's view on imperialism. The conference essentially constituted the division of the African continent among leaders of Western countries. The participating Western countries represented at the conference included Britain, France, Germany, Denmark, Italy, and others. Their goal was to address the struggle and competition for colonizing Africa. As if the continent was free property, Africa was divided and shared among the Western world.Spiegel, Steven L. World Politics in a New Era. Fourth ed. Oxford: Oxford UP, 2009. 518. Print.  The statistics = Politics  From the mid-1900s, Africa slowly gained its independence through a series of coups and uprisings.\\"The Scramble for Africa: This year 17 African nations mark 50 years of independence from a resource-hungry Europe\\". www.aljazeera.net. Retrieved 2010- 04-18 In 2002, all African countries except Morocco joined together to form the African Union.Thabo Mbeki (9 July 2002). \\"Launch of the African Union, 9 July 2002: Address by the chairperson of the AU, President Thabo Mbeki\\". ABSA Stadium, Durban, South Africa: africa-union.org. The mission of this organization is to promote economic and political growth within Africa and provide a form of continental protection. The AU works to combat the historical effects of colonization and apartheid to unify African nations in the mission to address the complex, multifaceted social, economic, and political challenges facing the continent. The AU is very similar to the European Union or NATO. All of these blocks work within the United Nations to push their policies forward. However The AU is a fairly new block compared to the EU and NATO, and therefore is disadvantaged.  Health and Wellness  Western media often portrays Africa as being very impoverished. Global educational inequalities pose major issues for a number of African countries. For example, Hungary's literacy rate of 99% starkly contrasts with Mali's rate of 26%.http://www.data/worldbank.org High rates of malnutrition and disease are a concern for many African nations.  Significance  This topic is significant to our world today because Africa is part of our world. Rich in natural resources such as diamonds and oil, Africa stands as a major contributor to the world economy. If promoting stability and human rights for economic benefits is not enough, think about this issue from an ethical point of view. Poverty prevents villages from installing wells causing people to travel three miles for dirty lake water that no one in the West would even think about drinking. Corrupt governments are too busy accepting bribes to notice or prevent civil war and massacre within their own borders. Fear drives families to migrate to \\"safer\\" areas resulting in cramp and unsanitary refugee camps. Little food, clean water, medical supplies and basic safety are being stripped from people who share this world with us. Yet these basic rights are the ones that the west seems to take for granted.  Current NGO's  Non- government Organizations are the world's single forms of international organization, and promote educations, political, human rights and economical equality. The international system is anarchic and without NGO's, there is no hope to create international organization.  UN  The purpose of the United Nations, one of today's only forms of international order, is to promote international peace. Peace is an idea that almost everyone is in support of. However peace cannot create itself. Without action our world will always be subject to violence and millions of people will be living in constant fear and hunger.  Different perspectives = Africa in media  The first perspective believes in the complete opposite of this paper. While there are many who believe that Africa is in need, there are many that think Africa does not need help. Unless you have actually traveled to Africa, your only understanding of the culture and area is primarily based on media, and even more specifically, movies. In October, BBC published an article about the growing corruption and devastation in Africa. In response to this article, Edward Mendy stated, \\"The BBC article, in my opinion, was a typical distortion and sensationalizing of news out of Africa\\".Mendy, Edward. \\"Africa is not Depressing\\". Africa: The Good News- Web. 15 March. 2011. http://www.africagoodnews.com/africa/newsletters/item/2109-africa-is-not- depressing.html He continues on claiming, \\"Africa is developing. The development may be slow but it is sure\\". [7] Lawyer Mendy is not the only one who feels this way. Many others believe that Western Media and especially film has exaggerates. \\"To date only African cinema has dealt with real African dramas\\".\\"Hollywood in Africa- the Early Years.\\" Gorillaland. Web. 15 March 2011. .  Charity Those with this perspective believe that we are neglecting Africa and need to help it. For example, in The Economist, the author wrote, \\"too often the world has dithered open-mouthed as evil men have slaughtered Daruris or Rwandans\\".Sir. \\"Don't Let Him Linger.\\" The Economist 398.8723 (2011): 14. Print. This perspective states that it is out duty to humanity to aid those less fortunate than us, including Africa, and that we owe our fortune to the country.  Priority  The last perspective is a mix of the latter two. This perspective acknowledges Africa's current condition, but does not help due to personal potential cost or the belief that aiding Africa is not their responsibility. This is the attitude most people carry. To most people the poverty and corruption in Africa is prevalent, yet the thought of personal sacrifice in order to help is often enough to turn us away. The other reason people are turned away is because with organizations such as Oxfam and the United Nations, it feels like there are already institutions created solely for the purpose of aiding others, so the responsibility is upon these institutions. Leaders such as the United States \\"had vowed never to return to a conflict it couldn't understand, between clans and tribes it didn't know, in a country where the US had no national interests\\". Unfortunately it is this perspective that challenges perspective number two. Often people want to help but are faced with many costs if they are to help.

The building is located in downtown Milwaukee, Wisconsin, at the Milwaukee River and Wells Street, which was once known as Oneida Street.TMER&L; Building, Old Milwaukee.net The company began operating electric street cars in 1890. Their expanding network of streetcar and interurban railway lines were powered by several of their own power plants. As the company generated more power than they used, they sold the excess electricity, and, as Wisconsin Energy Corporation, eventually became the major supplier of power to eastern Wisconsin.TMER&L; at trainweb.org The American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) describes the plant as the \\"first central power station in the United States to be equipped and successfully operated with pulverized coal.\\" The oldest building of the complex is the machine shop and boiler room #2, designed by E. Townsend Mix and built in 1890 for the Edison Illuminating Company. In 1896 the company and building were merged into the Milwaukee Electric Railway and Light Company. In 1900 TMER&L; built the Oneida Street Plant just south of the old Edison building. Boiler room #3 was added north of the Edison building in 1923 and 1925. Boiler room #4 was added in 1938. With From 1918 to 1920, the plant was the site of pioneering experiments into the use of pulverized coal-fired boilers. The chief engineer for the company directed experiments to determine whether pulverized coal would conserve fuel and reduced the cost of electrical power. This change was seen as controversial, and was opposed by many engineers. However, pulverized coal was determined to be much more efficient than stoker firing in the central station boilers. In addition to the change in the coal, a \\"water screen\\" was developed to reduce the temperature of the waste ash, to prevent it from fusing as slag on the floor of the boiler. Soon, boilers all over the country began using pulverized coal, due to the greater efficiency of the process. For this, the site is recognized as a National Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark, in 1980, by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. The building was added to the National Register of Historic places in 1984. However, the power plant was decommissioned and the building was renovated in 1987. The building currently houses the Patty and Jay Baker Theater Complex and the Milwaukee Repertory Theater.

Plot Jimmy hosts South Park Elementary's first annual comedy awards show. Among the awards given are the award for Most Unfunny People, which goes to the Germans, and the Kathy Griffin Award, given for the celebrity most likely to show up and receive it, which goes to Tyler Perry. The only person to laugh at Perry is Token, who appears upset with himself after realizing that no one else finds Perry funny. When the Germans find out that they have been voted Most Unfunny People, they are furious and the next day German chancellor Angela Merkel, German president Christian Wulff and the rest of the German government attack South Park Elementary. They take the students hostage and unveil a robot called the XJ-212 Funnybot, in an attempt to show the students that Germans are funny. Funnybot tells jokes in a robotic tone, punctuated by the punch line \\"Awkward!\\" Funnybot takes the comedy world by storm, becoming ubiquitous in all kinds of media. This distresses a number of famous human comedians, such as Adam Sandler and Jay Leno, who fear for their livelihoods. The comedians decide to storm South Park Elementary, demanding that the students stop Funnybot. Jimmy, Stan, Cartman and Kyle take up the task, but it is complicated by Funnybot's increasingly sinister behavior. During a stand-up performance, Funnybot reveals that his body houses two rotary cannons, which he then proceeds to fire into the audience, resulting in numerous deaths. The boys manage to gain access to Funnybot, only to discover that he plans to destroy the world as the ultimate joke. Funnybot connects to the defense mainframes of both the United States and Russia, arming the nuclear missiles of both countries. The boys are unable to disconnect Funnybot due to a defensive field surrounding him. However, Kyle remembers that robots can be confused by a logical paradox, which inspires Jimmy to present Funnybot with a comedy award. This confounds Funnybot's programming, since one who accepts an award for being funny is clearly taking themselves and comedy seriously, which is not funny. The loop ultimately overwhelms Funnybot's circuits, deactivating it. Afterwards, the action moves to a junkyard, where the Germans, the boys, the comedians, and President Barack Obama overlook a massive hole. The boys push a wooden crate onto a platform, where it is encased inside three massive metallic shells and dropped into the large hole, which is filled with concrete. Funnybot then appears, stating that he now knows that comedy is meant to be performed by humans. A noise is heard from the concrete-filled hole, and it is revealed to be Tyler Perry, buried in the ground. Jimmy admits that he has learned his lesson and promises that there will not be a comedy awards show next year, and Cartman ends the episode by saying \\"Or will there be?\\", breaking the fourth wall. Cultural references The first act of the episode parodies The Comedy Awards. Funnybot shares several characteristics with the Daleks, a villain species from the long-running BBC television series Doctor Who, and Nomad, a robot from \\"The Changeling\\", a 1967 episode of Star Trek: The Original Series.Frequently Asked Questions, South Park Studios, May 2011 A variety of references are made to the death of Osama bin Laden, which occurred three days prior to the airing of the episode. President Barack Obama is shown giving a speech addressing Funnybot's attempt to destroy humanity in the same location in which he gave his address concerning bin Laden, and much of the speech in the episode is lifted word-for-word from the real address. Bin Laden is further referenced at the conclusion of the episode, where President Obama states \\"I am pleased to announce the greatest threat to mankind is gone forever.\\" The \\"greatest threat\\" that Obama is referencing is Tyler Perry, who was buried alive. When the boys attempt to stop Funnybot at the television studio, a poster titled One And A Half Men can be seen in the hallway, mocking Charlie Sheen's departure from the show. Reception=Ratings In its original American broadcast on May 5, 2011, \\"Funnybot\\" was seen by 2.591 million viewers, according to Nielsen Media Research. It finished third in overall viewers, yet tied for first with a 1.8 rating in the critical 18‚Äì49 age demographic. This represents an audience drop of roughly 17% from the season fifteen premiere \\"HUMANCENTiPAD\\", which drew 3.108 million viewers, and compares negatively to the second episode of season fourteen, \\"The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs\\", which drew 3.24 million viewers. Reviews The episode received a mixed to negative reaction from critics. IGN gave the episode a 6.5/10 rating, stating \\"this episode could really be summed up in three words: not very good.\\" TV Fanatic, while praising the ability of the show to stay with current events, awarded the episode a mixed review of 3.5 out of 5, noting \\"it wasn't the strongest episode of the show's history.\\" The A.V. Club agreed, giving the episode a tepid C+, noting that \\"'Funnybot' was a bit too 'NON-SEQUITUR' for me, sticking to easy jokes about easy targets and then‚Äîlike Funnybot himself‚Äîpadding out its kernel of an idea with random nonsense that left the whole thing feeling a little slight.\\" While praising the episode's central concept, Assignment X nevertheless concluded that Funnybot had \\"a good idea that strangely doesn't deliver on the funny.\\" Positive reviews focused mainly on the show's ability to quickly incorporate current events into its episodes. Entertainment Weekly noted \\"One of the most fun parts about watching South Park is slowly piecing together its seemingly inane and ridiculous plot points and realizing that its creators are actually delivering a well-thought-out and relevant statement.\\" The Wall Street Journal echoed this sentiment, claiming the episode was \\"an impressive example of speedily manufactured humor.\\" ReferencesExternal links * \\"Funnybot\\" Episode guide at South Park Studios * \\"Funnybot\\" Full episode at South Park Studios * * Category:Television episodes set in Germany Category:Television episodes about robots Category:South Park (season 15) episodes Category:Cultural depictions of German people Category:Cultural depictions of Adam Sandler Category:Cultural depictions of Angela Merkel Category:Cultural depictions of Barack Obama ","title":"Funnybot"},{"id":"31661259","text":"The Bold is an epithet which may refer to: People: *Boles≈Çaw II the Generous (c. 1041 or 1042‚Äì1081 or 1082), also the Bold and the Cruel, King and Duke of Poland *Brendan the Bold (c. 484‚Äìc. 577), Irish monastic saint *Charles the Bold or the Rash (1433-1477), Duke of Burgundy *Mstislav Mstislavich the Bold (died 1228), prince of Kievan Rus *Philip III of France, le Hardi (the Bold) (1245-1285), King of France *Philip the Bold (1342-1404), Duke of Burgundy *Uhtred the Bold (died 1016), ealdorman of Northumbria *Vladimir the Bold (1353-1410), a prince of Serpukhov (in present-day Russia) Legendary characters: *Vadim the Bold, a chieftain of the Ilmen Slavs See also * Bold (disambiguation) Category:Epithets Category:Lists of people by nickname ","title":"List of people known as the Bold"},{"id":"31661293","text":"Callophrys lanoraieensis, the bog elfin, is a species of Lycaenidae that is native to North America.

Their terms derive from the Kabbalistic sephirot: Keter (above conscious Will) and Da'at (conscious Knowledge), considered two levels of the same unifying principle; the first encompassing, the second internalised within the person. In Kabbalah either Keter or Da'at are listed in the 10 sephirot, but not both. While the significance of this duality is limited in Kabbalah to its discussion of the Heavenly realms, the significance, and the terminology of \\"Higher\\" and \\"Lower Knowledge\\" emerges in the Hasidic internalisation of Kabbalah to describe alternative, paradoxical conscious perceptions of Divine Panentheism in this material World. Upper Knowledge refers to the Divine view \\"from Above\\", Lower Knowledge to the Created view \\"from Below\\". Description The terms Daas Elyon and Tachton are used particularly in the Habad philosophical systemisation of Hasidic thought. The alternative Kabbalistic terms Ayin and Yesh (\\"Non-Being and Being\\") are more commonly used in wider Hasidic mysticism. Habad differed from Mainstream Hasidism by its intellectual investigation of the Kabbalistic terminology and concepts that Hasidism had adapted to its psychologically focused mysticism. In this Daas Elyon and Tachton take on a related, but wider conceptual connotation than Ayin and Yesh, as they become the two alternative conscious perception paradigms of all Hasidic mysticism. Hasidism had extended the significance of Ayin and Yesh beyond its Heavenly abstract Kabbalistic meaning, to describe how this physical realm is alternatively Being or Non-Being, as perceived by Creation, in its nullification in the Panentheistic Divine All. Higher and Lower Knowledge broadens this further to any spiritual level of existence, or any concept under consideration. In historical Kabbalah, Keter (\\"Crown\\") is the transcendent Divine Will above conscious internalisation, while Da'at (\\"Knowledge\\") is the internalised aspect of the same principle, channeling the Creative Ohr lifeforce into existence. Consequently, Keter is the \\"Hidden Knowledge\\", that becomes revealed in Da'at. Moshe Cordovero lists Keter as the first sephirah and excludes Da'at, while Isaac Luria excludes Keter as being too transcendent to consider as the first cause of Creation, while substituting Da'at instead. Where Keter is the hidden soul root of the intellectual sephirot, Da'at is the hidden soul root of the emotions that emerge subsequently. Keter is revealed in Intellect, and Da'at is revealed in Emotions. Hasidic thought adapted Kabbalistic terminology to its own concern with direct psychological perception in deveikut cleaving to God. It related the sephirot to their corresponding parallels in the Kochos hanefesh (soul powers) devotional experience in Man. Similarly Da'at Elyon and Tachton emerge as the two alternative perspectives of Creation, the Divine consciousness \\"from Above\\", and the Created consciousness \\"from Below\\". While Hasidic thought universally retains the Kabbalistic meaning of Ayin (Non-Being) to refer to the inaccessible grasp of the Infinite Divine from the Creation's perspective, and Yesh (Being) to refer to Creation's perception of its own existence, this ascription only reflects the Lower Knowledge view. From the Divine view of Higher Knowledge, in truth only God exists, who is the Yesh Amity (\\"True Being\\"). Creation is nullified into acosmic non-existence (Ayin) within its Divine source, \\"as the light of the sun is nullified within the sun's orb\\". Nonetheless, as Hasidic mysticism describes man's devotion to God, it still uses the terms Ayin and Yesh in their Lower Knowledge, traditional Kabbalistic reference, and not reversed. Examples * Yichudah Ilaah (\\"Higher Unity\\") and Yichudah Tataah (\\"Lower Unity\\"), the two levels of perceiving God's Monotheism. This alternative paradox is explained in the second section of the Tanya, reflecting the author's most metaphorical interpretation of the Lurianic Tzimtzum, tending to Acosmic Monism. See Divine Unity in Hasidism. > ... It seems to the lower worlds as if the light and lifeforce of the > Omnipresent, blessed be He...were something apart from His blessed Self ... > Yet in regard to the Holy One, blessed be He, there is no tzimtzum, > concealment and occultation that would conceal and hide before Him ... for > the tzimtzumim and garments are not things distinct from His blessed Self, > heaven forefend, but (Genesis Rabba 21:5) \\"like the snail whose garment is > part of its very self\\"Tanya I:21 * In Habad Hasidic explanation of Free will, the paradox of human choice versus Divine foreknowledge relates to two alternative levels within the Divine knowledge of Creation. In the lower perspective, after the Tzimtzum (apparent concealment of God), God knows events \\"as an observer\\". In the higher perspective before the tzimtzum, God knows Creation from its source within Himself. * Higher and Lower Da'at relates to the Upper and Lower Chokhmah (Wisdom), the first of the three intellectual sephirot. The Zohar predicts, based on its interpretation of the upper and lower waters of Noah's flood (rains from above, wellsprings from below), that in the sixth century of the Hebrew sixth millennium (corresponding to the secular years 1740-1840) Wisdom will flood the World in preparation for the Messianic era. In the Likkutei Sichos talks of the Lubavitcher Rebbe,One such talk is reprinted as an Appendix in On the Essence of Chasidus, Kehot pub. he relates this prediction to the Higher Wisdom of Hasidic thought (called the Baal Shem Tov's \\"Wellsprings\\") and the Lower Wisdom of secular Science and thought. In Kabbalah the two levels of Water/Wisdom correspond to the Higher and Lower Waters in the account of Creation in Genesis I. * In Kabbalah's interpretation of the Tetragrammaton name of God, the first two letters are the \\"Concealed World\\" of Divine Intellect, corresponding to Atziluth and Beri'ah in the Four Worlds, and the last two letters are the \\"Revealed World\\" of Divine Emotions, corresponding to Yetzirah and Assiah. In the first section of Tanya,Tanya I:26 the Talmudic directive to bless God for misfortune as well as fortune is related to misfortune stemming from the higher hidden realms. In its source, the misfortune descends from a blessing too high to descend in revelation, as \\"no evil descends from above\\". * The Tetragrammaton and Elokim Divine Names in Kabbalah correspond to infinite transcendent encompassing light and finite immanent filling light. In Genesis chapter 1 Creation takes place through Elokim, while in Genesis 2 through both names. In Hasidic interpretation the essential Tetragrammaton Divine Infinitude enacts creation Something from Nothing, but shines through the concealment of Elokim to allow Creation to seem independent from God. In this Elokim becomes the means for revelation, as a Creation directly through the Tetragrammaton would be nullified. This corresponds to two levels of Bittul (Nullification): Bittul HaMetzius (\\"Nullification of Essence\\") and Bittul HaYesh (\\"Nullification of Ego\\"). As the highest of the Four Worlds Atziluth is still emanation, before perceived Creation, relatively it reflects Essential Nullification. In comparison to the lower two Worlds, also Beri'ah has some relation to Higher Bittul through the enclothement of Wisdom (Atziluth) descending into Understanding (Beriah). Prophecy is explained in KabbalahRabbi Chaim Vital Shaar HaNevuah, cited in Tanya II:2 to be the letters of Creation in Atziluth, as they descend into Beriah. This means Divine transcendent insight descending into some understanding. Similarly, Beriah is described in Kabbalah as the realm of the Divine \\"Throne\\", as the full emanated Divinity of Atziluth cloths itself through descent in Beriah, metaphorically as if descending onto a throne, to govern lower creation from above as a King. * In historical Kabbalah, all levels of existence reflect and correspond to higher Divine parallels in their root. In Kabbalah, the Male principle is defined as the giver/emanator, while the Female principle is the receiver/nurturer. Hasidic thought emphasises the ultimate advantage of the lower Female receiving level as the ultimate purpose of Creation. In the sephirot the Male corresponds to the 6 Emotions centred on Tiferet (Balanced Harmony), reflecting the revelation of Upper Knowledge, while the Female corresponds to Malkuth (Fulfilment in Action), the indwelling Shechinah (Divine Presence) in creation. In turn these principles reflect and are ultimately rooted in the Kav first emanation line into the Vacuum created by the Tzimtzum, and the unfolding sephirot in the scheme of circles. The Male corresponds to Yashar (Line) and the Female to Igul (Circle), reflected in the anatomy of Man and Woman. In general the Male relates to Higher Knowledge and Soul, and the Female to Lower Knowledge and Body. In the Messianic Era, the Female will emerge from its historical subordinate status, as the body will give life to the soul, through Atzmus (Divine essence) being revealed in the Physical. The contemporary emancipation of Women gives a foretaste of this. This is alluded to by the Midrash on Genesis 1 of the Moon's diminished light and future reinstatement with the Sun.

Together with its 'Pre-Prep ‚Äì Early Years' department, the school educates girls and boys aged between three and thirteen. In 2011, there were 266 children at the school, of whom 155 were boys and 111 were girls. The school has a Christian ethos, and its chapel services are reported to be \\"broadly Anglican in style\\". The most important religious event of the school year is the Advent Carol Service, which because of the numbers attending is held not at the school but in the larger chapel of nearby Bradfield College. Scholarships are awarded to some children above the age of eleven, based on merit. St Andrew's has a School Council to involve its children in decisions affecting them. In March 2011 an Independent Schools Inspectorate report endorsed the school's success. History The school was founded in 1934 as a boarding school for boys, and consisted of just two staff and eight boys.Donald P. Leinster-Mackay, The Rise of the English Prep School (1984), p. 340 Historically, as the school grew, boys would leave to go onto schools such as Eton, Harrow and Winchester, however its ties with these schools slowly deteriorated after it first admitted girls in 1971, going on to become fully co-educational.ISI Report, March 2011, online The school's main building is a listed Victorian Gothic country house called 'Buckhold', designed by Alfred Waterhouse set in fifty-four acres of woods and playing fields. Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge The school's most famous alumni is Catherine \\"Kate\\" Middleton. Following her family's return from Amman when she was four years old, Middleton was enrolled at St Andrew's, and she boarded part-weekly at the school in her later years. It was at this school in 1991 that Middleton first saw her future husband, Prince William, when he was part of a Ludgrove School hockey team that came to play a match at Middleton's school.Daily Telegraph Reporter, Kate Middleton 'first laid eyes on Prince William as a 10-year-old schoolgirl' dated 27 November 2010 at telegraph.co.uk The school today Now consisting of just under three-hundred pupils, the school is fully co-educational with a range of facilities including newly refurbished boarding houses, three science laboratories, music school, art studio and carpentry workshop, and a private chapel. The school also boasts extensive sporting facilities such as a 25-metre pool, all-weather astro playing field, sports hall, climbing wall, 9 hole golf course, 3 tennis courts (including one grass court) and multiple rugby/football/cricket/lacrosse pitches. Although boarding houses are strictly single sex, pupils are divided up into four co-ed houses called 'sections'.

The females are usually bigger than the males and have shorter wings, while in the males wings cover at least the whole abdomen. Some members of the genus occurred in North America until an estimated 49 million years ago, but the genus was absent from the continent until recent reintroductions of some cool-adapted species in eastern Canada and the eastern United States.

These include the ideas that bin Laden had been dead for years, or is still alive. Doubts about bin Laden's death were fueled by the U.S. military's supposed disposal of his body at sea, the decision to not release any photographic or DNA evidence of bin Laden's death to the public, the contradicting accounts of the incident (with the official story on the raid appearing to change or directly contradict previous assertions), and the 25-minute blackout during the raid on bin Laden's compound during which a live feed from cameras mounted on the helmets of the U.S. special forces was cut off. Within hours, an image purporting to show a dead bin Laden was broadcast on Pakistani television. Although the story was picked up by much of the British press, as well the Associated Press, it was swiftly removed from websites after it was exposed as a fake on Twitter. On May 4, the Obama administration announced it would not release any images of Bin Laden's dead body.Montopoli, Brian (2011-05-04). \\"Obama: I won't release bin Laden death photos.\\" CBS News. Retrieved 2011-05-04. The administration said it had considered releasing the photos to dispel rumors of a hoax, at the risks of perhaps prompting another attack by al Qaeda and of releasing very graphic images to people who might find them disturbing. Several photos of the aftermath of the raid were given to Reuters by an anonymous Pakistani security official, but though all appeared to be authentic, they were taken after the U.S. forces had left and none of them included evidence regarding bin Laden's fate. On May 6, it was reported that an al-Qaeda website acknowledged bin Laden's death. On May 11, Republican senator and Senate Armed Services Committee member Jim Inhofe stated he had viewed \\"gruesome\\" photographs of bin Laden's corpse, and later confirmed that the body \\"was him\\", adding, \\"He's history\\".Members of Congress see bin Laden photos, CNN.com, May 11, 2011 On May 21, 2015, journalist Seymour Hersh published a report claiming that Pakistan had kept bin Laden under house arrest since 2006, that the U.S. had learned of bin Laden's location through a Pakistani intelligence official and not through tracking a courier, and that elements of the Pakistani military aided the U.S. in killing bin Laden. The White House denied Hersh's report. Lack of physical evidence The primary source of skepticism about the U.S. government's story has been its own refusal to provide any physical evidence to substantiate its claim. Although the Abbottabad raid has been described in great detail by U.S. officials, no physical evidence constituting actual proof of his death has been offered to the public, neither to journalists nor to independent third parties who have requested this information through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). Numerous organizations filed FOIA requests seeking at least a partial release of photographs, videos, and/or DNA test results, including The Associated Press, Reuters, CBS News, Judicial Watch, Politico, Fox News, Citizens United, and NPR. At the time of filing their FOIA request, The Associated Press said: On April 26, 2012, a US federal judge decided in the case Judicial Watch v. U.S. Department of Defense, et al that the DoD did not need to release any evidence to the public. Burial at sea Doubts about bin Laden's death were fueled by the U.S. military's disposal of his body at sea, though U.S. officials maintained that the burial was necessary because arrangements could not be made with any country to bury bin Laden within 24 hours, as dictated by Muslim practice. The Muslim practice has not always been followed by the U.S. in the past. For example, the bodies of Uday Hussein and Qusay Hussein, sons of Saddam Hussein, were held for 11 days before being released for burial. In that instance, however, several Iraqi cities were reluctant to grant a gravesite for Saddam Hussein's sons. The decision to bury bin Laden at sea was questioned by terrorists and by some 9/11 survivors and the relatives of the victims. Professor Peter Romaniuk of John Jay College described the burial at sea as a way to forestall further questions. He stated: \\"Obviously they‚Äôre going to be under pressure to show a body or produce further evidence, but this was a way of taking that issue off the table.\\" A stated advantage of a burial at sea is that the site is not readily identified or accessed, thus preventing it from becoming a focus of attention or \\"terrorist shrine\\". Theories=In Pakistan Senior Pakistani officials disseminated the theory that no firefight ever took place, and that whomever the U.S. forces captured, they executed him outside the compound, and took his body away on a helicopter.Yusufzai, Mushtaq (2011-05-04). Bin Laden‚Äôs daughter confirms her father shot dead by US Special Forces in Pakistan. Al-Arabiya. Retrieved 2011-05-04. Hamid Gul, the former head of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), stated in an interview with CNN that he believed bin Laden had died many years ago, and that the official death story given out by the American media was a hoax. Furthermore, he thinks the American government knew about bin Laden's death for years, \\"They must have known that he had died some years ago so they were waiting. They were keeping this story on the ice and they were looking for an appropriate moment and it couldn't be a better moment because President Obama had to fight off his first salvo in his next year's election as he runs for the presidential and for the White House and I think it is a very appropriate time to come out, bring this out of the closet.\\" Yet another scenario was reported in an article in the Urdu newspaper Ausaf, which quoted military sources as saying, \\"Bin Laden has been killed somewhere else. But since the US intends to extend the Afghan war into Pakistan, and accuse Pakistan, and obtain a permit for its military's entry into the country, it has devised the [assassination] scenario.\\" Bashir Qureshi, who lives close to the compound where bin Laden was shot and whose windows were blown out in the raid, was dismissive. \\"Nobody believes it. We've never seen any Arabs around here, he was not here.\\" In Iran A number of Iranians said they believed that bin Laden was working with the U.S. during the entire war on terror. Ismail Kosari, an Iranian MP, said that bin Laden \\"was just a puppet controlled by the Zionist regime in order to present a violent image of Islam after the September 11 attacks\\", and that his death \\"reflects the passing of a temporary US pawn, and symbolizes the end of one era and the beginning of another in American policy in the region\\". Another MP, Javad Jahangirzadeh, said that it was the U.S. that had carried out the terrorist attacks, and bin Laden was the main source of help. He stated, \\"The West has been very pleased with bin Laden's operations in recent years. Now the West was forced to kill him in order to prevent a possible leak of information he had, information more precious than gold.\\" Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said \\"I have exact information that bin Laden was held by the American military for sometime... until the day they killed him he was a prisoner held by them,\\" in a live interview on Iranian state television. In Turkey Berkan Yashar, a Turkish politician, stated that bin Laden died of natural causes on June 26, 2006 and was buried. The Americans, he claims, dug out bin Laden's body and displayed it, falsely telling the world that he was killed in an assault.http://www.presstv.ir/detail/2012/05/19/242057/osama-bin-laden-died- of-natural-causes/ Seymour Hersh On May 21, 2015, Pulitzer prize winning journalist Seymour Hersh published a 10,000 word report (later a book -- The Killing of Osama bin Laden) challenging most aspects of the official account of Osama's death.The story was later released as a book. Among other things, the report claims that the Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) had kept bin Laden under house arrest at Abbottabad since 2006, and that when the US discovered this Pakistani Army chief Pervez Kayani and ISI director Ahmad Shuja Pasha helped the U.S. in killing, not capturing bin Laden. Hersh's U.S. and Pakistani intelligence sources stated that the U.S. had learned of bin Laden's location through a \\"walk-in\\", a former ISI officer who came to the US embassy in Islamabad in 2010 seeking the $25 million reward, and not through tracking a courier. This claim had been previously reported by R.J. Hillhouse and was confirmed afterwards by NBC news. The White House denied Hersh's report. Pakistani journalist Ahmed Rashid in the New York Review of Books finds the cooperation between the CIA and ISI that Hersh describes \\"inconceivable\\", in part because 2011 was \\"the worst year in US-Pakistan relations since the late 1980s\\" and \\"hatred and mistrust\\" between the CIA and ISI was \\"acute\\"‚Äîsomething Hersh does not mention in his article/book. Among the incidents that occurred in Pakistan in the months before the killing of bin Laden were the killing of two Pakistanis by Raymond Davis a CIA contractor; numerous death threats against the Islamabad CIA station chief after his name was leaked (purportedly by the ISI); the cessation of the issuing of visas for US officials, following which the entire US consulate in Lahore was shut down and moved to Islamabad over concerns about security; increased US anger over the refusal of Pakistan to exert pressure on the Taliban and Haqqani group; the death of 40 Pakistanis including many civilians and later 24 Pakistani soldiers from US drone strikes, the cut off of US supplies to Afghanistan by Pakistan. Further adding to the implausibility of Hersh's theory, according to Rashid, is the unlikeliness that either the US would have \\"calmly accepted\\" Pakistan's hiding/protecting bin Laden, or that the dozens of Pakistani military, police, fire and bureaucrats‚Äîwhose silence/complicity would have been required for a successful conspiracy‚Äîwould have cooperated with the American incursion. While there was little or no disapproval by the Pakistan public over Bin Laden's long residency in Pakistan, the US attack on the compound of bin Laden was so unpopular that just the failure of the military to detect and go after the US helicopters ignited outrage among the media, the public and the civilian government. Andrew Anthony in The Guardian called Hersh's theories \\"forceful but unconvincing\\". Zach Dorfman in the Los Angeles Times called Hersh's judgment \\"mixed, at best\\". (Rashid, Anthony, and Dorfman were also skeptical of another theory expounded in Hersh's book‚Äîthat the Ghouta chemical attack that killed hundreds of Syrian civilians where instigated not by the Syrian government, but by rebels aided by Turkey working as agents provocateurs, blaming the Syrian government in hopes of forcing the Obama administration to enter the war against the government.) Internet Facebook groups formed discussing a rumor, in what has been dubbed the \\"death hoax\\". Some blogs theorised that the raid and killing were faked, in a conspiracy to attempt to deflect questions about President Obama's citizenship, or to boost Obama's approval ratings and guarantee his popularity during the 2012 U.S. presidential election. Others In 2002, the FBI's top counter-terrorism official, Dale Watson, said, \\"I personally think he [Osama bin Laden] is probably not with us anymore.\\" Anti-war activist Cindy Sheehan stated \\"If you believe the newest death of OBL, you‚Äôre stupid\\".Geraghty, Jim (2011-05-02). Cindy Sheehan: ‚ÄòIf you believe the newest death of OBL, you‚Äôre stupid.‚Äô. National Review. Retrieved 2011-05-02. Sheehan further stated on her Facebook page, \\"The only proof of [bin Laden] being dead again that we were offered was Obama telling us that there was a DNA match between the man killed by the Navy SEALs and OBL. Even if it is possible to get DNA done so quickly, and the regime did have bin Laden DNA lying around a lab somewhere ‚Äì where is the empirical proof?\\" On Russia Today, radio host Alex Jones claimed that bin Laden had been dead for nearly ten years, and that his body had been kept in liquid nitrogen so that it can be used as a propaganda tool at a future politically expedient time. He claimed that in 2002 an anonymous White House source had told him that bin Laden \\"is frozen, literally frozen and that he would be rolled out in the future at some date\\". In a separate interview in 2002, Steve Pieczenik told Jones that bin Laden had been dead for months. Jones also pointed to similar comments made by former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in 2003, \\"Yes we have been told by intelligence that they‚Äôve got him, Bush may roll him out but because they exposed that at the election they didn‚Äôt do it\\". Jones further voiced doubts about the official story of bin Laden's death on his radio show telling his listeners, \\"My friends, this is a complete and total hoax.\\" The Iranian network Press TV interviewed Webster Tarpley and Stephen Lendman, who both doubted the official story of bin Laden's death. Tarpley said he believed bin Laden had been dead for a long time. He also claimed that the public was deceived by a staged announcement. Both Tarpley and Lendman suggested that Obama's announcement was also an excuse to involve the United States in wars with Pakistan and Middle Eastern nations. Andrew Napolitano, the host of the Fox Business program Freedom Watch, said bin Laden's death could not be verified and insinuated that Obama was using the death of bin Laden to save his \\"lousy presidency.\\"CNN: 'Deathers' take over where 'birthers' left off. May 5, 2011. An article in Mediaite criticized Napolitano's remarks, opining that \\"such conspiracy talk is ultimately beneath Napolitano and his often enlightened discussions.\\" Canadian deputy Leader of the Opposition and MP, Thomas Mulcair, stated in an interview with CBC Television that \\"I don't think from what I've heard that those pictures [of bin Laden's body] exist\\". His remarks were picked up by dozens of U.S. media outlets, and criticized by various Canadian politicians. An official statement from the Taliban stated that the lack of photos or video footage is suspicious, as their own sources close to bin Laden had not confirmed or denied his death, and that \\"when the Americans killed Mullah Dadullah (Taliban‚Äôs chief military commander) they publicly showed the footage\\".

It is a Swiss heritage site of national significance. History Large, square tower of the castle Vineyards surrounding the castle The Barons of Aigle were first mentioned in 1179. At that time they had a small fortification, that became the center of the modern castle, along the road over the Col du Pillon and Col des Mosses passes of the Rhone. However, only traces of this first castle have been archaeologically discovered.Burgenwelt.de website, from MEYER, Werner. Burgen der Schweiz, Band 4: Kantone Genf, Waadt, Wallis. Z√ºrich 1981. S. 22-24 accessed 3 May 2011 Some time before 1200, the Barons of Aigle ended up as vassals of the powerful Counts of Savoy. In 1232, Count Thomas of Savoy granted Aigle as a fief to the brothers Jacob and Peter of Saillon in exchange for their ancestral castle in Valais. The Saillon family seems to have been closely related with the barons of Aigle. In the second half of the 13th Century, Aigle expanded and received a city charter. The castle was rebuilt, with a fortified donjon and a curtain wall. In the 14th Century, the Lords of Compey inherited the rights of the Saillon family. They were also vassals of the Counts of Savoy and made Aigle into their headquarters. They added turrets and in 1450 built a massive tower in the south corner. This tower was an example of late French Donjon architecture. Starting in the mid-15th Century, Bern tried to control the city, to gain control of the important mountain passes into the Rhone Valley. Their first unsuccessful attempt was in 1464. The Burgundian Wars (1474‚Äì1477), which brought the Swiss Confederation into conflict with Duke Charles the Bold of Burgundy, brought another opportunity. Because Savoy had joined the Burgundian side, Swiss forces attacked the Savoy town of Aigle and devastated the castle. Jean de Compey had to flee and was killed soon afterward in Vevey. His son died fighting for Charles the Bold. After the war, the Compey family were unable to recover their title to the town or castle. Bern had the castle rebuilt again in 1488 and made it the seat of a provincial governor. Aigle became one of the first French speaking districts in Bern. The representatives of Bern resided here until the French invasion and creation of the Helvetic Republic in 1798. In 1804, the castle was acquired by the community of Aigle and until 1976 it was used as a cantonal jail. Since then, it has been a museum open to the public. Castle site Today the castle is home to Mus√©e de la Vigne et du Vin (Vine and wine museum).

Queen Elizabeth II's youngest child, Prince Edward, was created Earl of Wessex hours before the ceremony. Background and engagement Prince Edward, youngest child of Queen Elizabeth II, met Sophie Rhys-Jones at a tennis event in 1993. He announced his engagement to Sophie on 6 January 1999. Edward proposed to Sophie with a delicate engagement ring featuring a two-carat oval diamond flanked by two heart-shaped gemstones set in 18-karat white gold. This engagement ring was made by Asprey and Garrard (now Garrard & Co) and it is worth an estimated ¬£105,000. Wedding ceremony The wedding took place at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle. At the time of their engagement, Edward and Sophie made known their wish that the wedding not be turned into a state occasion, causing there to be no ceremonial state or military involvement. The ceremony was mainly a family occasion. Prime Minister Tony Blair and other politicians were not invited. Rather than court dress, the couple requested that guests attend wearing formal evening gowns, and not to wear hats to reflect its wish for a more informal royal wedding. Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother wore a hat regardless, as she was rarely seen in public without one. It was the town of Windsor's largest occasion since the 1952 funeral of King George VI. Edward's two brothers, the Prince of Wales and the Duke of York, both served as his supporters (the royal equivalent of the \\"best man\\"). Children of the couple's friends served as Sophie's attendants: Camilla Hadden, Olivia Taylor, Felix Sowerbutts, and Harry Warburton. The three royal brothers chose to leave their limousines behind and walk past the onlookers into the church, twenty minutes before the start of the ceremony. Sophie arrived with her father Christopher Rhys-Jones in a Rolls Royce owned by the Queen, and he walked her down the aisle while a fanfare by the Royal Marines was being played. Peter Nott, the Bishop of Norwich, performed the ceremony. Unlike previous royal weddings, like that of the Prince and Princess of Wales, Sophie chose to say the word \\"obey\\" in her vow \\"to love, cherish and obey\\", much as her second eldest sister-in-law the Duchess of York had. The couple said their respective vows properly, though some onlookers noted Edward had a little difficulty placing the wedding ring on Sophie's finger. In keeping with tradition, the wedding ring was crafted from Welsh gold from the Prince Edward mine in Gwynedd. The tradition of using Welsh gold within the wedding rings of the royal family dates back to 1923. Sophie wore a wedding dress designed by Samantha Shaw. It had a long, fitted coat with long sleeves, along with an ivory train that according to one source was \\"made from hand-dyed silk organza and hand-dyed silk crepe, with rows of pearls and crystal beading\\". Notably, the four girls and boys who carried her train were all commoners, the first time this has occurred in a royal wedding. Sophie wore a diamond tiara from the Queen's private collection, as well as a pearl necklace that was given to her by Edward for the wedding; Sophie in turn gave him an 18-karat gold pocket watch. Prince Edward's waistcoat was designed by John Kent. After the ceremony, Edward and Sophie rode in an open, horse-drawn carriage to the reception in St George's Hall at Windsor Castle, passing thousands of people en route. The Countess sent her wedding bouquet to Westminster Abbey to rest on the Grave of the Unknown Warrior. The tradition of Royal brides sending their bouquet to the Grave was started by Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon (later the Queen Mother) in 1923. After the marriage ceremony, the guests were gathered at the Waterloo Chamber and the Grand Reception Room, where they were served canap√©s. A buffet-style dinner was later served at the George's Hall. The couple's 10-foot-tall chocolate cake was made by Linda Fripp and adorned with daffodil and tennis rackets. The National Youth Orchestra of Scotland, the London Mozart Players and the band of the Royal Marines were in charge of providing the music for the reception ceremony. Geoffrey Shakerley photographed the wedding of Edward and Sophie. Shakerley later admitted that Prince William's face was digitally enhanced by taking a happier smile from another photograph and placing it on some of the released shots to the press. The couple spent their honeymoon at Balmoral Castle. Title upon marriage Royal monogram Hours before the ceremony, Prince Edward was created Earl of Wessex and Viscount Severn. Upon their marriage, the couple became known as Their Royal Highnesses The Earl and Countess of Wessex. Some constitutional scholars questioned why Edward had not been created a duke, as his brothers had before their weddings; it was made known at that time that Edward would be created Duke of Edinburgh after the deaths of both his parents. The publishing director of Burke's Peerage, Harold Brooks-Baker, noted that Edward was the first son of a monarch since George I to not be made a duke. Historian David Starkey criticised the choice of title Earl of Wessex, remarking \\"The title itself is a total fiction. There is nowhere called Wessex... the title has not been used for a thousand years - is it the right way to celebrate the third millennium by going back to the first?\\" Broadcast The wedding's broadcast garnered an estimated 200 million viewers from around the world. Reactions Many media outlets noted the more \\"relaxed tone\\" of the wedding compared to previous royal ceremonies, such as the wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer, which took place at the larger St Paul's Cathedral. One called it the \\"people's wedding\\", and 8,000 people were picked at random and invited into the castle grounds. The wedding ceremony was positively received by the public, and parties were held at different places in the streets to celebrate the occasion. The marriage also had a positive reflection in the media, who labelled it as a love match which could be successful unlike the marriages of Edward's elder siblings.

The battle was part of the Armenian war effort against a much larger and better trained army that habitually raided the Cilician Plain and threatened to annihilate the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia. Preceding events and discussion The Cilician Armenian Princes were the most important local Christian fighting force before the arrival of the Crusaders in Outremer in the late 1090s and they became the most natural regional allies of the Crusaders. Many Armenian mercenaries also became available in the early 12th Century. Together, allies or mercenaries, they served as cavalry and as highly regarded infantry archers in the Crusader armies, often organized in large units and sometimes under their own princes. At times, their numbers in the Latin Crusader States rose to 4,000 horsemen and 10,000 infantry. The feudalization of Cilician Armenia in the 12th and 13th century made it even easier for Armenian warriors to fit in the armies of the Crusader States. Thanks to his military and diplomatic prowess and with the support given by the Holy Roman Emperors (Frederick Barbarossa and his son, Henry VI), prince Levon Rupenian was able to elevate the status of his principality to a kingdom. The newly reformed Cilician Armenian monarchy sought to model itself on the Norman feudal system. The important role played by Cilician Armenia in the military history of the Crusaders has rarely been recognised though it was well understood by both the Crusaders and their Muslim foes. The Cilician Armenians were not reduced to feeble numbers, as the Franks were. They counted up to 100,000 troops, according to the contemporary sources, of which a third were horsemen and it is of note that the Armenian heavy cavalry was very similar to that of the Franks. In fact, their general equipment resembled more and more the one of the Latins. A network of fortresses had been raised in Cilician Armenia in order to protect the country and the defense of the borders was entrusted to knights of the military orders. The ruins of Bagras Castle in Cilicia, viewed from the S-E. Outremer in 1135, showing the territory of the Armenian Principality, and the cities of Sis and Tarsus When the Mongols appeared near the Mediterranean in the 13th century, King Hethum I accepted to become a Mongol vassal. The foundations of a military collaboration were laid and this brought the Armenians in direct conflict with the Mamluk Sultanate. Some modern historians, notably Angus Donal Stewart, who relies heavily on Muslim sources, has reservations that Armenian armies of the time could pose serious problems to the Mamluks, given the latters' reputation as an elite force of the 13th century Muslim world. He argues that the Mamluk column of 1276 was largely consisting of Turkmen invading from the direction of Marash and that Marius Canard found no Arab source which mentions this raid, concluding that it had merely local significance. Indeed, the only knowledge of it comes from Bar-Hebraeus the Syriac Orthodox catholicos and chronicle author. The Mamluks defeated the Armenians at the Battle of Mari in 1266, killing one of Hetoum I's sons (fallen, right) and capturing another (the future king Leo II, middle). They then ravaged the land of Cilician Armenia. The manuscript depicts the Mamluks in accurate Islamic garb and the Armenian nobles in European heavy cavalry armor. After the Mamluk victory over the Mongol Ilkhanate at Ain Jalut in 1260, where a force of reportedly 500 Armenian knights and their retinues also participated, the Mamluk armies started a series of devastating raids against the Kingdom of Cilician Armenia, an ally of the Ilkhanate and a prosperous Christian state bordering the Eastern Mediterranean. Notably, in 1266, in the absence of the Mongol allies and of King Hethum I who was traveling to Karakorum to summon help, the Armenians suffered a crushing defeat while taken by surprise by the Mamluk army at Mari, near Darbsak. In 1275, the Mamluk Sultan Baibars invaded Cilician Armenia, sacked its capital Sis (but not the citadel) and demolished the royal palace. His marauding troops massacred inhabitants of the mountain valleys and took large quantities of booty. The port city of Ayas was destroyed and burned by a Mamluk column and some 2000 Frankish and Armenian inhabitants drowned while attempting to take refuge on the ships in the harbor. The Cilician Plain was laid waste and its inhabitants put to the sword or carried as prisoners. According to eyewitnesses, only those who took refuge in fortified places escaped the carnage. The city of Tarsus was also ruined. In this context, Armenian nobility, mostly safe in its mountain strongholds, rallied around King Leo II (the son of Hethum I) and Constable Sempad. The battle In 1276 Sempad the Constable marched with several hundred knights and a force of Armenian infantrymen to meet a column of about 1000 Mamluk cavalrymen and a \\"great strength\\" of Turkmen auxiliaries approaching from the side of Marash. He ambushed them in the Northern Amanus mountains, in a pass near the fortress of Sarvandik'ar while King Leo II of Armenia undertook a detour to strike the enemy in the rear and block its retreat. The Christian ambush was reportedly so successful and the Mamluk losses so heavy that \\"the bodies of the dead impeded the flight of the survivors\\". While more detailed accounts of the battle are lacking due to the paucity of sources, the Cilician Armenians emerged as clear victors and followed the enemy in pursuit to the proximity of Marash, before stopping. The victory, however, cost the Armenians very dearly. They lost 300 knights and an unknown but important number of infantrymen. Their seasoned warrior, chronicler and Supreme Court judge, Sempad the Constable, died accidentally during the pursuit of the Muslim force, after being hurled against a tree by his own horse. The chronicle also mentions the Lord of Kharbizag Castle and thirteen other high born men, among the Armenian losses. Aftermath Enraged by the audacity of the Armenian attack, sultan Baibars was reportedly about to launch a new expedition when he died in 1277 from a wound inflicted, according to some chroniclers, by an Armenian archer. According to other sources he died by accidentally drinking poisoned kumis intended to kill someone else. The Mongol Khan commended King Leo for the valor of the Armenians knights during the clash and sent him a beautifully crafted sword, offering to make him ruler of all the lands conquered by the Mongol armies in Mesopotamia. Leo II however, declined the offer, pleading justly that the responsibility of defending just one kingdom in the given conditions was already too difficult. Fortress of Korycos, last stronghold of Armenian Cilicia, was handed over to the Lusignans of Cyprus The battle had shown that Cilician Armenia, though isolated from Europe and repeatedly raided, was not in complete defeat. The Kingdom of Cilician Armenia outlived, in fact, the Franks of Syria and Palestine and the Mongol Ilkhans. After the second clash of Sarvandik'ar, Cilician Armenia enjoyed a breathing spell of nearly 4 years. Hostilities between Mamluks and Mongols, and the latter's Armenian allies, soon broke out again, culminating in 1281 with the Second Battle of Homs that had renewed disastrous consequences for the Kingdom of Cilician Armenia. The struggle against the odds continued for nearly another century and the Armenians, ever fewer and continuously weakened by invasion, still succeeded in a few military encounters with the powerful Mamluk armies. Hethum II of Armenia and Leo IV of Armenia soundly defeated a Mamluk raiding force in the pass of Bagras in 1305. Nevertheless, Cilician Armenia was eventually left an isolated Christian island in a sea of Muslim states. Amidst failed Armenian pleas for help from Europe, the fall of Sis to the Mamluks in 1374 and the conquest of the fortress of Gaban in 1375, where the last king King Levon V had taken refuge, put an end to the kingdom.

The species is solely known from the early Eocene, Ypresian stage, Allenby Formation Lacustrine deposits near the town of Princeton, British Columbia. History and classification Neviusia dunthornei is known from only two fossils, the holotype, number \\"UWBM 54169\\", and the paratype number \\"UWBM 97148\\". Both specimens are preserved in the paleobotanical collections housed in the Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture, part of the University of Washington in Seattle, Washington, USA. The species was described from the two leaf specimens both found at the One Mile Creek locality, UWBM number 53355 in 1991 by Wesley Wehr and Peter Dunthorne. This locality is placed in the early Eocene Allenby Formation, designated the type locality. The Allenby Formation is part of the Eocene Okanogan Highlands floras which span from the Klondike Mountain Formation in Ferry County, Washington north west to Driftwood Canyon Provincial Park near Smithers, British Columbia. The specimens were studied by paleobotanists Melanie L. DeVore and Steven M. Moore of Georgia College and State University, Kathleen B. Pigg of Arizona State University and Wesley C. Wehr of the Burke Museum. Melanie DeVore and coauthors published the 2004 type description for N. dunthornei in the journal Rhodora. Melanie DeVore and coauthors chose the specific name dunthornei, in honor of Peter Dunthorne of Sedro-Woolley, Washington in recognition of the collecting work throughout the Okanagan highlands which he helped and participated with. The holotype of Neviusia dunthornei is a complete leaf though the leaf blade is folded near the base, while the paratype is more fragmentary. Together the two compression- impression fossil leaves, preserved in light green-grey shale display the leaf shape, margin, and morphology of the vein structure and teeth. The overall morphology and structure of the N. dunthornei leaves compare to the living species known as the Shasta snow-wreath (N. cliftonii), being broadly ovate, with secondary veins subopposite and a similar overall vein patterning. The leaf margins are serrate with two to three orders of teeth present. Unlike N. dunthornei the leaves of N. alabamensis are in general more elongate with finer teeth and secondary veins which are more alternate. N. dunthornei differs from both modern genera in the leaves having an overall thicker midrib. The presence of Neviusia in the Eocene Okanogan Highlands floras suggests the tribe Kerrieae originated in Asia and radiated to North America but did not become a major floristic component. This is supported by the absence of any Kerrieae tribe genera in the Mississippi embayment Eocene formations such as the Claiborne Formation.

Early life and education Lasker was born to Theodore and Mary Lasker in Brooklyn, New York, on December 1, 1929. He attended the Boys' High School in Brooklyn, graduating at the age of 16. Lasker began his academic career at the University of Miami in 1946. Initially, he majored in English, but transitioned to zoology with notions of medical school. However, he graduated in 1950, and applied for (and won) a scholarship for graduate studies in marine biology. He studied marine shipworms and earned his master's degree at the University of Miami in 1952. For his doctoral degree at Stanford Lasker studied silverfish gastrology, earning the degree in 1956. Lasker was married to Caroline Hayman with whom he had a daughter, Pamela, and son, Paul. Professional career In 1956, Lasker was awarded a post-doctoral appointment from the Rockefeller Foundation to culture euphausiid shrimps at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, California. After teaching briefly at Compton Community College and being granted a Lalor Faculty Fellowship at Scripps, Lasker was recruited to the U.S. Department of the Interior Bureau of Commercial Fisheries' new research laboratory on the Scripps campus; he began federal service as a fishery research biologist in June 1958. Lasker was charged with establishing what would become the Physiology Laboratory. Lasker and his teams went on to study various marine invertebrates, which eventually led him to his most widely recognized work with larval fish ecology. Most of his research centered around clupeid larval survival, feeding, and relevant environmental and planktonic variables within the California Current System (CCS). In 1970, Lasker revitalized the academic journal Fishery Bulletin as its scientific editor. Under his leadership, the journal became a quarterly publication and its content tripled. Lasker had been an Associate Professor of Marine Biology in Residence at Scripps since 1966 when he was appointed adjunct professor in 1973. Awards Lasker was awarded the Meritorious Service Award (Silver Medal Award) by the U.S. Department of the Interior in 1970, the Distinguished Service Award (Gold Medal Award) by the U.S. Department of Commerce in 1974, and the A.G. Huntsman Award for Excellence in the Marine Sciences by the Bedford Institute of Oceanography in 1983. In 1988, the American Institute of Fishery Research Biologists posthumously awarded Lasker its Outstanding Achievement Award. Death and legacy Lasker died of lung cancer on March 12, 1988, at the age of 58. His ashes were scattered from the research vessel NOAA'S David Starr Jordan on April 27, 1988, in the ocean off Point Loma.

Engraving by A.Lalauze. Juliette Dodu (Saint-Denis de la R√©union, June 15, 1848 - October 28, 1909) was a legendary heroine of the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, and the first woman to be awarded the Legion of Honor. However, many doubts have been raised about her actions during the war, and her story remains controversial.  Early life  Juliette Dodu was born in R√©union, the daughter of Alphonse Dodu, a navy surgeon originally from Indre, and Desa√Øffre de Pellegrin, a cr√©ole. Her father died of yellow fever when she was two. In 1864, at the age of sixteen, she left the island with her mother, who found work in France as director of the telegraph office of Pithiviers (Loiret).  The Franco-Prussian War and the Famous Wiretap Story  It was in the course of the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 that she became famous. The Prussians occupied Pithiviers on September 20, 1870. The telegraph office was seized and the Dodu family was relegated to the second floor of the house. The young woman of twenty-two then had the idea to rig up a tap on the wire that passed by her room. Having kept a receiving apparatus, she was thus able to intercept the transmissions each time that the occupiers received or sent dispatches. For 17 days, the young woman was able to deliver the dispatches to the French authorities without the slightest suspicion on the part of the Prussians, who were seduced by the charm of the young Frenchwoman. It was claimed that she saved the lives of 40,000 soldiers of General Aurelle de Paladines by means of one of her intercepted messages. However, the wiretap was discovered when a German soldier overheard a housekeeper accuse Juliette Dodu of tapping the telegraph wires. The Prussians prosecuted Juliette Dodu and tried her for espionage before a court-martial. She is reputed to have told her judges, Je suis Fran√ßaise et ma m√®re aussi, j‚Äôai agi pour mon pays. Messieurs, faites de moi ce que vous voudrez (\\"I am French and so is my mother. I have acted for my country. Messieurs, do with me as you wish!\\"). She was condemned to death. But the armistice was signed before her execution and Juliette Dodu was pardoned by prince Frederick Charles of Prussia and set free.¬´ Juliette Dodu : 15 juin 1848 - 28 octobre 1909 ¬ª, Journal de l'√Æle de La R√©union, January 1, 2005. However, decree number 1942 of December 8, 1870 only accorded her an honorable mention, as well as the 20 other employees and agents of the telegraphic service, because the postal employees were utilized to aid the army in the use of the telegraph.  Creating the Legend in the Press  In 1873, Juliette Dodu was responsible for the telegraph office of Enghien-les-Bains, where she made the acquaintance of Hippolyte de Villemessant, the patron of Le Figaro. On May 26, 1877, the first known version of the \\"legend of Dodu\\" appeared in that journal. Now cast as a symbol of the French resistance, Juliette Dodu was the first woman to receive the Military Medal and the Cross of the Legion of Honor. Patrice de Mac-Mahon, Marshal of France and president of the Third Republic, signed the decree of July 30, 1878, where it is stipulated \\" for intercepting dispatches at the peril of her life in 1870, for being condemned to death by the enemy and saved by the cessation of hostilities.\\"  Later life  Around 1875, she began a relationship with the baron F√©lix Hippolyte Larrey, medical chief of the army and son of the celebrated Larrey, and inherited his fortune (including his small ch√¢teau at Bi√®vres, Essonne). In 1880, she became inspector of schools and asylums and took up residence in Switzerland. Under the pseudonym of Lipp, she published a work in 1891 dedicated to George Sand, l'Eternel Roman. She died in 1909 at the Clarens, Switzerland home of her brother-in-law, the painter Odilon Redon.  The Controversy Surrounding the Legend  The Courrier du Loiret (Pithiviers newspaper) devoted a series of articles to Juliette Dodu in 1984 (one may find a copy at the Bi√®vres library). According to its author, \\"√âlisabeth de Mac- Mahon, wife of Patrice de Mac-Mahon, Marshal of France and president of the Third Republic, was an earnest feminist. It is not unthinkable that the text of the nomination of Juliette Dodu for the order of the Legion of Honor had been through her intervention.\\".¬´ Juliette Dodu, h√©ro√Øne ou catin ? ¬ª, a series of articles by Georges Durand, published in May and June 1984 in the Courrier du Loiret. This thesis was taken up again by the French author Guy Breton in his publication Les Beaux mensonges de l'histoire (The Beautiful Falsehoods of History). Breton alleges that the entire story of Juliette Dodu was not in fact anything but a fable gotten up by the journalist of the Figaro who signed himself Jean de Paris in an article of May 26, 1877, acting on behalf of M. de Villemessant, his director. In fact, it was not until seven years after the fact that one first heard of Mlle. Dodu. Guy Breton cites as reference general Aurelle de Paladines, commander in chief of the army of the Loire, who nowhere mentions that heroic salvation of his army. Lieutenant- colonel Rousset, author of a Histoire de la guerre Franco Allemande 1870‚Äì1871 (History of the Franco-Prussian War of 1870‚Äì1871), never makes any reference to it, while he swarms with lively details up to and including the depth of the snow and the state of the sky. Neither the report of M. Steenackens, director of the posts and telegrams of the period, who described all the acts of resistance of his employees during that war. Tombe de Juliette Dodu Guy Breton also lays out the inconsistencies of this eventful narrative; among others, that the Prussians had already quit Pithiviers three weeks before the related deeds, and the impossibility of collecting by sound a cipher message in German and passing the retransmission in Morse afterwards without error. This supposes a great familiarity, not only with the language, but also with the Prussian military codes. Furthermore, no one in Pithiviers possessed the Prussian codes. There is also no trace of the condemnation to death of Juliette Dodu, nor of her pardon. Which, according to Breton, leads one to the question of a possible hoax by M. de Villemessant, who obtained the Legion of Honor for a false heroine in a period when, just after the Paris Commune of 1871, France had just lost Alsace-Lorraine and defamed itself at the time of the Commune of Paris, had so much need for positive heroes.

Background The name Rimailho comes from the designer of the gun Captain Emile Rimailho a French artillery officer who was also involved in the design and testing of the famous Canon de 75 mod√®le 1897. The gun was designed in 1904 and the TR in the name means 'Tir Rapide' or Rapid Fire in English. Captain Rimailho's goal was to produce a medium artillery piece capable of a rate of fire equal to the mod√®le (Mle) 1897, which was no small feat for a gun of that size. In service a well-trained gun crew could achieve a rate of 15 rounds per minute, however the 1904TR was mechanically complex and its high rate of fire placed a great deal of stress on the gun. Theory of operation * After each round is fired the gun's breech is opened automatically . * While the gun runs back into battery the breech is held open. * The crew places a cartridge and shell onto the loading tray beneath the breach. * The motion of the gun returning to battery slides the loading tray up into place and the firing lever is cocked. * The firing lever is pulled and the cartridge and shell are rammed into the breech. * The breech then closes and the gun fires. History 155 Rimailho near Reims, being moved to the front during World War One. A firing demonstration was held at the French War College at Langres on September 4, 1906 with the French Minister of War, Eug√®ne Etienne in attendance. The 1904TR tested against existing 155 mm and 270 mm artillery pieces and judged to be superior when firing against hardened concrete fortifications. In 1907 the 1904TR was put into production and eventually five artillery regiments were equipped with the 1904TR. Each 1904TR battery consisted of two guns accompanied by three ammunition wagons for each gun. In August 1914, the French army had in service 104 pieces of 155 CTR, in 26 batteries.Guy Fran√ßois, \\"Le canon de 155 C mod√®le 1904 TR Rimailho\\", Histoire de Guerre, Bild√©s & Materi√©l, no. 93, July 2010, pp. 76-84, Paris: Histoire & Collection (in French) toc At the outbreak of war the 1904TR was one of the few large calibre modern artillery pieces available to the French Army. The French had neglected large calibre guns in favor of smaller and lighter artillery such as the Mle 1897. The Mle 1897 fit the French Army's doctrine of offence and manoeuver. This doctrine placed a great deal of emphasis on conducting battles in the open with room for cavalry and infantry to manoeuver and supported largely with direct-fire weapons. When the Western Front stagnated and both sides became entrenched in 1915 the French Army was at a disadvantage due to their lack of long range, large calibre artillery capable of high-angle fire. Although the 1904TR had a higher rate of fire than its German competitors such as the 15 cm sFH 02 and 15 cm sFH 13, the German guns outranged it and by 1916 the 1904TR no longer had sufficient range. The 1904 TR's carriage was also dated at the time of its introduction being patterned on older siege howitzers. The 1904TR was supplemented from 1915-1918 by the Canon de 155 C mod√®le 1915 St. Chamond and the 1904TR was replaced after 1917 by the Canon de 155 C mod√®le 1917 Schneider. Due to their short range, most of the 155 CTR were used with powerful charges. This resulted in rapid wear of their barrels. None was in service at the end of the war. Only one surviving example is known of today at the Royal Museum of the Armed Forces and Military History in Brussels.http://www.passioncompassion1418.com/Canons/ImagesCanons/France/Lourde/FC155Cm1904MRABruxelles.html See also=Weapons of comparable role, performance and era * 15 cm schwere Feldhaubitze M 94 : Austro-Hungarian equivalent * BL 6-inch 30 cwt howitzer : British equivalent * 15 cm sFH 02 : German equivalent * 6 inch field howitzer M-1908 : approximate US equivalent References * Hogg, Ian Twentieth-Century Artillery.

History The Virginia writers Nancy Hale and Elizabeth Coles Langhorne founded VCCA in 1971. Hale, the first female reporter for The New York Times and a frequent New Yorker contributor, testified before the Virginia Commission for the Arts and the Humanities that \\"if Virginia really wanted to further the arts, it could do so easily, moreover cheaply, by purchasing an abandoned motel and staffing it for writers to write in‚Äîfeeding them and seeing that they were uninterrupted.\\" The remark resonated with Langhorne, but her 1968 residency at the MacDowell Colony in New Hampshire suggested a considerably more elegant approach. She and Hale collaborated with Maria Miller and Edith Newcomb who donated the use of her Wavertree Farm, near Charlottesville, Virginia. Included on the original board were William Massey Smith, Alex von Thelen, Peter Taylor, and MacDowell Colony's longtime Director, George Kendall. The first sixteen Fellows arrived in June 1971, and the first international Fellows arrived from the UK and Korea the following year. Repeated dislocations marked the early years of the VCCA. In 1973 Edith Newcomb's daughters reclaimed Wavertree Farm, but in 1974 Rosamund Frost Lowell donated the use of historic Prospect Hill estate east of Charlottesville. That year VCCA received its first challenge grant from the National Endowment for the Arts. Expansion restrictions imposed by the National Register of Historic Places would convince the VCCA Board to close Prospect Hill. Then, the VCCA executive directorship was awarded to Willam \\"Bill\\" E. Smart (1933‚Äì2019), a VCCA Fellow and a professor at Sweet Briar College near Amherst, who would direct VCCA for several decades. Langhorne urged Smart to arrange two VCCA residency sessions with Sweet Briar College in 1976, which led to a 25-year lease of Sweet Briar's nearby 450-acre Mount San Angelo estate in 1976, an agreement made by Sweet Briar President Harold Whiteman and VCCA Board President Jane Camp. VCCA become the only artists' community in America directly affiliated with an institution of higher learning. In time, the lease was expanded to automatic 15-year options. VCCA Fellows periodically teach at Sweet Briar and benefit from its academic, cultural and athletic facilities. Elizabeth Taylor Warner and William Styron were the honorary chairs for VCCA's tenth birthday at New York City's Harold Reed Gallery in 1981.\\"The Evening Hours\\" by Judy Klemesrud, The New York Times, May 8, 1981 https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/08/style/the-evening-hours.html That year also witnessed the opening of the new Mt. San Angelo residence, designed specifically as a year-round residence for up to 24 Fellows. In 1982 VCCA assumed responsibility for the annual Virginia Prize for Poetry and Fiction, then one of the largest such American awards, alternating yearly between poetry and fiction, with an $8000 first prize and a $5000 second prize. The first VCCA art auction was hosted by Senator John Warner and William Styron in 1983 at the Gallery of the Arts Club in Washington, DC under the patronage of Virginia Governor Charles Robb and his wife Lynda Johnson Robb. In 1984 VCCA and Associated University Presses released what was termed the first work published by an artists' community: From Mt. San Angelo: Stories, Poems and Essays. In 1989 VCCA Fellow John Casey's novel Spartina took the National Book Award. In 1993 VCCA became a founding member of Res Artis, the Netherlands- based International Association of Residential Arts Centres. VCCA exchanges had come to include the Oberpf√§lzer K√ºnstlerhaus, Salzburg's K√ºnstlerhaus, Jerusalem's Mishkeot Shana'anim, London's Delfina Studios and Moscow's Kolodzei Art Foundation. In 1990 VCCA had been one of the 18 founding members of the Alliance of Artists Communities spawned by the MacArthur Foundation's 1990 \\"Special Initiative on Artists' Colonies, Communities, and Residencies.\\" In 1996 it hosted a conference on \\"Sustaining America's Artists\\", leading to the \\"Hedge-Apple Initiative\\" seeking just compensation of creative workers. After Charlene (Suny) Monk was appointed as Executive Director in 1997, VCCA garnered further awards including the 2000 Governor's Award in the Arts and National Book Awards for Fellows Alice McDermott (Charming Billy) and Ha Jin (Waiting). \\"Constructed residencies\\" have specifically fostered cross- fertilization of genres. VCCA has partnered with the Woodhull Institute for Ethical Leadership to provide writers with workshops on increasing their readership. As of 2010 there had been more than 4,500 VCCA Fellows, and exchanges with 350 artist from 62 countries; VCCA's international exchange program is the oldest and largest of its kind in America. Mount San Angelo Mount San Angelo is an estate in Central Virginia that includes a villa and gardens with more than 70 varieties of trees and shrubs, including Chinese chestnut, weeping hemlock, magnolia, mahonia, dogwood, copper beech, pink horse chestnut, spruce, crape myrtle, columbine and chrysanthemum. During the American Civil War, the estate owner, Elizabeth \\"Lily\\" Mosby had traveled to Europe where she admired Italian architecture.Dew, Natalie Manson, \\"Mount Saint Angelo - A Chronicle\\", Sweet Briar Alumnae News, October 1932 She brought architect Thomas Eastlock from England to create the original 1870 Italianate villa. Upon her death, she willed the estate, then called Mount Saint Angelo, to the legally nonexistent Catholic Sisters of Lynchburg, and so the property reverted to her brother. At his death, the estate transferred to Elizabeth Mosby's sister, Indiana Fletcher Williams, founder of Sweet Briar College. In 1909 the house was remodeled into a Georgian Revival mansion.Green, Bryan Clark et al, Lost Virginia: Architecture of the Old Dominion. Howell Press, Charlottesville 2001, p. 8. After 1920, a lake and a sunken boxwood garden‚Äîwith a waterlily pool edged with peonies, iris and roses‚Äîwere installed. Installation of a Normandy-style barn complex, overseer's cottage and tennis courts, as well as fruit and vegetable gardens, and the name change to Mount San Angelo occurred after 1932. Sweet Briar college purchased the property in 1968.\\"Sweet Briar Again Owns Amherst Historic Estate\\", The Lynchburg News, 31 December 1968 Fifty-six VCCA Fellows were in residence when a fire destroyed the mansion on July 17, 1979. During the two years it took for the residence to be replaced, Fellows lived and worked in the barn complex, and with emergency help from the National Endowment for the Arts, VCCA established the Phoenix Fund. Pasternak Bench at VCCA, a gift to VCCA from the Russian writers colony Peredelkino. The Pasternak Bench Situated on the grounds of VCCA is the 1,000-pound cast- iron \\"Pasternak Bench\\", which was transported from the Russian artist colony Peredelkino to Mount San Angelo in 1991. A gift of the Literary Fund of the Russian Federation of the Soviet Writers Union, the bench originally stood near the home of Nobel Prize-winning novelist, Boris Pasternak, who often visited it. The famed bench was known to have been visited by other residents of the Pereldelkino art colony, including the renowned authors Isaac Babel, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, Andrei Voznesensky, and Yevgeny Yevtushenko. VCCA- France: Le Moulin √† Nef VCCA is one of only three artists' communities with a studio center overseas. The seed of VCCA-France was planted by Alain and Lucy Delsol in 1994Bergman, Eric, \\"A Brief History of the CECA and the Moulin √† Nef \\", La Gazette du Moulin √† Nef 1/i 2001 when they invited a group of Denver, Colorado artists to spend two weeks working in the picturesque village of Auvillar, on the Garonne between Toulouse and Bordeaux. Some artists stayed with families; others had both their lodgings and their studio at the village's Maison Vielhezcases, named for the theatre director who once owned it. The visit was such a success that it became the yearly \\"Auvill'art\\" tradition, attracting attention and funding from the Donnell-Kay Foundation. In 1999 the Foundation bought land, including three decrepit buildings and an overgrown vineyard, in Auvillar's old port neighborhood. The property was dubbed the \\"Moulin √† Nef\\" or \\"floating mill\\". Such mills, which Procopius wrote, were first used by the Romans to maintain flour production during a land siege, had swarmed European rivers such as the Garonne for many centuries; 'Altivilaris', as Auvillar was known in the earliest 11th-century references, was a hub for commercial waterway shipping, and this helped the village to gain renown during the 18th and 19th centuries for its faience, tin-glazed earthenware that simulated Chinese porcelain. The largest of the Foundation's three buildings, destined to contain a ceramics atelier and several other studios, was called \\"La Ceba\\" after \\"La ceba d'Aoubila\\", the trademark floral motif of the old Auvillar faience-makers. A second building, containing offices and library, was called \\"La Cloucado do Molin\\" after \\"La Cloucado Marcabrun\\", the Occitan literary clique founded by Fr√©d√©ric Mistral and friends: seven f√©libres, latter-day troubadours, who inaugurated Auvillar's yearly festival of Saint No√© as part of their homage to their native Gascony. In 2000, having received permits to restore the Ceba and the Cloucado, the Foundation launched the Cultural Exchange Center of Auvillar (CECA), an American nonprofit chartered to finish construction, establish pilot programs, interact with American contacts, and find an appropriate institution to own and run the Moulin √† Nef. In 2001 came the Association Auvill'art (AAA), a French nonprofit to interact with French contacts. The Auvillar building crews proceeded so rapidly that by June 2001 the architect, Didier M√©dale, could conduct the final inspection of both the Ceba and the Cloucado. Cy Twombly ceiling in the Louvre During the next three years the Moulin √† Nef's exchanges came to include not only painting, drawing, sculpture, ceramics, literature, drama and musical composition but also filmmaking, a film festival, folk and ballet dancing, calligraphy, handicrafts, digital photography and gastronomy. There were adult and youth exchange programs with a number of educational institutions. Early in 2003 the Foundation sent out a circular to interested organizations it deemed candidates to inherit the Moulin √† Nef. The following April, the choice of VCCA was announced, and VCCA Fellows first appeared in Auvillar in June 2004, guided by VCCA Director of Artist Services Sheila Gulley Pleasants and her husband, Program Director Craig Pleasants. Ownership of the Moulin √† Nef was formally transferred to VCCA on December 29, 2004; the formation of the French nonprofit VCCA-France in 2007 made it an autonomous satellite of VCCA. Its current Resident Director is Cheryl Fortier. By the summer of 2010, 86 Fellows had completed their residencies, and collaboration with academic institutions such as Yale's Institute of Studio Studies was intensifying. VCCA's French connection became even firmer when VCCA Advisory Council Member Cy Twombly became the first American invited to do a permanent installation at the Louvre, painting the ceiling of the Salle des Bronzes with the assistance of VCCA Fellow Barbara Crawford.http://www.louvre.fr/llv/musee/presentation_alaune.jsp?CONTENT%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198674171979&CURRENT;_LLV_FICHE%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198674171979&FOLDER;%3C%3Efolder_id=9852723696500879&bmLocale;=en Current VCCA Programs Fully endowed VCCA residencies now include the Komaki Fellowship, the Ann Elder Bestor Memorial Fellowship, the Jane Geuting Camp Fellowship, the Columbus School for Girls Endowment, the Alonzo Davis Fellowship, the Goldfarb Family Fellowship, the Phillip and Eric Heiner Endowed Residency, the Patricia and Jerre Mangione Fellowship Fund, the Endowed Memorials Fund, the Elizabeth Ireland Graves Foundation, and the Karen Shea Silverman Endowed Fellowship. Since 2003 VCCA has awarded the Wachtmeister Award. Further fellowship sponsors include the Morris and Gwendolyn Cafritz Foundation, the Geraldine R. Dodge Foundation, the Harry D. Forsyth Fellowship for Visual Arts, the Heinz Endowments, the Mid Atlantic Arts Foundation, the Montana Fellowship, the Richard S. Reynolds Foundation, Sweet Briar College, Virginia Commonwealth University, the UNESCO Aschberg Bursaries, the NEA for the Cave Canem Residency, and the Bama Works Fund of the Dave Matthews Band. VCCA's commitment to democratic meritocracy extends to patronage as well as creativity: the Legacy Society and \\"Fund a Fellow\\" have allowed many people from all walks of life to become art patrons in the classical sense.

The comic's tagline is \\"Daily Lessons in Science, Literature, Love and Life\\".Surviving The World It is authored by professor Lucas LandherrDr. Lucas Landherr under the pseudonym Dante J.T. Shepherd, and when it started he claimed to be a graduate student at the fictional Fred Paulson Institute.Surviving The World: Faculty The site takes a novel approach to the webcomic genre in that it features a photograph (or a series of them) with text, graphs and sometimes comics drawn on a chalkboard and expressively framed by the author. This novelty is discussed in the comic itself as an intentional decision. The webcomic is approached as a continuing college class, including recitations, homework, and supplemental material, even going so far as to label the individual comics as \\"Lessons\\" and the authors as \\"Faculty\\". The strip consists of 3548 lessons including 100 separately-numbered recitations (and 17 recitations included in the official numbering of lessons). In addition, 43 \\"guest lectures\\", 28 \\"student presentations\\", and other daily content amounted to 3634 total comics and posts over 10 years and a day, with only 20 days break in that time. The minimal content of a traditionally artistic nature has led to discussion about whether Surviving the World properly counts as a webcomic.  History  The comic grew out of another project of Shepherd's, a script for a television show about college life. It was to be about a professor teaching at a YMCA, with the show focusing on the professor's \\"distinct lessons about how to survive and prepare for life and college\\", as well as the lives and interactions of students whom the professor was using as examples. Entitled 101, the script garnered little interest, prompting Shepherd to contemplate rewriting it as a one-act play. He then asked \\"around on the Internet to see if anyone would be willing to draw it as an off-beat comic book\\". He received no satisfactory responses and decided to create a webcomic himself. He eventually did so, basing the first hundred comics on the script of 101. The form of the comic is a result of Shepherd having little artistic ability, as well as his desire to do something with a \\"unique style\\". The title 101 was already being used on the site that the comic was originally published on, forcing the name change to Surviving the World.Fandomania Interview  The Shepherd Principle  The Shepherd Principle is a fictitious principle created by Shepherd. The principle states that \\"If you do anything long enough, it becomes creepy\\". This ties in with one of the comic's unspoken central themes of \\"how to creep people out\\".

C. maculosus mainly inhabits the edges of salt lakes in South Australia, from which its common names are derived. It survives in this harsh habitat through adaptive mechanisms to tolerate high temperatures and lack of free water. The female C. maculosus possesses unique male rejection techniques which are currently the focus of further research. Description C. maculosus can be identified by a white to pale grey dorsal surface with black blotches and a white ventral surface with a dark longitudinal dark streak. Black and brown spots are observed throughout its body. This cryptic coloration allows the species to blend into the salt surface it inhabits, and color variations are found depending on the specific population's environment. The adult male is about long (including tail), and the adult female is slightly shorter at . C. maculosus possesses small, sunken eyes protected by serrated eyelids and eye linings. Its nostrils are connected to its nasal cavity by only a narrow downward slit. This nasal structure is adaptive for preventing nasal blockage from burrowing in sand. Other sand-burrowing American lizards have also developed similar nasal structures via convergent evolution, including species in the genera Uracentron, Holbrookia, and Phrynosoma. Distribution and habitat C. maculosus is endemic to the three largest dry salt lakes of inner South Australia (Lake Eyre, Lake Callabonna, and Lake Torrens), with the densest population found in Lake Eyre. Three habitat characteristics characterize its distribution: a surface crust, a thick layer of dry sand or clay under the crust, and a constant source of humidity. This dragon lizard inhabits the edges of the lakes where it burrows in the damp sediments under the salt crust. Diet The main food source for C. maculosus is the harvest ant Melophorus. The nest-mounds of these ants provide an additional benefit to the dragon lizard as lookout points, basking sites, and sources of shade. C. maculosus is an opportunistic feeder, also feeding on other insects trapped on the salt surface. Behavior=Adaptations C. maculosus has developed behavioral mechanisms of avoiding environmental stresses in a similar fashion to desert-adapted animals. It uses various postures and movements to maintain an optimal body temperature. Its physiology has also adapted to the lack of free water by having a low evaporation rate, thus reducing water loss from the body. Flooding response When C. maculosus is forced to the beach surface by flooding, it changes color to a deeper grey with more numerous black and brown spots to match the pebbly beach sands. It also appears to show greater muscle coordination and the body inflates, which helps the dragon lizard float on the surface of the water. Sexual behavior The male C. maculosus is highly aggressive and attempts to force copulation with females by repeated harassment. Male harassment behavior can include chasing, biting, and pinning the female to the ground. On occasion, the male may injure or kill the female with which he is attempting to copulate by his mating grasp. The female employs three main rejection strategies to protect herself: fleeing from the male, performing a threat display, or flipping over on her back to prevent copulation. This last behavior is unique to C. maculosus and one species of insect. The female develops a bright orange color on her throat when she is reproductively receptive. In threat display and flipping-over rejection, the female reveals her throat to communicate rejection to the male. Oviposition results in significant declines in steroid levels, a fading of color from the throat, and an increase in rejection behavior. ReferencesFurther reading *Mitchell FJ.

The story is a sequel of the tale of Little Red Riding Hood. The film is a deconstruction of the classic fairy tale. The manner in which the characters of the wolves is portrayed is different from the original story, as the wolves are viewed as human beings throughout the film. They are akin to a family of forest hermits or a clan of bandits.  Plot  The story takes place one year after the well known story of Little Red Riding Hood. The wolf, who had been killed by the woodcutter, is revealed to have left behind family and friends who now wish to get revenge on Little Red. The deceased wolf's mother pays his friend, Lean Wolf to take her other son, Fat wolf and together catch Little Red Riding Hood. The wolves find a way to make Little Red Riding Hood believe that her grandmother has fallen ill again. Unaware that her grandmother is not truly ill, Little Red Riding Hood sets out through the forest to go visit her, meeting the wolves and other people on her journey. The little girl manages to foil all of the plans thought of by the wolves to catch her. They try dressing in clothes that will deceive Little Red Riding Hood into believing that they are kind and friendly, but in the end, she sucks them into her own game and they continually fail to catch her. Wolf cub, the deceased wolf's son, who spends his time reading stories, is clearly opposed to taking revenge on anyone for the things that have happened, and prefers to have nothing to do with his vengeful wolf family. His grandmother, angry with his lack of support, burns his storybook, which sends the cub into tears, and he runs away from his grandmother. On her travels, Little Red Riding Hood meets with ever more obstacles, such as a young spoiled boy who wishes to take Little Red Riding Hood as his possession so he can play with her whenever he wishes. He locks her in a room, but she is saved by Lean Wolf and Fat Wolf, who are now dressed as stately women, but are waiting with a sack to snatch her up. Wolf Cub takes the sack and foils their plans. The cub tries to hint at Little Red Riding Hood that her grandmother is not truly ill, but she does not heed his advice and continues on her way, and again the two wolves attempt to catch her. However, Fat Wolf, has grown attached to Little Red Riding Hood and is no longer so keen on capturing her as he had been initially. Little Red later learns from a shepherd who had previously conspired with the wolves, that her newfound companions are indeed the wolves. Upset and frustrated by this news, she dresses as the shepherd and gets the Lean Wolf to confirm his identity. She also brought the wolves a sleeping pill made of poppies instead of water, and they were put to sleep. Little Red Riding Hood proceeds to run away and runs into a hunter who only speaks of himself as if he were great, when in reality he is a coward. He wishes to shoot the wolves while they are asleep, but the girl stops him because she wishes to take the wolves to her village to be judged and so they can repent. The people from the village now learn of the trouble and come to Little Red Riding Hood's aid. They intend to hurt the wolves, but Little Red does not wish them any harm. She allows the wolves to flee.  Awards  The actress playing the main role of Little Red Riding Hood was a laureate USSR State Prize in literature and arts in 1978 for her acting in this film.

After establishing a career as a child prodigy in Cuba, his family sent him to Barcelona in 1932 to study under the retired virtuoso guitarist Miguel Llobet (1878‚Äì1938).Rey de la Torre On May 9, 1934 Llobet presented him in a concert at the Academia Marshall together with a pianist and then shortly after in a solo recital. Both received rave reviews from the tough Barcelona critics. Catalan composer and critic Jaime Pahissa described Rey as the most complete guitarist he had heard. Another critic compared him not only with Llobet but also with Pablo Casals.Turner Career His American d√©but was at The Town Hall in New York City in 1940. He subsequently made many appearances in the US, Canada and elsewhere. He gave radio broadcasts and played in two television plays. Rey de la Torre gave the US premi√®re of Concierto de Aranjuez by Joaqu√≠n Rodrigo on November 19, 1959, with the Cleveland Orchestra under the baton of Robert Shaw. He also premi√®red the Introduction to the Ch√¥ros by Heitor Villa-Lobos in New York, in August 1962, and Three Pieces for Guitar by Carlos Ch√°vez in New York on November 14, 1969.Weller 2006 A number of works were written for him by various composers, among them Juli√°n Orb√≥n. Spanish Music Center and Allegro recordings Rey made a number of recordings, the earliest of which he found unsatisfactory.Weller 2006 In the mid 1940s he recorded his first two LP albums for the Spanish Music Center (SMC) label. The first was titled The Music of Francisco T√°rrega - A Guitar Recital, vol. 1 SMC-516 and the second was The Music of Fernando Sor - A Guitar Recital, vol. 2 SMC-517. While it is believed that Andr√©s Segovia may have been the first to record the F. Sor studies, it was Rey's recordings of these important studies that first made it to vinyl.Andr√©s Segovia and his Contemporaries, vol. 10 (Rey de la Torre) - liner notes. In the early part of 1950, Rey recorded another two LP albums for the Allegro label. The first was titled Fernando Sor - Grand Sonata, Op.22 AL 76 and the second was German Song from the Minnesingers to the 17th Century AL 90. The later released was a collaborative effort with tenor Earl Rogers. The former album dedicated to Sor was later re-released by Allegro under a different title Rey de la Torre Plays Fernando Sor LEG 9013. The recording was later licensed to other minor record labels (such as Ember, Everest and EL) and it was generally released under the title Rey de la Torre Plays Spanish Guitar Classics. Philharmonia recordings In December, 1950 he recorded the Quintet in D, G. 448 by Luigi Boccherini with the Stuyvesant String Quartet on the short-lived Philharmonia record label. His most significant solo recording was made originally under the Philharmonia label in 1952, and was later re-released, first by Elektra records, and then by Nonesuch. Additionally, a recording exists of \\"Five Songs on Poems by Federico Garc√≠a Lorca\\" by No√´l Lee with soprano Adele Addison and flutist Samuel Baron in 1961 on the Composers Recordings Inc.

Mid career health issues Around 1961, right at a time when his career was flourishing, he suffered a setback: the middle finger of his right hand became less responsive and was a challenge for a number of years until Marianne Eppens, a physical therapist, was able to isolate the cause and offer a remedy. In 1969 they were married and moved to California. In 1975 at the zenith of his career Rey was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, a disease which ended his performing career a year later. Rey combined a teaching career with his active concert life until his retirement from the stage, at which point he devoted all of his efforts to teaching. He spent a brief period (1975‚Äì1977) teaching in New York, before relocating to San Francisco, where he spent the final two decades of his life, teaching in spite of a spiraling debilitation caused by his rheumatoid arthritis.Phillips, 2002 Discography * The Music of Francisco T√°rrega - A Guitar Recital, vol. 1 SMC-516 (1945) * The Music of Fernando Sor - A Guitar Recital, vol. 2 SMC-517 (1945) * Fernando Sor - Grand Sonata, Op.22 AL 76 (1949) * German Song from the Minnesingers to the 17th Century AL 90 (1949) * Boccherini: Quintet for Guitar & Strings #1 in D Major/Malipiero: Rispetti E.

It is a very popular belief accepted by certain premillennialists who usually promote young earth creationism. The view takes the stance that each millennium is actually a day according to God (as found in Psalm 90:4 and 2 Peter 3:8), and that eventually at the end of the 6,000 years since the creation, Jesus will return.Perry, Richard H. \\"The Complete Idiot's Guide to the Last Days\\". Penguin Group Publishing (USA). pg. 28-34; 320-321. It teaches that the 7th millennium is actually called the Sabbath Millennium, in which Jesus will ultimately set up his perfect kingdom and allow his followers to rest. The Sabbath Millennium is believed to be synonymous with the Millennial Reign of Christ that is found in Revelation 20:1-6. Proponents Early premillennialists included Pseudo-Barnabas,‚ÄùAmong the Apostolic Fathers Barnabas is the first and the only one who expressly teaches a pre-millennial reign of Christ on earth. He considers the Mosaic history of the creation a type of six ages of labor for the world, each lasting a thousand years, and of a millennium of rest, since with God ‚Äòone day is as a thousand years.‚Äô Millennial Sabbath on earth will be followed by an eighth and eternal day in a new world, of which the Lord‚Äôs Day (called by Barnabas ‚Äòthe eighth day‚Äô) is the type(access The Epistle of Barnabas here).

Hippolytus of Rome, Victorinus of Pettau,Note this is Victorinus of Pettau not Marcus Piav(v)onius Victorinus the Gaelic EmperorIn his Commentary on Revelation and from the fragment De Fabrica Mundi (Part of a commentary on Genesis). Jerome identifies him as a premillennialist. as well as various Gnostics groups and the Montanists. Many of these theologians and others in the early church expressed their belief in premillennialism through their acceptance of this sexta-septamillennial tradition. This belief claims that human history will continue for 6,000 years and then will enjoy Sabbath for 1,000 years (the millennial kingdom), thus all of human history will have a total of 7,000 years prior to the new creation. Christians throughout history have often considered that some thousand-year Sabbath, expected to begin six thousand years after Creation, might be identical with the millennium described in the Book of Revelation. This view was also popular among 19th- and 20th-century dispensational premillennialists. The term \\"Sabbatism\\" or \\"Sabbatizing\\" (Greek Sabbatismos), which generically means any literal or spiritual Sabbath- keeping, has also been taken in to have special reference to this definition. Support for the theory The main support for this view is found in the passages regarding the original Sabbath system that the Judeo-Christian God instituted, while also taking the verses of Psalms 90:4 and 2 Peter 3:8 into consideration. According to the proponents of the theory, Hosea 6:1-2 demonstrates that after 2 days, the Lord will revive Israel, and on the third day, restore her and live with her forever. According to these Christians, Jesus has indeed been gone for two millenniums. He was crucified during a time of severe Roman oppression that was directed towards Israel, which eventually caused the dispersion of Israel in the 1st century AD. Counting the first two days as two millenniums, and the third day as the Millennium in which Christ reigns on Earth may invariably lead to the conclusion that Jesus will return soon - most likely within the 21st century. It is this perception of Bible prophecy that provides the motivation to create a theory that is rooted in absolute Biblical literalism and is entirely based on Premillennialism. Additional support for the theory can be found in the Apocrypha. The Book of Jubilees records the end of the life of Adam in chapter four. Jubilees 4:29-30 \\"And at the close of the nineteenth jubilee, in the seventh week in the sixth year [930 A.M.] thereof, Adam died, and all his sons buried him in the land of his creation, and he was the first to be buried in the earth. And he lacked seventy years of one thousand years; for one thousand years are as one day in the testimony of the heavens and therefore was it written concerning the tree of knowledge: 'On the day that ye eat thereof ye shall die.' For this reason he did not complete the years of this day; for he died during it.\\" This theory has led some Christians to make a connection between the \\"Day of the Lord,\\" the \\"Last Day,\\" the \\"Sabbath,\\" and the 1000-year reign of Christ, seeing them as synonyms. However, this interpretation is not widely held at this time.

Colors (dark) (light) Summary The defending All-Filipino Conference champions had one new acquisition during the off-season, former University of Visayas cager Arnie Tuadles, taking the spot left by Fort Acu√±a, who retired to become coach Dante Silverio's assistant on the bench. The Tamaraws were tied with rival Crispa Redmanizers on top of the standings with 14 wins and 2 losses after 16 games. In the semifinal round, Toyota scored four straight victories to become the first team to enter the finals. On June 21, the Crispa Redmanizers formalized a return match with Toyota in the final playoffs after two years and six conferences with a 172-142 victory over the Tamaraws for their fourth win in five games on the night Atoy Co scored 50 points while Abe King of Toyota scored a season-high 60 points. The Tamaraws lost to Crispa in the championship series in five games. Bruce \\"Sky\\" King return for Toyota in the Open Conference and his import partner was 6-8 Andrew Fields, a former standout of Pennsylvania's Cheyney College. Fields debut with 16 points in Toyota's 124-118 overtime win over Gilbey's Gin, which got a combined 89-point output from their two imports, Larry McNeill and Dean Tolson, in the opening game of the second conference on August 5. Toyota finish a game behind Royal Tru-Orange after the two-round eliminations with 12 wins and 4 losses. Toyota makes it to the championship round against RTO, who were led by imports Larry Pounds and Otto Moore. The Tamaraws ended up bridesmaid for the second straight conference by losing to the Orangemen in four games of the title series. Three Toyota players namely Ramon Fernandez, Abe King and Ernesto Estrada skipped action in the round-robin of six teams in the Invitational championship, they were being sideline because of the disciplinary measures instituted by coach Dante Silverio, who felt the three did not play their best on several occasions in the second conference where Toyota lost in the finals to Royal. Despite their absence, the Tamaraws still made it to the championship for the third time in the season and played against rival Crispa Walk Tall Jeans. After the Tamaraws lost Game one by a whooping 28-point margin, the Toyota management decided to reactivate Fernandez, King and Estrada. Coach Dante Silverio resigned earlier in the day as both manager and coach upon learning on the management decision. Toyota retains the crown they won from last season and avoided a repeat of three runner-up finishes back in 1976 by defeating Crispa Walk Tall Jeans in the finals series, 3 games to 1, winning Game four, 98-87 on December 15 for their 6th PBA title. The victory snapped Toyota's five straight finals losses to Crispa, they won the championship this time under new coach Fort Acu√±a. Notable dates June 21: Abe King scored a conference-high 60 points in Toyota's 142-172 semifinal loss to Crispa. The 60-point output broke the previous record of 51 points set by Tony Torrente of RTO. November 27: Francis Arnaiz became the second player to reach 5,000 career points in Toyota's 88-81 win over Royal Tru Orange. December 11: Dante Silverio resigns as Toyota head coach after management reinstates Ramon Fernandez, Ernesto Estrada and Abe King in Game Two of the Invitational Conference finals. Awards Arnie Tuadles was voted the season's Rookie of the year. Tuadles was also named in the mythical first team. Ramon Fernandez lost out to Atoy Co in a close balloting for the season's Most Valuable Player award and settled for the mythical first team award along with Arnie Tuadles and Robert Jaworski.

The band described their music as \\"heavy pop\\". Their manager, Warren Bramley, has previously worked with Tony Wilson at Factory Records. Beginnings WU LYF formed in the summer of 2008 and consisted of \\"Jeau\\" (Joe Manning), \\"Lung\\" (Tom McClung), \\"Elle Jaie\\" (Ellery Roberts) and \\"Evnse\\" (Evans Kati). The band started their own record label titled Ridiculous Records. The band's first gig outside Manchester came in July 2010 at the MIDI Festival on the French Riviera. Subsequent shows include France's Transmusicales Festival, Berlin's Transmediale festival and sold-out headline shows in Glasgow and London. In July 2010 the band announced the formation of the Lucifer Youth Foundation, giving new members an illustrated bandit mask and a 12\\" single featuring the tracks \\"Concrete Gold\\" and \\"Heavy Pop\\". The band started recording their debut album in November 2010 using the money generated by the L Y F membership scheme. Deciding against the conventional studio set up, they instead took over Saint Peter's church in Ancoats, Manchester, to record their album. The album is self-produced. The band declined all offers from established record labels and released their debut album, entitled Go Tell Fire to the Mountain, themselves on 13 June 2011 through the L Y F recordings imprint. In support of the record's release, the band played several dates in the UK to critical acclaim, culminating in the curation of the Great Bridgewater Street Tunnel as part of the Manchester International Festival. Making the album The band had the concept for Go Tell Fire to the Mountain long before the recording process took place. Roberts states that it was written \\"in a narrative sense and [was approached] as a complete work rather than a bunch of songs thrown together.\\" When searching for a place to record, the group was dissatisfied with the sound they were getting from traditional studios, leading them to settle on an old abandoned church in Manchester, England. The amount of open airspace in the church allowed for a healthy dose of reverb, which is a critical part of the album's larger than life sound. Despite the media's insistence of the location's relevance to the religious theme of the band, Roberts denies it. Although the church altered the \\"vibe of the songs\\", the band asserts that Saint Peter's church sonically fit the album's needs. Press coverage Much of the early press coverage on the band has focused on the fact that they do not know much about the band. The New York Observer described the phenomenon as \\"carefully designed anonymity\\". One critic highlighted their \\"ability to maintain mystique at a time when everything is out in the open\\". The NME picked the band as one that was likely to define 2011. Stereogum featured WU LYF as a \\"Band to Watch\\" in May 2010. They were described as \\"the cult band of the moment in England\\" by Rolling Stone magazine in Italy. The Dutch magazine Kicking the Habit described them as sounding like \\"Tom Waits in a church under the guidance of stoned garage\\". The band appeared on BBC2's \\"Culture Show\\", showcasing a song off their debut album and conducting an interview. Latter-day press became more concerned with WU LYF's intense, cathartic live shows. Pitchfork Media gave Go Tell Fire to the Mountain an 8.4 rating and the \\"Best New Music\\" accolade, stating, \\"WU LYF in the manner of Iceage or Odd Future as musicians that have made me genuinely excited about their potential impact on listeners, the same things that make them seem juvenile---the artistic and personal volatility, the semblance of a roving gang more than a band, the invitation to indulge in your most disturbing impulses and yet feel morally superior to an ill-defined majority ---are the same things that feel totally galvanizing. And it's easy to imagine Go Tell Fire to the Mountain giving disaffected listeners the promise of an entry to something beyond themselves in a way that James Blake or Bon Iver can't.\\". BBC Radio 1's Zane Lowe named \\"Dirt\\" the \\"Hottest Track in the World\\" in 2011. This Wikipedia page on the band has been deleted several times, which itself has been covered by the press. Post-breakup On 24 November 2012, a video for a new track appeared on YouTube accompanied by a supposed letter from lead singer Ellery Roberts, directed towards his bandmates. It stated: \\"I am gone. This isn't the end. This is the beginning.\\" At this moment in time it was unclear as to whether this was the end for WU LYF, however their Facebook page also disappeared around the same time the video surfaced. A new track titled \\"T R I U M P H\\" accompanied the letter, in which Roberts announced, \\"WU LYF is dead to me.\\" Following his departure, the remaining WU LYF members continued on as Los Porcos, a former side-project, releasing 2 tracks in April 2013. Tom McClung created a solo project called Francis Lung, and Evans Kati and Joe Manning formed Dream Lovers, debuting their first show at Midi Music Festival in 2015. Ellery Roberts joined girlfriend Ebony Hoorn to form LUH., which stands for \\"Lost Under Heaven\\". LUH.'s debut album, entitled Spiritual Songs for Lovers to Sing, was co-produced by The Haxan Cloak and was released in May 2016 by Mute Records. On 27 September 2016 WU LYF's official Twitter account sent out their first tweet in over three years, saying only \\"Soon...\\". The tweet was deleted a short time later.

History x265 builds on source code from x264, an open-source video encoder for the previous MPEG video coding standard H.264/MPEG-4 AVC. The project has licensed the rights to use the x264 source code. Development on x265 began in March 2013. MulticoreWare made the source code for x265 publicly available on July 23, 2013. The x265 project was initially funded by a small group of charter licensee companies that direct the development requirements and receive commercial licenses to use x265 in their products without having to release their products under the GPL 2 license. In February 2014, x265 was integrated into the popular multimedia transcoding tool FFmpeg and its fork Libav.Volker Zota (heise online), 14. 2. 2014: Videokodierung: HEVC/H.265-Encoder h√§lt Einzug bei FFmpeg und LibAV Version 1.0 was completed in May 2014. The stable version (2.0) was released on July 14, 2016. Technical details x265 source code is written in C++ and assembly. x265 supports the Main, Main 10, Main 12 and Main Still Picture profiles of HEVC (including intra-only profiles), utilizing a bit depth of either 8 bits or 10 bits per sample YCbCr with 4:2:0, 4:2:2 or 4:4:4 chroma subsampling. x265 supports most of the features of x264 including all rate control modes: Constant QP (CQP), Constant Rate Factor (CRF), Average Bit Rate (ABR), 2-pass or multi-pass and video buffering verifier rate control. Visual quality algorithms include CU-Tree (the successor to x264's macroblock-tree), adaptive quantization, b-pyramid, weighted prediction and psycho-visual optimizations (psy-rd and psy-rdoq). A fully lossless mode is also supported. Temporal scalability is supported, allowing for a video to be encoded into a base layer HEVC bitstream that is half the frame rate of the input video frame rate, and an enhancement layer that can be decoded along with the base layer to enable playback at the full frame rate. In April 2015, at the NAB Show in Las Vegas, MulticoreWare demonstrated high quality real-time 4K 10-bit HEVC encoding at frame rates in excess of 60 FPS on a dual Intel Xeon E5 v3 server, occupying only one standard rack unit.

In the book Bradley examines American policy in the Pacific during the presidency of Theodore Roosevelt, and a surrounding a secret diplomatic/Congressional mission to Asia conceived by Roosevelt which would affect United States involvement in Asia. The material also covers a wide array of other cultural factors that loosely relate to this, the largest diplomatic delegation ever sent to Asia in U.S. history. The book asserts that Roosevelt's diplomatic mistakes constituted the original encouragement for the Japanese imperialism that ultimately backfired on the United States and led to the war in the Pacific, and acted as a catalyst in the fomentation of many subsequent events in Asia, including the Chinese Communist Revolution, the Korean War, and even the current state of U.S.-Asia affairs today in the 21st century.Bradley, James. The Imperial Cruise. In support of the book's themes, Bradley presents evidence in the form of Roosevelt's personal letters and pictures. Nevertheless, the book's historical accuracy has proved controversial, with some historians, specialists and reviewers pointing out Bradley's methods as faulty. Synopsis The book centers on the diplomatic mission of the sent by President Theodore Roosevelt in the summer of 1905. On board was the largest diplomatic mission delegation in U.S. history, including some of the highest profile political figures of the time. They included Secretary of War (and future President) William Howard Taft; Roosevelt's daughter, Alice Roosevelt; her future husband, Congressman (and later Speaker of the House) Nicholas Longworth; along with 29 other members of the House and Senate, and their wives; and an array of additional high-ranking military and civilian officials.The Imperial Cruise - p. 2. After his initial description and introduction of the SS Manchuria's voyage, the author explores brief excerpts of the history behind the period's American domestic and foreign policy, elaborating on its influence, motivation, and consequences, specifically in regard to American-Japanese, Sino-Japanese, and Russo-Japanese relations. More broadly, Bradley explores his contention relating to how deep-set racial tendencies, biases and racially deterministic philosophiesDyer, Thomas G. \\"Theodore Roosevelt and the Idea of Race\\" Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University, 1960. fueled and undergirded virtually all U.S. foreign and domestic policy-making in that era pertaining to U.S. relations with other nations and to populations of other racial, cultural or religious heritages. This included virtually all peoples of non-Teutonic Anglo-Saxon descent, and resulted, for example, in the slaughter of more than 250,000 Filipinos during the U.S. colonial take-over of the Philippines.The Imperial Cruise - p.22. It is Bradley's contention that the actions of one Roosevelt, and the diplomatic cruise in the summer of 1905, lit that fuse that would doom more than 100,000 U.S. military to die in the Pacific theater decades later under another Roosevelt in the 1940s.The Imperial Cruise - p.168. Through what Bradley describes as their \\"bumbling diplomacy\\", he describes how Teddy Roosevelt and his emissary Taft turned previously friendly Japanese sentiment, against the United States.The Imperial Cruise - p.322. Critical reception The Imperial Cruise has received mixed reviews. Writing for The New York Times Review of Books, Janet Maslin noted that \\"The Imperial Cruise is startling enough to reshape conventional wisdom about Roosevelt's presidency\\". At the same time, she criticized the author, which favors \\"broad strokes and may at times be overly eager to connect historical dots, but he also produces graphic, shocking evidence of the attitudes that his book describes.\\"name=\\"newyorktimesreview\\" USA Today was neutral, calling it useful for readers who think that history \\"is the story of good guys and bad guys\\", and expressing disappointment with the \\"relentlessly sarcastic\\" tone and lack of ambiguity. Chiefly, USA Today noted an unresolved historical issue at the heart of Bradley's thesis, which argues that Japan was inspired by the visit of the U.S. delegation to pursue imperialistic expansion in 1905, when Japan had no such ambitions. Bradley's book argues that it was the American delegation's seminal influence that both inspired Japanese imperialistic adventurism, including eventually and ironically, their attack on Pearl Harbor, and also continuing tensions between the United States and Asian nations.The Imperial Cruise - p.5. While Bradley argues that \\"The U.S. Army had brought the Aryan to the Pacific coast\\", USA Today cited his failure to explain how \\"in the 1930s, imperial Japan would act on the secret words of a man dead for more than a decade and out of office since 1909.\\" Scholars such as M. Patrick Cullinane of Northumbria University rejects Bradley's main themes as extreme exaggerations based on misinterpretations. He says the treatment of Roosevelt is \\"grossly unfair\\" and Bradley ignores the Asian role in the multiple catastrophes blamed on Roosevelt.M. Patrick Cullinane, \\"James Bradley, The Imperial Cruise....\\" Journal of American Studies 45.#1 (2011): E5. online Professor William N. Tilchin of Boston University attacks \\"Bradley's stupendously faulty analysis, The Imperial Cruise is a profoundly ignorant book even on the basic level of undisputed objective facts.\\" He writes: :The pomposity and the utter absurdity of The Imperial Cruise are starkly previewed in a single sentence in the book's sixth paragraph: \\"This book reveals that behind [Roosevelt's] Asian whispers that critical summer of 1905 was a very big stick‚Äîthe bruises from which would catalyze World War II in the Pacific, the Chinese Communist Revolution, the Korean War, and an array of tensions that inform our lives today.\\" (24) This grandiose, ridiculous assertion is made without even the remotest understanding of Theodore Roosevelt's diplomacy or of either U.S. foreign policy or internal Japanese developments between 1905 and 1941. The central notion that TR \\"gave\\" Korea to Japan‚Äîwhen Japan actually had previously secured control of Korea‚Äîis preposterous and, moreover, completely fails to explore the president's main alternative to endorsing Japanese rule: TR could have gratuitously antagonized Japan over this matter, thereby endangering the U.S. position in the Philippines and, more generally, signaling the Japanese that they should view the United States as a hostile rival.William N.

The film features Kareena Kapoor and Imran Khan in lead roles, with Ratna Pathak Shah, Boman Irani and Ram Kapoor in supporting roles. The plot centers on an uptight architect named Rahul Kapoor, living in Las Vegas, Nevada, who loses his job and, following a night of debauchery, accidentally marries a free-spirited hairstylist named Riana Braganza. After mutually deciding to annul the marriage, Rahul begins a one- sided attraction for Riana, which threatens to ruin their new friendship. Development began in 2010, when Johar signed Batra and Khan for a film to be made under his banner. Inspired by the Woody Allen style of film-making, Ayesha Devitre and Batra worked on the script, with principal photography taking place in Vegas, Los Angeles, Pataudi and Mumbai. The film features music by Clinton Cerejo and Amit Trivedi, with the former composing the score and the latter composing the songs. The lyrics for songs were written by Amitabh Bhattacharya. Originally slated to release during the fall of 2011, Ek Main Aur Ekk Tu eventually released on 10 February 2012, to positive critical reception, with major praise directed to Kapoor and Khan's performance, and proved a moderate commercial success.  Plot  Rahul Kapoor, an architect, has always been on the road to perfection, as per the wishes of his domineering father and socialite mother. After suddenly losing his job in Vegas, he hides the truth from his parents and looks for another job. Unable to cope with unemployment, he goes to a psychologist and runs into another patient, Riana Braganza. A series of events lead Riana to believe that he is sent by her ex-boyfriend to stalk her, and she ends up taking his file by mistake. Riana, who later realises her mistake, calls him and apologises for her behaviour. They meet up on Christmas Eve and Riana invites Rahul to have a few drinks with her. A few drinks turn into a night of intoxicated revelry and they end up marrying each other. Horrified the following morning, they decide to get it annulled as soon as possible. Meanwhile, Riana, who is also unemployed and has not paid her rent, loses her accommodation and an initially hesitant Rahul lets her stay with him till her problem gets resolved. During these few days, they get to know each other better. Rahul is revealed to be interested in photography while Riana recounts her ambition to be a ballet dancer, which was destroyed after she broke her ankle in childhood. Their friendship develops as Riana gives Rahul a long break he always wanted. As they grow closer, Rahul develops feelings for Riana, who fails to reciprocate them. As New Year's Eve approaches, Riana plans to visit her family in India and asks Rahul to accompany her. He disagrees initially, as his parents live in Mumbai, but later succumbs to her argument. Upon arrival, she introduces him to her family, making his feelings towards her grow. The next day, Riana takes him to visit her school. Amidst reflecting over her past relationships, he unsuccessfully tries to kiss her. Realising that she does not feel the way he does, he angrily leaves the school, only to almost run into a car revealed to be his mother's. He lies and tells his mother that he is in India for a research trip, and that Riana is a colleague. They have lunch with Rahul's parents, where he spins a web of intricate lies to avoid telling his father the truth. He leaves Riana's house and returns to his parents, trying to tell them the truth, but once again is overpowered by his father. Two days later, during a family dinner, Rahul angrily divulges the complete truth to his in- denial parents and their business partners, after realising the meaninglessness of his pretense he indulged in all these years. He rushes back to Riana to apologise for his behaviour while Riana apologises she never intended to lead him on. After a night of reflection and deep conversation, they decide to maintain their friendship. The duo return to Las Vegas and finalise their annulment. Rahul gets a new job, while making time for photography. He remains hopeful that one day he will convince Riana to go back to that chapel with him. Both remain good friends, with an ending note from Rahul claiming that he is finally happy with his life, as the credits roll.  Cast  * Kareena Kapoor as Riana Braganza, a hairstylist who tries to add zing to Rahul Kapoor's monotonous life following their marriage. In an interview with The Times of India, Kapoor describes her character and explains, \\"Riana knows what she is doing.

His parents have always told him what to do, how to behave, what to study, what career to pursue and so on and so forth. Even his hobbies have been decided by his parents. He has never had a spontaneous moment in his life where he has done something for himself. He is actually a very sad, lonely and tragic guy but he doesn't realize it.\\" * Ratna Pathak Shah as Mrs. Kapoor, Rahul's mother, a fiercely dominating woman. * Boman Irani as Mr. Kapoor, Rahul's father, a strict disciplinarian. * Ram Kapoor as Mr. Bulani, a friend of Rahul's father, who tries to help Rahul overcome his low self-esteem. * Dana Lewis as Mrs. Bulani, who makes sexual advances at Rahul. * Soniya Mehra as Anusha, Rahul's ex-girlfriend. * Rajesh Khattar as Mr. Shah. * Nikhil Kapoor as Phil Braganza, Riana's father. * Zenobia Shroff as Nicole Braganza, Riana's mother. * Manasi Scott as Steph Braganza / Steph Karan Sharma, Karan's wife, Riana's sister. * Mukul Chaddha as Karan Sharma, Steph's husband, Riana's brother-in-law. * Avantika Malik in a special appearance during the song Auntyji.  Production  A major part of Ek Main Aur Ekk Tu was set in Las Vegas, Nevada. Pre-production work on Ek Main Aur Ekk Tu began in 2010 when Karan Johar announced his plans of making a new project with debutant Shakun Batra. Following the success of their previous collaboration I Hate Luv Storys (2010), Khan was contracted by Johar to play the male lead. In an attempt to sign in an actress who had never worked with Khan before, Kapoor was confirmed to play the female lead several days later. She had to cut her hair short and sport red streaks for her role. On casting Khan and Kapoor, Johar commented, \\"They could get their real life personality onto the film. Imran is meant to be this very perfectionist young man. So while he is a very stuffy kind of a character, he is also very focused and doesn't let himself go. On the other hand Kareena plays this woman who is like a modern version of Geet from Jab We Met.\\" Batra mentioned, \\"It's a slice of life film, driven by characters. The plot is not primary, emotions of the characters are at the forefront. It is set on two weeks of the life of two characters, played by Imran and Kareena.\\" On the other hand, Johar said it was inspired by the Woody Allen style of film-making. He added that there would be \\"lot more conversation happening here\\" and there would be \\"these walk-talk sequences where it is just you and the camera in motion.\\" Principal photography commenced in November 2010 in Las Vegas, Nevada after Khan had completed working on Mere Brother Ki Dulhan and later continued in Los Angeles. After completing the film's first schedule, the crew shifted to shoot in Pataudi, in the Indian state of Haryana, followed by Mumbai. As photography began in Vegas, media sources began to report that it could be an adaptation of the American romantic comedy, What Happens in Vegas (2008). Johar, however, went on to deny these reports, claiming that, if he wanted to remake the film, he would have bought the rights to it. Originally referred to as Short Term Shaadi, the title and first look was launched by Johar in August 2011 via Twitter. According to him, \\"Short Term Shaadi was just a working title that attached itself to this film through the making. Neither the director nor I were happy with it from the start.\\" The name Ek Main Aur Ekk Tu was derived from a song from the Rishi Kapoor and Neetu Singh starrer Khel Khel Mein (1975). On deciding to set the stot in Vegas, Batra said that \\"the character of the place is very well defined and we need to show it as Las Vegas. It can't be shown as any other city. Since most films are not set there, it gets difficult. In case of Ek Main Aur Ekk Tu, our film is set in Las Vegas and Mumbai.\\" As filming took place during the winter in Vegas, the production team shot for double shifts to be cost effective.  Soundtrack  The music rights of Ek Main Aur Ekk Tu were sold to T-Series for . The soundtrack, which released on 26 December 2011, featured music composed by Amit Trivedi with lyrics by Amitabh Bhattacharya. Batra mentioned that Trivedi was his first choice for music director and added that while the track \\"Gubbare\\" was the first to be recorded, the title track took the longest to compose.  Reception  The soundtrack met with a positive response, with Avijit Ghosh of The Times of India mentioning, \\"Composer Amit Trivedi and lyricist Amitabh Bhattacharya are among the finest musical team in Bollywood. In Ek Main Aur Ekk Tu, they are again at their best. The seductive Auntyji and the racy title track have a delightful breeziness. And the more evocative tracks such as Gubbare Gubbare and Aahatein stay with you for long\\". While praising the compositions, Joginder Tuteja of Bollywood Hungama commented that the album belonged to a \\"niche audience\\". He added that the songs Ek Main Aur Ekk Tu and Kar Chalna Shuru Tu would make the most impression. Mitesh Saraf of Planet Bollywood, while summarising his review wrote, \\"The album has some cool songs to chill out to and they should sound even better on screen.\\"  Release  The film released worldwide on 10 February 2012, coinciding with Valentine's Day celebrations. Upon release, Ek Main Aur Ekk Tu received positive reviews and was a moderate box office success. The trailers of Ek Main Aur Ekk Tu faced trouble with the censor board before release. Initially, the word \\"sex\\" was objected to by the board and asked to be removed. Later, a scene depicting Kapoor pinching Khan's buttocks was considered inappropriate for television promos and had to be removed.  Critical reception  Rachel Saltz of The New York Times noted, \\"The happy surprise of Ek Main aur Ekk Tu is that it's not crude, sniggering or vindictive. Instead it's rather sweet and sometimes even a little unexpected.\\" Avijit Ghosh of The Times of India gave 4 out of 5 stars and said that, \\"Ek Main Aur Ekk Tu is the sweetest heartbreak that Bollywood has conjured in a long, long time.\\" Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama also gave 4 out of 5 stars saying, \\"This take on love is refined, smart, lively and thoroughly pleasing thanks to its characters, conversations and the inherent humor.\\" Piyali Dasgupta of NDTV, in her 4-star review, explained, \\"I'll play on the film's USP for this review and keep it short and crisp. No extra lines. But, just like you need to read this, you need to go and watch the film.\\" DNA India recommended it and gave 4 stars out of 5 concluding, \\"All in all, Ek Main Aur Ekk Tu is a delightful film that keeps getting better along the way, and ends fabulously. Clocking under two hours, the film is a breezy watch that will leave you with a smile.\\" MiD DAY gave 3.5 stars out of 5, commenting, \\"The climax is brave, unpredictable and real. Go watch! Ek Main Aur Ekk Tu is a small packet of joy.\\" India Today, too, gave 3.5 stars out of 5 saying, \\"Ek Main Aur Ekk Tu is a gentle little film, where even the regulation song with Americans dancing to Bollywood music in the middle of Vegas don't look so bad.\\" A review carried by Birmingham Mail mentioned, Daily Bhaskar gave 3 out of 5 stars and concluded saying, \\"Overall, Ek Main Aur Ekk Tu is a typical popcorn entertainment with super-amazing climax which puts it in a different league altogether.\\" Sukanya Verma for Rediff too gave the film 3 stars out of 5, and commented, \\"Ek Main Aur Ekk Tu is neither on the epic side like Dharma Productions' great, grand ancestors nor weighed down by an overload of pop culture references of those that define the genre.\\" Komal Nahta for Koimoi, too, gave 3 out of 5 stars, saying Ek Main Aur Ekk Tu is an entertaining and enjoyable fare for the city audience. Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave it 3 out of 5 stars and said \\"Ek Main Aur Ekk Tu is a narrative that unfolds mainly through dialogue, and the lighter moments come at you as the odd couple gets to know each other. The humor hits the mark many times and falls flat occasionally, but the movie doesn't grate because the characters aren't trying too hard to be cute.\\" The Economic Times gave 2.5 stars out of 5, and said \\"It's perfect in whatever it offers. But what it offers is quite average in volume.\\" Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express gave 2.5 stars out of 5 and said \\"The film passes by pleasantly enough past all its expected roadsigns, providing a smile and an occasional chuckle but making you wish for more newness.\\" On the contrary, Kunal Guha of Yahoo! gave 2 stars out of 5, saying \\"this film doesn't subscribe to every clich√© associated with this auspicious day for getting Main and Tu to become Hum.\\"  Box office  Ek Main Aur Ekk Tu opened well in multiplexes in North India, while other areas had an average opening at multiplexes. On its first day, it earned about nett, with major collections coming from Mumbai, Delhi NCR, Punjab and Mysore.

The company sells communications products such as TV (analog, digital, IP), Internet, phone, and applications for elderly care at home and smart metering/telemetry. The company claims to be number 5 in Germany and market leader in its core business in central Germany. The corporate headquarters is in Leipzig.  History =Company History primacom was formed in 1998 from the merger of Kabelmedia and S√ºweda. After the merger, the Group was introduced to the stock exchange of the New Market and the NASDAQ on 22 February 1999 . Since 5 June 2003 the stock of the PrimaCom AG is listed in the Prime Standard of Frankfurt Stock Exchange. In August 2000 primacom acquired the Multikabel company in the Netherlands, which was sold to UPC five years later. In September 2007, the Orion Cable GmbH acquired nearly 91% of the shares of primacom group, with the aim to integrate the company with Tele Columbus Group, a company Orion Cable had already acquired. Orion Cable's attempts to integrate were stopped by primacom in 2009, due to low success estimations. The halt of the integration led to uncertainty at the banks of primacom, so that in December 2009 refinancing negotiations begun. As part of the refinancing negotiations, the operational business of the primacom Group was acquired by Medfort S.√† rl in July 2010. Hence the company's operational business and the former holding PrimaCom AG were separated. In January 2011 primacom completed the refinancing successfully and is now focused on the development of operating business. The existing cable network is the main driver of the core business of the company. However, there were some changes over the years. While the core areas of the company were initially divided into two areas - Hessen / Rhineland-Palatinate, Baden-W√ºrttemberg on one side and areas in the east of Germany on the other, the existing networks in the western areas of Germany were sold to competitors during the following years. In 2008, the cable networks in Aachen and Wiebaden were sold to Unity Media. In 2010, the city networks in Mainz and Osnabr√ºck were sold to Kabel Deutschland. Primacom began to relocate its headquarters to the eastern part of Germany, following the trend of cable network development. According to information provided by the company this process will be completed by 2011.  Organisation The Luxembourg company Medfort S.√† rl is holding 100 per cent of shares of the primacom group. In turn Perseus to SA is holding 100 per cent of Medfort S.√† rl shares . The operational business of the Group is led by the holding PrimaCom Management GmbH. Within the holding company the operational assets as well as rights and licenses and also staff are performed in different operating units. Two Managing Directors are appointed for all operational companies. These are: ‚Ä¢ Michael Dorn, Chief Executive Officer (CEO, COO), ‚Ä¢ Dipl.-Ing. Wolf Waschkuhn (CRO) Key Data  primacom has about one million connected households, most of them are upgraded to the highest standard of technology according to information of the company. The core of the network is the backbone installed by primacom. That is a redundant and automatically controlled network controlled centrally from Leipzig. According to its own data, the turnover of the company is currently at about EUR 100 million with earnings before taxes, interest, depreciation and amortization of more than EUR 40 million.

National Hydrography Dataset high- resolution flowline data. The National Map , accessed May 19, 2011 portion of the Little Calumet River that begins just east of Holmesville, Indiana in New Durham Township in LaPorte County and flows west to Porter County and the Port of Indiana-Burns Waterway. History Joseph Bailly Homestead on east bank of the Little Calumet River in Porter, Indiana. Great blue heron (Ardea herodias) flying with nesting material. Yellow trout lily in bloom on the East Arm Little Calumet River Example of farming right up to the river's edge. Loss of riparian vegetation leads to run-off carrying sediment and pollutants (e.g. fertilizer) directly into the river, reducing water clarity and quality. Although its origins are unclear, the Calumet name seems to reflect the nature of the river. It may have come from the Old French word chalemel, which has to do with reeds, or it might be a corruption of the Potawatomi word gekelemuk, which means \\"a low body of deep still water\\". In 1822 Joseph Bailly (born Honore Gratien Joseph Bailly de Messein) established a homestead and fur trading business at the now historic Bailly Homestead, a part of Indiana Dunes National Park, on the east bank of the Little Calumet River in Porter, Indiana. The Potawatomis brought the beaver pelts by canoe to Bailly in the spring of the year and then he shipped them to Mackinac, from whence they were traded to Montreal and then Europe. By 1830, the beavers were depleted and Bailly opened a tavern on the Fort Dearborn to Detroit Road (present day U.S. Hwy. 12). The fur trading era in northwestern Indiana had come to an end. Until 1926 the river continued west to Illinois as the Little Calumet River proper, but excavation of the Burns Waterway caused the flow from the eastern arm of the Little Calumet River to be diverted directly into Lake Michigan at Burns Harbor, Indiana. Watershed and course The East Arm of the Little Calumet River flows west under the Indiana Toll Road and into Round Lake at Holmesville, then is joined by Carver Ditch on the right, and then on the left by Reynolds Creek, Sand Creek, Coffee Creek, Salt Creek and by the Little Calumet River (west arm), then exits via the Burns Waterway into Lake Michigan. The watershed begins in the physiographic unit known as the Valparaiso Morainal Area. The Valparaiso Moraine, located south of the Lacustrine Plain, is an arc-shaped moraine complex that parallels the southern shore of Lake Michigan. The moraine divides LaPorte and Porter County into northern and southern drainage areas. The area north drains into Lake Michigan; south of the moraine water drains to the Kankakee River. Numerous kettle lakes sit on the moraine. Habitat and wildlife A great blue heron (Ardea herodias) rookery was protected and made part of the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore in 1980. The herons, numbering 98 nesting pairs as of 2001, have made their home on the eastern portion of the wet woods along the Little Calumet River for more than 60 years. They return to the region after wintering in the southeast and south central States. Beaver (Castor canadensis) were hunted for their fur since the era of the French trappers only to be extirpated from Indiana in the nineteenth century. In 1935 re- introductions of Wisconsin and Michigan beaver into Indiana were successful and the aquatic herbivorous mammal was spotted in the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore beginning in 1968. Whitaker reported in 1994 that beaver were trapped in the river north of Chesterton and that he had found signs of beaver in the lower portions of the river. Beaver create wetlands which remove sediment and pathogens and increase trout and salmon abundance as their ponds make ideal fish-rearing habitat. Research in the western United States, found that extensive loss of beaver ponds resulted in an 89% reduction in coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) smolt summer production and an almost equally detrimental 86% reduction in critical winter habitat carrying capacity. Contrary to popular myth, most beaver dams do not pose barriers to trout and salmon migration, although they may be restricted seasonally during periods of low stream flows. The nonvenomous northern water snake (Nerodia sipedon) inhabits the river, where it often winters in the rubble around bridges, and is often seen near Bailly's Homestead. In June 2015, the Little Calumet River East Branch Watershed Management Plan was produced via a partnership led by Save the Dunes. Pollution and conservation Portions of the lower river and its Salt Creek tributary are now protected by Indiana Dunes National Park. The Heron Rookery protects a mid-section and a portion of the headwaters including part of Round Lake is protected by the 106 acre Little Calumet Headwaters Nature Preserve, part of the 160 acre Red Mill County Park, established in 2002. The East Arm Little Calumet River watershed is listed as impaired for \\"Mercury Fish Consumption Advisory, PCB Fish Consumption Advisory, and Pathogens\\". Recreation The lower part of the Little Calumet River, along with Salt Creek and Trail Creek, is stocked by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources with steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), and coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch). These fish are non-native potamodromous salmonids from the West Coast which run up from Lake Michigan to the creeks where they were stocked in an attempt to spawn, although Indiana's creeks are too warm for significant salmonid reproduction, requiring regular re-stocking.

At the age of thirteen, she talked her piano teacher into teaching her the basics of the organ. Nancy has been playing the organ at Bellflower Baptist Church for over 55 years; it was there that she met her husband, Bill. She also plays the organ at the Orange County Fair, the Pomona Fair, and has played shows in Las Vegas and Lake Tahoe. Los Angeles Dodgers organist In the mid-1980s, Bea filled in for a friend as the organist for California Angels games at Angel Stadium, and was offered a job which she declined not wishing to take work from a friend. When it was announced in 1987 that long-time Dodger organist Helen Dell was to retire at the end of the season after fifteen years, Bea auditioned at an exhibition game between the Dodgers and the USC Trojans on February 14, 1988. She did not preplan her programs, getting her cues from the events occurring on the field during the game and including a variety of popular pop and rock songs alongside older and less commonly played numbers. Bea- alongside announcers Vin Scully and Rick Monday- was a great crowd favorite at Dodger Stadium.

First released in the UK, it was followed up with a US version two years later containing two alternate tracks for American audiences. Release and reception The City That Sleeps was received with mixed critical acclaim. The original UK version of the album, produced by Sam Williams, contains 11 tracks, including their single \\"You Will Leave a Mark.\\" This single was number one in the Sunday Times Culture magazine's 'Hottest Downloads' chart. The album was compared to the music of bands such as Coldplay and reviewers described it as 'catchy and accessible.' It is this comparison that saddled the band with the piano rock label. After the album's release the band toured, visiting places such as Portugal where they quickly became popular. After a matter of weeks, \\"You Will Leave A Mark\\" reached the top of the Portuguese download singles charts, followed by the album soon after. In advance of the US release, the alternative rock music station Alt Nation on SiriusXM Satellite Radio began to play \\"You Will Leave A Mark\\" in April 2010. The song soon made it onto the station's Alt 18 Most Requested Song Countdown, debuting on the 5/1/2010 Countdown at #14. It would ultimately reach #1 and remain on the Countdown for 30 weeks, making it the longest running song to chart. This honor would be held until Foster the People's \\"Pumped Up Kicks\\" eventually surpassed it. The band toured the US in September and December 2010, then performed almost daily from March 10 through April 8, 2011 in support of the album. The latter run was as support for Civil Twilight. In July, A Silent Film did a mini-tour of the West Coast. New material was presented at these shows which would ultimately wind up on the band's sophomore release, Sand & Snow. These included: \\"Cuckoo Song,\\" \\"Harbour Lights,\\" and \\"Let Them Feel Your Heartbeat.\\" \\"Snowbirds\\" (later named \\"Where Have the Snowbirds Flown\\") was also showcased, but would be a non LP b-side to the album's lead single, \\"Danny, Dakota and the Wishing Well,\\" and would later appear on the deluxe edition of Sand & Snow.

It is mainly used in aircraft engine oil chip detection systems. Chip detectors can provide an early warning of an impending engine failure and thus greatly reduce the cost of an engine overhaul. Operation Chip Detectors consist of small plugs which can be installed in an engine oil filter, oil sump or aircraft drivetrain gear boxes. Over a period of time, engine wear and tear causes small metal chips to break loose from engine parts and circulate in the engine oil. The detector houses magnets incorporated into an electric circuit. Magnetic lines of force attract ferrous particles. Collection of these particles continues until the insulated air gap between the magnets (two magnet configuration) or between the magnet and housing (one magnet configuration) is bridged, effectively closing the circuit. The result is an electronic signal for remote indication. Thus, warning light on the instrument panel illuminates, indicating the presence of metal chips.http://www.allenaircraft.com/products/chip_detectors.html Chip detectors may be positioned in the application with a self-closing valve/adapter through either a bayonet or threaded interface. As the chip detector is disengaged from the valve, the valve closes minimizing any fluid loss from the system. The chip detectors used on aircraft are inspected in every 'A check' and higher.

The term derives from the Greek of the New Testament and was used for Jesus's original Twelve Apostles (including Peter, James, and John), as well as a wider group of early Christian figures, including Paul, Barnabas, and Junia. Some other religions use the term for comparable figures in their history. The word in this sense may be used metaphorically in various contexts, but is mostly found used specifically for early associates of the founder of a religion, who were important in spreading his or her teachings. The adjective apostolic () is claimed as a continuing characteristic by a number of prominent Christian churches (i.e., that a given church's traditions, practices, and teachings descend directly from the original apostles), and so finds wider modern application. The word is found, for example, in the \\"Apostolic See\\", the official name for the Roman Catholic Papacy; in the doctrine of apostolic succession, held by many branches of Christianity; and in the Four Marks of the Church (\\"one, holy, catholic, and apostolic\\") found in the Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed. Terminology Gallery of the Apostles, Temmenhausen Nikolauskirche The term apostle is derived from Classical Greek ·ºÄœÄœåœÉœÑŒøŒªŒøœÇ (ap√≥stolos), meaning \\"one who is sent off\\", from œÉœÑŒ≠ŒªŒªŒµŒπŒΩ (\\"stellein\\"), \\"to send\\" + Œ±œÄœå (ap√≥), \\"off, away from\\". The literal meaning in English is therefore an \\"emissary\\" (from the Latin mittere, \\"to send\\", and ex, \\"from, out, off\\". The word apostle has two meanings, the broader meaning of a messenger and the narrower meaning of an early Christian apostle directly linked to Jesus. The more general meaning of the word is translated into Latin as missi≈ç, and from this word we get missionary. The term only occurs once in the Septuagint.Wilhelm Schneemelcher, Robert McLachlan Wilson New Testament Apocrypha: Writings relating to the Apostles- 2003 - 0664227228 Page 7 \\"Unfortunately the adjectival noun ŒëœÄœåœÉœÑŒøŒªŒøœÇ occurs in LXX only in a single passage, and indeed as a translation of the Hebrew shaluach (passive participle of shalach - 1 Kings 14:6).\\" But Walter Bauer in his Greek-English Lexicon of the NT relates the term to the rabbinical idea of a Shaliah, or agent; \\"‚Ä¶Judaism had an office known as apostle (◊©◊ú◊ô◊ó)\\". The Friberg Greek Lexicon gives a broad definition as one who is sent on a mission, a commissioned representative of a congregation, a messenger for God, a person who has the special task of founding and establishing churches. The UBS Greek Dictionary also describes an apostle broadly as a messenger. The Louw-Nida Lexicon gives a very narrow definition of a special messenger, generally restricted to the immediate followers of Jesus, or extended to some others like Paul or other early Christians active in proclaiming the gospel. Christianity Before their sending away, the Twelve had been called disciples, or \\"students\\" (Latin discipulus; Greek ŒºŒ±Œ∏Œ∑œÑŒÆœÇ mathƒìt·∏ós; Hebrew ◊ú÷¥◊û÷º◊ï÷º◊ì limm√ªdh; all meaning \\"one who learns\\").Cassell's Latin Dictionary, Revised by Marchant & Charles Jesus is stated in the Bible to have sent out the Twelve Apostles, \\"whom he also named apostles\\" (), first before his death \\"to the lost sheep of Israel\\" (), and after his resurrection, to spread the message of the Gospel to all nations (). There is also a tradition in the Eastern Churches of \\"Seventy Apostles\\", derived from the seventy-two disciples mentioned in the Gospel of Luke.  Modern day apostle in the apostolic movement  A modern-day Apostle in the tradition of the Apostolic-Prophetic movement is one who is \\"called and sent by Christ to have the spiritual authority, character, gifts and abilities to successfully reach and establish people in Kingdom truth and order, especially through founding and overseeing local churches‚Äù, according to Dr. David Cannistraci. An \\"apostle\\" is one who has a call to plant and oversee churches, has verifiable church plants and spiritual sons in the ministry, who is recognized by other apostles and meets the biblical qualifications of an elder. Latter Day Saint movement In the Latter Day Saint movement, an apostle is a \\"special witness of the name of Jesus Christ who is sent to teach the principles of salvation to others.\\" In many Latter Day Saint churches, an apostle is a priesthood office of high authority within the church hierarchy. As of March 31st, 2018, the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are: M. Russell Ballard, Jeffrey R. Holland, Dieter F. Uchtdorf, David A. Bednar, Quentin L. Cook, D. Todd Christofferson, Neil L. Anderson, Ronald A. Rasband, Gary E. Stevenson, Dale G. Renlund, Gerrit W. Gong, and Ulisses Soares. There are also members of the Quorum of the Seventy (referred to as ‚ÄúSeventies‚Äù). They typically work under the direction of the twelve apostles and are given similar responsibilities that build up the church. In many churches, apostles may be members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of the church. In most Latter Day Saint churches, modern-day apostles are considered to have the same status and authority as the biblical apostles. In the Latter Day Saint tradition, apostles and prophets are believed to be the foundation of the church, with Jesus as the chief cornerstone. The Articles of Faith, written by Joseph Smith, mentions apostles: \\"We believe in the same organization that existed in the Primitive Church, namely, apostles, prophets, pastors, teachers, evangelists, and so forth.\\" Islam In Islam, an apostle or messenger () is a prophet sent by God. According to the Qur'an, God has sent many prophets to mankind. The five universally acknowledged messengers in Islam are Ibrahim, M≈´sa, DƒÅw≈´d, ƒ™sƒÅ and Muhammad,Concise Encyclopedia of Islam, C. Glasse, Messenger as each is believed to have been sent with a scripture.Muslims believe Ibrahim received the Scrolls of Abraham, Musa received the Torah, David in Islam received the Psalms, Jesus the Gospel in Islam and Muhammad received the Qur'an Muslim tradition also maintains that Adam received scrolls as did some of the other patriarchs of the Generations of Adam.A-Z of Prophets in Islam and Judaism, B.M. Wheeler, Apostle The term apostle or messenger is also applied to prophets sent to preach to specific areas; the Qur'an mentions Yunus, Elijah, Ismail, Shuaib and other prophets as being messengers as well. Sahabah refers to the companions, disciples, scribes and family of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. Later scholars accepted their testimony of the words and deeds of Muhammad, the occasions on which the Qur'an was revealed and various important matters of Islamic history and practice. The testimony of the companions, as it was passed down through chains of trusted narrators (isnads), was the basis of the developing Islamic tradition. From the traditions (hadith) of the life of Muhammad and his companions are drawn the Muslim way of life (sunnah), the code of conduct (sharia) it requires and the jurisprudence (fiqh) by which Muslim communities should be regulated. Muslims consider apostles to be messengers or prophets. Islamic teachings emphasise the Quranic verse which exclaims that God sent a messenger to every nation of the world. Thus Muslims recognize many religious figures as messengers or prophets, including Jesus, Abraham, Moses, Noah, Adam as well as all Prophets followed by Christians and Jews.

Steamboat inspection failure Steamboat safety regulations were strict in theory in 1903, but loosely enforced. Following the sinking, in January 1904, of the Clallam, where a variety of safety rules had been violated, the steamboat inspectors swept through the Puget Sound steamboat fleet, fining sixteen vessels, including Florence K $750, a considerable sum then, for various safety deficiencies. The safety deficiencies included inadequate fog horns; rather a steam driven horn, the vessels were using hand-held tin horns driven by a hand-bellows, or a weak manual horn simply blown by mouth, insufficient fire axes and fire buckets, not enough oars in the lifeboats, no plugs in the lifeboat drains, lack of life preserver notices and instructions, no load capacity marked on lifeboats, and boat falls and davits in poor condition.‚ÄúSixteen Vessels Receive Fines‚Äù, Port Townsend Morning Leader, Feb. 17, 1904, col. 2 (accessed 2/24/2008) Inspectors strictly counted the total numbers of persons boarded on each vessel, and gave notice that there would be no more remissions of fines for equipment defects.

It is reported that at some point Florence K was acquired by Kitsap County Transportation Co.. In 1922, one of the crewmen of Florence K was Reed O. Hunt (later chairman of the board of Crown Zellerbach Corporation witnessed from the Florence K the tragic drowning of his cousins, Ward Hunt, who had fallen off a freight boat, the Burro on the east side of Point Defiance. Steam ferry In 1924, Florence K was reconstructed as a ferry, but still under steam power, by A.R. Hunt, one of the Hunt Brothers, and renamed Gloria. A.M. Hunt & Sons, one of the many Hunt family shipping concerns, operated Gloria on the Tacoma ‚Äì Vashon Island ‚Äì Gig Harbor route under lease to Pierce County, Washington. As rebuilt, Gloria could ship 18 automobiles. In 1923 Capt. Harry Crosby, one of the pioneers of the Puget Sound ferry fleet, bought Gloria from A.R. Hunt and renamed the ferry Beeline. Crosby was then engaged in a rate war with the powerful Puget Sound Navigation and Kitsap County Transportation companies. PSN charged $2.00 for one-way and $2.50 round trip for their run from Seattle to Bremerton (called the \\"Navy Yard Route.\\"). The KCTC rerouted their boats to run out to Vashon Island from Fauntleroy rather than Seattle, and reduced their fares to $1.00 each way for car and driver. Cosby reduce rates to 50 cents each way for car and driver. PSN and KCTC then went to the Public Utilities Commission, and were able to force Crosby to raise his rates to 85 cents one way, and $1.50 round trip. In June 1926, the rate war was over and the three ferries of the Crosby concern, including Beeline, had been merged into the PSN, although for a time after the merger the Crosby boats operated under the Crosby name. On December 4, 1926, Beeline was shifted over to the route from Everett to Langley, replacing the ferry Whidby, which was transferred to the run between Mukilteo and Clinton. Capt. Bart Lovejoy was master of the Beeline on the Everett-Langley route. During this time, autobuses picked up passengers and brought them down to Beeline and other ferries. By this time, the steamboat business on Puget Sound was fading rapidly. Joshua Green, an important early founder of the PSN, and later a prominent banker, left the PSN in 1927 because, in his words, \\"the steamboat business was rapidly degenerating into the ferry boat business.\\"Green, Joshua, The Green Years (memoirs), at page 115, as quoted in Kline and Bayless, Ferryboats ‚Äì A Legend on Puget Sound, at page 249.  Last years  In 1937, Beeline was one of the five remaining wooden-hulled vessels of the Puget Sound Mosquito Fleet, the others being Virginia V, Manitou, Sightseer and Arcadia. Line drawings of five vessels were prepared by Phillip F. Spaulding, then an apprentice to naval architect Carl J. Nordstrom. Nordstrom had a contract from the Works Progress Administration to prepare maritime records for the Historic American Register and Building Survey.Kline, Steamboat VIRGINIA V at 90. During World War II Beeline was taken over by the U.S. Navy to run between Hadlock and Indian Island. Just what happened to Beeline after the war is not known, but the vessel was probably scrapped.Evergreenfleet.com (accessed 05-02-11).

The building thus served as a notary seat, and the activities therein were strictly related to those that occurred in the adjacent Palazzo della Ragione, where trials were held. The palace occupies the west side of the rectangular Piazza Mercanti city square. While its original structure dates back to the age of medieval communes, it was largely rebuilt in the 15th century in Gothic style. The facade was designed by Giovanni Solari in 1466 and largely restored in 1899 by Luca Beltrami. A minor restoration occurred in 1967, under the supervision of Antonio Cassi Ramelli. In the floor of the portico, there is a notable relief with the biscione, Milan's emblem under the House of Sforza.

The thirty New Caledonian languages form a branch of the Southern Oceanic languages. They are spoken mainly by the indigenous Kanaks of the islands. The languages present at the time of colonization At the time of colonization, native speakers used their native language to communicate, and, in case of need, they used Bislama, an Anglo- Melanesian language whose lexical basis is essentially English. This language allowed them to communicate with shopkeepers or with the other Melanesian populations. Those native languages have been favoured by some of the missionaries to evangelize the population, the Catholic missionaries preferred the usage of French. Thus, there were three languages used: French, English, and Bislama. In 1853, a decree imposed the teaching of French in every school of the colony, and in 1863, only the teaching of French was allowed because the colonizers did not want the other languages to compete with French.Jacques Leclerc, L‚Äôam√©nagement Linguistique dans le Monde http://www.tlfq.ulaval.ca/axl/pacifique/ncal.htm Present day New Caledonia is constituted of numerous populations, but the vast majority is represented by Kanaks or Europeans. Nowadays, there are about 30 Melanesian languages present, and also other languages peculiar to the immigrant populations (Javanese, Vietnamese, Indonesian, Chinese, Flipino and others). Those populations have immigrated to New Caledonia during the nickel rush. The native languages of New Caledonia are part of the Austronesian family. This family extends from the island of Madagascar, Taiwan, Southeast Asia and covers almost all of the Pacific. Those languages have great differences between them (in grammar, phonetic ).  Native languages  The forty native languages of New Caledonia form two branches of the Southern Oceanic languages, part of the Austronesian family; West Uvean is Polynesian. Their speakers are known as Kanaks. The most important are: Drehu, Nengone, Paic√Æ, Aji√´, and X√¢r√¢c√π√π. The other languages are spoken by a few hundred to couple thousand people and are endangered. Many Kanaks do not know their native languages very well because of the wide usage of French.  French  New Caledonians of French and European descent generally speak French as their native language. Kanaks also speak a variety of French, New Caledonian French, which is characterized by some phonetic particularities and specific grammatical constructions derived from native languages. In the early colonial era, there had been a French pidgin used in New Caledonia as a contact language, especially along the east coast, alongside Bichelamar, and today there is a local French creole known as Tayo that may descend from it. Legal status New Caledonia being a part of French Republic, its official language is French, following the constitutional law 92-554 (June 1992). This law is applicable to every field (justice, tribunals, administration, schools...). At the level of legislation and justice, on some occasions they may have recourse to a Melanesian language (in spoken conversation, for example). A series of decrees and clauses allow the usage of Melanesian languages in education in some cases. The more important law to that purpose is the \\"Loi d‚Äôorientation d‚ÄôOutre-Mer\\" (law 2000-1207, December 2000) which stipulates that we have to respect these native languages which are a part of New Caledonian culture.Isabelle Bril, En Pays Kanaks Education Secondary school is under State authority (as opposed to nursery and primary school, which are under Provincial authority), therefore, the language in application is French. Some schools give optional native languages lessons, but it is still very rare. Nevertheless, four languages are proposed at the baccalaureate: Aji√´, Drehu, Nengone and Paic√Æ. There has been controversy about the educational system, as it has been claimed, that the programs are not adjusted to the population. As a French overseas department New Caledonia is almost exclusively under the administrative control of France at the educative level and the textbooks are tailored to European students. Moreover, French is only a second language for significant minority of New Caledonians. This situation has been described as a major cause for the high rate of illiteracy and academic failure by New Caledonian students. The success rate at the baccalaureate is very low.Isabelle Bril, En Pays Kanak, 282-8 Some have advocated to increase the importance of native languages as a teaching medium in school, while reducing the status French to that of a second language.Isabelle Bril, En Pays Kanak, 286-7 Critics have pointed out, that proposal denies reality as French is the predominant native language among New Caledonian students.

It is found at the heart of the Bronze Age palace of Knossos, one of the main centers of the Minoan civilization and is considered the oldest throne room in Europe... Environment The throne room was unearthed in 1900 by British archaeologist Arthur Evans, during the first phase of his excavations in Knossos.. It was found in the center of the palatial complex and west of the central court. This throne room is considered the oldest stone throne of the Aegean region, indeed the oldest in Europe. The chamber contains an alabaster seat on the north wall, identified by Evans as a \\"throne\\", while two Griffins rest on each side are staring at it. Moreover, on three sides it contains gypsum benches. It was part of a larger suite that also included an anteroom and an inner chamber with a ledge that was possibly a chapel. The throne room was accessed from the anteroom through two double doors. According to Evans's estimates, a total of thirty people could be accommodated both in the throne room and its anteroom. The room received its final form in Late Minoan IIIA period, since it was a latter addition to the palace that occurred during the last phase of occupation after 1450 BC. Purpose One of the two Griffins facing the throne Initially, Evans believed that this area was designed to serve a religious purpose, while he claimed that this was the priest-king's seat and that the presence of the griffins confirmed that this king was somehow beyond mortal realms.. He also identified the stone throne as the seat of the mythical king of Crete, Minos, evidently applied Greek mythology. On the other hand, archaeologists Helga Reusch and Friedriech Matz suggested that the throne room was a sanctuary of a female divinity and that a priestess who sat there was her impersonator.. The stone benches around the walls suggest a sitting council or perhaps a court, while a sunken area, called by Evans a \\"lustral basin\\", partially partitioned off at one side, was used for ritual bathing. In view of the civil and religious powers held by the king, there can be little argument against the notion that proceedings of an official character began with sacred ceremonials.. According to various views, the throne itself may have actually had more religious than political significance, functioning in the re-enactment of epiphany rituals involving a High Priestess, as suggested by the iconography of griffins, palms, and altars in the wall-paintings. More recently, it has been suggested that the room was only used at dawn at certain times of the year for specific ceremonies.. Mycenaean influence Various archaeologists claim that the room and its furniture most likely date to the time of the Mycenaean takeover circa after 1450 BC when political conditions in Crete were entirely different, as indicated by the concurrent appearance of elite tombs, individual burials and the presence of the Mycenaean Greek Linear B script. At that time, the palace at Knossos seems to have been modified in a minor way in order to include features such as the throne room. Especially, the stylized paintings of heraldically opposed griffins were popular in later era Mycenaean wall painting but not seen before in Crete.. For instance, similar wall decoration was also found in the throne room of the Mycenaean palace of Pylos in the Peloponnese.

Pig Point is located in Suffolk, Virginia at the mouth of the Nansemond River near Hampton Roads, Virginia. This location is about from Newport News, Virginia. The engagement occurred before any significant battles, other than the opening Battle of Fort Sumter, had taken place and received some notoriety at the time. The action was essentially inconclusive, but the Confederates repulsed the Union gunboat's attack, and the defenders' gunfire wounded five of its crew. Like other early engagements between Union gunboats and Confederate shore batteries, the battle at Pig Point was an early Civil War military action in connection with the blockade by the Union Navy of the Southern States in general and Chesapeake Bay in particular. Correspondingly, it was part of the effort by Confederate forces to deny the use of rivers in Virginia to Union military and commercial traffic. Background On April 15, 1861, the day after the small U.S. Army garrison surrendered Fort Sumter in the harbor Charleston, South Carolina to Confederate forces, President Abraham Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers to reclaim federal property and to suppress the incipient rebellion of the seven Deep South Slave states. Four Upper South States which also permitted slavery, including Virginia, refused to furnish troops for this purpose and began the process of secession from the Union.Hansen, Harry.

On April 27, 1861, he extended the blockade of the original Confederate States that he had declared on April 19, 1861 to include the ports of Virginia and North Carolina.Long, E. B. and Barbara Long.

Meanwhile, the Confederates established a battery at Pig Point across the Nansemond River from Newport News with guns captured from the Gosport Navy Yard in Norfolk County, Virginia, now part of Portsmouth, Virginia.Lossing, Benson John and William Barritt.

The compound was located at the end of a dirt road 1,300 metres (0.8 mi) southwest of the Pakistan Military Academy in Bilal Town, Abbottabad, Pakistan, a suburb housing many retired military officers. Bin Laden was reported to have evaded capture by living in a section of the house for at least five years, having no Internet or phone connection, and hiding away from the public, who were allegedly unaware of his presence. Completed in 2005, the main buildings in the compound lay on a plot of land, much larger than those of nearby houses. Its perimeter was 3.7- to 5.5-metre (12 to 18 ft) concrete walls topped with barbed wire, and there were two security gates. The compound had very few windows. Little more than five years old, the compound's ramshackle buildings were badly in need of repainting. The grounds contained a well-kept vegetable garden, rabbits, some 100 chickens and a cow. The house itself did not stand out architecturally from others in the neighbourhood, except for its size and exaggerated security measures; for example, the third- floor balcony had a 2-metre (7 ft) privacy wall. Photographs inside the house showed excessive clutter and modest furnishings. After the American mission, there was extensive interest in and reporting about the compound and its design. To date, the Pakistani government has not responded to any allegations as to who had built the structure. After the September 11 attacks in 2001, the U.S. searched for bin Laden for nearly 10 years. By tracking his courier Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti to the compound, U.S. officials surmised that bin Laden was hiding there. During a raid on May 2, 2011, 24 members of the United States Naval Special Warfare Development Group arrived by helicopter, breached a wall using explosives, and entered the compound in search of bin Laden. After the operation was completed and bin Laden was killed, Pakistan demolished the structure in February 2012. Architecture Diagram of the compound. Left photo taken in 2004; right photo taken in 2011 In the urban setting, the architecture of the bin Laden hideout was called by an architect as \\"surprisingly permanent ‚Äì and surprisingly urban\\" and \\"sure to join Saddam Hussein's last known address among the most notorious examples of hideout architecture in recent memory\\". The compound was fortified with many safeguard features intended to confuse would-be invaders, and U.S. officials described the compound as \\"extraordinarily unique\\". Associated Press identified the owner as Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti, who purchased the vacant land for the complex in 2004 and four adjoining lots between 2004 and 2005 for the equivalent of US$48,000. Constructed between 2003 and 2005, the three-story structure was located on a dirt road northeast of the city centre of AbbottƒÅbad. The local architect for the project said it was only built and planned for a two-story structure and that the third floor (where bin Laden lived) was built afterwards in an illegal construction. While the compound was assessed by U.S. officials at a value of 1 million, local real estate agents assess the property value at 250,000.Declan Walsh, Osama bin Laden hideout 'worth far less than US claimed', The Guardian, 4 May 2011. Intelligence reports have indicated that bin Laden may have moved into the complex on 6 January 2006. On a plot of land much larger than those of nearby houses, it was surrounded by concrete walls topped with barbed wire. Apart from its size, it did not stand out from others in the neighborhood and it was not easily seen except from close by. The compound walls were higher than usual in the neighbourhood, although nearly all houses in Bilal Town have barbed wire. There were no phones or Internet wires running into the compound. Security cameras were found installed, and aerial photographs show several satellite dishes. There were two security gates and the third-floor balcony had a two meter (7 ft) privacy wall. The compound measured in size, and had relatively few windows. The compound was known as Waziristan Haveli () by the local residents. The compound's casual name referred to Waziristan, a region in Pakistan, and a haveli, which means \\"mansion\\". It was owned by a transporter from Waziristan; bin Laden previously spent time in the Waziristan area of Pakistan. One of the main builders of the compound, Gul Mohammed, was instructed to construct the high perimeter fence and then to build another wall 2 metres (7 ft) tall around one of the dwellings. He became suspicious and when he asked about the huge, fort-like walls, he was told it was none of his business. According to Mohammed, one or two men came to supervise the project and they were not stingy with funds. He was told to refer to the main occupant of the household as \\"The Master\\" even though he never met him. Furnishings The house where the bin Laden family lived on the two upper floors was large and modestly furnished. It had \\"cheap foam mattresses, no air conditioning (but central heating) and old televisions.\\" Several of the bedrooms had an attached kitchen and a bathroom. One of the first floor rooms was furnished with a whiteboard, markers and textbooks, to serve as a classroom for the children in the house, who were home-schooled in Arabic. Food The self-described brothers of the house known to the neighbours would frequently visit the local shops. They would buy enough food to feed ten people, and purchased \\"the best brands‚ÄîNestle milk, the good-quality soaps and shampoos\\", Pepsi and Coca-Cola. The food found at the house by the Pakistani authorities was basic, such as dates, nuts, eggs, olive oil and dried meat. The brothers would visit Rasheed's corner store, about a minute's walk from the house, with young children for whom they bought sweets and soft drinks. They also purchased bread from a local bakery. Rabbits, 100 chickens and a cow were reared on the compound grounds. A vegetable garden at the back of the house was well-kept, and Shamraiz, a neighbouring farmer, was paid to plant vegetables about twice a year. Days before the May 2011 raid Shamraiz was called to plough additional ground in the compound using a tractor. He never went inside the house itself. The compound had an adjacent grazing area that hosted cows and a buffalo as well as a deep water well, possibly allowing it a water supply separate from the local municipality. There was a small garden on the north side of the house that included poplar trees.Behind High Walls, Model Neighbors Were Harboring a Fugitive A farmer's field growing cabbages and potatoes surrounded the compound on three sides, and wild Cannabis plants grew up to the side of the compound. History View of the compound, looking north from the south side of a wall turning slightly northeast. Another view of the compound Gulf News reported that it had previously been used as a safe house by Inter- Services Intelligence, but was no longer being used for this purpose. ISI alleged that this compound was raided in 2003 while under construction as Abu Faraj al-Libbi was suspected of living there. However, this account was disputed by American officials who said that satellite photos show that in 2004 the site was an empty field. The compound was believed to be built around the summer of 2005 to late 2006, based on local accounts, most likely completed in late 2005 as intelligence reports indicate Bin Laden may have moved into the house on 6 January 2006. American intelligence officials discovered bin Laden's whereabouts by tracking one of his couriers, Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti. Information was collected from Guant√°namo Bay detainees who gave intelligence officers al-Kuwaiti's pseudonym and said that he was a prot√©g√© of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. In 2007, U.S. officials discovered the courier's real name, and, in 2009, that he lived in AbbottƒÅbad. Using satellite photos and intelligence reports, the CIA surveilled the inhabitants of the compound. In September, the CIA concluded that the compound was \\"custom built to hide someone of significance\\" and that it was very likely that bin Laden was residing there. Officials surmised that he was living there with his youngest wife. U.S. Intelligence estimates that bin Laden lived in the compound for five or six years. Bin Laden's wife confirmed to the Pakistani authorities that they had lived in the compound for five years. Prior to moving to the compound, they lived in the village of Chak Shah Muhammad, in the nearby Haripur District, for nearly two and a half years.  Operation Neptune Spear  Osama bin Laden was killed in Waziristan Haveli on 2 May 2011, shortly after 1AM local time, by a United States special forces military unit. * * * Martin, David, CBS Evening News, 3 May 2011. * Katie Couric, CBS Evening News, 2 May 2011. Encounters between the SEALs and the residents took place in the guest house, in the main building on the first floor where two adult males lived, and on the second and third floors where bin Laden lived with his family. * * * * * * * The operation, code-named Operation Neptune Spear, was ordered by United States President Barack Obama and carried out in a U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) operation by a team of United States Navy SEALs from the United States Naval Special Warfare Development Group (informally known as DEVGRU or by its former name SEAL Team Six) of the Joint Special Operations Command in conjunction with CIA operatives. The raid on the compound was launched from Afghanistan. After the raid, U.S. forces took bin Laden's body to Afghanistan for identification, then buried it at sea within 24 hours of his death. After the event Following the raid, the former hideout was placed under the security control of the Pakistan Police. Days after the raid, police allowed reporters and locals to approach the walls of the compound, but kept the doors sealed shut. There was intense media interest in the architecture of the compound. The construction included highly fortified walls made of concrete blocks with three gates, separating the building from the large courtyard and a garden planted with immature fruit trees in front of a collapsed wall. Pakistan security agencies demolished the compound in February 2012 to prevent it from becoming a \\"sacred building for jihadis\\". In February 2013, Pakistan announced plans to build a R265 million ($2.7m) amusement park in the area, including the property of the former hideout. =Local residents= Locals disclosed details about their interactions with the residents of the compound to an AP journalist in Pakistan. A woman who distributed polio vaccines to the compound said she saw expensive SUVs parked inside. The men received the vaccine and instructed her to leave. A woman in her 70s said one of the men from the hideaway gave her a ride to the market in rainy weather. Her grandchildren played with the children living in the house, and received rabbits as presents. One farmer said, \\"People were skeptical in this neighbourhood about this place and these guys. They used to gossip, say they were smugglers or drug dealers. People would complain that even with such a big house they didn't invite the poor or distribute charity.\\" Present at some neighbourhood funerals, two men from the compound were \\"tall, fair skinned and bearded\\" and self-identified as cousins from elsewhere in the region. Neighbors said that if a child's ball went over the fence, the men in the compound did not return that ball; instead they paid the child 100‚Äì150 Pakistani rupees (about US$0.60‚Äì$0.90), many times the value of the ball.

While traditional business incubators are often government-funded, generally take no equity, and focus on biotech, financial technology (FinTech), medical technology (MedTech), clean tech or product-centric companies, accelerators can be either privately or publicly funded and focus on a wide range of industries. Unlike business incubators, the application process for seed accelerators is open to anyone, but highly competitive. There are specific types of seed accelerators, such as corporate accelerators, which are often subsidiaries or programs of larger corporations that act like seed accelerators. Distinctive qualities The main differences between business incubators and accelerators are: # The application process is open to anyone, but highly competitive. Y Combinator and TechStars have application acceptance rates between 1% and 3%. # A seed investment in the startups is usually made, in exchange for equity. Typically, the investment is between and (or and in Europe) # The focus is on small teams, not on individual founders. Accelerators generally consider that one person is insufficient to handle all the work associated with a startup. # The startups must \\"graduate\\" by a given deadline, typically after 3 months. During this time, they receive intensive mentoring and training, and they are expected to iterate rapidly. Virtually all accelerators end their programs with a \\"Demo Day\\", where the startups present to investors. # Startups are accepted and supported in cohort batches or classes (the accelerator isn't an on-demand resource). The peer support and feedback that the classes provide is an important advantage. If the accelerator doesn't offer a common workspace, the teams will meet periodically. The primary value to the entrepreneur is derived from the mentoring, connections, and the recognition of being chosen to be a part of the accelerator. The business model is based on generating venture style returns, not rent, or fees for services. Seed accelerators do not necessarily need to include a physical space, but many do. The process that startups go through in the accelerator can be separated into five distinct phases: awareness, application, program, demo day, and post demo day. History The first seed accelerator was Y Combinator, started in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 2005, and then later moved to Silicon Valley by Paul Graham. It was followed by TechStars (in 2006), Seedcamp (in 2007), Startupbootcamp (in 2010), Tech Wildcatters (in 2011), several accelerators of SOSV, and Boomtown Boulder (2014). In Europe, the first accelerator program was started by Accelerace in 2009 in Denmark (strongly subsidised by the Danish government) followed shortly after by Startup Wise Guys in 2012 in Estonia. With the growing popularity of seed accelerator programs in the US, Europe has seen an increase in accelerators to support a growing startup ecosystem. Top- rated seed accelerator programs in Europe include Seedcamp (based in London) and Startupbootcamp (pan European accelerator with program locations and office spaces based in Copenhagen, Amsterdam, Berlin, Israel, Eindhoven, Istanbul and London) and Startup Wise Guys (Europe's most experienced B2B startup accelerator). Forbes published an analysis of startup accelerators in April 2012. Since 2010 there has been substantial growth of Corporate Accelerator programs, which are sponsored by established organizations but follow similar principles. In 2011 Matthew Clifford and Alice Bentinck, formerly management consultants at McKinsey & Company, co-founded Entrepreneur First, a London-based accelerator which guides promising tech graduates and those already working in technology firms to design and run their own startups. Entrepreneur First differs from other accelerators such as Y Combinator and Wayra in that it works with individuals rather than companies.

His resignation was effective September 14, 2018 (the last day he can file his paperwork to officially enter the mayoral race).

Since becoming mayor, Stewart has supported the Moderate Income Rental Housing Pilot Project (MIRHPP), which allows developers of secured market rental housing to add more units to their developments than the current zoning would allow as long as 20 percent of the units are permanently reserved for moderate income households. In August 2019, the federal Minister of Families, Children and Social Development, Jean-Yves Duclos, and Stewart announced a partnership where the federal government would provide $184million in low-interest loans and grants to fund the construction of 1,100 units of affordable housing on City-owned land.

Major landmarks are Badi Masjid popularly known as Tabligi Jamat Mosque (Nizam‚Äôs era), Glory Cinema Talkies (1935; earlier known as Zia and Sham Talkies), SBH Branch (1973) and Housing Board Colony (1956). History Mallepally was built by fifth Asafjahi ruler ‚Äì Afzal Ud Daula next to the Afzal Sagar tank which was one of the largest tank. Many people from Mallepally emigrated from India to the western countries. In the early 19th century, Malay people used to stay at this place and that‚Äôs how the area got its name. In the early 20th century, Hyderabad faced much flooding by the Musi River and subsequently led to a plague which reduced the population. Nizam Osman Ali Khan Asaf Jah VII, who had just come to occupy the throne, conferred with his ministers and city planners to come up with comprehensive plans to improve sanitation and hygiene of the city. Transport Mallepally is connected by buses run by TSRTC. The closest MMTS train station is at Nampally is about 2 KM away.  Business  Mallepally is a market for all those who would love to wander the lanes of an old Hyderabad, giving you the touch of memories of famous Urdu writers and poets. Many residents from Mallepally worked in the Persian Gulf area and returned with their earnings. This phenomenon has brought a variety of cultures to the neighborhood.

How Kaggle competitions work # The competition host prepares the data and a description of the problem. # Participants experiment with different techniques and compete against each other to produce the best models. Work is shared publicly through Kaggle Kernels to achieve a better benchmark and to inspire new ideas. Submissions can be made through Kaggle Kernels, through manual upload or using the Kaggle API. For most competitions, submissions are scored immediately (based on their predictive accuracy relative to a hidden solution file) and summarized on a live leaderboard. # After the deadline passes, the competition host pays the prize money in exchange for \\"a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable and royalty-free license [...] to use the winning Entry\\", i.e. the algorithm, software and related intellectual property developed, which is \\"non-exclusive unless otherwise specified\\". Alongside its public competitions, Kaggle also offers private competitions limited to Kaggle's top participants. Kaggle offers a free tool for data science teachers to run academic machine learning competitions, Kaggle In Class. Kaggle also hosts recruiting competitions in which data scientists compete for a chance to interview at leading data science companies like Facebook, Winton Capital, and Walmart. Impact of Kaggle competitions Kaggle has run hundreds of machine learning competitions since the company was founded. Competitions have ranged from improving gesture recognition for Microsoft Kinect to improving the search for the Higgs boson at CERN. Competitions have resulted in many successful projects including furthering the state of the art in HIV research, chess ratings and traffic forecasting. Most famously, Geoffrey Hinton and George Dahl used deep neural networks to win a competition hosted by Merck. And Vlad Mnih (one of Hinton's students) used deep neural networks to win a competition hosted by Adzuna. This helped show the power of deep neural networks and resulted in the technique being taken up by others in the Kaggle community. Tianqi Chen from the University of Washington also used Kaggle to show the power of XGBoost, which has since taken over from Random Forest as one of the main methods used to win Kaggle competitions. Several academic papers have been published on the basis of findings made in Kaggle competitions. A key to this is the effect of the live leaderboard, which encourages participants to continue innovating beyond existing best practice. The winning methods are frequently written up on the Kaggle blog, No Free Hunch.

It was a handy dog that was used to work the meat market in Smithfield, London. It is a dog standing from and has a shaggy appearance. Very little has been documented about this breed, and although it is not a recognised pure breed in the Australian National Kennel Council, it is shown at the Campbell Town Show in Tasmania. Many older farmers still own the breed, as well as some breeders who want to keep the original lines going and maintain effort in the future of the breed.John Chandler, The \\"Smithfield\\" Dog  Appearance  The Smithfield is different in appearance from the Australian Stumpy Tail Cattle Dog. They are sometimes referred to as 'the British Smithfield'. The coat of the Smithfield grows long, coarse and shaggy in nature. As this dog was originally found in England, and was a street dog, this is consistent with staying warm.  Personality  The Smithfield displays characteristics which are friendly, patient, and good with children. However, they are a working breed and require exercise to satisfy this and ensure a relaxed demeanor at home. Chasing a ball, learning tricks, catching a Frisbee will all satisfy a Smithfield which is not being actively used as a herding dog. At home, and as long as they receive an outing and some exercise each day, they will enjoy being with the family and will be happy to lounge around and alert the family to visitors with a friendly bark. thumb References tv See also *Bob the Railway Dog Category:Extinct dog breeds Category:Herding dogs Category:Dog breeds originating in England ","title":"Smithfield (dog)"},{"id":"31663660","text":"The Piesau is a right tributary of the river Lichte in Thuringia, Germany. It is approximately long. The name is derived from the municipality of Piesau.  Sources  The Piesau has its source close to the Rennsteig south of the municipality of Piesau in the Thuringian Highland.  Course  The Piesau rises as the Piesau Kieselbach and flows through the Thuringian Forest Nature Park, first from the Rennsteig, to the municipality of Piesau. Then it merges with the B√§renbach, becoming the Piesau River, and flows north to the district Bock-und-Teich of the municipality of Lichte, the so-called Piesauknie. The Piesau then flows alongside the street Saalfelder Strasse in parallel to B 281. In Wallendorf, close to the Lichte East railway station, it flows under the rail viaduct over the Piesau Valley. In the centre of Lichte (in the Wallendorf district) the Piesau joins the Lichte.  Name  According to old written traditions, the original name of the river was Schmiedebach. This referred to the lower reaches, in the area of Bock-und-Teich of the municipality of Lichte. The present-day name of the river appears only after the foundation of the municipality of Piesau in 1627, derived from the name of the founder, Pisa.Johann G.

He is the brother of Saint Peter. He is referred to in the Orthodox tradition as the First-Called (, Pr≈çtoklƒìtos). According to Orthodox tradition, the apostolic successor to Saint Andrew is the Patriarch of Constantinople. Life The Calling of Saints Peter and Andrew by Caravaggio (1603-1606) Crucifixion of Saint Andrew, by Juan Correa de Vivar (1540‚Äì1545) The name \\"Andrew\\" (Greek: manly, brave, from ·ºÄŒΩŒ¥œÅŒµŒØŒ±, Andreia, \\"manhood, valour\\"), like other Greek names, appears to have been common among the Jews and other Hellenized people of Judea. No Hebrew or Aramaic name is recorded for him. Andrew the Apostle was born between AD 5 and AD 10 in Bethsaida, in Galilee. The New Testament states that Andrew was the brother of Simon Peter,Butler, Alban. The Lives of the Fathers, Martyrs and Other Principal Saints, Vol. III and likewise a son of John, or Jonah. He was born in the village of Bethsaida on the Sea of Galilee. \\"The first striking characteristic of Andrew is his name: it is not Hebrew, as might have been expected, but Greek, indicative of a certain cultural openness in his family that cannot be ignored. We are in Galilee, where the Greek language and culture are quite present.\\"Pope Benedict XVI. \\"Andrew the Protoclete\\", General Audience, June 14, 2006, Libreria Editrice Vaticana Both he and his brother Peter were fishermen by trade, hence the tradition that Jesus called them to be his disciples by saying that he will make them \\"fishers of men\\" (Greek: , halieis anthr≈çp≈çn).Metzger & Coogan (1993) Oxford Companion to the Bible, p 27. At the beginning of Jesus' public life, they were said to have occupied the same house at Capernaum. In the Gospel of Matthew () and in the Gospel of Mark () Simon Peter and Andrew were both called together to become disciples of Jesus and \\"fishers of men\\". These narratives record that Jesus was walking along the shore of the Sea of Galilee, observed Simon and Andrew fishing, and called them to discipleship. In the parallel incident in the Gospel of Luke () Andrew is not named, nor is reference made to Simon having a brother. In this narrative, Jesus initially used a boat, solely described as being Simon's, as a platform for preaching to the multitudes on the shore and then as a means to achieving a huge trawl of fish on a night which had hitherto proved fruitless. The narrative indicates that Simon was not the only fisherman in the boat (they signalled to their partners in the other boat ‚Ä¶ ()) but it is not until the next chapter () that Andrew is named as Simon's brother. However, it is generally understood that Andrew was fishing with Simon on the night in question. Matthew Poole, in his Annotations on the Holy Bible, stressed that 'Luke denies not that Andrew was there'.Matthew Poole's Commentary on Luke 5, accessed 19 February 2017 In contrast, the Gospel of John () states that Andrew was a disciple of John the Baptist, whose testimony first led him, and another unnamed disciple of John the Baptist, to follow Jesus. Andrew at once recognized Jesus as the Messiah, and hastened to introduce him to his brother. The Byzantine Church honours him with the name Protokletos, which means \\"the first called\\". Thenceforth, the two brothers were disciples of Christ. On a subsequent occasion, prior to the final call to the apostolate, they were called to a closer companionship, and then they left all things to follow Jesus. Subsequently, in the gospels, Andrew is referred to as being present on some important occasions as one of the disciples more closely attached to Jesus.; , ; but in Acts of the Apostles there is only one mention of him. Andrew told Jesus about the boy with the loaves and fishes (), and when Philip wanted to tell Jesus about certain Greeks seeking Him, he told Andrew first (). Andrew was present at the Last Supper. Andrew was one of the four disciples who came to Jesus on the Mount of Olives to ask about the signs of Jesus' return at the \\"end of the age\\".) Eusebius in his Church History 3.1 quoted Origen as saying that Andrew preached in Scythia. The Chronicle of Nestor adds that he preached along the Black Sea and the Dnieper river as far as Kiev, and from there he travelled to Novgorod. Hence, he became a patron saint of Ukraine, Romania and Russia. According to Hippolytus of Rome, Andrew preached in Thrace, and his presence in Byzantium is mentioned in the apocryphal Acts of Andrew. According to tradition, he founded the See of Byzantium (later Constantinople and Istanbul) in AD 38, installing Stachys as bishop. This diocese would later develop into the Patriarchate of Constantinople. Andrew, along with Saint Stachys, is recognized as the patron saint of the Patriarchate. Basil of Seleucia also knew of Apostle Andrew's missions in Thrace, Scythia and Achaea.Ferguson, Everett. Encyclopedia of early Christianity, p. 51. Andrew is said to have been martyred by crucifixion at the city of Patras (Patr√¶) in Achaea, in AD 60. Early texts, such as the Acts of Andrew known to Gregory of Tours,In Monumenta Germaniae Historica II, cols. 821‚Äì847, translated in M.R. James, The Apocryphal New Testament (Oxford) reprinted 1963:369. describe Andrew as bound, not nailed, to a Latin cross of the kind on which Jesus is said to have been crucified; yet a tradition developed that Andrew had been crucified on a cross of the form called crux decussata (X-shaped cross, or \\"saltire\\"), now commonly known as a \\"Saint Andrew's Cross\\" ‚Äî supposedly at his own request, as he deemed himself unworthy to be crucified on the same type of cross as Jesus had been.The legends surrounding Andrew are discussed in F. Dvornik, \\"The Idea of Apostolicity in Byzantium and the Legend of the Apostle Andrew\\", Dumbarton Oaks Studies, IV (Cambridge) 1958. The iconography of the martyrdom of Andrew ‚Äî showing him bound to an X-shaped cross ‚Äî does not appear to have been standardized until the later Middle Ages.Judith Calvert, \\"The Iconography of the St. Andrew Auckland Cross\\", The Art Bulletin 66.4 (December 1984:543‚Äì555) p. 545, note 12; according to Louis R√©au, Iconographie de l'art chr√©tien III.1 (Paris) 1958:79, St. Andrew's Cross appeared for the first time in the tenth century, but did not become an iconographic standard before the seventeenth. Calvert was unable to find a sculptural representation of Andrew on the saltire cross earlier than an architectural capital from Quercy, of the early twelfth century. The Acts of Andrew Martyrdom of Saint Andrew in the Nuremberg Chronicle The apocryphal Acts of Andrew, mentioned by Eusebius, Epiphanius and others, is among a disparate group of Acts of the Apostles that were traditionally attributed to Leucius Charinus. \\"These Acts (...) belong to the third century: ca. A.D. 260,\\" in the opinion of M. R. James, who edited them in 1924. The Acts, as well as a Gospel of St Andrew, appear among rejected books in the Decretum Gelasianum connected with the name of Pope Gelasius I. The Acts of Andrew was edited and published by Constantin von Tischendorf in the Acta Apostolorum apocrypha (Leipzig, 1821), putting it for the first time into the hands of a critical professional readership. Another version of the Andrew legend is found in the Passio Andreae, published by Max Bonnet (Supplementum II Codicis apocryphi, Paris, 1895). Relics Saint Andrew of Patras cathedral, where Saint Andrew's relics are kept Statue of Andrew in the Archbasilica of St. John Lateran by Camillo Rusconi (1713-1715) Relics of the Apostle Andrew are kept at the Basilica of Saint Andrew in Patras, Greece; in Amalfi Cathedral (the Duomo di Sant'Andrea), Amalfi and in Sarzana Cathedralhttp://www.cattedraledisarzana.it/main.php?m=4&s;=200&l;= in Sarzana, Italy; St Mary's Roman Catholic Cathedral, Edinburgh, Scotland; and the Church of St Andrew and St Albert, Warsaw, Poland. There are also numerous smaller reliquaries throughout the world. Andrew's remains were preserved at Patras. According to one legend, Saint Regulus (Rule), a monk at Patras, was advised in a dream to hide some of the bones. Shortly thereafter, most of the relics were translated from Patras to Constantinople by order of the Roman emperor Constantius II around 357 and deposited in the Church of the Holy Apostles. Regulus was said to have had a second dream in which an angel advised him to take the hidden relics \\"to the ends of the earth\\" for protection. Wherever he was shipwrecked, he was to build a shrine for them. St. Rule set sail, taking with him a kneecap, an upper arm bone, three fingers and a tooth. He sailed west, towards the edge of the known world, and was shipwrecked on the coast of Fife, Scotland. However, the relics were probably brought to Britain in 597 as part of the Augustine Mission, and then in 732 to Fife, by Bishop Acca of Hexham, a well-known collector of religious relics. The skull of Saint Andrew, which had been taken to Constantinople, was returned to Patras by Emperor Basil I, who ruled from 867 to 886.Christodoulou, Alexandros. \\"St. Andrew, Christ‚Äôs First-Called Disciple\\", Pemptousia In 1208, following the sack of Constantinople, those relics of Saint Andrew and Saint Peter which remained in the imperial city were taken to Amalfi, Italy, by Cardinal Peter of Capua, a native of Amalfi. A cathedral (Duomo), was built, dedicated to Saint Andrew (as is the town itself), to house a tomb in its crypt where it is maintained that most of the relics of the apostle, including an occipital bone, remain. Thomas Palaeologus was the youngest surviving son of Byzantine Emperor Manuel II Palaiologos. Thomas ruled the province of Morea, the medieval name for the Peloponnese. In 1461, when the Ottomans crossed the Strait of Corinth, Palaeologus fled Patras for exile in Italy, bringing with him what was purported to be the skull of Saint Andrew. He gave the head to Pope Pius II, who had it enshrined in one of the four central piers of St. Peter's Basilica in the Vatican and then in Pienza, Italy. In September 1964, Pope Paul VI, as a gesture of goodwill toward the Greek Orthodox Church, ordered that all of the relics of Saint Andrew that were in Vatican City be sent back to Patras. Cardinal Augustin Bea along with many other cardinals presented the skull to Bishop Constantine of Patras on 24 September 1964. The cross of Saint Andrew was taken from Greece during the Crusades by the Duke of Burgundy.Charlotte Deno√´l. Saint Andr√©: culte et iconographie en France (Ve -XVe si√®cles). Paris : √âcole nationale des chartes, 2004 It was kept in the church of St. Victor in Marseilles until it returned to Patras on 19 January 1980. The cross of the apostle was presented to the Bishop of Patras Nicodemus by a Catholic delegation led by Cardinal Roger Etchegaray. All the relics, which consist of the small finger, the skull (part of the top of the cranium of Saint Andrew), and the cross on which he was martyred, have been kept in the Church of St. Andrew at Patras in a special shrine and are revered in a special ceremony every 30 November, his feast day. In 2006, the Catholic Church, again through Cardinal Etchegaray, gave the Greek Orthodox Church another relic of Saint Andrew.Relic of St. Andrew Given to Greek Orthodox Church.

Traditions and legends= Georgia  A 13th-century fresco depicting Saint Andrew, from Kintsvisi Monastery, Georgia The church tradition of Georgia regards Saint Andrew as the first preacher of Christianity in the territory of Georgia and as the founder of the Georgian church. This tradition was apparently derived from the Byzantine sources, particularly Nicetas of Paphlagonia (died c. 890) who asserts that \\"Andrew preached to the Iberians, Sauromatians, Taurians, and Scythians and to every region and city, on the Black Sea, both north and south.\\"Peterson, Peter Megill (1958), Andrew, Brother of Simon Peter: His History and Legends, p. 20. E. J. Brill The version was adopted by the 10th‚Äì11th-century Georgian ecclesiastics and, refurbished with more details, was inserted in the Georgian Chronicles. The story of Saint Andrew's mission in the Georgian lands endowed the Georgian church with apostolic origin and served as a defence argument to George the Hagiorite against the encroachments from the Antiochian church authorities on autocephaly of the Georgian church. Another Georgian monk, Ephraim the Minor, produced a thesis, reconciling Saint Andrew's story with an earlier evidence of the 4th-century conversion of Georgians by Saint Nino and explaining the necessity of the \\"second Christening\\" by Nino. The thesis was made canonical by the Georgian church council in 1103.Rapp, Stephen H. (2003), Studies in Medieval Georgian Historiography: Early Texts And Eurasian Contexts, p. 433. Peeters Publishers, Djobadze, Wachtang Z., \\"Materials for the Study of Georgian Monasteries in the Western Environs of Antioch on the Orontes\\", pp. 82‚Äì83. Corpus Scriptorum Christianorum Orientalium, vol. 372, subsidia 48. Louvain, 1976. The Georgian Orthodox Church marks two feast days in honour of Saint Andrew, on 12 May and 13 December. The former date, dedicated to Saint Andrew's arrival in Georgia, is a public holiday in Georgia. Cyprus Cypriot tradition holds that a ship which was transporting Saint Andrew went off course and ran aground. Upon coming ashore, Andrew struck the rocks with his staff at which point a spring of healing waters gushed forth. Using it, the sight of the ship's captain, who had been blind in one eye, was restored. Thereafter, the site became a place of pilgrimage and a fortified monastery stood there in the 12th century, from which Isaac Comnenus negotiated his surrender to Richard the Lionheart. In the 15th century, a small chapel was built close to the shore. The main monastery of the current church dates to the 18th century. Other pilgrimages are more recent. The story is told that in 1895, the son of a Maria Georgiou was kidnapped. Seventeen years later, Saint Andrew appeared to her in a dream, telling her to pray for her son's return at the monastery. Living in Anatolia, she embarked on the crossing to Cyprus on a very crowded boat. As she was telling her story during the journey, one of the passengers, a young Dervish priest, became more and more interested. Asking if her son had any distinguishing marks, he stripped off his clothes to reveal the same marks and mother and son were thus reunited. Apostolos Andreas Monastery () is a monastery dedicated to Saint Andrew situated just south of Cape Apostolos Andreas, which is the north-easternmost point of the island of Cyprus, in Rizokarpaso in the Karpass Peninsula. The monastery is an important site to the Cypriot Orthodox Church. It was once known as 'the Lourdes of Cyprus', served not by an organized community of monks but by a changing group of volunteer priests and laymen. Both Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities consider the monastery a holy place. As such, it is visited by many people for votive prayers. Malta Fifth-century mosaic of Saint Andrew at St. Paul Outside the Walls, Rome The first reference regards the small chapel at Luqa dedicated to Andrew dates to 1497. This chapel contained three altars, one of them dedicated to Andrew. The painting showing Mary with Saints Andrew and Paul was painted by the Maltese artist Filippo Dingli. At one time, many fishermen lived in the village of Luqa, and this may be the main reason for choosing Andrew as patron saint. The statue of Andrew was sculpted in wood by Giuseppe Scolaro in 1779. This statue underwent several restoration works including that of 1913 performed by the Maltese artist Abraham Gatt. The Martyrdom of Saint Andrew on the main altar of the church was painted by Mattia Preti in 1687. Romania Entrance to Saint Andrew's caves near Ion Corvin, Constan»õa County The official stance of the Romanian Orthodox Church is that Andrew preached the Gospel in the province of Dobruja (Scythia Minor) to the Daco-Romans, whom he is said to have converted to Christianity. Such a tradition was however not widely acknowledged until the 20th century. According to Hippolyte of Antioch, (died c. 250 C.E.) in his On Apostles, Origen in the third book of his Commentaries on the Genesis (254 C.E.), Eusebius of Caesarea in his Church History (340 C.E.), and other sources, such as Usaard's Martyrdom written between 845‚Äì865, and Jacobus de Voragine's Golden Legend (c. 1260), Saint Andrew preached in Scythia, a possible reference to Scythia Minor, whose territory was integrated into Romania in the late 19th century. According to some modern Romanian scholars, the idea of early Christianisation is unsustainable. They take the idea to be a part of an ideology of protochronism which purports that the Orthodox Church has been a companion and defender of the Romanian people for its entire history, which was then used for propaganda purposes during the communist era,Stan, Lavinia and Turcescu, Lucian. Religion and Politics in Post- Communist Romania, Oxford University Press, 2007, p.48 although this is disputed.  East Slavs  Saint Andrew's prophecy of Kiev depicted in Radzivill Chronicle. Tradition regarding the early Christian history of Ukraine holds that the apostle Andrew preached on the southern borders of modern-day Ukraine, along the Black Sea. Legend has it that he travelled up the Dnieper River and reached the future location of Kiev, where he erected a cross on the site where the Saint Andrew's Church of Kiev currently stands, and where he prophesied the foundation of a great Christian city.Lytvynchuk, Janna. St. Andrew's Church, p. 7, Kiev: Anateya, 2006, Because of this connection to Kiev, Saint Andrew is considered to be the patron saint of the two East Slavic nations descended from the Kievan Rus: Ukraine and Russia, the latter country using the Saint Andrew's Cross on its naval ensign. The third East Slavic nation, Belarus, however, reveres Euphrosyne of Polotsk, a local saint, as its patron instead. Scotland The Saltire (or \\"Saint Andrew's Cross\\") is the national flag of Scotland Several legends state that the relics of Andrew were brought by divine guidance from Constantinople to the place where the modern Scottish town of St Andrews stands today (Gaelic, Cill R√¨mhinn). The oldest surviving manuscripts are two: one is among the manuscripts collected by Jean-Baptiste Colbert and willed to Louis XIV of France, now in the Biblioth√®que Nationale, Paris; the other is the Harleian Mss in the British Library, London. They state that the relics of Andrew were brought by one Regulus to the Pictish king √ìengus mac Fergusa (729‚Äì761). The only historical Regulus (Riagail or Rule) whose name is preserved in the tower of St Rule was an Irish monk expelled from Ireland with Saint Columba; his dates, however, are c. 573 ‚Äì 600. There are good reasons for supposing that the relics were originally in the collection of Acca, bishop of Hexham, who took them into Pictish country when he was driven from Hexham (c. 732), and founded a see, not, according to tradition, in Galloway, but on the site of St Andrews. Saint Andrew, carving c.1500 in the National Museum of Scotland According legendary accounts given in 16th-century historiography, √ìengus II in AD 832 led an army of Picts and Scots into battle against the Angles, led by √Üthelstan, near modern-day Athelstaneford, East Lothian. The legend states that he was heavily outnumbered and hence whilst engaged in prayer on the eve of battle, √ìengus vowed that if granted victory he would appoint Saint Andrew as the Patron Saint of Scotland. On the morning of battle white clouds forming an X shape in the sky were said to have appeared. √ìengus and his combined force, emboldened by this apparent divine intervention, took to the field and despite being inferior in numbers were victorious. Having interpreted the cloud phenomenon as representing the crux decussata upon which Saint Andrew was crucified, √ìengus honoured his pre-battle pledge and duly appointed Saint Andrew as the Patron Saint of Scotland. The white saltire set against a celestial blue background is said to have been adopted as the design of the flag of Scotland on the basis of this legend. However, there is evidence that Andrew was venerated in Scotland before this. Traditional stone fireplace in northern England. The carved Saint Andrew's cross in the left hand wooden post was to prevent witches from flying down the chimney, Ryedale Folk Museum, Hutton-le-Hole. Andrew's connection with Scotland may have been reinforced following the Synod of Whitby, when the Celtic Church felt that Columba had been \\"outranked\\" by Peter and that Peter's brother would make a higher ranking patron. The 1320 Declaration of Arbroath cites Scotland's conversion to Christianity by Andrew, \\"the first to be an Apostle\\". Numerous parish churches in the Church of Scotland and congregations of other Christian churches in Scotland are named after Andrew. The national church of the Scottish people in Rome, Sant'Andrea degli Scozzesi is dedicated to Saint Andrew. A local superstition uses the cross of Saint Andrew as a hex sign on the fireplaces in northern England and Scotland to prevent witches from flying down the chimney and entering the house to do mischief. By placing the Saint Andrew's cross on one of the fireplace posts or lintels, witches are prevented from entering through this opening. In this case, it is similar to the use of a witch ball, although the cross will actively prevent witches from entering, and the witch ball will passively delay or entice the witch, and perhaps entrap it. Spain A form of St. Andrew's cross called the Cross of Bourgogne was used as the flag of the Duchy of Burgundy, and after the Duchy was acquired by Spain, by the Spanish Crown, and later as a Spanish naval flag and finally as an army battle flag up until 1843. Today, it is still a part of various Spanish military insignia and makes part of the Coat of Arms of the king of Spain as it did with General Franco. Monument to Andrey Pervozvanniy in Kyiv, Ukraine. The sculptors were Boris Krylov and Oles Sydoruk. In Spain, Saint Andrew is the patron of several locations: San Andr√©s (Santa Cruz de Tenerife), San Andr√©s y Sauces (La Palma), Navalmoral de la Mata (C√°ceres), √âibar (Guip√∫zcoa), Baeza (Ja√©n), Pobladura de Pelayo Garc√≠a and Pobladura de Yuso (Le√≥n), Berlangas de Roa (Burgos), Lig√ºerzana (Palencia), Castillo de Bayuela (Toledo), Almorad√≠ (Alicante), Estella (Navarra), San Andr√©s de Palomar, (Barcelona), Pujalt (Catalonia), Adamuz (C√≥rdoba) and in Cameros (La Rioja). Legacy Saint Andrew the Apostle by Yoan from Gabrovo, 19th century Andrew is the patron saint of several countries and cities including: Barbados, Romania, Russia, Scotland, Ukraine, Sarzana,http://www.cattedraledisarzana.it/main.php?m=4&s;=200&l;= Pienza and Amalfi in Italy, Esgueira in Portugal, Luqa in Malta, Para√±aque in the Philippines and Patras in Greece. He was also the patron saint of Prussia and of the Order of the Golden Fleece. He is considered the founder and the first bishop of the Church of Byzantium and is consequently the patron saint of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. The flag of Scotland (and consequently the Union Flag and those of some of the former colonies of the British Empire) feature Saint Andrew's saltire cross. The saltire is also the flag of Tenerife, the former flag of Galicia and the Russian Navy Ensign. The Confederate flag also features a saltire commonly referred to as a St Andrew's cross, although its designer, William Porcher Miles, said he changed it from an upright cross to a saltire so that it would not be a religious symbol but merely a heraldic device. The Alabama flag also shows that device. The feast of Andrew is observed on 30 November in both the Eastern and Western churches, and is the national day of Scotland. In the traditional liturgical books of the Catholic Church, the feast of Saint Andrew is the first feast day in the Proper of Saints. In Islam The Qur‚Äôanic account of the disciples of Jesus does not include their names, numbers, or any detailed accounts of their lives. Muslim exegesis, however, more-or-less agrees with the New Testament list and says that the disciples included Peter, Philip, Thomas, Bartholomew, Matthew, Andrew, James, Jude, John and Simon the Zealot.

Biography Nothing is known of Leontares's early life, except a statement by the historian Doukas that Leontares had served with distinction as an officer in the Morea and Thessaly in the 1390s.. Leontares first appears in the historical sources in 1403. As a close friend and trusted agent of Manuel II, he escorted John VII Palaiologos to Thessalonica, the Byzantine Empire's second city, which John VII had been granted as a semi-independent appanage by Manuel. Leontares remained in the city and served as John VII's advisor and liaison to Manuel II until the former's death in 1408... At this point, Manuel placed him as tutor and regent over his young son, the despotes Andronikos Palaiologos, who succeeded John VII as governor of Thessalonica... Leontares remained in Thessalonica as its effective governor until 1415/16,. when the Ottoman prince D√ºzmece Mustafa and Junayd of Aydƒ±n fled to the city after a failed attempt to seize the Ottomans' European domains from Mehmed I (r. 1413‚Äì1421). Mehmed demanded the surrender of the rebel, but Leontares referred him to Manuel II in Constantinople. Eventually, a deal was reached whereby Mustafa would be kept in exile in the Byzantine island of Lemnos and Junayd in Constantinople, in exchange for an annual subsidy of 300,000 aspers. Leontares himself escorted Mustafa on the ship to Constantinople.. In late 1420/early 1421 and again in May 1421, Leontares was dispatched by Manuel II to Mehmed I in missions of good will, as reports of preparations for an Ottoman attack on Constantinople increased. The first meeting occurred during a crossing of the Bosphorus by Mehmed. Leontares, at the head of a group of Byzantine aristocrats and officials and supplied with gifts, met Mehmed at the Constantinopolitan suburb of Koutoulos (probably modern Kurtulu≈ü) and escorted him to Diplokionion (modern Be≈üikta≈ü), where the Emperor and his sons awaited in their galley. The second meeting was a full embassy to the Sultan's residence in Adrianople in May 1421, perhaps connected with a purported amendment in Mehmed's will that would have made Manuel guardian of his two younger sons. Leontares was cordially received, but negotiations were prevented by Mehmed's death on 21 May. To prevent another struggle for succession, his death was kept secret for a while, and Leontares found himself under virtual house arrest. Only with difficulty did he manage to find out news of the Sultan's death and report them to Constantinople.. Following the death of Mehmed, the hawkish party in the Byzantine court, headed by Manuel II's son and co-emperor John VIII, became ascendant, and Manuel II resigned effective control of the state to him.. Leontares released Mustafa and Junayd from their exile, and the Ottoman prince was promised imperial support against Murad II if he would surrender the strategically important fortress of Gallipoli. With Byzantine support, Mustafa besieged and took Gallipoli, and managed to quickly establish his authority over the Ottomans' European domains. However, when Leontares was dispatched to demand Gallipoli from Mustafa, he was rebuffed. In the event, Mustafa was defeated by Murad in spring 1422, abandoned by his supporters, caught and executed.. Leontares appears again in 1427, when he headed the Byzantine fleet in its last naval victory, over the forces of Carlo I Tocco (r. 1411‚Äì1429) at the Battle of the Echinades.. He later retired to a monastery, under the monastic name Daniel, and died probably on 6 September 1431. He was buried at the Petra Monastery in Constantinople.. Markos Eugenikos and Gennadios Scholarios wrote funeral eulogies in his honour.. Family Little is known about his family, except that he had brothers and was married, having one known son, John Laskaris Leontares.

A great heiress, in 1269 she was married to Edmund Crouchback, 1st Earl of Lancaster, the second son of Henry III of England. She died five years later, and the marriage produced no children. Life Aveline de Forz was born on 20 January 1259 at Burstwick in Holderness. Her parents were William de Forz, 4th Earl of Albemarle and Isabella de Fortibus, Countess of Devon. Marriage Queen Eleanor, the consort of Henry III of England, arranged the marriage between Aveline and their second son Edmund Crouchback, 1st Earl of Lancaster. Eleanor negotiated with Aveline's mother Isabella and grandmother Amice to secure the alliance. On 8 or 9 April 1269, Aveline was married to Edmund at Westminster Abbey. Given that Aveline was only ten years old, the marriage was not consummated until 1273, when she turned fourteen. With marriage to the great heiress, the already wealthy Edmund hoped to gain the earldoms of Devon and Aumale as well as the lordships of Holderness and the Isle of Wight. Her last surviving brother, Thomas, died in 1269, and she inherited his titles, becoming Countess of Aumale. Her lands fell into King Henry's custody. However, Aveline died on 10 November 1274 at Stockwell, Surrey, which prevented Edmund from inheriting the lands. They had no children. Aveline was buried in Westminster Abbey, the first tomb to be placed in its new church.

A forward or winger comfortable on either flank, Garside-Wight began her career with local club Bradford City and later joined Doncaster Belles. She was known as Melanie Garside until she married Gillian Wight in May 2010 and added her surname to her own. Club career Garside-Wight came to prominence with Bradford City Women, playing in the FA Women's Premier League National Division and achieving England recognition. In November 1998 she suffered a broken leg in a freak accident while training in Peel Park. In 1999‚Äì00, with City having been relegated in her absence, Garside-Wight joined Doncaster Belles. She scored the winner in that season's FA Women's Cup semi‚Äìfinal victory over Arsenal as Doncaster reached a record 12th final. She also started The Belles' controversial 2‚Äì1 defeat to Croydon in the final at Bramall Lane. Two years later Garside-Wight was an unused substitute as Doncaster Belles lost another FA Women's Cup final, this time to Fulham at Selhurst Park. She transferred to Northern Division club Sheffield Wednesday that summer. In 2003‚Äì04 Garside- Wight was Manchester City's top goalscorer, before she joined Stockport County ahead of 2004‚Äì05. Garside-Wight subsequently returned to Bradford City and became the club's captain and all‚Äìtime record goalscorer. In 2010‚Äì11 she was converted to a goalkeeper. International career As a teenager Garside- Wight played three times for England in 1997‚Äì98. Her debut came in February 1998, playing 90 minutes of a 3‚Äì2 friendly defeat to France in Alen√ßon. The following month she appeared as a substitute for Mo Marley in a 1‚Äì0 World Cup qualifying loss to Germany at The New Den. Garside-Wight's third and final cap came in a 2‚Äì1 home friendly defeat to Italy in April 1998. She and fellow striker Joanne Broadhurst were substituted at half-time after failing to make an impact. After Hope Powell was appointed England manager in July 1998, Garside-Wight remained on the fringes of the national team, until suffering serious injury later that year.

The technique was developed in the early 1990s. Since it integrates both neural networks and fuzzy logic principles, it has potential to capture the benefits of both in a single framework. Its inference system corresponds to a set of fuzzy IF‚ÄìTHEN rules that have learning capability to approximate nonlinear functions. Hence, ANFIS is considered to be a universal estimator.Jang, Sun, Mizutani (1997) ‚Äì Neuro- Fuzzy and Soft Computing ‚Äì Prentice Hall, pp 335‚Äì368, For using the ANFIS in a more efficient and optimal way, one can use the best parameters obtained by genetic algorithm. It has uses in intelligent situational aware energy management system. ANFIS architecture It is possible to identify two parts in the network structure, namely premise and consequence parts. In more details, the architecture is composed by five layers. The first layer takes the input values and determines the membership functions belonging to them. It is commonly called fuzzification layer. The membership degrees of each function are computed by using the premise parameter set, namely {a,b,c}. The second layer is responsible of generating the firing strengths for the rules. Due to its task, the second layer is denoted as \\"rule layer\\". The role of the third layer is to normalize the computed firing strengths, by dividing each value for the total firing strength. The fourth layer takes as input the normalized values and the consequence parameter set {p,q,r}. The values returned by this layer are the defuzzificated ones and those values are passed to the last layer to return the final output. Fuzzification layer The first layer of an ANFIS network describes the difference to a vanilla neural network. Neural networks in general are operating with a data pre-processing step, in which the features are converted into normalized values between 0 and 1. An ANFIS neural network doesn't need a sigmoid function, but it's doing the preprocessing step by converting numeric values into fuzzy values. Here an example: Suppose, the network gets as input the distance between two points in the 2d space. The distance is measured in pixels and it can have values from 0 up to 500 pixels. Converting the numerical values into Fuzzy numbers is done with the membership function which consists of semantic descriptions like near, middle and far. Each possible linguistic value is given by an individual neuron. The neuron ‚Äúnear‚Äù fires with a value from 0 until 1, if the distance is located within the category \\"near\\". While the neuron ‚Äúmiddle‚Äù fires, if the distance in that category. The input value ‚Äúdistance in pixels‚Äù is split into three different neurons for near, middle and far.

George Dance. Life Seward was the only son of William Seward, a partner in the major London brewery Calvert & Seward. He was born in London in January 1747. Having started school near Cripplegate, he moved in 1757 to Harrow School, but also attended Charterhouse School for a while before matriculating at Oriel College, Oxford in 1764. After university, Seward travelled widely in Italy and elsewhere in Europe. He had considerable wealth, but no taste for business, and sold his interest in the brewery when his father died. However, his cultivation and conversational talents soon gained him a place in London literary circles, notably that of the Thrales in Streatham, also a brewing family. There he met Samuel Johnson. The two became intimate and Seward became a member of the Essex Head Club that Johnson had founded. Johnson also provided him with a recommendation to James Boswell when he visited Edinburgh and the Highlands in 1777. He made a western tour of England in August 1781, indulging his hypochondria liberally by consulting \\"a doctor, apothecary or chemist\\" in every town where he stopped, according to Fanny Burney.The Diary and Letters of Madame D'Arblay, ed. W. C. Ward, 1 (London: Swan Sonnenschein & Co., 1892), I, 219. Two years later he was in Paris, and then in Flanders studying the pictures of Claude Lorrain. Meanwhile he had been elected a Fellow of the Royal Society and a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1779. When Johnson died in 1784, Seward helped the classical scholar Samuel Parr to compose his epitaph. In 1788, Seward was thought to be suffering from mental illness and was confined to a straitjacket for a time. Four years earlier, Mrs Thrale had recorded being \\"plagued‚Ä¶ with a Visit from Seward, who I think is going out of his Senses by the oddity of his Behaviour.\\"Thraliana: the diary of Mrs. Hester Lynch Thrale (later Mrs. Piozzi), 1776‚Äì1809, ed.

Conversation Seward had been responsible in 1776 for introducing the music scholar Charles Burney and his family to the Thrales, which led to an intimacy between Hester Thrale and Fanny Burney that lasted until the former's remarriage in 1784. Fanny Burney's copious letters and diaries contain many affectionate references to Seward. In March 1777, for instance, she describes him in a letter to another Burney family friend, Samuel Crisp, as \\"a very polite, agreeable young man.\\"The Early Diary of Frances Burney 1768‚Äì1778, ed. Annie Raine Ellis (London: G. Bell and Sons, Ltd., 1913 [1889]). II. 152. This includes a biographical note on Seward. On 15 January 1782, her 17-year-old sister Charlotte Ann Burney noted that on her arrival at Mrs Thrale's, \\"Mr Seward came up to me immediately as he commonly does when I meet him to do the honours to me in his odd way;- lugging a chair into the middle of the room for me, and upon my saying I could not sit there by myself, \\"oh,\\" he cried, \\"I'll stand by you, and amuse you.\\"The Early Diary... II, p. 306. In May 1792 he was amusing Fanny: \\"When I came in... I was accosted by Mr. Seward, & he entered into a gay conversation, upon all sorts of subjects, which detained me, agreeably enough, in a pleasant station by one of the windows.\\"The Journals and Letters of Fanny Burney (Madame d'Arblay), ed. Joyce Hemlow etc. (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1972) I, L23, pp. 161‚Äì162. Other well-known people whom he knew and helped included the classical scholar Richard Porson, the radical Thomas Paine and the poet Anna Seward (no relation). Fanny Burney also provided in a letter of 2 May 1799 a vivid account of Seward just before he died: \\"Poor Mr Seward! ‚Äì I am indeed exceedingly concerned ‚Äì nay, grieved for his loss to us ‚Äì to us I trust I may say, for I believe he was so substantially good a Creature, that he has left no fear or regret merely for himself. He fully expected his end was quickly approaching... he spent almost a whole morning with me in chatting of other times, as he called it ‚Äì for we travelled back to Streatham, Dr Johnson and the Thrales.\\"The Journals and Letters... IV, L319, 284‚Äì285. Seward had become very fat, and died of dropsy at his lodgings in Dean Street, Soho on 24 April 1799. He was buried in the family vault at Finchley on 1 May. Works Many articles, including a series of \\"Reminiscentia\\", were supplied by Seward to the Whitehall Evening Post, and he contributed anecdotes and literary discoveries to Thomas Cadell's Repository and the European Magazine. (The latter published Seward's portrait and lengthy obituary as its lead article in October 1799.) His papers of \\"Drossiana\\" in the European Magazine from October 1789 formed the basis of his anonymous Anecdotes of some Distinguished Persons (1795‚Äì1797), 5 vols (a fifth edition in four volumes in 1804). This was followed in 1799 by two volumes of Biographiana, for which the Gentleman's Magazine praised him for \\"felicity... in hitting off the leading features of his subject.\\"1st series, 69 (1799), 439‚Äì440. Quoted in the ODNB entry. Thomas James Mathias in his long poem The Pursuits of LiteratureThe Pursuits of Literature, 2nd rev. ed. (London: T. Becket, 1797). 2nd dialogue, ll. 61‚Äì62. speaks of Seward as a \\"publick bagman for scraps\\", but describes the volumes as entertaining and their author as the best compiler of anecdotes after Horace Walpole.

The compound itself was located just half a mile from Pakistan's premier military training academy Kakul Military Academy (PMA) in Abbottabad. In the aftermath of bin Laden's death, US- President Barack Obama asked Pakistan to investigate the network that sustained bin Laden. \\"We think that there had to be some sort of support network for bin Laden inside of Pakistan,\\" Obama said in a 60 Minutes interview with CBS News. He also added that the United States was not sure \\"who or what that support network was.\\" In addition to this, in an interview with Time magazine, CIA Director Leon Panetta stated that US-officials did not alert Pakistani counterparts to the raid because they feared the terrorist leader would be warned. According to Fred Burton, vice-president of the global intelligence firm Stratfor, officials of ISI, Pakistani military, along with one retired Pakistani military general, had knowledge of the arrangements made for bin Laden and the safe house. Bin Laden's compound was razed that day at his Abbottabad safe house. David Ignatius in The Washington Post referred to the claim of the former ISI chief General Ziauddin Butt that the Abbottabad compound was used by the Intelligence Bureau and noted that a report in the Pakistani press in December had quoted him as saying that Osama's stay at Abbottabad was arranged by Brigadier (retired) Ijaz Shah, senior ISI officer and the head of the Intelligence Bureau during 2004‚Äì2008, on Pervez Musharraf's orders. Later Butt denied making any such statement. Allegations Critics cited the very close proximity (800 yards) of bin Laden's heavily fortified compound (a custom-built luxury complex) to the Pakistan's National Military Academy (PMA), Pakistan's \\"West Point\\", and that the United States chose not to notify Pakistani authorities before the operation, and the alleged double standards of Pakistan regarding the perpetrators of the 2008 Mumbai attacks. US-government files leaked by WikiLeaks disclosed that American diplomats were told that Pakistani security services were tipping off bin Laden every time US-forces approached. Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) also helped smuggle al Qaeda militants into Afghanistan to fight NATO troops. According to the leaked files, in December 2009, the government of Tajikistan had told US-officials that many in Pakistan were aware of bin Laden's whereabouts. The CIA Director and the US defense secretary Leon Panetta stated that Pakistan was \\"either involved or incompetent.\\" In an interview to CBC television, > Obviously the concern has always been how could a compound like this, how > could bin Laden be in an area where there were military establishments, > where we could see the military operating and not have them know. Regarding the US decision to withhold intelligence about the raid from Pakistan, he said, > The concern we had is that...we had provided intelligence to them with > regards to other areas and unfortunately, for one way or another, it got > leaked to the individuals we were trying to go after, so as a result of that > we were concerned that if we were going to perform a sensitive mission like > this, we had to do it on our own. Talking about the support network Panetta stated that some \\"lower rank\\" officers in the military knew where Bin Laden was hiding. The defense secretary said, > Well, you know, these situations sometimes, the leadership within Pakistan > is obviously not aware of certain things and yet people lower down in the > military establishment find it very well, they've been aware of it, ...But > bottom line is that we have not had evidence that provides that direct link. Husain Haqqani the former-Pakistan Ambassador to the United States, who earlier said both countries \\"cooperated in making sure\\" that the operation leading to bin Laden's death was \\"successful\\", has admitted that Osama bin laden indeed had a support system in Pakistan, albeit without the Pakistani government being privy to this fact. > Obviously, bin Laden did have a support system (in Pakistan). The issue was > that support system within the government and the state of Pakistan or > within the society of Pakistan, ...We all know that there are people in > Pakistan who share the same belief system as bin Laden and other > extremists... So that is a fact, that there are people who probably > protected him... We did not know. We had no knowledge [about Bin Laden]. And > if we had knowledge, we would have acted upon it long ago\\" ‚ÄîMr. Haqqani said > in an interview. A Pakistani official, speaking anonymously, said \\"We assisted only in terms of authorization of the helicopter flights in our airspace\\" and that \\"we did not want anything to do with such an operation in case something went wrong.\\" US Senator Joe Lieberman, Chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, said \\"This is going to be a time of real pressure on Pakistan to basically prove to us that they didn't know that bin Laden was there\\". John O. Brennan, Obama's chief counterterrorism advisor, said that it was inconceivable that bin Laden did not have support from within Pakistan. He further stated: \\"People have been referring to this as hiding in plain sight. We are looking at how he was able to hide out there for so long.\\" Senator Dianne Feinstein said that \\"it's hard for me to understand how the Pakistanis ... would not know what was going on inside the compound\\", and that top Pakistan officials may be \\"walking both sides of the street.\\" Senator Lindsey Graham questioned, \\"How could [bin Laden] be in such a compound without being noticed?\\", raising suspicions that Pakistan was either uncommitted in the fight against Islamist militants or was actively sheltering them while pledging to fight them. A Pakistani intelligence official said that they had passed on raw phone tap data to the United States that led to the operation, but had failed to analyze this data themselves. Carl Levin who is chairman United States Senate Committee on Armed Services stated that he believes Pakistani officials knew the location of bin Laden and had \\"no doubt\\" they also know the location of other senior al-Qaeda operatives. He said Pakistan's intelligence and army have \\"got a lot of explaining to do,\\" given that bin Laden was holed up in such a large house with surrounding buildings, the fact that its residents took the unusual step of burning their garbage and avoiding any trash collection. He further stated, \\"It's hard to imagine that the military or police did not have any ideas what was going on inside of that.\\" After the raid, the US asked that Pakistan identify its top intelligence operatives as it tried to establish if any of them had contact with bin Laden in the last few years. Mosharraf Zaidi, a leading Pakistani columnist, stated, \\"It seems deeply improbable that bin Laden could have been where he was killed without the knowledge of some parts of the Pakistani state.\\" WikiLeaks had revealed that a US diplomatic dispatch told the Americans that \\"many\\" inside Pakistan knew where bin Laden was. The document stated that \\"In Pakistan, Osama Bin Laden wasn't an invisible man, and many knew his whereabouts in North Waziristan, but whenever security forces attempted a raid on his hideouts, the enemy received warning of their approach from sources in the security forces.\\" Indian Minister for Home Affairs P. Chidambaram said that bin Laden hiding \\"deep inside\\" Pakistan was a matter of grave concern for India, and showed that \\"many of the perpetrators of the Mumbai terror attacks, including the controllers and the handlers of the terrorists who actually carried out the attack, continue to be sheltered in Pakistan\\". He called on Pakistan to arrest them. The Globe and Mail reported local police saying that the compound belonged to Hizbul Mujahideen, a militant group supported by ISI which is fighting Indian forces in Kashmir. In October 2011, former Pakistani Army Chief, General Ziauddin Butt has asserted that Osama bin Laden was kept in an Intelligence Bureau safe house in Abbottabad by the then Director-General of the Intelligence Bureau of Pakistan (2004‚Äì2008), Brigadier Ijaz Shah. According to him, this had occurred with the \\"full knowledge\\" of former army chief General Pervez Musharraf and possibly that of current Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Ashfaq Pervez Kayani. In December 2017, former USA President Barack Obama said: \\"We had no evidence that Pakistani government was aware of Osama bin Laden's presence there but that is something obviously we looked at.\\"https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/no-evidence-that-pak-government- was-aware-of-osama-bin-ladens-presence-barack-obama-1782607 Pakistan's denial  Michael Mullen, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff talking with Ashfaq Kayani (left) and Pasha (right) to on the USS Abraham Lincoln. In a 2005 interview, the then-president Musharraf emphatically denied bin Laden was in Pakistan, stating \\"One thing is very sure, let me assure you, that we are not going to hide him for a rainy day and then release him to take advantage.\\" Pakistan's president Asif Ali Zardari denied that his country's security forces may have sheltered Osama bin Laden, and called any supposed support for bin Laden by the Pakistani government \\"baseless speculation.\\" The Pakistani foreign office issued a statement that \\"categorically denies\\" media reports that Pakistan's leadership, \\"civil as well as military, had any prior knowledge of the US operation against Osama bin Laden.\\" Pakistan's former president Pervez Musharraf denied that officials in his country were responsible, calling bin Laden's presence in Pakistan a \\"blunder\\". Musharraf said instead that there was a possibility that rogue lower-level members of Pakistan's intelligence and military may have had knowledge of bin Laden's location. He conceded they might have known during the last year of his presidency six years ago, and said there ought to be an investigation. Ahmed Shuja Pasha, the head of Pakistan's powerful Directorate of Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), conceded that Osama bin Laden's presence in Pakistan had been an \\"intelligence failure\\" but denied his ISI could have had any role in hiding Bin Laden. \\"If we had shielded Osama bin Laden, why would we have killed and arrested so many al-Qaeda leaders?\\" he stated \\"Would we have hidden such a large target in such an exposed area? Without any guards or escape route?\\" Follow-up by Pakistani authorities  Regardless of Pakistan's claims about their previous conduct, many outside observers have raised ongoing concerns that most of the people jailed by them since Bin Laden's killing have been those who were trying to help capture him, rather than those who helped shield him. One such incident would be when doctor Shakil Afridi who assisted the CIA in the hunt for Osama bin Laden, was arrested several weeks after the killing of bin Laden. A Pakistani court imposed a 33-year sentence on the doctor. The doctor was eventually tried under a tribal judicial system that denies the accused the right to have an attorney or to present evidence. According to The Washington Post, the Doctor could have received the death penalty if he had been tried under normal Pakistani law. ‚Ä≥It is now indisputable that militancy in Pakistan is supported by the ISI (Inter-Services Intelligence). Pakistan's fight against militancy is bogus. It's just to extract money from America,‚Ä≥ Dr Shakil Afridi stated in an interview with Fox News. He was interviewed from inside Peshawar Central Jail, where he is being held by Pakistani authorities. According to his statements, the Pakistani authorities said, 'The Americans are our worst enemies, worse than the Indians,' and he suffered ‚Ä≤crippling torture‚Ä≤ and ‚Ä≤psychological abuse‚Ä≤ during the 12 months he was held by Pakistani spy agency for helping the US. He further revealed the fact that the ISI is in collusion with terrorists. Abbottabad Commission report A judge-led inquiry set up by Pakistani government in 2011, based on interviews with 201 sources found there was evidence of incompetence at every level in the Pakistan's intelligence and security services and it did not rule out the involvement of rogue elements within the Pakistani intelligence service. The 336-page Abbottabad Commission Report, obtained in July 2013 by Al Jazeera, blasted Pakistan's civilian and military leadership for \\"gross incompetence\\" over the bin Laden affair. It found that by 2005, Pakistani intelligence was no longer actively pursuing intelligence that could lead to his capture. The report called the handling of the bin Laden situation a \\"natural disaster\\" and even called on the leadership to apologize to the people of Pakistan for their \\"dereliction of duty.\\" Al Jazeera reported that the government's intention in conducting the inquiry was likely aimed at \\"regime continuance, when the regime is desperate to distance itself from any responsibility for the national disaster that occurred on its watch\\" and was likely \\"a reluctant response to an overwhelming public and parliamentary demand.\\" Lack of intelligence on bid Laden's nine-year residence in the country was blamed on \\"Government Implosion Syndrome.\\" Lack of knowledge of a CIA support network without Pakistan being aware was \\"a case of collective and sustained dereliction of duty by the political, military, and intelligence leadership.\\" Although the report focused on the night of the raid, it had other findings. One was that bin Laden had been living in Pakistan since 2002, after surviving the Battle of Tora Bora. Another was that he and some family members moved into the compound in Abbottabad in 2005, the same year Pakistani intelligence stopped independently looking for him.Leaked Pakistan report details bin Laden's secret life ‚Äì Militarytimes.com, 8 July 2013 Statements from other countries * : Defense ministry spokesman said that ISI must have known that bin Laden was in Abbottabad prior to the US killing him.

Impact on US‚ÄìPakistan relations The United States suspended about a third of its $2.7 billion annual defense aid to Pakistan. In November 2018, U.S. President Donald Trump stated Pakistan helped Osama hide in the country. Accusing Pakistan of not doing \\"a damn thing for us\\" and defended his administration's decision to withhold hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid to Islamabad. In an interview with Fox News aired on November 18, Trump accused Pakistan of helping to hide Osama bin Laden.

The book was released on May 17, 2011, and reached No. 6 on the New York Times list of best-selling hardcover non-fiction books. It has been publicized in politically conservative venues. The book alleges inconsistencies and fabrications in Obama's life story as well as a conspiracy and cover-up by Obama and the White House Press Office. The book says, among other things, that Obama cannot be a natural-born citizen because, as a boy, he was registered in school as a Muslim and a citizen of Indonesia. The book also alleges that Obama spent millions in legal fees to avoid having to provide a long-form birth certificate to the courts, an assertion which has been disputed by Obama supporters. Obama released his birth certificate several weeks before Where's the Birth Certificate? was published, but the book was nonetheless released unedited. The book's publisher responded to the birth certificate release by saying that Corsi was \\"deeply suspicious of the authenticity of this document\\". Impact and reception Despite the release of Obama's long-form birth certificate on April 27, 2011, publisher Joseph Farah told The Washington Post that Where's the Birth Certificate? would not be renamed and would still be released on May 17. He said the imminent publication of the book had pressured Obama into releasing the certificate. The Boston Globe columnist Joan Vennochi opined that Obama's birth certificate was released in part to preempt Corsi's book. Time criticized Corsi for writing a book that provided emotionally satisfying answers rather than factual ones and predicted that Where's the Birth Certificate? would still sell though Obama had released his long-form birth certificate one month before the book was to hit the shelves. Paul Harris, a foreign correspondent for The Guardian, commented that the book was nothing to be laughed at because it represented a \\"dangerous precedent\\"; the mainstreaming of a formerly extremist idea that is \\"palpably and stupidly misguided\\". Journalist Matthew Continetti, writing in The Washington Post about the earlier Corsi book Unfit for Command that swiftboated John Kerry, concluded: \\"The connection is important: Birtherism may be to the 2012 election what the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth were to 2004.\\" Martin Wisckol of the Orange County Register reported June 1, 2011, that Corsi's new book was \\"listed at No. 6 on The New York Times best-seller list for hardcover non-fiction\\" but suggested that the failure of Corsi's previous book, The Obama Nation, to derail Barack Obama's bid for the presidency was \\"evidence the book will not affect the upcoming election\\" like Unfit for Command did Kerry's presidential run four years earlier. Esquire lawsuit  Because Obama released his long-form birth certificate prior to the publication of Where's the Birth Certificate?, shortly after the book's release, a blogger for Esquire wrote a satirical article stating that the book had been recalled.Warren, Mark (May 18, 2011), \\"Breaking: Jerome Corsi's Birther Book Pulled from Shelves!\\". Esquire. On June 29, 2011, Corsi and WND Books filed a lawsuit against Esquire for damages of over (equivalent to about $M in ).Linkins, Jason (June 29, 2011), \\"Birthers Sue Esquire Over Satirical Article\\", The Huffington PostBercovici, Jeff (June 29, 2011), \\"Birthers Sue Esquire Over Parody, Seeking More than $200 Million\\", Forbes In June 2012, the lawsuit was tossed out in United States district court, in a decision stating that satire is protected by the First Amendment and noting \\"Having become such well-known proponents of one position on the issue, plaintiffs cannot complain that the very intensity of their advocacy also became part of the public debate. Those who speak with loud voices cannot be surprised if they become part of the story.\\" The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed the dismissal.

Background At the time of the 1968 general election, mass resignations by the members of Barisan Sosialis in the parliament, who opted to protest and \\"struggle for democracy\\" on the streets, had effectively removed all opposition from the parliament. In 1970, however, it was five members from the governing People's Action Party who were invited to resign and give way to new blood as a part of renewing PAP's ranks. The resulting vacancies were in the constituencies of Delta, Havelock, Kampong Kapor, Ulu Pandan and Whampoa. By-elections were arranged, with nomination day set as 8 April 1970 and polling day as 18 April 1970. Similar to 1968 general election, no opposition parties stood except a newly formed United National Front formed from remnants of the defunct Singapore Alliance. This party stood candidates in two seats out of the five, namely Kampong Kapor and Ulu Pandan. Once again the PAP won the other three by walkovers.

In 2015 the ministry's Fine Arts Department published History of the Thai Nation (; ) at the order of the National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO). The NCPO wanted a new history book covering the past 400 years to foster \\"national reconciliation\\". The book was written in two months.

Ten thousand copies of the book were published at a cost of one million baht. Twenty copies autographed by Prayut were sold at the launch. In November 2017, the prime minister ordered the Fine Arts Department to send 100 copies of the book to each of Thailand's provinces.

History The barracks were opened as Garrioch Barracks in 1872. Built to accommodate an infantry regiment, a squadron of cavalry and a battery of field artillery, it dominated the area which is now the Wyndford housing estate. The barracks replaced the previous Infantry Barracks at Duke Street in the East End of the city. Glasgow City Corporation had been petitioning the government since the early 19th century for more military protection from their fear of \\"riot and tumult\\" in the growing industrial city. Despite the fact that Maryhill at the time was an independent burgh, it agreed to the erection of Glasgow's new barracks, with the greatly enlarged complex opening in 1876. Higher quality than normal, the barracks engendered a sense of community. The Glasgow Soldiers' Home, where those on leave could entertain relatives, and public houses with names such as the Highland Light Infantry (HLI) and the Elephant and Bugle (the HLI emblem) gave Maryhill the feel of a garrison town. Vandalism was also reduced.\\"Greater Glasgow: An Illustrated Architectural Guide\\", by Sam Small, 2008 Married quarters were added to the barracks in 1911.Hansard, HC Deb 28 February 1911 vol 22 c187 During the 1919 40-hours general strike in Glasgow, the soldiers at Maryhill Barracks were deemed to be unreliable and were confined to barracks while troops from elsewhere were brought in to re-impose order. It was in 1919 that Maryhill Barracks was used as a marshalling place for the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders before embarking for India. Maryhill Barracks became the depot of the Highland Light Infantry (City of Glasgow) regiment in March 1921. In May 1934 a bomb exploded in the barracks, which was alleged to have been set off by the same person as bombed the Army Recruiting Offices, 139 Bath Street, a fortnight previously.Glasgow Bomb Outrage, The Scotsman newspaper, 29 May 1934 It was also home to the Scots Greys and famously held Adolf Hitler's second-in-command Rudolf Hess during World War II after his supposed \\"Peace\\" flight to the UK in 1941, at a time when it was used as a prisoner of war camp. In 1942, the Free French leader, General Charles de Gaulle, visited French troops there. The Barracks were decommissioned and largely demolished in the early 1960s, to be replaced by the Wyndford housing estate, although the guardroom and boundary walls remain.

Ara√∫jo was also a former pornographic actress. Biography Ara√∫jo was born into a middle-class family in Governador Island (Rio de Janeiro), Brazil. At 12, Ara√∫jo kissed a male classmate prior to her transition inside the public school where she studied. This event generated rumors that came to the school board's attention, and Ara√∫jo was persecuted by the supervisor. Thinking that the employee's intention was only to help her, Ara√∫jo confessed she was gay. As a result, she was expelled from school in 1997 while in seventh grade. After the incident, Ara√∫jo confessed to her parents, Severino Ara√∫jo and stay- at-home Terezinha Ara√∫jo, both evangelicals, that she saw herself as a woman, not a man, and was attracted to males. Her older brother, whose name she never disclosed, wanted her to be expelled from the house because of it, but her parents supported her. Ara√∫jo began to dress as a woman, and guided by a transvestite who lived near her home, began taking hormonal control pills to become more feminized. At 15 years of age, she married a man twenty years older and lived in S√£o Paulo. The relationship lasted four years and soon after it ended, Ara√∫jo returned to Rio de Janeiro to find work and complete high school. She could not find work and subsequently went into prostitution, first in Brazil and later in Italy, using the name Patricia Chantily. In 2009, she was mentioned on newspapers for being invited by football player Adriano to a private party in his home, allegedly with other prostitutes. In 2009 Ara√∫jo was featured in Rio Fashion Week. She has also worked as an actress in the miniseries A Lei e o Crime and the telenovela Luz do Sol, both on the Brazilian television network Rede Record. In April 2009 she posed along with the model Pamela Sanches, for the magazine A Gata da Hora.

Life Kang Ky≈èng-ae was born in Songhwa, Hwanghae-do, and had an unhappy childhood.Korean Literature Translation Institute: She was the daughter of a servant and lost her father at the age of five. She was then forced to moved to Changyeon where her mother remarried a man with three children. All of these circumstances resulted in substantial unhappiness.Feminist Press: Kang was something of a prodigy and started teaching herself to read the Korean alphabet when she was eight years old using her step-father's copy of the Tale of Ch‚Äôunhyang at a time when female literacy was not greatly valued. By age ten, she had been nicknamed the ‚Äúlittle acorn storyteller‚Äù by neighborhood elders for whom she read traditional Korean tales. She was also praised in school for her essay writing and often read stories for her friends. Kang enrolled in a Catholic boarding school with the help of her brother-in-law. She was later expelled for orchestrating and participating in a sit-in against the school's strict policies and a particularly cruel dorm mistress. She met a college student who was visiting from Tokyo, moved to Seoul with him, and began an affair. When the affair ended, she moved back to her family home in Hwanghae-do. In 1931 Kang began publishing her writing (\\"P'ag ≈≠m\\" or Broken Zither, 1931A History of Korean Literature. Peter H. Lee - editor. Publisher: Cambridge University Press. Cambridge, England. 2003. Page Number: 412.), and moved to Manchuria as a newlywed, married to a communist who had divorced his first wife. She lived as a housewife in Yongjin and began to churn out literary works. This period lasted seven years after which Kang ceased writing fiction altogether. This was partly related to the fact that she became the managing editor of the Manchurian Chosun Ilbo. On April 26, 1944, one month after her mother died, Kang Ky≈èng-ae died at her home in Hwanghae Province. Work Kang is often mentioned by literary critics as one of the foremost female writers of the colonial period. Different from other prominent female authors of the time, such as Na Hye-sok and Heo Jong-suk, she focused solely on fiction and essay writing and did not branch out into other forms of artistic expression such as painting. She produced works focusing on the Korean underclass often based on her experiences with extremely poor Koreans in Manchuria, where many of her works took place. These include: \\"The Broken Geomungo\\" (Pageum), \\"Vegetable Garden\\" (Chaejeon), \\"Football Game\\" (Chukgu jeon), and \\"Mother and Child\\" (Moja). She also wrote proto-feminist works focusing on women‚Äôs oppression including \\"Mothers and Daughters\\" (). Most of her works are anti-love/anti family, in which only those women who cut their ties with their failed relationships can achieve freedom. From Wonso Pond (Ingan munje), which many consider her best work, is her only novel and deals with a multiplicity of class and gender issues.

The High Sheriff had judicial, electoral, ceremonial and administrative functions and executed High Court Writs. In 1908, an Order in Council made the Lord Lieutenant the Sovereign's prime representative in a county and reduced the High Sheriff's precedence. However the sheriff retained his responsibilities for the preservation of law and order in the county. The usual procedure for appointing the sheriff from 1660 onwards was that three persons were nominated at the beginning of each year from the county and the Lord Lieutenant then appointed his choice as High Sheriff for the remainder of the year. Often the other nominees were appointed as under-sheriffs. Sometimes a sheriff did not serve his full term due to death or another event, and another sheriff was then appointed for the remainder of the year. The dates given in this article are the dates of appointment. In Ireland the County Sheriffs were selected or \\"pricked\\" by the Lord Lieutenant.

The film marks Edward G. Robinson's second film with actress Marsha Hunt. Also known by its section names of Actor's Blood and Woman of Sin. Lee Garmes was co-director and cinematographer, as he was on most of the films Hecht directed. Plot The film lampoons the Hollywood motion picture industry and is separated into two sections: The first section of the film is Actor's Blood, a morality play about legitimate theater. The second section is Woman of Sin, a send-up of Hollywood greed. Actor's Blood takes place in New York City. Broadway star Marcia Tillayou (Marsha Hunt) has been found shot dead in her apartment. Her father Maurice (Edward G. Robinson) is himself an actor, and had watched her theater career rise as his own declined. She had let success overcome her, and had thus alienated critics, fans, producers, and her playwright husband (Dan O'Herlihy). She had a few recent stage flops before being murdered. Woman of Sin takes place in Hollywood. Dishonest agent writer's agent Orlando Higgens (Eddie Albert) has been receiving frantic calls from Daisy Marcher (Jenny Hecht) about a screenplay she had written called Woman of Sin. Thinking they are crank calls, Higgens tells her to never call his office again. He then learns that through a mixup of the mails, her screenplay had been received by film mogul J.B. Cobb (Alan Reed), a man who once passed on Gone With the Wind based on Higgins' advice. Cobb thinks that Higgins sent the script and offers Higgins a lucrative sum for the rights. The problem is that Higgins has no idea where Daisy is, or that she is actually a nine-year-old child. Cast Actor's Blood sequence: *Dan O'Herlihy as Alfred O'Shea, Narrator *Edward G.

Mayer, and Jack L. Warner Reception In speaking toward the film's two sections, DVD Talk writes \\"Both are light, breezy, and inconsequential, though admittedly written with an expert's ear for dialogue and a knack for clever story twists.\\" They write that both sections \\"move at an efficient pace\\", and praise Ben Hecht for the dialog and rhythm of his scripts. They also note that the actors were well chosen, finding flaw only in the child actors used in the Woman of Sin segment. They did have critique about the material itself, noting that while Hecht knew his way around both Hollywood and Broadway, the subject matter comes off as a little \\"too inside\\". They were also disappointed in the two stories, finding the plotlines \\"fairly hokey and predictable\\". However, and despite the \\"hackneyed narrative\\", they found the film overall to be \\"very watchable\\", in that Hecht's sense of timing kept the project from being boring. DVD Verdict wrote that \\"the most intriguing element\\" of the film, and not properly promoted by the film's trailer, is that \\"it is actually two brief films combined in one package.\\" In analyzing Actor's Blood, they wrote that there was \\"an opportunity for insight and depth in this story, but it would seem that Mr. Hecht wrote the screenplay while in a blind rage.\\" They offered that the material might even have been comedic but for it being \\"preposterously heavy-handed\\". They felt that the actors generally spoke each line over- dramatically and floundered, with only Edward G. Robinson \\"able to make this work within the context of his character\\". In their analysis of Woman of Sin, they found it to be \\"reasonably engaging early on as a breezy satire\\", despite the concept of a story written by a nine-year-old \\"earning words of praise and adoration from the likes of Jack Warner and Louis B. Mayer\\". They noted that the cameos by the studio heads were amusing, but that the story was derailed by the use of Ben Hecht's daughter Jenny in the role of child screenwriter Daisy Marcher. They felt that she was \\"fingernails-on-a-blackboard grating\\" in this role, in that she \\"dials up every aspect of precociousness that can afflict a child actor as high as it can possibly go, and her presence effectively destroys any sense of comic momentum that the film had built up to that point,\\" making her use a clear example of the problems inherent in nepotism. They concluded that the film would stand as \\"an interesting curiosity for Hollywood history buffs, but fails as a cinematic experience.\\" Controversy Upon original release, several theater chains refused to screen the film due to its lampooning of stage and screen. This resulted in a lawsuit by United Artists and Sid Kuller Productions against the A. B. C. Theatres Company.

According to The Daily Telegraph, he is \\"one of Britain's best-selling figurative painters\\". Biography Born in Manchester, his formative years were spent in Manchester‚Äôs meat market where he would accompany his father (Harold Demsteader) to the family butchery and meat-packing business. Completely absorbed in the noise, smells, and sheer physicality of this environment, the young Mark learnt more about the structure of sinew, bone, and flesh‚Äîalbeit livestock‚Äîthan in any subsequent life drawing class. As a teenager passionate about pursuing an artistic career, Mark completed two foundation courses: first and at Oldham and then Rochdale Colleges of Art. However, in the 1980s conceptual art dominated the mainstream market and there were little opportunities for a young figurative painter in Manchester. Forced to return to work at his father‚Äôs wholesale butchery, Mark continued to attend life classes throughout the next decade. In the early 1990s the family business fell victim to the recession and Mark was spurred on to find a commercial outlet for his work. To allow himself time to build a portfolio, he took a job as an art technician at an Oldham grammar school for another ten years. A short course at the Slade School of Fine Art gave him an opportunity to tour the London galleries with his portfolio, but with Brit Art in the ascendency he found drawing out of favour. Eventually, a gallery in Blackheath offered him space in a mixed show where he sold six works. Mark gave notice at the grammar school soon after. In 1997 he became a founder member of the Neomodern Art Group founded by Guy Denning. He has held an annual solo exhibition with Panter & Hall in the West End of London since 2004. He is now represented in Daikanyama, Japan by Art Obsession. Notably, he produced a surreal portrait of musician Anomie Belle for her album Flux, and 34 paintings of Harry Potter actress Emma Watson.

He was convicted of espionage for the Soviet Union in the 1980s. Barnett was the second CIA officer to be convicted after Edwin Moore II, a retired CIA employee who was arrested by the FBI in 1976 after attempting to sell classified documents to Soviet officials.  Career  Barnett was initially a Special Agent of the U.S. Army Counter Intelligence Corps (CIC), serving with the 308th CIC Detachment in Seoul, Korea, in 1958 and January 1959. He served in the S2 - Counter Subversive Section. Barnett was released from the U.S. Army and hired by the CIA in January 1959, after which he stayed in Korea for approximately one year. From the 1960s until 1970, Barnett was employed by the CIA, working in the United States and Asia. Barnett was stationed in Indonesia from 1967 until 1970 after South Korea. He was a teacher and wrestling coach during the 1970s at Kiskiminetas Springs School in Saltsburg, Pennsylvania. After leaving his teaching position at Kiski, Barnett returned to Indonesia to administer a shrimp processing company. Within six years, he had amassed debts of over $100,000 and faced imminent financial ruin. To rectify his problems, Barnett elected to sell classified information to the Soviets. In 1976, he approached KGB officers in Jakarta, Indonesia, and offered to sell them the names of CIA assets.  Espionage  Over the next three years in meetings held in the Embassy of the Soviet Union in Vienna, Barnett revealed to the KGB the identities of almost 30 CIA officers. Additionally, he handed over classified information gathered by the CIA on a clandestine operation, code-named HA/BRINK, that had focused on the acquisition of Soviet military hardware sold to Indonesia during the Sukarno era, including an SA-2 guidance system, designs for the Whiskey-class submarine, the Riga-class frigate, the Sverdlov- class cruiser, the P-15 Termit anti-ship missile and the Tu-16 Badger bomber. He compromised CIA operations and informants in Indonesia and South Korea. The Soviets paid him a total of $92,000 for information received between 1976 and 1980. On instructions from his KGB handlers, who included Oleg Kalugin,The First Directorate: My 32 Years in Intelligence and Espionage Against the West, by Oleg Kalugin (New York: Basic Books, 2009), 466 pp. Barnett applied for staff positions on the Senate and House intelligence committees and the President's Intelligence Advisory Board, but was unsuccessful. In January 1979, he was rehired by the CIA as a contract agent and if undetected, could have betrayed further CIA secrets. Later in 1979, Barnett was identified as a spy following the release of information provided by Colonel Vladimir Mikhaylovich Piguzov, a KGB officer stationed in Jakarta who had been recruited as a double agent by the CIA. Piguzov was in turn betrayed by Aldrich Ames in 1985 and subsequently executed.Earley, Pete. Confessions of a Spy: The Real Story of Aldrich Ames. Barnett was questioned by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and resigned from his CIA job. In October 1980 Barnett pled guilty to espionage charges. He was sentenced to 18 years imprisonment and was paroled in 1990.  Personal life  David Barnett married Sarah Blount after they met in the 1960s in Washington, DC. Blount had moved to DC in 1964 to work for the Office of Economic Opportunity, and Barnett was in between overseas tours. They married after only four weeks of dating. At the time Blount believed Barnett worked in the Foreign Service, not the CIA. Barnett and his wife were soon stationed in Indonesia, where he ultimately revealed his true position with the CIA to Sarah. She claims that his frequent secrecy with his job is what led to her lack of suspicion when he began working with the Soviets. Barnett and Sarah had three children: Charles, John Henry, and Dorsey, who were between the ages of 12 and 6 at the time of their father's incarceration.

Beginnings and international events Since the late 1970s, a permanent Seminar of the Aesthetics of Media and Communication has been directed by its founder Mario Costa at the University of Salerno. The basic principles of the aesthetics of technological communication were identified and conceptualized in 1983.The history of the \\"aesthetics of communication\\", especially upon its debut in the 1980s, is recorded in the book by Mario Costa,The Aesthetics of Communication. Aesthetic use of simultaneity at a distance, Rome, Castelvecchi, 1999; its basic principles, formulated by Costa, were expressed for the first time in News and Notes, published by the International Center of Aesthetic Communication, Salerno, 1986. A conference on \\"Technological Imaginary\\", held in 1984 at the Museo del Sannio in Benevento, discussed the issue of the new relationship between art and technology and the consequent need to re-evaluate aesthetics, warning that \\"all our future existence will be played at the crossroads between technology and imaginary\\".\\"Aa. Vv., L‚Äôimmaginario tecnologico, Museo del Sannio, Benevento, p. 8. The comprehensive relationship between art and technoscience, technology, and philosophy has also been the theoretical subject of the ten international \\"Artmedia\\" conferences which were held in Salerno and Paris between 1985 and 2008. Particularly relevant were conferences held in Paris between 2002 and 2008, which took place at the Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure, the Bibliotheque Nationale de France (BNF) and the Institut National d'Histoire de l 'Art (INHA), with the partnership of the Soci√©t√© Fran√ßaise d'Esth√©tique, the Universit√© du Qu√©bec √† Montr√©al, the University of Toronto, the Universidade de S√£o Paulo, the Universit√© de Paris 1 Sorbonne, and the U.S. magazine Leonardo.See Mario Costa, Fred Forest (eds) (2011), Ethique, esth√©tique, communication technologique dans l'art contemporain ou le destin du sens, Paris: Institut National Audiovisuel, Editions L'Harmattan, and Dossier Artmedia VIII, in \\"Ligeia\\", Paris, 2002. Continuous debate between artists and theorists Derrick de Kerckhove, Ren√© Berger and Mario Costa, Artmedia IV (1992) Maurizio Bolognini, Richard Kriesche, Mario Costa and Eduardo Kac, Artmedia VII (1999) Artmedia wanted to gather theorists and artists from all over the world and encourage both joint and complementary work, beginning with the need to give attention to theoretical and artistic practices and developing both together. These also contributed towards spreading the spirit of the project, both in a number of festivals and shows, and through their own artworks and research.Antonella Fimiani, Arte & tecnologia, la frontiera-Salerno, in \\"Il Mattino\\", November 24, 1999, p. 23; Sylvie Lisiecki e Marie Saladin, Fenetr√™s sur les arts num√©riques, in \\"Croniques de la Biblioth√®que Nationale de France\\", 46, 2008. Theorists who worked with Artmedia and participated in its activities included Bernard Stiegler, Ren√© Berger, Abraham Moles, Derrick De Kerckhove, Pierre Levy, Gillo Dorfles, Paul Virilio, Frank Popper, Roger Malina, Daniel Charles, Jos√© Jim√©nez, Anne Cauquelin, Edgar Morin, Thierry de Duve, Catherine Millet, Filiberto Menna, Andreas Broeckmann, Rudolf zur Lippe, Edmond Couchot, Dominique Chateau, Yannick Geffroy, Philippe Queau, Arlindo Machado, Tetsuo Kogawa, and Bernard Teyssedre.

The questions raised in various projects promoted by Artmedia, in a continuous dialogue between artists and theorists, led to discussions on topics including Aesthetics of Communication and the anthropology of the future (1985), Global aesthetic communication (1986), Electronic performativity and the art system (1990), Neo-technological arts between aesthetics and communication (1992), Aesthetic research and technology (1995), Developments in aesthetics: change or mutation? (1999), From the Aesthetics of Communication to Net art (2002), and Ethics, aesthetics and techno-communication. The future of meaning (2008). All Artmedia symposiums have been followed by many publications. For the two held in Paris, a complete video recording is also available, and can be viewed at the Institut National de l'Audiovisuel. An assessment of 25 years of Artmedia activity was made into a seminar on The aesthetic object of the future, held at the University of Salerno in 2009. The Artmedia project produced a large number of publications and documents that are being catalogued, with a view to their proper placement and use.

Theme Gita milindam contains 15 gunjans (songs) in different melodious rhythms. The poet swept over untouched horizons and speaks for the common mass. The couple of bumble- bees are the natural singers and enjoyers of life's honey. By taking them as anchors of his presentation of poetic message, the poet has not only shown a creative technique but also suggested his attitude to life. Looking at his off-beat theme, none can deny that he is projecting the voice of the mass and hence he is a postmodern poet. The author of Gita-milindam does not present the theme of courtly love. Instead, while subverting the Jayadeva tradition he has composed a parody that ridicules lyrical romantic love in its lyrical structure, typically popular in the Sanskrit literary tradition. The male and female bumblebees are the hero and heroine of the poem. They present their dialogues in different cantos. The male bee is a passionate lover of sensual enjoyment whereas the female bee opposes it. The male is the hero of the Omar Khayam who wishes to live away his life in sensuality. Parallels are drawn between him and a Tennysonian \\"lotus eater\\" - heedless to the closure of the lotus flower at sunset and even its resultant death. The female partner warns him, reminding him of the contemporary social and economic crises such as child labour, unemployment and political corruption that shatter society as a whole, resulting in severe and pitiable conditions that compel an old woman like archetypical Kunti to moving from door to door. Doctors are taking the lives of living human beings while the god of death takes away only the lives of the dead. We are reminded of the September 11 attacks that devastated New York City. Environmental pollution, children's death due to starvation and many other social problems seek to draw the attention of the bee-poets to presenting their experience rather than the ethereal and unnaturally high pitch of Romanticism of bygone days. The female bee is not a materialist, but certainly a representative of the Marxist socialism objecting to the feudalistic luxury and courtly ideology so typical of the age-old Sanskrit literature. Poet Manomohan has been successful in lyricizing the theme that has for so long been considered anti-lyrical. The reader wonders at how Acharya has overcome the challenging task of reorienting the Sanskrit language to accommodate the contemporary theme in such traditional meters.https://www.scribd.com/doc/51146116/Jayadeva-Restructured While using nine ragas from Jayadeva,(cantos 1-5, 8-10 and 13), he has used Raga from other sources, the six ragas, Abhinava being his own invention.

The present church, which combines a plain, unadorned Gothic Revival exterior with a lavishly decorated interior featuring extensive early 20th-century paintings by Nathaniel Westlake, is the third building used for Roman Catholic worship in the seaside resort. James Burton's new town of 1827, immediately west of Hastings, was home to a convent from 1848; public worship then transferred to a new church nearby in 1866. When this burnt down, prolific and \\"distinguished\\" architect Charles Alban Buckler designed a replacement. The church remains in use as the main place of worship in a parish which extends into nearby Hollington, and has been listed at Grade II by English Heritage for its architectural and historical importance. History St Leonards-on- Sea was conceived and built as a new town by James Burton, a builder, property developer and speculator. In 1828, he bought a large area of wooded, sloping land (formerly part of the Manor of Gensing) which had a long shoreline facing the English Channel. He spent the next few years laying out a high-class planned community with houses, shops, hotels, markets, an Anglican church and facilities suitable for a fashionable seaside resort. Within a few years, it rivalled its ancient neighbour Hastings in size and popularity. A Roman Catholic place of worship was soon provided in the growing town. Rev. John Jones, the Honorary Chaplain of the Bavarian Embassy in London, received from the will of Lady Barbara Stanley a bequest of ¬£10,000, of land and a house in St Leonards-on-Sea, all to be used for \\"religious purposes\\" for the benefit of Roman Catholics. He planned to build a convent for Jesuits, and extended the house for their use. They declared it unsuitable, and the proposed chapel and convent‚Äîlarge, intricately designed buildings in the Italianate style, conceived by Charles Parker‚Äîwere not built. Work on less ambitious Gothic Revival-style buildings began in 1837, overseen by A.W.N. Pugin, and a newly founded order of nuns‚ÄîThe Society of the Holy Child Jesus‚Äîmoved in. Pugin started work on a convent chapel in 1848, but it was not completed until 1869 (by his son Edward Welby) and the convent refectory initially served as a temporary chapel for the sisters and the general public. The permanent chapel was dedicated to St Michael and All Angels. St Michael and All Angels convent chapel was St Leonards-on-Sea's first Roman Catholic place of worship. Relations between the convent sisters and the parish were difficult, and in 1866 a new church was built for public use nearby, after which the convent chapel reverted to private use for The Society of the Holy Child Jesus only. The chosen site, on the west side of Magdalen Road near the convent, was above the east portal of Hastings Tunnel, a railway tunnel near Warrior Square station. The church was designed by Charles Alban Buckler, a Roman Catholic convert and \\"one of the most distinguished early to mid-Victorian Roman Catholic architects\\". It was founded on 21 August 1865 and opened for public worship on 24 May 1866, and was consecrated in 1868 by the Bishop of Southwark Thomas Grant. Its most distinctive fixture was a large piet√† carved in oak. It was dedicated to St Thomas of Canterbury (Thomas Becket) and the English Martyrs (Catholics executed during the Reformation) and was registered for marriages in June 1866. The church was destroyed by fire on 3 January 1887. Within two months, a tin tabernacle had been erected on the site to allow worship to continue while a new church was designed and built. Charles Alban Buckler was again asked to design the replacement church. Construction started on 30 March 1888, although the foundation stone was laid on 21 July of that year. Builder Edmund Boniface executed Buckler's design, and the new Church of St Thomas of Canterbury and English Martyrs opened to the public on 6 July 1889. Between 1908 and 1911, Nathaniel Westlake painted the interior with a range of vivid murals depicting scenes from the Bible. Much of this was stencilled, but the work is unusually extensive and it is unusual for such designs to have survived in churches. Weather damage necessitated repairs in the 1950s, but by 1981 the murals' condition was so poor that whitewashing over them appeared to be the only course of action. Enough money was raised for a full restoration to take place; artist Charles Camm was responsible for this. Architecture There is a great contrast between the austere, minimalist exterior of the Church of St Thomas of Canterbury and English Martyrs and its elaborately decorated interior. Architecturally, Charles Alban Buckler was a medievalist who worked almost exclusively in the Gothic Revival style‚Äîparticularly Early English Gothic. His church at St Leonards-on-Sea was a good example of this: typical Gothic exterior features included trefoil and tall lancet windows, a multi-sided apse and buttressing. The walls are of ironstone and Bath Stone with some irregular rock facing. The plan consists of a nave with six bays and vaulted side chapels treated like simple arcades, a chancel with its own side chapels (all with apsidal ends), a porch, sanctuary, narthex and mortuary chapel (a later addition). The building lacks a tower or spire, and the effect from the outside is an appearance \\"as sparing as a friars' church\\". The \\"richly decorated\\" interior has been described as \\"unexpected\\" after this simple exterior. The vividly coloured painted murals, some purely decorative and some representative of Biblical scenes, date from 1908‚Äì1911 and have been repaired and enhanced since. Some windows have stained glass, apparently by Charles Eamer Kempe and the Clayton and Bell and Hardman & Co. firms. Nathaniel Westlake's images include St Michael (in the side chapel dedicated to St George), the English Martyrs and the Hand of God above the chancel arch, various saints and prophets on the chancel ceiling, a Nativity on the south wall and a Last Supper on the north wall. Original fittings include some pews in the nave, a carved organ case, a marble font with carvings depicting the Seven Sacraments, a similar pulpit with images of saints and (in the Lady chapel) a Bath Stone altar with depictions of the Virgin Mary, Jesus and angels. The church today The Church of the Holy Redeemer in Hollington is in the parish. The Church of St Thomas of Canterbury and English Martyrs was listed at Grade II by English Heritage on 13 December 2006. This defines it as a \\"nationally important\\" building of \\"special interest\\". As of February 2001, there were 521 Grade II listed buildings, and 535 listed buildings of all grades, in the borough of Hastings. In an architectural survey of the Diocese of Arundel and Brighton's churches undertaken in 2005 before the church was listed, it was stated that it was \\"likely to be listable\\" in the future. The authors noted that Buckler's other churches: St Richard's (Slindon), St Edward the Confessor, and the former St Peter's Church (Shoreham-by-Sea) were already listed and the interior decoration scheme \\"[made] it special\\". It is one of several listed churches in St Leonards-on-Sea: the Anglican churches of Christ Church, St Peter's and St John the Evangelist are classed at the higher Grade II*, while St Leonard's Anglican parish church, St Leonard's Baptist Church and the Greek Orthodox St Mary Magdalene's Church, along with the former St Leonards-on-Sea Congregational Church, are also Grade II-listed. Pugin's former convent chapel, now disused, also has Grade II* status. The church is one of two in the parish of St Leonards-on-Sea and Hollington. This is one of five parishes (consisting of seven churches) which make up the Deanery of St Leonards-on- Sea, which is in turn one of 13 deaneries in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Arundel and Brighton. The other church in the parish is the Church of the Holy Redeemer in Hollington, an ancient village which developed in the interwar and postwar eras into a large suburb of Hastings. Wilfred Mangan's Vernacular brick church of 1934 became part of the parish in 1959 and was extended and reordered internally in the 1980s. There is another Roman Catholic church in the borough: Our Lady Star of the Sea (1882) in Hastings Old Town. Two Masses are celebrated each Sunday at the church. Confession is heard weekly on Saturday mornings. The church is licensed for worship in accordance with the Places of Worship Registration Act 1855 and has the registration number 31803.

TMOS is based on the principles of total internal reflection (TIR), frustration of TIR (FTIR) and field sequential colour generation (FSC). This combination of features make it suitable for applications such as mobile phones, televisions and signalling systems. Larry F. Hodges, \\"Time-Multiplexed Stereoscopic Computer Graphics,\\" IEEE Computer Graphics March/April 1992 (vol. 12 no. 2) pp. 20-30 DOI Bookmark:IEEE Computer Society Components A TMOS display system consists of a group of sub-systems * the illumination system; colour generation is based on the conventional tristimulus model, so the system comprises a group of red, green and blue LEDs * a Light guide , of high quality optical glass. The illumination system is attached to one of its edges and the other three edges are covered with mirrors to keep the reflective light inside the guide. * a drive control at the individual pixel level, a simple variable capacitor architecture that works as an optical shutter for each pixel in the system. The capacitor consists on two conductive parallel planes: a transparent conductor on the light guide and a thin continuous layer of conductive material placed inside the active layer. * the Opcuity active layer, the characteristic part of TMOS technology. It includes a base carrier film, a conductor and micro-optic structures that define the light output performance of the display system. These structures are facing the light guide and there are so small that there are hundreds for each pixel. of them. * the Drive control circuitry system. The initial prototype has all of the control logic programmed in a FPGA processor. A TMOS unit is arranged as a set of layers placed atop another in the following order: the light guide, a transparent conductive layer, a TFT structure and the Opcuity active layer which includes a conductive layer. Operating principle # The illumination system emits periodically red, green and blue light, each colour cycles for an equal period of time in a very high frequency. # The coloured light enters inside de guide light, the mirrored edges cause a continual TIR reflections producing a highly uniform of light energy within the light guide. # The light is trapped in the light guide until a voltage differential is created between the two conductive layers of the capacitor at any pixel area. When it happens the two conductive planes attract each other via Coulomb attraction. # The Opcuity active layer is the only moving part of TMOS and it is pulled down until it touches the light guide. Then, the specific pixel is activated and the light escaped through it due to the phenomenon frustration of total internal reflection (FTIR). # When the voltage differential disappears, the active layer returns to its initial position and the light is trapped again in the light guide. When the two conductive layers are in contact is said that the pixel is open or active (ON), when the layers are separated then the pixel is closed or inactive (OFF) . The duration of the charge determines the amount of time the shutter is open or closed. To generate images displays, the previous process is specific for each pixel. The color generation is based on the field sequential colour (FSC) system. Colour generation Traditional displays use three part pixel, each pixel is created by displaying different intensities of three dots (red, blue and green) so close together that the human eye perceives them as a single colour. This technique takes advantage of the spatial additive colour. However, TMOS technology is based on temporal additive colour, it exploits the temporal resolving power of the human visual system. Red, green and blue light bursts are emitted at sufficiently high frequency that the human eye only perceive a single colours. Different durations of each burst, create different colours. In TMOS the emitting duration of each burst is the same for the three colors, but the amount of time that each pixel stays open or closed can be only a percentage of the total time controlled by the quantity of the TFT charge (amount of time that the active layer is in contact with the light guide). Therefore, each coloured pixel is generated combining the precise time that each pixel is kept open for each colour burst. Depending on the combination, a million of colours can be created. For instance: :To get white the pixel remains open the 100% of the total time for each burst and for black each pixel is closed the entire time.:To produce grey, the pixel should be active half of the total time for each burst (when the three values of the three components are equal, a grey is produced) :To create red, the pixel must be closed during blue and green burst, the percentage of the red cycle the pixel is open determines the shade of red. General features * Brightness: 1400 cd/m2 in a 12.1-inch display with 176¬∞ viewing angle at 13.2 watts. Even, it can achieve values of 3.430 cd/m2 at 30 watts. * Night vision: Because the red LED is controlled independently, there is no necessity to add any infrared filter to achieve night vision compatibility. * Resolution: TMOS can achieve mm dot pitch due to its unicellular pixel structure. * Viewing angle: Without additional steering optics angles as narrow as 25¬∞ √ó 12¬∞ (12.5¬∞ left, 12.5¬∞ right, 6¬∞ up, 6¬∞ down) can be achieved. * Grey levels: 24 bits or 36 bits for special inherent systems. The grey levels for monochromatic infrared are three times the primary colour gray scale for visible operation. * Dimming range: 34 dB * Video Capability: 60 frames/second * Shock and vibration: TMOS has important resistance to mechanical stresses during operation as the applied forces are distributed globally and not locally at the individual pixels. The low mass and the lamination structure of the active layer mitigate the resonances and modes. * Mean time between failures: The first components it is expected to fail in a TMOS technology is the illumination system. LEDs usually have 100,000 hours' MTBF under continuous operation; as TMOS uses LEDs at duty cycle, the maximum expected MTBF is 300,000 hours. Advantages TMOS technology offers many advantages over other popular technologies like LCD, plasma and OLED. :Simplicity: The simple TMOS structure brings most of the others advantages. The five layers of an LCD become only one in TMOS. This involves a simpler manufacturing process and increases the performance. : Energy efficiency: TMOS is ten times more efficient than an LCD. In LCD less than 5‚Äì10% of the energy input is transmitted as light output, while in TMOS 61% percent of the energy is transmitted. Low power consumption makes TMOS ideal for battery-powered applications. : Low cost: Because of the TMOS simple structure the manufacturing process becomes simpler and the total cost lower. TMOS devices can be 60% cheaper than the others. :Good contrast and brightness: TMOS display systems produce 10% more brilliant images and with a better contrast ratio (4500:1) comparing with LCD (2500:1) and others (700:1) :Mean time between failures: TMOS life could achieve 300,000 hours, overcoming the 10,000 hours of OLED, 30,000 of plasma displays, 40,000 hours of CTRS and the 100,000 hours of LCD. :Scalability: Scale flexibility is another important characteristic. TMOS is the first technology capable of supporting different configurations and sizes up to 110‚Ä≥. Until now, OLED achieved 20‚Ä≥, LCD 54‚Ä≥ and plasma 72‚Ä≥. :Variety of applications: Traditional displays have specific applications: OLED for mobiles, plasma for television and LCD for computers. Thanks to scalability, TMOS will be suitable for mobile, television and computers displays. Disadvantages The main disadvantage is the necessity of a very high velocity; if it is insufficient a rainbow effect could appear at blink. Future developments In the future, it aims to improve efficiency and features of that kind of screens. Some of these improvements are going to be a new guide light material, polycarbonate or flexible polymer, and the enlargement of the LED's gamut. What is more, the TFTs structure is going to be eliminated and a system of a stripes (rows and columns) called Simple Matrix will provide individual pixel control. The following features are being investigated for TMOS displays: :Flexibility, allowing radius of curvature up to 20 times the displays thickness. This characteristic will enable the creation of photo-realistic images, the development of \\"home theatres\\" that surround the viewer like IMAX screens. :Readability in bright sunlight so they could be used for road and highway signs, tradeshows...etc. :Transparency, displays could have a transparent rear therefore, they could be used as windows from the inside and as displays from the outside.

The company develops and produces systems and products for bonding, sealing, damping, reinforcing, and protecting. Currently, it has over 25,000 employees, subsidiaries in more than 100 countries, and an annual sales turnover of CHF 8.1 billion. Sika was founded in 1910 when Kaspar Winkler laid the cornerstone for the firm. Winkler worked himself up from poverty to become a successful entrepreneur, and by the 1920s he was already engaged in founding subsidiaries abroad. Besides the brand Sika, more than 900 product brands are in use including Sikaflex, SikaTack, Sika ViscoCrete, SikaBond, Sikafloor, Sika CarboDur Sikagard, Sika MaxTack, Sikaplan, Sikament, Sikadur, SikaLastic, SikaRoof MTC, Sika Unitherm and Sika Sarnafil. In 2019, Sika acquired PAREX Group, a global company headquartered in France with more than 4,500 employees and 1,034 million ‚Ç¨ on revenues. Sika AG is the legal entity for the holding company, which includes the Sika organizations worldwide, Sika Technology AG (Research and Development) and Sika Services AG (Corporate functions supporting all organizations worldwide). History=1910 - 1950 * 1910: Kaspar Winkler founded Sika: Winkler's first inventions were agents to protect and clean granite (Conservado, Purigo) and a waterproofing agent for mortars. This waterproofing agent named Sika-1 is still sold today. *1912: Subsidiary founded: In Southern Germany a subsidiary with its own, small-scale manufacturing facility was founded. Leadership capacity and connections were insufficient for determined expansion. By hiring a Director for Foreign Operations who cared about the Sika operations, more subsidiaries were founded in England, Italy, and France. *1918: The Swiss Federal Railways ran successful trials: The Swiss Federal Railways ran successful trials using Sika to waterproof the tunnels of the Gotthard section. This became necessary so that electric trains could be used as well. The Swiss National Railways waterproofed 67 tunnels with Sika during the following years, which was Sika's breakthrough, as it represented Sika's first big reference project, a true landmark. *1935: Worldwide Presence: Before World War II Fritz Schenker, Winkler's son-in-law pushed the expansion in Europe, North- and South America and in Asia. 1950 - 2000 *1971: Second generation change: Romuald Burkard took over the leadership of the group of companies which by 1968 had become a single integral corporate structure with Sika Finanz AG. Subsequently, Sika was listed on the Swiss Stock Exchange. *1990: Weak Profitability: 1990s were not an easy decade for Sika AG. The solution to survive the difficult times was achieved by withdrawing from less lucrative, non-core businesses, such as the building of robots used to restore sewer lines. Sika also abandoned the manufacture of road building products. Sika came close to selling its sealing membranes business to Sarnafil. *2000: Core competencies: Sika summarizes its core competencies as follows: sealing, bonding, damping, reinforcing and protecting. 2000 - present *2009: Dubai Metro‚Äôs first line: The Dubai Metro's first line was inaugurated. The second line is scheduled to begin by operating in 2011. There are 58.7 km of overground track in tunnels clad with 53000 prefabricated tubbing elements. *2010: 100-year anniversary: Worldwide celebrations at the different subsidiaries with the attendance of the owner family, active and retired Senior Managers, and others. On the threshold of its 100-year anniversary, Sika starts running the platform Sika Experiences which promotes internships and enables students and young professionals insights into this industry. *2012: A new president for the Board of Directors and a new CEO: Paul H√§lg, CEO of the D√§twyler Gruppe, is elected as president of the Board of Directors of Sika AG. Jan Jenisch takes over the CEO position from Ernst B√§rtschi upon his retirement on January 1, 2012. *2013: Target Markets & Regions: Sika defines its target markets as concrete, waterproofing, roofing, flooring, sealing and bonding, refurbishment and industry. The geographical regions are reduced from six to four: EMEA (Europe, Middle East, Africa), North America, Latin America and Asia/Pacific. The former regions Europe South and Europe North are incorporated in the new region EMEA. The region IMEA is dissolved and India is included in the region Asia/Pacific.

Biography Neveu studied in Paris at the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure (ENS). In 1969 he received his diploma (Th√®se de troisi√®me cycle) at University of Paris XI in Orsay with Philippe Meyer and Claude Bouchiat and in 1971 he completed his doctorate (Doctorat d'√âtat) there. In 1969 he and his classmate from ENS and Orsay, Jo√´l Scherk, together with John H. Schwarz and David Gross at Princeton University, examined divergences in one-loop diagrams of the bosonic string theory (and discovered the cause of tachyon divergences). From 1971 to 1974 Neveu was at the Laboratory for High Energy Physics of the University of Paris XI where he and Scherk showed that spin-1 excitations of strings could describe Yang‚ÄìMills theories. In 1971, Neveu with John Schwarz in Princeton developed, at the same time as Pierre Ramond (1971), the first string theory that also described fermions (called RNS formalism after its three originators).; ; ; . The version of Neveu and Schwarz differed from that of Ramond in the boundary terms. By the choice of the boundary terms they obtained fermion pairs to produce a model of the pion, a boson. An important advantage of this string theory at that time was also that the unphysical tachyon of the bosonic string theory was eliminated. This was an early appearance of the ideas of supersymmetry which were being developed independently at that time by several groups. A few years later, Neveu, working in Princeton with David Gross, developed the Gross‚ÄìNeveu model.A quantum-field-theoretic model of Dirac fermions with a four-fermion interaction vertex and unitary symmetry in one spatial dimension. It is renormalizable and asymptotically free. In this model phenomena such as dynamic bulk production and spontaneous symmetric breaking can be studied. With Roger Dashen and Brosl Hasslacher, he examined, among other things, quantum-field-theoretic models of extended hadrons and semiclassical approximations in quantum field theory which are reflected in the DHN method of the quantization of solitons. From 1972 to 1977 Neveu was at the Institute for Advanced Study while spending half of the time in Orsay. From 1974 to 1983 he was at the Laboratory for Theoretical Physics of the ENS and from 1983 to 1989 in the theory department at CERN. From 1975 he was Maitre de recherche in the CNRS and from 1985 Directeur de recherche. From 1989 he was at the Institute (Laboratory) for Theoretical Physics of the University of Montpellier II (now L2C, Laboratory Charles Coulomb). In 1994/5 he was a visiting professor in the University of California, Berkeley. In 1973, Neveu received the Paul Langevin Prize of the Soci√©t√© Fran√ßaise de Physique. In 1988 he received the Gentner-Kastler Prize awarded jointly by the Soci√©t√© Fran√ßaise de Physique and the Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft (DPG). In 2020 he was awarded the Dirac Medal of the ICTP.Dirac Medal 2020 of ICTP Neveu is married and has three children.

Listed at , 170 lb., he batted and threw left-handed. Career Born in Columbus, Ohio, the 17-year-old Dick Hoover was signed by the New York Giants as an amateur free agent prior to the start of the 1943 season. He was assigned to the Appalachian League, where he finished 11‚Äì1 to lead the league in winning percentage (.917) while helping lead the Bristol Twins to a 74‚Äì35 pennant-winning record. But his baseball career was interrupted in 1944 after he entered service in the United States Navy during World War II.Baseball in Wartime ‚Äì Those Who Served Following his discharge in 1946, Hoover was part of successive transactions between the Giants, Cubs and Pirates organizations, playing for six different teams in a span of three years. Before the 1949 season, Hoover was sent by the Giants along with Gary Gearhart and cash consideration to the Atlanta Crackers of the Southern Association in exchange for Davey Williams. By then, the Crackers were a Class AA affiliate of the Boston Braves, a period during which they won more games than any other league team.Baseball Players of the 1950s: A Biographical Dictionary of All 1,560 Major Leaguers ‚Äì Rich Marazzi, Len Fiorito. Publisher: McFarland & Company, 2004. Format: Hardcover, 450pp. Language: English. Hoover had two solid years with the Crackers, after going 11‚Äì11 with a 3.97 ERA in 1949 and 16‚Äì7, 3.35 in 1950. He was promoted to Triple A Milwaukee Brewers of the American Association in 1951, ending with a 5‚Äì4 record and a 3.14 ERA in 27 games, basically as a middle reliever and spot starter. Hoover opened 1952 with the Boston Braves, pitching for them from April 16 through April 23. He made two relief appearances, allowing four runs on eight hits and three walks while striking out one batter in 4‚Öî innings of work. He did not have a decision, but gained notoriety by serving up the home run ball hit by future Hall of Famer Hoyt Wilhelm in his first Major League at bat. It would be the only homer Wilhelm would hit in his 20-year major league career.Baseball Players of the 1950s Following his brief stint in the majors, Hoover returned to Milwaukee for the rest of the 1952 season. He went 10‚Äì5 while leading the pitching staff with a 2.60 ERA. He finished his career with Triple A Columbus Jets in 1955. His career highlight came on August 14, when he hurled a no-hitter against the Richmond Virginians. In an 11-season, minors career Hoover posted an 89‚Äì72 record and a 3.44 ERA in 313 pitching appearances. After baseball retirement in 1955, Hoover worked as a police sergeant in his native Columbus.

He was elected as the Conservative Party of Canada Member of Parliament for the riding of Labrador in the 2011 federal election. Penashue was the first Innu from Labrador to be elected to the House of Commons of Canada and the first Innu cabinet minister in Canadian history. He was also the first centre-right MP to be elected from the riding of Labrador since 1968, and only the second ever to win it since Newfoundland and Labrador joined Canada in 1949. Following allegations of irregularities in his campaign spending, Penashue announced on March 14, 2013 that he would resign and seek to regain his seat in a by-election. In the resulting by-election, held on May 13, 2013, he was defeated by Yvonne Jones of the Liberal Party. He unsuccessfully ran again in the riding in the 2015 federal election. Background Penashue was born in the Innu community of Sheshatshiu, Newfoundland and Labrador. His mother Elizabeth is an authorhttps://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/elizabeth-penashue- book-launch-1.5121538. He attended elementary and secondary school in Sheshatshiu before continuing his education in St. John's, where he graduated from Brother Rice High School and pursued studies at Memorial University of Newfoundland. Penashue assumed a number of leadership roles in the Labrador Innu community, from Land Claims Director, Executive Director and Financial Administrator with the Naskapi Montagnais Innu to Grand Chief of the Innu Nation. Penashue was elected President of the Innu Nation at the age of 26, and served as Grand Chief of the Innu Nation, for twelve years, from 1990 to 1997 and 1999 to 2004, and was the driving force behind the negotiation of the impacts-benefit agreement between the Innu Nation and the Voisey's Bay Nickel Company. He was also elected to the position of Deputy Grand Chief of the Innu Nation in Sheshatshiu in 2007 and stepped down on March 9, 2010. Federal politics Penashue was elected to the House of Commons of Canada in the 2011 Canadian federal election, in the riding of Labrador. Penashue's challenger, Liberal incumbent Todd Russell, had originally been declared by the media as retaining his seat early on election night but after the last five polls were counted Penashue overtook Russell and was ultimately declared the winner. Penashue's original margin of victory of 231 votes was reduced to 79 votes on recount. Penashue was one of two Innu in Parliament. Jonathan Genest-Jourdain, the New Democratic MP from the neighbouring riding of Manicouagan in Quebec, was the other. Cabinet Minister Penashue was the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and President of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada from May 18, 2011 until his resignation on March 14, 2013. 2011 election campaign irregularities and aftermath Penashue's campaign took 28 ineligible campaign contributions totaling $27,850 in cash and $18,710 in in- kind contributions from Provincial Airlines for services provided. Elections Canada deemed the contributions ineligible and Penashue's campaign was forced to pay $26,850 on November 28, 2012 and $18,710 on March 4, 2013 to the Receiver General of Canada. After the 2011 election the Peneshue campaign had $4000 but still owed $15,000 from a $25,000 zero interest loan to the Innu Development Limited Partnership, a firm managed by his brother-in-law, Paul Rich. Interest free loans are not allowed by Canadian election law. In November 2012, the Conservative Party transferred $30,000 to the campaign and a further $14,350 on March 1, 2013. On March 14, 2013, Penashue resigned from Parliament. At the same time, he announced he would seek to return to his old seat via a by-election. In the resulting by-election, held on May 13, 2013, he was defeated by Yvonne Jones of the Liberal Party. In July 2015, seven companies acknowledged that they made illegal donations to Penashue's 2011 election campaign. Penashue's official agent in the 2011 campaign, Reg Bowers, has been charged with three counts of accepting illegal corporate contributions under the Canada Elections Act. Penashue stated he feels badly for his former official agent. On September 3, 2015, Penashue was nominated as Conservative candidate in his former riding in the 2015 Canadian federal election, again running against Yvonne Jones. He lost by a margin of over 50% and was pushed into third place. Penashue later served as one of two Innu Nation representatives on the Independent Expert Advisory Committee examining health concerns surrounding the Muskrat Falls hydroelectric project.

It was confirmed by a plebiscite in September 1968 following an intensive three-month propaganda campaign by the regime. It retained the Greek monarchy, and envisaged a return to a parliamentary system. The parliament was to be reduced to 150 members. King Constantine II, who had been in self-imposed exile since his failed 13 December 1967 counter-coup, would be allowed to return after the first parliamentary election unless the government called him back sooner. However, the junta, headed by Prime Minister Georgios Papadopoulos, stated that elections would not be held until the \\"Greek mentality\\" had been sufficiently reformed. Most of the guarantees of civil rights were suspended until civilian rule could be restored. The constitution explicitly reserved a regulatory role for the Greek military, which was tasked with the \\"maintenance of the social and political order\\". Further watchdogs were envisaged in the form of a constitutional court and a powerful National Security Council. In the event, as elections were never held and military rule continued, the constitution was never fully implemented. It was replaced by the Greek Constitution of 1973, again drafted by the junta, which abolished the monarchy and created a presidential republic (see Metapolitefsi).

Trottier was elected in the 2011 federal election when he defeated the Leader of the Liberal Party, Michael Ignatieff, who was also the Leader of the Official Opposition. In February 2015, Trottier was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs and for La Francophonie. Previously, he was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Public Works and Government Services in September 2013. Early years and education Born and raised in St. Paul, Alberta, he was born to Dr. L√©on Trottier and artist Terry Trottier. After graduating from St. Paul Regional High School in 1983, Bernard Trottier went on to earn his B.Sc.Eng. from the University of Alberta in 1988 and his M.B.A. from the Richard Ivey School of Business at the University of Western Ontario in 1992. He also attended l'√âcole des Hautes √âtudes Commerciales, l'Universit√© de Montr√©al/√âcole Polytechnique de Montr√©al, and the University of Ottawa. Business career and community activities Since graduating from the University of Western Ontario in 1992, Trottier has resided in Toronto. Trottier was a management consultant in the Toronto area before joining IBM Global Business Services as a senior consulting manager, a job he held at the time he was elected to Parliament. He previously served as the President of the Etobicoke‚ÄîLakeshore Conservative Association and of the Sunnylea Co-operative Nursery School. He also volunteered as a coach in the Royal York Baseball League and the Islington Rangers Soccer League. Entrance to politics In the 2011 federal election, Trottier won the Toronto riding of Etobicoke‚ÄîLakeshore, defeating Leader of the Liberal Party, Michael Ignatieff, who was also the incumbent Leader of the Official Opposition. The Liberal Party had held 20 of the 22 Toronto ridings prior to the election. Trottier was initially considered a sacrificial lamb candidate; even he initially didn't expect to win. However, he benefited from a collapse in Liberal support in Toronto which saw the Conservatives claim a total of eight seats in the city. He also benefited from the endorsement of Toronto Mayor and Etobicoke resident Rob Ford. Voters were reportedly also concerned that Ignatieff might resign in the event the Liberals didn't do well.Church, Elizabeth. The sacrificial lamb who slew Ignatieff. The Globe and Mail, 2011-05-03. Reports suggested that Ignatieff had initially promised to move into a home inside his riding, but instead he resided in the Downtown Toronto neighbourhood of Yorkville, which rankled Etobicoke‚ÄîLakeshore residents and reinforced perceptions of Ignatieff's political opportunism. Trottier was defeated by Liberal James Maloney in the 2015 election, taking 32 percent of the vote amid the Liberal wave that swept through Toronto.

It is directed by Iranian film maker Mohsen Makhmalbaf. The movie is about a little boy who has the onerous task of earning money for his family, but is always enchanted and distracted by music. It is set in Tajikistan. Synopsis Khorshid lives with his mother in a house near a river somewhere in Tajikistan. The landlord comes every morning to ask for the rent. Khorshid has to provide the money or else they'll have to leave. His blindness has given him an amazing skill in tuning musical instruments which gets him a job at an instrument making workshop. But Khorshid is mesmerized by sonorous music all the time; whenever he hears a great musician play, he loses track of time and place. This causes him to lose his place and have to work late. He struggles to find a balance between his love of music and his task as a breadwinner. Overview Makhmalbaf is a controversial figure. For example, \\"when he was seventeen years old he had picked up a knife to attack a police officer to steal his gun to rob a bank to launch a revolution.\\"Dabashi, Hamid. (2009) Post-Orientalism: Knowledge and Power in Time of Terror. page 172 His revolutionary zeal is manifest through his first works, e.g. Boycott (film). He himself divided his works into four phases in an article in The New York Times: \\"The first four films, made before 1985, are thinly disguised religious proselytizing. From 1985 to 1990, when the ruling mullahs loosened censorship enough to allow movies to focus on general social problems, his perspective changed...After this, Mr. Makhmalbaf largely abandoned traditional narrative...First, he made what he calls his philosophical films, then he made the recent poetic movies that have landed him in trouble with the censors.\\"https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/08/movies/an- unlikely-auteur-from-iran.html Sokout belongs to his poetic style of film making, where he gets rid of the shackles of classical narration and depicts some of his favorite themes by using symbolism coming from Sufi traditions. Sufism, music and universal truth The movie is replete with symbols of Sufism. From the use of music to achieve ecstasy; the nature, and the broken mirror, the repeated image of the river, to the light coming from above, the symbolic representation of mystic interpretations of Islam appear throughout the movie. Makhmalbaf doesn't stay local on this matter. His use of Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven) shows that he deliberately wants to say the themes he is referring to are of a universal nature according to him, and not just mundane, ephemeral, matters. The broken mirror is an icon borrowed from Rumi, which represents only a part of the truth. Everyone possesses a part of the mirror, i.e. a part of the truth, and thinks she has all of it. But, of course to a Sufi, none of the parts equals to the whole truth. Professor Ridgeon is among those who emphasize extensively on the implications of the mirror in Makhmalbaf's movies, particularly this one.Ridgeon, L.

He was a frequent collaborator and friend of actor-producer Burt Lancaster.  Career  Kibbee began his career writing for radio in 1931, working with Jack Lescoulie, and later collaborated with Nat Hiken, writing for the series The Grouch Club, which starred Lescoulie. After this, Kibbee worked on Fred Allen's staff and wrote for Groucho Marx, before serving in the U.S. Air Force during World War II. Following his military service, he collaborated with Joseph Fields to write the screenplay for the Marx Brothers 1946 film A Night in Casablanca. He frequently worked on films for Burt Lancaster, including The Crimson Pirate (1952), Vera Cruz (1954), The Devil's Disciple (1959), and Valdez Is Coming (1971). For a time they teamed to form \\"Norlan Productions\\". Together they wrote, produced and directed The Midnight Man (1974). Some of his best-known films were A Night in Casablanca (1946), The Crimson Pirate (1952), The Appaloosa (1966) and Valdez Is Coming (1971). Prominent TV producer and writer Norman Lear also acknowledged that while he would sometimes do the opening monologues for The Tennessee Ernie Ford Show, Kibbee was in fact the show's main writer.https://variety.com/2015/tv/features/norman-lear-recalls-early-days-as- tv-comedy-writer-1201629371/ In a 2015 interview with Variety, Lear credited both Kibbee and Hiken as his two mentors. He also wrote for TV shows, among them The Virginian, It Takes a Thief (which he created) and Columbo. Kibbee won Emmy awards for his work on the short-lived 1961 series The Bob Newhart Show, Columbo and Barney Miller.  HUAC Informer  In the early '50s, Kibbee was named as a former member of the Communist party by screenwriter Martin Berkeley along with 155 others. Kibbee had become a member in 1937, \\"by way of the Hollywood Anti-Nazi League and out three years later by way of the Nazi- Soviet Pact\\" He was also named by his colleague and Hecht-Lancaster executive Harold Hecht. Kibbee was then required to testify before the committee which he did, believing to have mostly named those who had named him. Kibbee broke off with Hecht but continued to work for the company on a freelance basis. He retained his friendship with Lancaster, allegedly warning to distance himself from Hecht. Lancaster had been a vocal critic of the House Un-American Activities Committee. Kibbee is one of the interview subjects in Naming Names, the definitive history of the Hollywood Blacklist by journalist Victor Navasky. The author discovered that like many who had testified, Kibbee was mistaken and had in fact given names that were not previously known to the committee.

History The chapel was commissioned by Niccol√≤ dei BufaliniHis full name was Niccol√≤ di Manno Bufalini di Citt√† di Castello (~1450 - 1506) for his mortuary chapel in the church of Santa Maria in Aracoeli. Bufalini was a prelate, citizen of Citt√† di Castello, who worked as abbreviator 'The abbreviators di parco maggiore, which are all prelates draw the Papal bulls, and send them when they are written.

Several important painters, including Pietro Perugino, Sandro Botticelli, Luca Signorelli, and Pinturicchio, had finished the wall decoration of the Sistine Chapel (1482), and had returned to their hometowns, with the exception of Pinturicchio, who had formed a workshop including some of the collaborators in that work. Pinturicchio, who had been so far outshone by Perugino's fame, could exploit his presence in Rome to obtain the commission of his first great work, the Bufalini Chapel, also favored by the common origin with Riccomanno Bufalini. The painter had already executed at least one work for the latter's family, a Madonna now in the Municipal Gallery of Citt√† di Castello (c. 1480). No documents about the works' execution exist, but they are generally dated to around 1484-1486.Other sources date the frescoes incorrectly to the 1490s. The frescoes suffered some damage and repainting, and were subsequently restored in 1955-1956 and 1981-1982. Description The chapel has a rectangular plan, with a cross-vault and a pavement decorated by Cosmatesque mosaics. The frescoes occupy three walls and the vault, and portray the life and miracles of Bernardino of Siena, a Franciscan Friar recently canonized. The church was in fact held by this monastic order at the time, and the frescoes also include two scenes of St. Francis of Assisi's life. The Bufalini family had strong ties with Bernardino, since the latter had resolved disputes between them and the Baglioni and Del Monte families. Detail of St. John the Evangelist, in the vault. Vault The paintings on the vault were the first to be completed. They depict the four Evangelists, within four bright oval almonds, according to a layout inspired by Perugino. The Evangelists' postures were carefully studied and are more lively than those by Perugino. The Glory of St. Bernardino. Central wall The central wall is decorated with the Glory of St. Bernardino, on two levels as was the lost Assumption by Perugino. The lower section portrays Bernardino on a rock, with open arms, surmounted by two angels crowning him. He is flanked by the saints Augustine and Antony of Padua, while in the background is a landscape inspired by those of Umbria. The upper sector depicts a blessing Christ within an almond, with angels and musicians. This fresco shows a more lively composition than Perugino's, both in the figures and the rocks in the landscape, which do not follow a symmetrical pattern and are spatially deeper. Bernardino holds a book on which is written PATER MANIFESTAVI NOMEN TVVM OMNIBVS (\\"Father, I have shown your name to everyone\\"), the words the friars were chanting as Bernardino passed away on Ascension eve, 1444. Under the previous scenes is a monochrome band, today only partially readable: It originally housed blind niches and reliefs, of which one remains today with a military procession with prisoners and satyrs. It is one of the first examples of the taste for antiquities which was becoming widespread in Rome at the time, and which was used also by Filippino Lippi in the Carafa Chapel in Santa Maria sopra Minerva. Right wall For the right wall, which features a double mullioned window, Pinturicchio adopted an illusionistic perspective, painting two fake symmetrical windows, one with a blessing Eternal Father and one with a dove, an early Christian symbol of eternal life. The wall contains also two scenes with episodes of the life of St. Francis of Assisi: The first is the Renunciation to the Patrimony, characterized by an oblique perspective, which takes advantage of the piers of the arches, having a grotesque decoration; the second depicts St. Francis Receiving the Stigmata, featuring in the background a view of the Verna Sanctuary over a rocky peak. Under the real window is an illusory opening with five characters: among them is an aged friar, perhaps the convent's prior, and a lay figure that resembles him, perhaps an administrator of the basilica. The Funerals of St. Bernardino. Riccomanno Bufalini is depicted standing on the left, next to St. Bernardino. Left wall The left wall comprises two scenes organized vertically, divided by a painted frieze. The upper lunette shows the romitaggio (hermitage) of the young Bernardino; below are the Funerals of Bernardino, set in an urban scene with a chessboard-like pavement, painted using geometrical perspective. The latter has its vanishing point in an edifice with central plan, taken from Perugino's Delivery of the Keys. Pinturicchio, however, departed from that model by using two buildings of different heights at the sides. On the left is a loggiato, supported by piers decorated with fanciful gilded candelabra. On the right is a cubic building connected through a double loggia to the landscape and the bright sky in the background. The foreground depicts the saints' funerals. Bernardino lies on a catafalque, which, thanks to its oblique perspective, increases the depth of the scene and the interaction between the characters. Friars, pilgrims and other common people are approaching the corpse to pay homage; on the sides are two richly dressed characters, identified as Riccomanno Bufalini (on the left, with a fur-lined hood and the gloves) and a member of his family. The remaining characters are used to portray a series of miracles attributed to Bernardino during his life: the healing of a blind man(who hints at his eyes), the resurrection of someone possessed, the healing of a dead newborn, the healing of Lorenzo di Niccol√≤ da Prato, wounded by a bull, and the pacification of the Umbrian families. In the fresco, Perugino's influence on Pinturicchio is manifest: the Umbrian-Perugian perspective rationality, the variety of types and attitudes of the characters, inspired by Florentine painters such as Benozzo Gozzoli or Domenico Ghirlandaio, the striking appearance of the poor pilgrims and beggars, derived from Flemish painting. The candelabra grotesque decoration is inspired by contemporary examples discovered at Rome in the Domus Aurea. These elements are contained in one of the few drawings certainly attributable to Pinturicchio, housed in the Kupferstichkabinett of Berlin (n. 5192). In his later works, the quality of Pinturicchio's decorative elements would fall due to the increasing use of assistants.

Several buildings in the Square collapsed due to a major earthquake on 25 April 2015. Durbar Square was surrounded with spectacular architecture and vividly showcases the skills of the Newar artists and craftsmen over several centuries. The Royal Palace was originally at Dattaraya square and was later moved to the Durbar square.Nepal Handbook by Tom Woodhatch The Kathmandu Durbar Square held the palaces of the Malla and Shah kings who ruled over the city. Along with these palaces, the square surrounds quadrangles, revealing courtyards and temples. It is known as Hanuman Dhoka Durbar Square, a name derived from a statue of Hanuman, the monkey devotee of Lord Ram, at the entrance of the palace. History and construction The preference for the construction of royal palaces at this site dates back to as early as the Licchavi period in the third century. Even though the present palaces and temples have undergone repeated and extensive renovations and nothing physical remains from that period. Names like Gunapo and Gupo, which are the names referred to the palaces in the square in early scriptures, imply that the palaces were built by Gunakamadev, a King ruling late in the tenth century. When Kathmandu City became independent under the rule of King Ratna Malla (1484‚Äì1520), the palaces in the square became the Royal Palaces for its Malla Kings. When Prithvi Narayan Shah invaded the Kathmandu Valley in 1769, he favored the Kathmandu Durbar Square for his palace. Other subsequent Shah kings continued to rule from the square until 1896 when they moved to the Narayan Hiti Palace. The square is still the center of important royal events like the coronation of King Birendra Bir Bikram Shah in 1975 and King Gyanendra Bir Bikram Shah in 2001. Though there are no written archives stating the history of Kathmandu Durbar Square, construction of the palace in the square is credited to Sankharadev (1069‚Äì1083). As the first king of the independent Kathmandu City, Ratna Malla is said to have built the Taleju temple in the Northern side of the palace in 1501. For this to be true then the temple would have had to have been built in the vihara style as part of the palace premise surrounding the Mul Chok courtyard for no evidence of a separate structure that would match this temple can be found within the square. Taleju Temple, established in 1564 Kotilingeshwara Mahadev Temple Construction of the Kernel Chok is not clearly stated in any historical inscriptions; although, it is probably the oldest among all the courtyards in the square. The Bhagavati Temple, originally known as a Narayan Temple, rises above the mansions surrounding it and was added during the time of Jagajaya Malla in the early eighteenth century. The Narayan idol within the temple was stolen so Prithvi Narayan Shah replaced it with an image of Bhagavati, completely transforming the name of the temple. The oldest temples in the square are those built by Mahendra Malla (1560‚Äì1574). They are the temples of Jagannath, Kotilingeswara Mahadev, Mahendreswara, and the Taleju Temple. This three-roofed Taleju Temple was established in 1564, in a typical Newari architectural style and is elevated on platforms that form a pyramid-like structure. It is said that Mahendra Malla when he was residing in Bhaktapur, was highly devoted to the Taleju Temple there; the Goddess being pleased with his devotion gave him a vision asking him to build a temple for her in the Kathmandu Durbar Square. With a help of a hermit, he designed the temple to give it its present form and the Goddess entered the temple in the form of a bee. His successors Sadasiva (1575‚Äì1581), his son, Shiva Simha (1578‚Äì1619), and his grandson, Laksmi Narsingha (1619‚Äì1641), do not seem to have made any major additions to the square. During this period of three generations, the only constructions to have occurred were the establishment of Degutale Temple dedicated to Goddess Mother Taleju by Shiva Simha and some enhancement in the royal palace by Laksminar Simha. Under Pratap Malla In the time of Pratap Malla, the square was extensively developed. He was an intellectual, a pious devotee, and especially interested in arts. He called himself a Kavindra, king of poets, and boasted that he has learned in fifteen different languages. A passionate builder, following his coronation as a king, he immediately began enlargements to his royal palace, and rebuilt some old temples and constructed new temples, shrines, and stupas around his kingdom. Indrapur Temple (left) and Vishnu Temple (right) at the Kathmandu Durbar Square During the construction of his palace, he added a small entrance in the traditional, low and narrow Newari style. The door was elaborately decorated with carvings and paintings of deities and auspicious signs and was later transferred to the entrance of Mohan Chok. In front of the entrance, he placed the statue of Hanuman thinking that Hanuman would strengthen his army and protect his home. The entrance leads to Nasal Chok, the courtyard where most royal events such as coronation, performances, and yagyas, holy fire rituals, take place. It was named after Nasadya, the God of Dance, and during the time of Pratap Malla the sacred mask dance dramas performed in Nasal Chok were widely famed. In one of these dramas, it is said that Pratap Malla himself played the role of Lord Vishnu and that the spirit of the Lord remained in the king's body even after the play. After consulting his Tantric leaders, he ordered a stone image of Lord Vishnu in his incarnation as Nara Simha, the half-lion, and half-human form, and then transferred the spirit into the stone. This fine image of Narasimha made in 1673 still stands in the Nasal Chok. In 1650, he commissioned for the construction of Mohan Chok in the palace. This chowk remained the royal residential courtyard for many years and is believed to store a great amount of treasure under its surface. Pratap Malla also built Sundari Chok about this time. He placed a slab engraved with lines in fifteen languages and proclaimed that he who can understand the inscription would produce the flow of milk instead of water from Tutedhara, a fountain set in the outer walls of Mohan Chok. However elaborate his constructions may have been, they were not simply intended to emphasize his luxuries but also his and the importance of others' devotion towards deities. He made extensive donations to temples and had the older ones renovated. Next, to the palace, he built a Krishna temple, the Vamsagopala, in an octagonal shape in 1649. He dedicated this temple to his two Indian wives, Rupamati and Rajamati, as both had died during the year it was built. In Mohan Chok, he erected a three roofed Agamachem temple and a unique temple with five superimposing roofs. After completely restoring the Mul Chok, he donated to the adjoining Taleju Temple. To the main temple of Taleju, he donated metal doors in 1670. He rebuilt the Degutale Temple built by his grandfather, Siva Simha, and the Taleju Temple in the palace square. As a substitute to the Indreswara Mahadeva Temple in the distant village of Panauti, he built a Shiva temple, Indrapura, near his palace in the square. He carved hymns on the walls of the Jagannath Temple as prayers to Taleju in the form of Kali. A temple seen out of Kathmandu Durbar gate. At the southern end of the square, near Kasthamandap at Maru, which was the main city crossroads for early traders, he built another pavilion named Kavindrapura, the mansion of the king of poets. In this mansion, he set an idol of dancing Shiva, Nasadyo, which today is highly worshiped by dancers in the Valley. In the process of beautifying his palace, he added fountains, ponds, and baths. In Sundari Chok, he established a low bath with a golden fountain. He built a small pond, the Naga Pokhari, in the palace adorned with Nagakastha, a wooden serpent, which is said he had ordered stolen from the royal pond in the Bhaktapur Durbar Square. He restored the Licchavi stone sculptures such as the Jalasayana Narayana, the Kaliyadamana, and the Kala Bhairav. An idol of Jalasayana Narayana was placed in a newly created pond in the Bhandarkhal garden in the eastern wing of the palace. As a substitute to the idol of Jalasayana Narayana in Buddhanilkantha, he channeled water from Buddhanilkantha to the pond in Bhandarkhal due bestow authenticity. The Kalyadana, a manifestation of Lord Krishna destroying Kaliya, a water serpent, is placed in Kalindi Chok, which is adjacent to the Mohan Chok. The approximately ten-feet-high image of terrifyingly portrayed Kal Bhairav is placed near the Jagannath Temple. This image is the focus of worship in the chok, especially during Durga Puja. Image of Kal bhairav With the death of Pratap Malla in 1674, the overall emphasis on the importance of the square came to a halt. His successors retained relatively insignificant power and the prevailing ministers took control of most of the royal rule. The ministers encountered little influence under these kings and, increasingly, the interest of the arts and additions to the square was lost on them. They focused less on culture than Pratap Malla during the three decades that followed his death, steering the city and country more towards the arenas of politics and power, with only a few minor constructions made in the square. These projects included Parthivendra Malla building a temple referred to as Trailokya Mohan or Dasavatara, dedicated to Lord Vishnu in 1679. A large statue of Garuda, the mount of Lord Vishnu, was added in front of it a decade later. Parthivendra Malla added a pillar with an image of his family in front of the Taleju Temple. Around 1692, Radhilasmi, the widowed queen of Pratap Malla, erected the tall temples of Shiva known as Maju Deval near the Garuda image in the square. This temple stands on nine stepped platforms and is one of the tallest buildings in the square. Then her son, Bhupalendra Malla, took the throne and banished the widowed queen to the hills. His death came early at the age of twenty-one and his widowed queen, Bhuvanalaksmi, built a temple in the square known as Kageswara Mahadev. The temple was built in the Newari style and acted as a substitute for worship of a distant temple in the hills. After the earthquake in 1934, the temple was restored with a dome roof, which was alien to the Newari architecture. Courtyard of Kumari Bahal. Jayaprakash Malla, the last Malla king to rule Kathmandu, built a temple for Kumari and Durga in her virginal state. The temple was named Kumari Bahal and was structured like a typical Newari vihara. In his house resides the Kumari, a girl who is revered as the living goddess. He also made a chariot for Kumari and in the courtyard had detailed terra cotta tiles of that time laid down. Under the Shah dynasty During the Shah dynasty that followed, the Kathmandu Durbar Square saw a number of changes. Two of the most unusual temples in the square were built during this time. One is the Nautale, a nine- storied building known as Basantapur Durbar. It has four roofs and stands at the end of Nasal Chok at the East side of the palace. It is said that this building was set as a pleasure house. The lower three stories were made in the Newari farmhouse style. The upper floors have Newari style windows, sanjhya and tikijhya, and some of them are slightly projected from the wall. The other temple is annexed to the Vasantapur Durbar and has four stories. This building was initially known as Vilasamandira, or Lohom Chok, but is now commonly known as Basantapur or Tejarat Chok. The lower floors of the Basantapur Chok display extensive woodcarvings and the roofs are made in popular the Mughal style. Archives state that Prthivi Narayan Shah built these two buildings in 1770. Rana Bahadur Shah was enthroned at the age of two. Bahadur Shah, the second son of Prithvi Narayan Shah, ruled as a regent for his young nephew Rana Bahadur Shah for a close to a decade from 1785 to 1794 and built a temple of Shiva Parvati in the square. This one roofed temple is designed in the Newari style and is remarkably similar to previous temples built by the Mallas. It is rectangular in shape and enshrines the Navadurga, a group of goddesses, on the ground floor. It has a wooden image of Shiva and Parvati at the window of the upper floor, looking out at the passersby in the square. Another significant donation made during the time of Rana Bahadur Shah is the metal-plated head of Swet Bhairav near the Degutale Temple. It was donated during the festival of Indra Jatra in 1795 and continues to play a major role during the festival every year. This approximately twelve feet high face of Bhairav is concealed behind a latticed wooden screen for the rest of the year. The following this donation Rana Bahadur donated a huge bronze bell as an offering to the Goddess Taleju. Talaju TempleTogether with the beating of the huge drums donated by his son Girvan Yudha, the bell was rung every day during the daily ritual worship of the goddess. Later these instruments were also used as an alarm system. However, after the death of his beloved third wife Kanimati Devi due to smallpox, Rana Bahadur Shah turned mad with grief and had many images of gods and goddesses smashed including the Taleju statue and bell, and Sitala, the goddess of smallpox. In 1908, a palace, Gaddi Durbar, was built using European architectural designs. The Rana Prime Ministers who had taken over the power but not the throne of the country from the Shahs Kings from 1846 to 1951 were highly influenced by European styles. The Gaddi Durbar is covered in white plaster, has Greek columns and adjoins a large audience hall, all foreign features to Nepali architecture. The balconies of this durbar were reserved for the royal family during festivals to view the square below. Some of the parts of the square like the Hatti Chok near the Kumari Bahal in the southern section of the square were removed during restoration after the devastating earthquake in 1934. While building the New Road, the southeastern part of the palace was cleared away, leaving only fragments in places as reminders of their past. Though decreased from its original size and attractiveness from its earlier seventeenth-century architecture, the Kathmandu Durbar Square still displays an ancient surrounding that spans abound five acres of land. It has palaces, temples, quadrangles, courtyards, ponds, and images that were brought together over three centuries of the Malla, the Shah, and the Rana dynasties. Visiting Kathmandu Durbar Square 2013 Kathmandu's Durbar Square is the site of the Hanuman Dhoka Palace Complex, which was the royal Nepalese residence until the 19th century and where important ceremonies, such as the coronation of the Nepalese monarch, took place. The palace is decorated with elaborately-carved wooden windows and panels and houses the King Tribhuwan Memorial Museum and the Mahendra Museum. It is possible to visit the state rooms inside the palace. Time and again the temples and the palaces in the square have gone through reconstruction after being damaged by natural causes or neglect. Presently there are less than ten quadrangles in the square. The temples are being preserved as national heritage sites and the palace is being used as a museum. Only a few parts of the palace are open for visitors and the Taleju temples are only open for people of Hindu and Buddhist faiths. At the southern end of Durbar Square is one of the most curious attractions in Nepal, the Kumari Chok. This gilded cage contains the Raj Kumari, a girl chosen through an ancient and mystical selection process to become the human incarnation of the Hindu mother goddess, Durga. She takes a tour of the city during the festival of Indra Jatra, during these festivals she is carried around from place to place in her chariot. She also makes public appearances during few other festivals otherwise her devotees can visit and worship her for a fee paid to her guards. It is said doom is upon you if she refuses to let you worship her.
