He also headed the Institute of State and Law in the Soviet Academy of Sciences. Biography=Early life Vyshinsky was born in Odessa into a Polish Catholic family, who later moved to Baku.

A talented student, Andrey Vyshinsky married Kara Mikhailova, and became interested in revolutionary ideas. He began attending the Kiev University but was expelled for participating in revolutionary activities.Arkady Vaksberg, Stalin's Prosecutor: The Life of Andrei Vyshinsky (New York: Grove Weidenfeld, 1990), 15. Vyshinsky returned to Baku, became a Menshevik in 1903 and took an active part in the 1905 Russian Revolution. As a result, in 1908 he was sentenced to prison and a few days later was sent to Bailov prison to serve his sentence.Arkady Vaksberg, Stalin's Prosecutor: The Life of Andrei Vyshinsky (New York: Grove Weidenfeld, 1990), 19-20.

After his release, he returned home to Baku for the birth of his daughter Zinaida in 1909. Soon thereafter, he returned to Kiev University and did quite well. He was even considered for a professorship, but his political past caught up with him, and he was forced to return to Baku.Vaksberg, Stalin's Prosecutor, 22. Determined to practice law, he tried Moscow, where he became a successful lawyer, remained an active Menshevik, gave many passionate and incendiary speeches, and became involved in city government.Vaksberg, Prosecutor and the Prey, pp. 22-3. Vaksberg, Stalin's Prosecutor, 22-25.

In 1917, he became reacquainted with Stalin, who had become an important Bolshevik leader. Consequently, he joined the staff of the People's Commissariat of Food, which was responsible for Moscow's food supplies, and with the help of Stalin, Alexei Rykov, and Lev Kamenev, he began to rise in influence and prestige.Vaksberg, Stalin's Prosecutor, 22-25. In 1920, after the defeat of the Whites under Denikin, and the end of the Russian Civil War, he joined the Bolsheviks.Vaksberg, Stalin's Prosecutor, 30. Bolsheviks in power Andrei Yanuarevich Vyshinsky (bottom, right of Lenin), 1922. Kamenev, Lenin, Zinoviev, party congress Becoming a member of the nomenklatura he became a prosecutor in the new Soviet legal system, began a rivalry with a fellow lawyer, Nikolai Krylenko, and in 1925 was elected rector of Moscow University, which he began to clear of \\"unsuitable\\" students and professors.Vaksberg, Stalin's Prosecutor, 36, 39-40. In 1928, he presided over the \\"Shakhty Trial\\" against 53 alleged counter-revolutionary \\"wreckers.\\"Vaksberg, Stalin's Prosecutor, 43. Krylenko acted as prosecutor, and the outcome was never in doubt. As historian Arkady Vaksberg explains, \\"all the court's attention was concentrated not on analysing the evidence, which simply did not exist, but on securing from the accused confirmation of their confessions of guilt that were contained in the records of the preliminary investigation.\\"Quotation from Vaksberg, Stalin's Prosecutor, 44. In 1930, he acted as co-prosecutor with Krylenko at another show trial, which was accompanied by a storm of propaganda. In this case, all eight defendants confessed their guilt. As a result, he was promoted.Vaksberg, Stalin's Prosecutor, 51-54. He carried out administrative preparations for a \\"systematic\\" drive \\"against harvest-wreckers and grain-thieves.\\"Soviet Crop Failure: New Campaign against \\"Wreckers\\", The Times, August 10, 1933 Procurator General and Soviet law theorist Prosecutor General Vyshinsky (centre), reading the 1937 indictment against Karl Radek during the second Moscow Trial. In 1935 he became Procurator General of the USSR, the legal mastermind of Joseph Stalin's Great Purge. Although he acted as a judge, he encouraged investigators to procure confessions from the accused. In some cases, he prepared the indictments before the \\"investigation\\" was concluded.Vaksberg, Stalin's Prosecutor, 78-79. In his Theory of Judicial Proofs in Soviet Justice (Stalin Prize in 1947) he laid a theoretical base for the Soviet judicial system, based on Marxist‚ÄìLeninist principles, giving it a strong bias towards dialectical and collectivist thinking. Vyshinsky recommended that investigators and judges consider \\"the wider social perspective\\" of each individual case in the context of class struggle. As a result, an actual commission of a crime was not required for conviction: people could have been convicted for being perceived as bourgeois (\\"class responsibility\\") or simply if that was considered to be beneficial for the Communist Party, for example in the \\"educational\\" role of the judicial system (thus, the importance of show trials, even with completely false accusations). Many of the rules introduced were mutually exclusive: for example, Vyshinsky generally warned against treating self-indictment as a formal proof due to possible manipulation, but at the same time he warned against \\"treating this rule in abstraction from specific characteristics of each case\\" in \\"cases of conspiracy, criminal organisations, and especially cases of anti-Soviet and counterrevolutionary groups\\". He also used his own speeches from the Moscow Trials as an example of how defendants' statements could be used as primary evidence in such cases, as the prosecution \\"cannot expect that the conspirators would document their criminal activities\\". Perhaps based on this practice, in which according to Vaksberg, Stalin personally gave direction on the use of confessions and the use of the death penalty, Vyshinsky is cited for the principle that \\"confession of the accused is the queen of evidence\\".Vaksberg, Stalin's Prosecutor, 79-80. Vyshinsky first became a nationally known public figure as a result of the Semenchuk case of 1936.John McCannon, Red Arctic: Polar Exploration and the Myth of the North in the Soviet Union, 1932-1939 (Oxford University Press US, 1998: ), p. 156. Konstantin Semenchuk was the head of the Glavsevmorput station on Wrangel Island. He was accused of oppressing and starving the local Yupik and of ordering his subordinate, the sledge driver Stepan Startsev, to murder Dr. Nikolai Vulfson, who had attempted to stand up to Semenchuk, on 27 December 1934 (though there were also rumours that Startsev had fallen in love with Vulfson's wife, Dr. Gita Feldman, and killed him out of jealousy).McCannon, Red Arctic, p. 157. The case came to trial before the Supreme Court of the RSFSR in May 1936; both defendants, attacked by Vyshinsky as \\"human waste,\\" were found guilty and shot, and \\"the most publicised result of the trial was the joy of the liberated Eskimos.\\"Yuri Slezkine, Arctic Mirrors: Russia and the Small Peoples of the North (Cornell University Press, 1994: ), p. 288. In 1936, Vyshinsky achieved international infamy as the prosecutor at the Zinoviev-Kamenev trial (this trial had nine other defendants), the first of the Moscow Trials during the Great Purge, lashing its defenseless victims with vituperative rhetoric:Nicolas Werth, Karel Barto≈°ek, Jean-Louis Pann√©, Jean- Louis Margolin, Andrzej Paczkowski, St√©phane Courtois, The Black Book of Communism: Crimes, Terror, Repression, Harvard University Press, 1999, , page 750 He often punctuated speeches with phrases like \\"Dogs of the Fascist bourgeoisie,\\" \\"mad dogs of Trotskyism,\\" \\"dregs of society,\\" \\"decayed people,\\" \\"terrorist thugs and degenerates,\\" and \\"accursed vermin.\\"Vaksberg, Stalin's Prosecutor, 83, 107. This dehumanization aided in what historian Arkady Vaksberg calls \\"a hitherto unknown type of trial where there was not the slightest need for evidence: what evidence did you need when you were dealing with 'stinking carrion' and 'mad dogs'?\\"Vaksberg, Stalin's Prosecutor, 107. During the trial of Bukharin, Vyshinsky characterized him as an \\"accursed crossbreed of fox and pig\\" who supposedly committed a \\"whole nightmare of vile crimes\\". He is also attributed as the author of an infamous quote from the Stalin era: \\"Give me a man and I will find the crime.\\"http://www.polityka.pl/tygodnikpolityka/kraj/1526939,1,byla-poslanka- beata-s-skazana.read During the trials, Vyshinsky misappropriated the house and money of Leonid Serebryakov (one of the defendants of the infamous Moscow Trials), who was later executed.Raider Vyshinsky by Novaya Gazeta Adolf Hitler held Vyshinsky in high esteem, stating that Roland Freisler is \\"our Vyshinsky\\". Wartime diplomat The Great Purge inflicted tremendous losses on the People's Commissariat of Foreign Affairs. Maxim Litvinov was one of the few diplomats who survived and he was dismissed. Vyshinsky had a low opinion of diplomats because they often complained about the effect of trials on opinions in the West.Vaksberg, Stalin's Prosecutor, 193-194. In 1939, Vyshinsky entered another phase of his career when he introduced a motion to bring the Western Ukraine into the USSR to the Supreme Soviet.Vaksberg, Stalin's Prosecutor, 204. Afterwards, as Deputy Chairman of the People's Commissariat, which oversaw culture and education, as this area and others were incorporated more fully into the USSR, he directed efforts to convert the written alphabets of conquered peoples to the Cyrillic alphabet. In June 1940 Vyshinsky was sent to Latvia to supervise the establishment of a pro-Soviet government and incorporation of that country into the USSR. He was generally well received, and he set out to purge the Latvian Communist Party of Trotskyists, Bukharinites, and possible foreign agents. In July 1940, a Latvian Soviet Republic was proclaimed. It was, unsurprisingly, granted admission to the USSR. As a result of this success, he was named Deputy People's Commissar of Foreign Affairs, and taken into greater confidence by Stalin, Lavrentiy Beria, and Vyacheslav Molotov.Vaksberg, Stalin's Prosecutor, 207, 213, 215, 219. After the German invasion of the Soviet Union Vyshinsky was transferred to the shadow capital at Kuibyshev. He remained here for much of the war, but he continued to act as a loyal functionary, and attempted to ingratiate himself with Archibald Clark Kerr and visiting Republican presidential candidate Wendell Willkie.Vaksberg, Stalin's Prosecutor, 226, 231, 234. During the Tehran Conference in 1943, he remained in the Soviet Union to \\"keep shop\\" while most of the leadership was abroad.Vaksberg, Stalin's Prosecutor, 239. Stalin appointed him to the Allied Control Council on Italian affairs where he began organizing the repatriation of Soviet POWs (including those who did not want to return to the Soviet Union). He also began to liaise with the Italian Communist Party in Naples.Vaksberg, Stalin's Prosecutor, 226, 239, 242, 243. The unconditional surrender of the German Wehrmacht is signed on 8 May 1945 in Karlshorst by Marshal Zhukov, General Sokolovsky and Vyshinsky. In February 1945, he accompanied Stalin, Molotov, and Beria to the Yalta Conference.Vaksberg, Stalin's Prosecutor, 244. After returning to Moscow he was dispatched to Romania, where he arranged for a Communist regime to assume control in 1945. He then once again accompanied the Soviet leadership to the Potsdam Conference. British diplomat Sir Frank Roberts, who served as British Charg√© d'Affaires in Moscow from February 1945 to October 1947, described him as follows: Post-Second World War James Byrnes (left) is greeted at the airport en route to the Potsdam Conference by Andrei Gromyko and Vishinsky, 15 July 1945 He was responsible for the Soviet preparations for the trial of the major German war criminals by the International Military Tribunal. In 1953, he was among the chief figures accused by the U.S. Congress Kersten Committee during its investigation of the Soviet occupation of the Baltic states.The Iron Heel, TIME Magazine, December 14, 1953 The positions he held included those of vice-premier (1939-1944), Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs (1940-1949), Minister of Foreign Affairs (1949‚Äì1953), Academician of the Soviet Academy of Sciences from 1939, and permanent representative of the Soviet Union to the United Nations. He died of heart attack in 1954 while in New York and was buried near Red Square. Scholarship Vyshinsky was the director of the Soviet Academy of Sciences' Institute of State and Law. Until the period of destalinization, the Institute of State and Law was named in his honor. During his tenure as director of the ISL, Vyshinsky oversaw the publication of several important monographs on the general theory of state and law. Family Vyshinsky married Kapitolina Isidorovna Mikhailova and had a daughter named Zinaida Andreyevna Vyshinskaya (born 1909).Arkady Vaksberg (1990) The Prosecutor and the Prey: Vyshinsky and the 1930s Moscow Show Trials.

In Gregor Martov's Alternative History novel \\"His New Majesty\\",Published in Russian 1997, English and German translation 2002 depicting an alternate history in which Denikin's White forces defeated the Bolsheviks in 1921, Vyshinsky joins the winners and acts as the Royal Prosecutor in a show trial in which Lenin, Stalin, Trotsky and Bucharin are sentenced to death as \\"Subversives, Traitors, Blasphemers and Regicides\\". He is rewarded in being ennobled by the restored Czar and made a Duke, but gets assassinated by an Anarchist girl with whom he had a secret affair.

He gained national prominence as deputy leader of Liverpool City Council in the 1980s and was a member of the Trotskyist Militant group. Early life Hatton attended the Liverpool Institute for Boys from 1959 to 1964. His subsequent academic success was limited, but he enjoyed sports and appeared on stage as Gratiano in a school production of The Merchant of Venice with future theatre producer Bill Kenwright.Derek Hatton Inside Left: The Story So Far [autobiography], London: Bloomsbury, 1988. Political career Hatton became a firefighter and later joined the Labour Party and Militant, a Trotskyist organisation then following an entryist strategy within the Labour Party. As deputy leader of Liverpool City Council from 1983, Hatton was the most vocal and prominent member of the council's leadership. The then Leader of the Council was John Hamilton, a soft-spoken and widely admired local politician. Hatton joined the rate- capping rebellion in 1985 as the council refused to make a rate increase. In June, the council changed tactics and set an illegal \\"deficit budget\\" which committed it to spending ¬£30 million more than its income, claiming that the excess represented grant \\"stolen\\" by central government. Once adopted by the Liverpool District Labour Party and 49 councillors, this policy catapulted Hatton and the city council into massive media attention and conflict with the then Conservative government. Hatton was expelled from the Labour Party in 1986 for belonging to Militant, which had earlier been found to be in breach of the Labour Party's constitution. Hatton argued that Militant was a legitimate Marxist tendency within the Labour Party, but the National Executive Committee voted to expel him by twelve votes to six. In 1993, Hatton was accused of corruption as deputy leader of Liverpool City Council. After a lengthy trial, he was found not guilty. Media career Hatton presented the lunchtime phone-in on 105.4 Century FM when it launched in 1998, titled \\"The Degsy Debate\\". The BBC Two fly-on-the-wall documentary Trouble at the Top followed the station's launch, and Hatton's training. In the 1990s, he worked as Talk Radio's morning phone-in presenter. He was the subject of a BBC documentary, My Brilliant Career in 1996. In the 1990s, Hatton starred in a series of adverts for Sekonda watches. He also appeared on an episode of BBC panel show Have I Got News for You in 1993, alongside Conservative MP and panellist Edwina Currie. In 2010, Hatton appeared in Channel 4's Alternative Election Night Special episode of Come Dine with Me alongside Brian Paddick, Edwina Currie and Rod Liddle. Hatton is now a motivational speaker and chairman of the new media company Rippleffect. His son Ben Hatton is its managing director. Hatton is also a property developer in Cyprus. Rejoining the Labour Party It was reported in the Liverpool Daily Post in 2007 that Hatton had rejoined the Labour Party and intended to seek selection as a prospective parliamentary candidate in the North West. Hatton made clear that he is no longer a Trotskyist, but maintains that he remains firmly on the left of the party, expressing his belief that Labour has to abandon New Labour ideology (or \\"neo-Tory\\", as Hatton puts it) and return to its traditional values. In October 2008, during an interview with The Sunday Telegraph, Hatton revealed that he has become a capitalist running a property company in Cyprus and drives a ¬£60,000 Range Rover, justifying his change in attitude as \\"My days in politics were a very long time ago and I lost interest in it after I was expelled from the city council\\". Hatton gave another interview in the same year to the Liverpool Daily Post in which he reasserted his intention to seek selection as a parliamentary Labour candidate for a constituency in Liverpool or elsewhere in the North West at some point in the future. Hatton stated that he may challenge \\"one of the neo-Tory types currently representing Liverpool, like Maria Eagle maybe\\". 2015 rejected application On 28 May 2015, it emerged that Hatton had attempted to rejoin the Labour Party on 9 May, two days after Labour's defeat in the 2015 general election. His application was rejected by Iain McNicol, the party's general secretary. In September 2015, Hatton endorsed Jeremy Corbyn's campaign in the Labour Party leadership election. He wrote: \\"For the first time since the Eighties we have a clear choice between a Tory party supported by big business, and a Labour party based on the trade unions. This might sound very old fashioned, but it's simply a return to the obvious split that has always existed. It was artificially camouflaged under New Labour. It's an exciting time for the whole country, but I fear that the pressure which will be brought to bear from the 'New Labour dinosaurs' and from much of the media will be massive, and Jeremy Corbyn will need strength and support in abundance in order to resist it.\\" In a BBC Newsnight broadcast on 27 July 2015 Hatton claimed not to be a property developer, and that he was a card-carrying member of the Labour Party. He supported the campaign of Jeremy Corbyn to lead the Labour Party. However, the Labour Party denied this, insisting instead that Hatton had been sent a membership card automatically but had not been permitted to join. At the end of January 2017, in an article for the Liverpool Echo, Hatton wrote that he had voted against Britain leaving the European Union in the membership referendum in June 2016: \\"I can't believe Corbyn is arguing for Labour MPs to vote with the most reactionary and xenophobic Tory government we've seen for a long time. This shows a real lack of leadership on his part and does now make me have serious doubts about him\\". 2018 overturned successful application Hatton applied to rejoin Labour in September 2018. The application was approved in February 2019. He was suspended from the party on 20 February, just days after he was re-admitted, after an allegedly anti- Semitic tweet from 2012 came to light.

It can often be a child's first introduction to playing cards. The game is a cross between Beggar-My-Neighbour and Egyptian Ratscrew and is also sometimes known as Heart Attack. It is also related to the simpler 'slap' card games often called Snap. Gameplay A 52-card deck is divided into face-down stacks as equally as possible between all players. One player removes the top card of their stack and places it face-up on the playing surface within reach of all players. The players take turns doing this in a clockwise manner until a jack is placed on the pile. At this point, any and all players may attempt to slap the pile with the hand they didn't use to place the card; whoever covers the stack with his or her hand first takes the pile, shuffles it, and adds it to the bottom of their stack. If another player puts their card over the jack before it is slapped, the jack and the cards underneath can't be taken by a player until the next jack is revealed. When a player has run out of cards, they have one more chance to slap a jack and get back in the game, but if they fail, they are out. Gameplay continues with hands of this sort until one player has acquired all of the cards. In a popular variation with a regular deck, the person covering the cards must simultaneously say \\"Slapjack!\\" If the person fails to say this, they do not get the pile. Additionally, if the player covers the pile and says \\"Slapjack\\", and the card is not a jack, then the other players get to divide the pile evenly among themselves. Variations=Snap Two eights dealt in a row is a \\"snap\\" Snap is a popular children's card game where cards are dealt out and the object is to react first when a pair of same-value cards are revealed.Snap - Card Game Rules Gameplay is related to Egyptian Ratscrew. The game is often one of the first card games to be taught to children and is often played with special packs of cards featuring popular children's characters from television programmes or recent films. For older children, more complex packs exist, where the differences between cards are more subtle and penalties exist for falsely calling Snap. The pack of cards is dealt out among the players in face-down stacks as equally as possible. Play proceeds with the players taking it in turns to remove a card from the top of their stack and place it face-up on a pile in front of them. If two cards on the tops of any of these piles are ever identical (or, if a conventional pack of cards is used, are of the same number), the first player to shout \\"Snap!\\" takes both face-up piles and adds them to the bottom of their own stack. The player who accumulates all the cards wins. In a variation, better suited to younger children, cards are played onto a single shared stack, and players call \\"snap!\\" if two consecutive cards on this pile are identical. Cabin 6 This variation is played with a traditional deck of cards and complications are added as to appeal to a slightly older demographic. A standard 54 (including jokers) deck of cards is dealt face down to the players. Simultaneously, all players turn over their top card. If any two cards show the same number, OR a joker is played by any player, the first player to cry out (traditionally the word 'snap' but any cry will do) receives all of the cards played. If none is played, players turn over the next card in their deck. When a player runs out of cards, they have until the end of the trick AND the next trick to attempt to win themselves cards. After this they are eliminated. Eliminated players act as judges as to who cries out first. The player with all of the cards at the end wins. Irish Snap Irish Snap is a card game whose objective is to lose cards as quickly as possible. Since there is only one loser, forfeits can be made for the person with all the cards at the end of the game. A deck of card is dealt out to the players, face down. They take turns to play cards face-up to a centre pile, calling out card ranks as they do so: the first player calls \\"Ace\\", the second \\"two\\", and so on. If the card you play matches the card you have called, the pile can be slapped as in Slapjack, with the last person to slap taking the pile as a penalty. The last player to have any cards left is the loser. In some versions of this game, a \\"snap\\" can be called if the most two most recent cards are identical, or if the most recent card is a queen. =Alternative rules= An extra, optional, rule of Irish snap is that anything said, including the card number and snap must be done so in an Irish accent. If a player snaps incorrectly when there is not actually any kind of matching pair, they receive all of the cards. However, in order for this to come into effect the player must touch the deck in the middle. If they simply shout snap, or motion towards it, the game carries on as normal. The game can also be continued so that even players who have lost all their cards still take part in the game. They will still say the next number after the previous person whilst not putting down a card. For example if person B has lost all their cards and player A puts down a 7 whilst saying the number 6, as soon as player B says 7 everyone slams for the pile. It is common for the person to dummy, in which case if he has not said the number the person who touches the pile incorrectly will pick up the pile. The \\"Extreme\\" variant of Irish Snap is also referred to as 'Ultimate Snap', or simply 'Irish Snap'. It is based on the alternative rules of Irish Snap in addition to any other house rules the players consent to. It bears some similarity to Egyptian Ratscrew. Commonly accepted rules include: ;Irish Snap :If the card rank presently laid matches the rank being spoken by the layer, all players snap. ;Conventional Snap :If the card laid is identical in rank to the one beneath it, all players snap. ;Silent Sevens :If a seven (or another rank of card agreed upon by all players) is laid, the ranks are no longer counted out loud and players must keep track of them in their head. This may continue until the same card is laid again and nullifies the rule. ;Runs :Players snap a set of cards which increase or decrease by one rank every card. For example: 5,6,7 or 8,7,6. ;Sandwiches :Players snap two matching cards with any card in between them, such as 5,7,5 or Jack,3,Jack. ;King Salutes :Players must salute before making a snap which will land on a king ;Preemptive Snap :When a player runs out of cards, he continues to play, just as in the alternative Irish Snap rules. However, any potential snaps this causes may be snapped before he has said the relevant card rank. This is particularly interesting when neighboring players run out of cards simultaneously. Technically there is no end to the list of rules that can be added to a game of Irish snap, and some variations state that any player who snaps fastest twice in a row may add another rule. Some games include the rule that any player who runs out of cards and snaps fastest is declared the winner, whereas other versions of the game simply go on until players choose to leave.

Kiska is shown as Island #7; Attu Island is shown as Island #1. Kiska (, ) is an island in the Rat Islands group of the Aleutian Islands of Alaska. It is about long and varies in width from . It is part of Aleutian Islands Wilderness and as such, special permissions are required to visit it. The island has no permanent population.  History = European Discovery (1741)  In 1741 while returning from his second voyage at sea during the Great Northern Expedition, Danish-born Russian explorer Vitus Bering made the first European discovery of most of the Aleutian Islands, including Kiska. Georg Wilhelm Steller, a naturalist- physician aboard Bering's ship, wrote: > On 25 October 1741 we had very clear weather and sunshine, but even so it > hailed at various times in the afternoon. We were surprised in the morning > to discover a large tall island at 51¬∞ to the north of us.Georg Steller ‚Äì > Journal of a Voyage with Bering, 1741‚Äì1742 edited by O. Frost. Stanford > University Press, 1993, p. 119, Prior to European contact, Kiska Island had been densely populated by native peoples for thousands of years.  After Discovery (1741‚Äì1939)  Kiska, and the other Rat Islands, were reached by independent Russian traders in the 1750s. After the initial exploitation of the sea otter population, Russians rarely visited the island as interest shifted further east. Years would frequently pass without a single ship landing. Starting in 1775, Kiska, the Aleutian Islands, and mainland Alaska became fur trading outposts for the Russian-American Company managed by Grigory Shelekhov. In 1867, U.S. Secretary of State William H. Seward negotiated the purchase of Alaska with the Russian Empire. Kiska was included in the purchase.  World War II (1939‚Äì1945)  The Allied invasion of Kiska, August 15, 1943 As one of the only two invasions of North America during World War II, the Japanese No. 3 Special Landing Party and 500 marines went ashore at Kiska on June 6, 1942 as a separate campaign concurrent with the Japanese plan for the Battle of Midway. The Japanese captured the sole inhabitants of the island: a small United States Navy Weather Detachment consisting of ten men, including a lieutenant, along with their dog. (One member of the detachment escaped for 50 days. Starving, thin, and extremely cold, he eventually surrendered to the Japanese.) The next day the Japanese captured Attu Island. The military importance of this frozen, difficult-to-supply island was questionable, but the psychological impact upon the Americans of losing U.S. soil to a foreign enemy for the first time since the War of 1812 was tangible. During the winter of 1942‚Äì43, the Japanese reinforced and fortified the islands‚Äînot necessarily to prepare for an island- hopping operation across the Aleutians, but to prevent a U.S. operation across the Kuril Islands. The U.S. Navy began operations to deny Kiska supply which would lead to the Battle of the Komandorski Islands. During October 1942, American forces undertook seven bombing missions over Kiska, though two were aborted due to inclement weather. Following the winter, Attu was recaptured, and bombing of Kiska resumed for over two months, until a larger American force was allocated to defeat the expected Japanese garrison of 5,200 men. The Japanese, aware of the loss of Attu and the impending arrival of the larger Allied force, successfully removed their troops on July 28 under the cover of severe fog, without being detected by the Allies. On August 15, 1943, an invasion force consisting of 34,426 Allied troops, including elements of the 7th Infantry Division, 4th Infantry Regiment, 87th Mountain Infantry Regiment, 5,300 Canadians (mainly the 13th Canadian Infantry Brigade from the 6th Infantry Division, with supporting units including two artillery units from the 7th Infantry Division), 95 ships including three battleships and a heavy cruiser, and 168 aircraft landed on Kiska, only to find the island completely abandoned. Allied casualties during this invasion nevertheless numbered close to 200, all either from friendly fire, booby traps set out by the Japanese to inflict damage on the invading allied forces, or weather-related disease. As a result of the brief engagement between U.S. and Canadian forces, there were 28 American and four Canadian dead. There were an additional 130 casualties from trench foot alone. The destroyer USS Abner Read hit a mine, resulting in 87 casualties. That night the Imperial Japanese Navy warships, thinking they were engaged by Americans, shelled and attempted to torpedo the island of Little Kiska and the Japanese soldiers waiting to embark. Admiral Ernest King reported to the secretary of the Navy, Frank Knox, that the only things that remained on the island were dogs and freshly brewed coffee. Knox asked for an explanation and King responded, \\"The Japanese are very clever. Their dogs can brew coffee.\\"  Present-day (1945‚Äìpresent)  The Japanese occupation site on the island is now considered a National Historic Landmark and is protected under federal law. The island is also a part of the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge (AMNWR) and contains the largest colony of least auklets (over 1,160,000 birds) and crested auklets. Research biologists from Memorial University of Newfoundland have been studying the impact of introduced Norway rats on the seabirds of Kiska since 2001. Much of the aftermath of World War II is still evident in Kiska. The slow erosion processes on the tundra have had little effect on the bomb craters still visible both from the ground and in satellite images on the hills surrounding the harbor. Numerous equipment dumps, tunnels (some concrete-lined), Japanese gun emplacements, shipwrecks, and other war relics can be found, all untouched since 1943. In 1983, a memorial plaque was placed on Kiska by the 87th Mountain Infantry Regiment, inscribed: > To the men of Amphibious Task Force 9 who fell here August 1943 placed here > August 1983 by 87th Mountain Infantry Regiment. On August 22, 2007, the submarine , which disappeared with a crew of 70 during World War II, was found in of water off Kiska.  In fiction  Renamed \\"Skira\\", the island was used as the setting for the Codemasters video game Operation Flashpoint: Dragon Rising. The fictionalized version of the island is relocated closer to Russia and China, but the island's topography is replicated near-exactly, with elements of the game designed around it, instead of vice versa.  Kiska Volcano  Kiska Volcano Kiska Volcano (Qisxan Kamgii in Aleut) is an active stratovolcano, in diameter at its base and high, located on the northern end of Kiska Island. On January 24, 1962, an explosive eruption occurred, accompanied by lava extrusion and the construction of a cinder cone about high at Sirius Point on the north flank of Kiska Volcano, from the summit of the main cone (Anchorage Daily News, January 30, 1962). A second eruption that produced a lava flow was reported to have occurred on March 18, 1964 (Bulletin of Volcanic Eruptions, 1964). Since then, the volcano has emitted steam and ash plumes, as well as smaller lava flows.

He became editor of The Sun in 1981, by when the publication was established as the Britain's largest circulation newspaper. After leaving The Sun in 1994, he was appointed to executive roles in satellite television and other broadcasting outlets, as well as being involved in a number of publishing enterprises. After short periods as a columnist at the Daily Mail and The Daily Telegraph, MacKenzie returned to his old paper in the same role. His contract was terminated in May 2017 after being suspended. Early life and career MacKenzie was born in Thanet, Kent, to Ian and Mary MacKenzie, both journalists working for The South London Observer. When the South London Press took over their paper, Mary became press chief for the Conservative leader of the Greater London Council, Horace Cutler. Kelvin's father died in April 2004 at the age of 84. Educated at Alleyn's School in Dulwich, MacKenzie left school with one O-level in English literature.The Independent 22 January 1994 He joined the South East London Mercury at 17, and worked on local and then national newspapers, including the Daily Express, for the next ten years. MacKenzie has said that he discovered early on in his career that he had little writing ability and that his talents lay in making up headlines and laying out pages. By 1978, at the age of 32, he was managing editor of the New York Post, two years after it had been purchased by Rupert Murdoch. Editor of The Sun After moving back to the United Kingdom and a period as night editor of the Daily Express, Murdoch appointed him The Sun editor in 1981. Conflict between the two groups meant that MacKenzie performed both jobs for a time. In 1978, The Sun had finally overtaken the Daily Mirror in circulation becoming the newspaper with the highest sales in the UK. It was MacKenzie though who cemented the paper's image as a right-wing tabloid, not only increasing its profile, but also making it known for its attacks on left-wing political figures and movements and its sensationalist front-page celebrity expos√©s.Tanya Gold \\"Kelvin MacKenzie destroyed his own reputation years before Hillsborough\\", The Guardian, 28 September 2012 These often proved to be misleading or false, with many controversies in this area occurring during MacKenzie editorship. Commentators including The Guardian contributor Roy Greenslade and journalist John Pilger have commented on the alleged 'Murdoch effect'. MacKenzie himself stated that he feels that his own spell as editor of The Sun had a \\"positively downhill impact on journalism\\". MacKenzie is quoted as saying in the early 1980s (on the subject of how he perceived The Suns target audience): The paper was frequently accused of dumbing down public discourse because of its preoccupations; Pilger blamed it for the promotion of jingoism, racism, homophobia, and intolerance. MacKenzie was widely criticised for his perceived cruelty to both the targets of his ‚Äì sometimes false ‚Äì newspaper allegations; his choice of targets frequently being not only left-wing politicians and celebrities but even ordinary members of the public, and also his alleged cruelty to his own staff and colleagues, to which MacKenzie has since responded: The Suns headlines The sinking of the Belgrano was celebrated on the front page of the British tabloid newspaper The Sun MacKenzie was responsible for the \\"Gotcha\\" front-page headline of 4 May 1982, which reported the contentious sinking of the Argentinian cruiser General Belgrano by a British submarine during the Falklands War. MacKenzie was heavily condemned by some commentators who felt he was glorifying death and the headline caused a storm of controversy and protest, although MacKenzie had actually changed the front-page of later editions to \\"Did 1,200 Argies drown?\\" after it was established that there had been a large number of Argentine casualties. MacKenzie later defended his \\"Gotcha\\" headline, saying: Despite MacKenzie's self-professed pride at having printed the \\"Gotcha\\" headline, Roy Greenslade has said that he had only chosen the headline prior to it becoming clear that there had been a large number of Argentine casualties resulting from the sinking of the Belgrano and that even he later became concerned that the headline may be seen as insensitive and distasteful. Greenslade states that MacKenzie insisted on changing the headline to \\"Did 1,200 Argies Die?\\" for later editions because of these concerns, and that he did so against the wishes of Rupert Murdoch, present in the newspaper building at the time because of an industrial dispute, who reputedly demanded that the \\"Gotcha\\" headline remain, despite the large number of casualties and later said of the headline, \\"I rather liked it\\". This is reportedly the only occasion that MacKenzie ever disobeyed a specific order from Murdoch. MacKenzie's coverage of the Falklands War was criticised by many commentators for being a glorification of war (Greenslade was working with MacKenzie on The Sun at the time). Freddie Starr Ate My Hamster, The Sun, 13 March 1986 MacKenzie was responsible for the \\"Freddie Starr Ate My Hamster\\" front-page headline. The claims made in the accompanying article, that the comedian Freddie Starr had placed his girlfriend's hamster on a sandwich and proceeded to eat it, turned out to be entirely untrue and an invention of the publicist Max Clifford. The headline is often held up as the prime example of The Sun's supposedly celebrity-obsessed, sensationalist and often inaccurate journalism. The Suns politics In the general elections which were held during his time as editor, MacKenzie's Sun strongly supported the Conservative Party and its policies. Although the coverage of the 1992 election remains the best remembered, there were many other vitriolic personal attacks on Labour leaders by MacKenzie's Sun during elections, such as in 1983 campaign, when MacKenzie ran a front page featuring an unflattering photograph of Michael Foot, then nearly 70 years old, alongside the headline \\"Do You Really Want This Old Fool To Run Britain?\\".\\"Sun still shines for Blair\\", BBC News, 8 March 2001. Retrieved on 4 May 2007. MacKenzie's coverage of the British miners' strike in 1984‚Äì1985 supported the police and the Thatcher government against the striking NUM miners. The paper was accused of making misleading or even outright false claims about the miners, their unions and leader Arthur Scargill. MacKenzie at one point prepared a front page with the headline \\"Mine F√ºhrer\\" and a photograph of Scargill with his arm in the air, a pose giving the appearance of him making a Nazi salute. The print workers at The Sun, regarding it as an attempt at a cheap smear, refused to print it.Greg Philo, War and Peace News (Open University Press, 1985), p. 138.

Retrieved on 4 May 2007. On the day of the 1992 election MacKenzie used the front-page headline \\"If Kinnock Wins Today, Will The Last Person To Leave Britain Please Turn Out The Lights\\", accompanied by a picture of Kinnock's head superimposed over a lightbulb.\\"1992: Major confounds the polls\\", BBC News Election 2001. The Sun front page is reproduced. Retrieved on 4 May 2007. While the paper initially supported the government of John Major, because it appeared that Major himself shared the ideological hostility of Thatcher towards European integration, this soon changed. Following the UK's forced exit from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism on Black Wednesday in September 1992, according to MacKenzie, Major telephoned him to ask about how the paper would report the story. While Major has denied the conversation ever took place,George Eaton \\"John Major denies \\"bucket of shit\\" story\\", New Statesman (Staggers blog), 12 June 2012 MacKenzie has claimed his response was: \\"Prime Minister, I have on my desk in front of me a very large bucket of shit which I am just about to pour all over you.\\"Chippindale & Horrie, p. 442\\\\. The precise wording varies from source to source. Invented stories In January 1987, MacKenzie published a totally unfounded front-page story alleging that pop singer Elton John had had sex with underage rentboys. Shortly afterwards, MacKenzie published further entirely false allegations that the singer had had the voiceboxes of his guard dogs removed because their barking kept him awake at night. MacKenzie confirmed their inaccuracy shortly after publication by sending a reporter to the singer's house, who quickly discovered that all of his guard dogs were quite capable of barking. MacKenzie later said that in retrospect he found it difficult to understand why he had believed, never mind published, the claims about the guard dogs which he later realised were self-evidently absurd. Elton John sued The Sun for libel over both these claims and was later awarded ¬£1,000,000 in damages.Kelvin McKenzie \\"Boss applies blowtorch over rentboys\\", story from The Guardian as reproduced in the Sydney Morning Herald,27 April 2002. Retrieved on 4 May 2007. MacKenzie later said of Elton John: There were many other controversies during MacKenzie's time in charge of The Sun. MacKenzie at one point ran a story about a previously unknown member of the public who had just undergone a heart transplant operation, the story denouncing the man as a \\"love rat\\", Sun journalists having been told that he had left his wife 15 years earlier. Aside from criticism about the story's highly questionable news value, the newspaper was furiously condemned as the story was run when the man's recovery was still in the balance. MacKenzie and his team were accused of simply inventing many of the stories that appeared in the newspaper, as well as interviews, and in some instances this proved to be the case, such as when an entirely fabricated interview with the disfigured Falklands war hero Simon Weston was published, which was criticised for \\"inviting readers to feel revulsion at his disfigurement\\". MacKenzie himself once told his staff: \\"Give me a Sunday for Monday splash on the royals. Don't worry if it's not true‚Äîso long as there's not too much of a fuss about it afterwards.\\"Pimlott, Ben (2001). The Queen: Elizabeth II and the Monarchy. London: HarperCollins. , p. 521 Some other controversies that occurred under MacKenzie include a headline describing Australian Aborigines as \\"The Abo's: Brutal and Treacherous\\" (which was condemned as \\"inaccurate\\" and \\"unacceptably racist\\" by the Press Council) and MacKenzie's sending of photographers to break into a psychiatric hospital to ask actor Jeremy Brett, who was a patient in the hospital at the time and who was suffering from manic depression and dying of cardiomyopathy, whether he was \\"dying of AIDS\\". The newspaper apparently suspected Brett of being a homosexual and that his mystery illness might be AIDS, which it was not.David McKie \\"The very best of Holmes\\", The Guardian, 9 June 2005.

On the subject of the sensationalist and sometimes inaccurate reporting which appeared in The Sun during his time as editor, MacKenzie has said: Coverage of the Hillsborough disaster The false allegations on The Sun front page on 19 April 1989 caused widespread offence among Merseysiders, causing them to boycott the newspaper. In April 1989, the single biggest controversy during MacKenzie's period as editor occurred, later described in a Sun editorial in 2004 as \\"the most terrible mistake in our history\\", during the aftermath of the Hillsborough disaster, a deadly crush which occurred during an FA Cup semi-final at Hillsborough football stadium in Sheffield claiming the lives of 96 Liverpool fans. The Sun printed the front- page headline \\"The Truth\\", with three sub-headings, \\"Some Fans Picked Pockets of Victims\\", \\"Some Fans Urinated on the Brave Cops\\" and \\"Some Fans Beat Up PC Giving Kiss of Life\\". The accompanying article claimed that ticketless and drunken Liverpool fans were responsible for the disaster, having supposedly tried to fight their way into the stadium by rushing the turnstiles and attacking policemen outside the ground. Further specific allegations were made that during the disaster itself Liverpool fans inside the stadium had stolen wallets and other items from the dead, had urinated over policemen and the bodies of dead fans, that they had beaten policemen, ambulance men and rescue workers attempting to save the lives of other fans and had sexually abused the body of a dead girl after shouting \\"throw her up and we'll fuck her\\" to policemen moving her body. The sources for these allegations were stated to be anonymous high-ranking police officers from Sheffield police and Irvine Patnick, then Conservative MP for Sheffield Hallam, who was not even present at the match. In 2007, on BBC television's Question Time, MacKenzie additionally claimed that one of his sources was a regional news agency. The article was accompanied by graphic photographs showing Liverpool fans, including young children, choking and suffocating as they were being crushed against the perimeter fences surrounding the terraces ‚Äì this was widely condemned as inappropriate. The coverage and the allegations caused intense uproar throughout Merseyside, where The Sun was boycotted, with public burnings of the paper organised and many newsagents (including in Everton F.C.-supporting areas) refusing to stock it at all. There was widespread criticism and condemnation from many commentators. The Press Council described the allegations unequivocally as \\"lies\\". The official government enquiry into the disaster dismissed the allegation that drunken Liverpool fans had been responsible for the disaster and concluded that inadequate crowd control and errors by the police had been the primary cause of the tragedy. Prior to the publication of The Suns initial article, a number of local newspapers in Yorkshire, such as the Sheffield Star and The Yorkshire Post, published very similar allegations.Hillsborough Football Disaster ‚Äì The Immediate Aftermath ‚Äì The Media reaction, Contrast website. Retrieved on 4 May 2007. It has since emerged that many British national newspaper editors were offered the same story from the same sources the day before The Sun article was published but while many national newspapers printed allegations about Liverpool fans being responsible for the disaster, only MacKenzie and his counterpart at the Daily Star newspaper were prepared to print the more outlandish allegations about theft and abuse of dead bodies, with many editors feeling that the claims sounded dubious. Furthermore, the other national papers which printed coverage claiming Liverpool fans to be responsible for the disaster, including the Daily Star, withdrew their allegations and apologised the day after publication, whereas The Sun did not. In their book about the history of The Sun, Peter Chippindale and Chris Horrie wrote: Murdoch for his part ordered MacKenzie to appear on BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend in the aftermath of the controversy to apologise. MacKenzie said on the programme: \\"It was my decision and my decision alone to do that front page in that way and I made a rather serious error\\". In 1993 he told a House of Commons National Heritage Select Committee that In 1996, MacKenzie again discussed the matter on Radio 4 but this time said: \\"The Sun did not accuse anybody of anything. We were the vehicle for others\\". Sales of The Sun on Merseyside have not recovered, with News International (now News UK) losing several million pounds a year in revenue. Many newsagents on Merseyside continue to refuse to stock the newspaper. After editing The Sun In January 1994, MacKenzie moved to BSkyB, another of Murdoch's News Corporation assets, but left within a few months. In 1995, MacKenzie joined Mirror Group Newspapers and was appointed joint boss of its fledgling L!VE TV British cable television channel. The station had previously been headed by Janet Street-Porter, who had set out to establish L!VE TV as an alternative, youth-orientated station. She clashed with MacKenzie over programme content and soon left, leaving him in sole charge. MacKenzie later said that he would agree to indulge in a \\"night of passion\\" with Janet Street-Porter and that he would be \\"willing\\" but only if she paid him ¬£4.7m, a figure he had arrived at after calculating how much money he would lose from \\"loss of reputation, the negative impact on future earnings etc\\". MacKenzie took a radically different approach and was criticised for producing severely down-market programming. MacKenzie introduced features such as nightly editions of 'Topless Darts' (featuring topless women playing darts on a beach), 'The Weather in Norwegian' (with a young, typically blonde and bikini-clad Scandinavian woman presenting weather forecasts in both English and Norwegian), other weather forecasts featuring dwarfs bouncing on trampolines and stock exchange reports presented by Tiffany, a young female presenter who would strip to her underwear as she read out the latest share prices. A large amount of airtime was given over to tarot card readers and astrologers. L!VE TV's best known character was the News Bunny, a man dressed as a giant rabbit who popped up during news broadcasts to give a thumbs up or a thumbs down to the various news stories to indicate whether or not he found them interesting or exciting. The station had a budget of only ¬£2,000 an hour and attracted a very small audience, with an average of 200,000 viewers, but it was well-known because of the controversy and criticism surrounding its programming, which led to the station being labelled \\"Tabloid TV\\" and even \\"Sun TV\\" (in reference to the newspaper, some critics accusing MacKenzie of doing nothing more than creating a television version of his old newspaper). MacKenzie has been accused of taking a \\"shamelessly tacky approach\\". He eventually left the station in 1997. He later said on LIVE TV: The station failed and closed. In November 1998, MacKenzie headed a consortium, TalkCo Holdings, which purchased Talk Radio from CLT for ¬£24.7 million. One of the financial backers was News International, News Corporation's UK subsidiary. In 1999 TalkCo was renamed The Wireless Group and in January 2000 Talk Radio was rebranded as TalkSport. The Wireless Group acquired The Radio Partnership in 1999, gaining control of its nine local commercial stations. In May 2005, it was announced that the Northern Irish media company, UTV plc, had made an agreed offer to buy the company, subject to shareholder and regulatory approval. In June 2005, the takeover proceeded, with MacKenzie being replaced by UTV executive Scott Taunton. The station lost listeners during MacKenzie's tenure. In September 2005, MacKenzie took over Highbury House Communications, a magazine publishing company based in Bournemouth and Orpington. HHC held a number of titles mainly in the leisure and computer games market with a 'ladette' title sitting uncomfortably in its portfolio. HHC was already suffering from massive debts when MacKenzie took the reins and despite efforts on his part to broker a life-line to save the ailing company, he had inherited a poisoned legacy. This venture also failed; Highbury closed in December 2005. MacKenzie then spent a year as chairman of one of the UK's largest marketing and communications groups, Media Square plc. This was unsuccessful and MacKenzie left in March 2007.Chris Tryhorn \\"MacKenzie quits marketing group\\", The Guardian, 29 March 2007. Retrieved on 4 May 2007. Despite the aforementioned criticism of the corporation, in March 2006, MacKenzie joined BBC Radio Five Live as a presenter. He made his debut on the station over the summer, presenting a series of programmes telling the story of various scandals which have occurred at FIFA World Cup tournaments over the years. He then presented a retrospective look at the year gone by on Christmas Day.\\"Kelvin MacKenzie makes his debut on Five Live\\", BBC press release, 30 March 2006. Retrieved on 4 May 2007. In May 2006, MacKenzie returned to The Sun, this time as a columnist, where he was accused using one of his columns to launch an attack on the people of Scotland (see below). On the subject of the columns themselves, he has said \\"I want to get the Lonsdale Belt for vile and be personally rude to as many people as possible.\\" In June 2011, it was announced that MacKenzie would leave The Sun to write a column for the Daily Mail. It emerged in December 2016, during a civil case, that he had left The Sun because Rebekah Brooks, then head of News International, and Dominic Mohan, then editor of The Sun, had not told him of the extent of the company's phone hacking scandal. MacKenzie was also concerned about their employment of Jeremy Clarkson whose privacy injunction against his ex-wife was then in force. However he left the Mail in July 2012 after writing for the title for one year, citing an \\"increased commercial workload\\". Subsequently, The Guardian reported that MacKenzie's departure was due to disagreements regarding the editing of his column. MacKenzie was an early investor in online video company Base79, established by his son Ashley MacKenzie in 2007. They sold the firm in 2014. In 2011 MacKenzie launched the online TV channel Sports Tonight, describing the channel as \\"Sky Sports News meets TalkSport\\". The channel received investment from former Conservative Party treasurer Lord Ashcroft, who took a minority stake. MacKenzie joined The Daily Telegraph as an online columnist in 2013, but he was dropped by the newspaper after one column, with Roy Greenslade reporting in The Guardian that he was let go because of upset among staff on the Telegraph sports desk at his role in reporting on the Hillsborough disaster, in particular from football columnist and ex-Liverpool player Alan Hansen, who played at Hillsborough. In April 2013, The Guardian reported that the Daily Mail was being sued for libel for ¬£200,000 over a column by MacKenzie. The claim was brought by an NHS doctor, Antonio Serrano, whom MacKenzie had criticised in the paper. In October 2014, MacKenzie was a contestant on gameshow Pointless Celebrities. Angered viewers complained to host Richard Osman, who said that if he had known in advance, he would not have let him appear. In December 2014 The Sun announced that MacKenzie would make a second return to the newspaper as a columnist. Political ambitions MacKenzie's commitment to Conservative, Thatcherite politics has led him to argue that Margaret Thatcher is the UK's greatest post-war prime minister.\\"Your Favourite Prime Minister\\", The Daily Politics official BBC website, 13 June 2007. Features a video of MacKenzie championing Margaret Thatcher as the UK's greatest post-war Prime Minister. Retrieved 14 October 2007. In 2003, he presented a documentary, Kelvin Saves the Tories, in which he proposed a low-tax, anti-BBC and cautiously pro-capital punishment manifesto for the party. However, in February 2008, in a Sun newspaper article, MacKenzie claimed that he is now against the return of the death penalty. In May 2008, MacKenzie stood for election as a local councillor in Elmbridge. He lost the election, gaining 227 votes whereas the Conservative seat holder Glenn Dearlove won 679. That same year, after Conservative member of parliament David Davis announced that he would resign his seat in the House of Commons in order to fight a by-election as a protest against the Labour government's plans for 42-day detention without charge for terrorist suspects, MacKenzie announced that he was likely to contest the election on a pro-42-day detention platform, stating: \\"I have been associated with The Sun for 30 years. The Sun is very, very hostile to David Davis because of his 28 day stance and The Sun has always been very up for 42 days and perhaps even 420 days\\". Off-camera, before a BBC interview, MacKenzie referred to Hull, which the Haltemprice and Howden constituency borders, as \\"an absolute shocker\\". Asked to clarify those comments, he said it was \\"a joke\\" and that he has \\"never actually been to Hull\\". MacKenzie subsequently decided not to run for the Haltemprice and Howden seat, stating: \\"The clincher for me was the money. Clearly The Sun couldn't put up the cash ‚Äì so I was going to have to rustle up a maximum of ¬£100,000 to conduct my campaign.\\" Later developments in the Hillsborough controversy=Incidents in 2006‚Äì7 During an after-dinner speech to Newcastle-based law firm Mincoffs Solicitors on 30 November 2006, MacKenzie is reported to have said of his coverage of the Hillsborough disaster:MacKenzie's Hillsborough - 'The Sun told The Truth, The Independent, 2 December 2006 MacKenzie went on to compare Merseysiders with animal rights activists. \\"If this got out, it would blow up all over again\\", MacKenzie is said to have remarked. The remarks were met with widespread incredulity and condemnation, particularly on Merseyside, where Liverpool F.C., the local Liverpool Echo and numerous local MPs condemned MacKenzie, with Walton MP Peter Kilfoyle arguing that the quotes confirmed that MacKenzie was \\"never fit to edit a national newspaper\\". The Liverpool Echo called for The Sun to sack MacKenzie as a columnist. The Sun issued a statement saying that they had \\"already apologised for what happened and we stand by that apology.\\" However, despite reports of consternation at The Sun over MacKenzie's statements, the newspaper chose to retain him as a columnist. MacKenzie refused to comment publicly on the controversy and pulled out of a scheduled appearance on BBC television's Question Time later that week. Earlier that autumn MacKenzie had already provoked controversy in Liverpool by stating in a Press Gazette interview that he had never knowingly printed any lies in The Sun and that even stories which later turned out to be untrue were still \\"good stories\\". In relation to the publishing of false or misleading reports in The Sun, MacKenzie asked \\"What am I supposed to feel ashamed about?\\" MacKenzie was not specifically referring to the coverage of the Hillsborough disaster and made no mention of the tragedy during the interview, but the Liverpool Echo published a piece reporting MacKenzie's statements and criticising the apparent lack of shame or regret over the Hillsborough coverage implied by them (and the fact that MacKenzie may still regard the misleading coverage as a \\"good story\\"). Although there was actually little reaction to the quotes on Merseyside at the time, they did draw comment from Phil Hammond, chairman of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, who said: \\"I can't believe that even after all these years, there is no remorse or regret for the hurt he caused\\".Roy Greenslade \\"MacKenzie 'no lies' claim angers Merseyside\\", blog on The Guardian website, [no date]. Retrieved on 4 May 2007. It was still thought at this point however that, although MacKenzie appeared not to regret the coverage, he no longer regarded it as having any factual basis after his apparent admissions in the past that the allegations made were lies fed to him by police officers and a Conservative MP. On 6 January 2007, a protest took place at Anfield Stadium, the home of Liverpool F.C., during the FA Cup Third Round match against Arsenal F.C.. The protest was organised by fan group Reclaim The Kop, with the support of Liverpool F.C., and was directed towards MacKenzie personally and his continuing allegations about Hillsborough, and also towards the BBC (which was present at the stadium, broadcasting the game live on television) for employing MacKenzie as a radio presenter and paying him with television licence payers' (and therefore public) money. Almost 12,000 people in the Kop stand held up a mosaic which spelled out the words 'The Truth' whilst Liverpool supporters chanted \\"Justice for the 96\\" for six minutes, signifying the length of time that the Hillsborough game played on for before being abandoned. MacKenzie did not publicly respond to the protest. On 11 January 2007, MacKenzie appeared on BBC television's Question Time programme, broadcast from a venue in Kent. Towards the end of the programme, MacKenzie was asked by presenter David Dimbleby about The Suns claims about the Hillsborough disaster. MacKenzie said that he stood by his allegation that ticketless fans were the cause of the disaster but that he does not know whether the other allegations about theft from the dead and fans urinating over victims and policemen were true. Clare Short MP suggested MacKenzie should apologise to the bereaved families and survivors who say that his claims cause them distress and hurt but he refused, claiming that it would make no difference anyway due to the bad blood between himself and Liverpool F.C. MacKenzie suggested that those who feel angry at him should instead direct their anger towards \\"someone who caused the disaster\\". MacKenzie was heckled by some members of the audience while Short was applauded when she repeated her suggestion that he should retract his claims and apologise, but MacKenzie remained adamant that he had nothing to apologise for. In February 2007, Independent journalist Matthew Norman claimed that MacKenzie was considering issuing a public apology for his coverage of the Hillsborough disaster, although at the time he was \\"still unsure\\" as to whether to do so.\\"Matthew Norman's Media Diary\\", The Independent, 26 February 2007. Retrieved on 4 May 2007. His former colleague at The Sun, Roy Greenslade has suggested that the real reason why MacKenzie may be so hesitant to apologise and admit the inaccuracy of the coverage may be his \\"anti-Scouse\\" bias, which Greenslade suspects makes it difficult for MacKenzie to \\"bring himself to say sorry to the city's people\\".Roy Greenslade \\"Vote, vote, vote for Kelvin MacKenzie\\", blog on The Guardian website, 28 February 2007. Retrieved on 4 May 2007. Fans exoneration (2012) On 12 September 2012, following the publication of the official report into the disaster using previously withheld government papers which has exonerated the Liverpool fans present at the match, MacKenzie issued the following statement: Trevor Hicks, chairman of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, rejected Mr MacKenzie's apology as \\"too little, too late\\", calling him \\"lowlife, clever lowlife, but lowlife\\". The copy from White's news agency was available to other newspapers, who reported the story as allegations ‚Äì The Sun reported the allegations, on McKenzie's say-so, as 'the truth'.Roy Greenslade commenting on McKenzie's apology, Up All Night, Radio 5 Live, 13 September 2012 Following the Warrington Inquests verdicts, Mackenzie was door-stepped by Alex Thomson of Channel 4 News. He was filmed pleading \\"Please Alex, this isn't reasonable\\". Nine complaints were received by Ofcom asserting MacKenzie's privacy had been invaded, but in its adjudication, the regulator rejected the application. Comments in 2016‚Äì7 Despite apologising on a number of platforms, in 2016, MacKenzie made a joke in The Sun newspaper that if it was true that George Osborne (the then Chancellor of the Exchequer) was putting gongs up for sale, he should be made Lord MacKenzie of Anfield (Liverpool FC's home stadium). A day before the 28th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster in April 2017, MacKenzie's column in The Sun mentioned the Everton footballer Ross Barkley appearing to imply Barkley deserved to be beaten up in a nightclub incident earlier in the week. Comparing the player to a \\"gorilla at the zoo\\", MacKenzie was accused of racism (Barkley is of part-Nigerian descent). The column was removed from the newspaper's website on the afternoon of its day of publication. Later in the day, a spokesman for the newspaper apologised \\"for the offence caused\\" and said the columnist \\"has been suspended from the paper with immediate effect. The views expressed by Kelvin Mackenzie about the people of Liverpool were wrong, unfunny and are not the view of the paper\\". A month after the column appeared, it was announced that MacKenzie's \\"contract with News Group Newspapers\\", the Suns publishers, \\"has been terminated by mutual consent\\". In response to MacKenzie's article, on the day of its publication Everton FC banned The Sun and its reporters \\"from all areas of its operation\\" following Liverpool FC who had made such a decision about The Sun in February 2017. Attacks on Scotland In 2007 MacKenzie made a series of attacks on the people of Scotland, although he is of Scottish descent ‚Äì his grandfather was from Stirling. In July 2006, MacKenzie wrote a column for The Sun newspaper referring to Scots as \\"Tartan Tosspots\\" and apparently rejoicing in the fact that Scotland has a lower life expectancy than the rest of the United Kingdom. MacKenzie's column provoked a storm of protest, and was heavily condemned by numerous commentators including Scottish MPs and MSPs. Question Time On 11 October 2007, MacKenzie appeared on the BBC's Question Time TV programme and launched another attack on Scotland. During a debate about tax, MacKenzie claimed that: The comments came as part of an attack on prime minister Gordon Brown, whom MacKenzie said could not be trusted to manage the British economy because he was \\"a socialist Scot\\", and insisting that this was relevant to the debate. Fellow panellist Chuka Umunna from the think tank Compass called his comments \\"absolutely disgraceful\\", and booing and jeering were heard from the Cheltenham studio audience. The BBC received around 200 complaints and MacKenzie's comments drew widespread criticism, including comments from the Scottish entrepreneur Duncan Bannatyne who responded on BBC Radio 5 Live: On 13 January 2012, MacKenzie once again appeared on the BBC's Question Time television programme and remarked on the move for Scottish independence: Accusation of Islamophobia In July 2016, after the Nice truck attack, MacKenzie wrote an article for The Sun in which he queried whether it was appropriate for Channel 4 News presenter Fatima Manji to read the news wearing a hijab. Manji accused MacKenzie of attempting to \\"intimidate Muslims out of public life\\" and attempting to smear 1.6 billion Muslims in suggesting they are inherently violent. She said, \\"He has attempted to smear half of them further by suggesting they are helpless slaves. And he has attempted to smear me by suggesting I would sympathise with a terrorist\\". The Independent Press Standards Organisation (IPSO) received 17 complaints about Manji wearing the hijab, an objection which was rejected. Eventually, the IPSO received 1,700 complaints about MacKenzie's article. The IPSO ruled in October 2016 that MacKenzie was \\"entitled\\" to make his comments, and a \\"prejudicial or pejorative reference\\" to Manji's religion was not present in the article. Manji said the ruling meant it was now \\"open season on minorities, and Muslims in particular\\". Personal life MacKenzie married Jacqueline Holland in 1968 in Camberwell. They had a daughter (born 1969) and two sons (born 1972 and 1974). His elder son and his daughter worked at Talkradio. In the late 1990s, MacKenzie was featured in The Mail on Sunday, holidaying in what the paper described as a \\"love nest\\" in Barbados with News International secretary Joanna Duckworth.\\"Axe Grinder 31.03.06\\", Press Gazette (online edition), 30 March 2006.

Equivalently, a powerful number is the product of a square and a cube, that is, a number m of the form m = a2b3, where a and b are positive integers. Powerful numbers are also known as squareful, square- full, or 2-full. Paul Erd≈ës and George Szekeres studied such numbers and Solomon W. Golomb named such numbers powerful. The following is a list of all powerful numbers between 1 and 1000: :1, 4, 8, 9, 16, 25, 27, 32, 36, 49, 64, 72, 81, 100, 108, 121, 125, 128, 144, 169, 196, 200, 216, 225, 243, 256, 288, 289, 324, 343, 361, 392, 400, 432, 441, 484, 500, 512, 529, 576, 625, 648, 675, 676, 729, 784, 800, 841, 864, 900, 961, 968, 972, 1000, ... .  Equivalence of the two definitions  If m = a2b3, then every prime in the prime factorization of a appears in the prime factorization of m with an exponent of at least two, and every prime in the prime factorization of b appears in the prime factorization of m with an exponent of at least three; therefore, m is powerful. In the other direction, suppose that m is powerful, with prime factorization :m = \\\\prod p_i^{\\\\alpha_i}, where each Œ±i ‚â• 2. Define Œ≥i to be three if Œ±i is odd, and zero otherwise, and define Œ≤i = Œ±i ‚àí Œ≥i. Then, all values Œ≤i are nonnegative even integers, and all values Œ≥i are either zero or three, so :m = \\\\left(\\\\prod p_i^{\\\\beta_i}\\\\right)\\\\left(\\\\prod p_i^{\\\\gamma_i}\\\\right) = \\\\left(\\\\prod p_i^{\\\\beta_i/2}\\\\right)^2\\\\left(\\\\prod p_i^{\\\\gamma_i/3}\\\\right)^3 supplies the desired representation of m as a product of a square and a cube. Informally, given the prime factorization of m, take b to be the product of the prime factors of m that have an odd exponent (if there are none, then take b to be 1). Because m is powerful, each prime factor with an odd exponent has an exponent that is at least 3, so m/b3 is an integer. In addition, each prime factor of m/b3 has an even exponent, so m/b3 is a perfect square, so call this a2; then m = a2b3. For example: :m = 21600 = 2^5 \\\\times 3^3 \\\\times 5^2 \\\\, , :b = 2 \\\\times 3 = 6 \\\\, , :a = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{m}{b^3}} = \\\\sqrt{2^2 \\\\times 5^2} = 10 \\\\, , :m = a^2b^3 = 10^2 \\\\times 6^3 \\\\, . The representation m = a2b3 calculated in this way has the property that b is squarefree, and is uniquely defined by this property.  Mathematical properties  The sum of the reciprocals of the powerful numbers converges. The value of this sum may be written in several other ways, including as the infinite product : \\\\prod_p\\\\left(1+\\\\frac{1}{p(p-1)}\\\\right)=\\\\frac{\\\\zeta(2)\\\\zeta(3)}{\\\\zeta(6)} = \\\\frac{315}{2\\\\pi^4}\\\\zeta(3), where p runs over all primes, Œ∂(s) denotes the Riemann zeta function, and Œ∂(3) is Ap√©ry's constant.(Golomb, 1970) More generally, the sum of the reciprocals of the sth powers of the powerful numbers (a Dirichlet series generating function) is equal to :\\\\frac{\\\\zeta(2s)\\\\zeta(3s)}{\\\\zeta(6s)} whenever it converges. Let k(x) denote the number of powerful numbers in the interval [1,x]. Then k(x) is proportional to the square root of x. More precisely, : cx^{1/2}-3x^{1/3}\\\\le k(x) \\\\le cx^{1/2}, c = \\\\zeta(3/2)/\\\\zeta(3) = 2.173 \\\\ldots (Golomb, 1970). The two smallest consecutive powerful numbers are 8 and 9. Since Pell's equation has infinitely many integral solutions, there are infinitely many pairs of consecutive powerful numbers (Golomb, 1970); more generally, one can find consecutive powerful numbers by solving a similar Pell equation for any perfect cube . However, one of the two powerful numbers in a pair formed in this way must be a square. According to Guy, Erd≈ës has asked whether there are infinitely many pairs of consecutive powerful numbers such as in which neither number in the pair is a square. showed that there are indeed infinitely many such pairs by showing that has infinitely many solutions. Walker's solutions to this equation are generated, for any odd integer , by considering the number :(2\\\\sqrt{7}+3\\\\sqrt{3})^{7k}=a\\\\sqrt{7}+b\\\\sqrt{3}, for integers divisible by 7 and divisible by 3, and constructing from and the consecutive powerful numbers and with . The smallest consecutive pair in this family is generated for , , and as :7\\\\cdot 2637362^2 = 2^2\\\\cdot 7^3\\\\cdot 13^2\\\\cdot 43^2\\\\cdot 337^2=48689748233308 and :3\\\\cdot 4028637^2 = 3^3\\\\cdot 139^2\\\\cdot 9661^2 = 48689748233307. It is a conjecture of Erd≈ës, Mollin, and Walsh that there are no three consecutive powerful numbers.  Sums and differences of powerful numbers  Visual proof that the differences of consecutive squares are consecutive odd numbers Any odd number is a difference of two consecutive squares: (k + 1)2 = k2 \\\\+ 2k + 1, so (k + 1)2 ‚àí k2 = 2k + 1. Similarly, any multiple of four is a difference of the squares of two numbers that differ by two: (k + 2)2 ‚àí k2 = 4k + 4. However, a singly even number, that is, a number divisible by two but not by four, cannot be expressed as a difference of squares. This motivates the question of determining which singly even numbers can be expressed as differences of powerful numbers. Golomb exhibited some representations of this type: :2 = 33 ‚àí 52 :10 = 133 ‚àí 37 :18 = 192 ‚àí 73 = 35 ‚àí 152. It had been conjectured that 6 cannot be so represented, and Golomb conjectured that there are infinitely many integers which cannot be represented as a difference between two powerful numbers. However, Narkiewicz showed that 6 can be so represented in infinitely many ways such as :6 = 5473 ‚àí 4632, and McDaniel showed that every integer has infinitely many such representations (McDaniel, 1982). Erd≈ës conjectured that every sufficiently large integer is a sum of at most three powerful numbers; this was proved by Roger Heath-Brown (1987).  Generalization  More generally, we can consider the integers all of whose prime factors have exponents at least k. Such an integer is called a k-powerful number, k-ful number, or k-full number. :(2k+1 ‚àí 1)k, 2k(2k+1 ‚àí 1)k, (2k+1 ‚àí 1)k+1 are k-powerful numbers in an arithmetic progression. Moreover, if a1, a2, ..., as are k-powerful in an arithmetic progression with common difference d, then : a1(as \\\\+ d)k, a2(as + d)k, ..., as(as + d)k, (as + d)k+1 are s + 1 k-powerful numbers in an arithmetic progression. We have an identity involving k-powerful numbers: :ak(al \\\\+ ... + 1)k \\\\+ ak + 1(al \\\\+ ... + 1)k \\\\+ ... + ak + l(al \\\\+ ... + 1)k = ak(al \\\\+ ... +1)k+1. This gives infinitely many l+1-tuples of k-powerful numbers whose sum is also k-powerful. Nitaj shows there are infinitely many solutions of x+y=z in relatively prime 3-powerful numbers(Nitaj, 1995). Cohn constructs an infinite family of solutions of x+y=z in relatively prime non-cube 3-powerful numbers as follows: the triplet :X = 9712247684771506604963490444281, Y = 32295800804958334401937923416351, Z = 27474621855216870941749052236511 is a solution of the equation 32X3 \\\\+ 49Y3 = 81Z3.

She was the editor and producer of the Network 7 series on Channel Four, which was awarded a BAFTA for its graphics. Street-Porter was also an editor for two years of The Independent on Sunday, but relinquished the job to become editor-at-large in 2002. Since 2011, she has been a regular weekly panellist on the ITV talk show Loose Women. Street-Porter has made numerous appearances on television programmes, including Question Time (1988‚Äì2015), I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! (2004, 2013), Deadline (2007), Celebrity MasterChef (2013), and Have I Got News for You (1996‚Äì2018). She was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2016 Birthday Honours for services to journalism and broadcasting. Early life Street-Porter was born in Brentford, Middlesex, the daughter of Stanley W. G. Bull, an electrical engineer who had served as a sergeant in the Royal Corps of Signals in World War II and Cherry Cuff Ardern (n√©e Jones) who was WelshLoose Women, 22 March 2012 and worked as a school dinner lady and in the civil service as a clerical assistant in a tax office. Her mother was still married to her first husband, George Ardern, at the time, and was not to marry Stanley until 1954, hence her name being recorded thus in the birth records. She was later to take her father's surname. Street-Porter grew up in Fulham, West London and Perivale, Greater London after the family moved there when she was 14 and the family would stay in her mother's home town of Llanfairfechan in North Wales for their holidays. She attended Peterborough Primary and Junior Schools in Fulham and Lady Margaret Grammar School for Girls (now Lady Margaret School) in Parsons Green from 1958 to 1964 where she passed 8 O-levels and 3 A-levels in English, History and Art. She also took an A-level in pure mathematics but did not pass the exam. Whilst studying A-levels, she had an illegal abortion.Generation '66, BBC Four, 31 July 2016 She then spent two years at the Architectural Association School of Architecture, where she met her first husband, photographer Tim Street-Porter. Career Street-Porter became fashion editor of the Evening Standard in 1971. When the LBC local radio station began to broadcast in 1973, Street-Porter co-presented a mid-morning show with Fleet Street columnist Paul Callan. The intention was sharply to contrast the urbane Callan and the urban Street-Porter. Their respective accents became known to the station's studio engineers as \\"cut-glass\\" and \\"cut-froat.\\" Friction between the ill-matched pair involved constant one- upmanship. In early 1975, Street-Porter was launch editor of Sell Out, an offshoot of the London listings magazine Time Out, with its publisher and her second husband, Tony Elliott. The magazine was not a success. Television Street-Porter began to work in television at LWT in 1975, first as a reporter on a series of mainly youth-oriented programmes, including The London Weekend Show (1975‚Äì79), then went on to present the late-night chat show Saturday Night People (1978‚Äì80) with Clive James and Russell Harty. She later produced Twentieth Century Box (1980‚Äì82), presented by Danny Baker. Street-Porter was editor of the Network 7 series on Channel Four from 1987. In the same year, BBC2 controller Alan Yentob appointed her to become head of youth and entertainment features, making her responsible for the twice-weekly DEF II. She commissioned Rapido, Red Dwarf and Rough Guide, and she was responsible for the cancellation of the long-running music series The Old Grey Whistle Test. Her Network 7 show was awarded a BAFTA for its graphics in 1988. In 1992, Street-Porter provided the story for The Vampyr: A Soap Opera, the BBC's adaptation of Heinrich August Marschner's opera Der Vampyr, which featured a new libretto by Charles Hart. Street-Porter's approach did not endear her to critics, who objected to her diction and questioned her suitability as an influence on Britain's youth. In her final year at the BBC, she became head of independent commissioning. She left the BBC for Mirror Group Newspapers in 1994 to become joint-managing director with Kelvin MacKenzie of the ill-fated L!VE TV channel. She left after four months. In 1996, Street-Porter set up her own production company. Since 1996, Street-Porter has appeared several times on the BBC panel show Have I Got News for You, most recently in May 2020. Since 1998, Street-Porter has appeared annually on BBC's Question Time except in 2013. In 2000, Street-Porter was nominated for the \\"Mae West Award for the Most Outspoken Woman in the Industry\\" at Carlton Television's Women in Film and Television Awards. In 2007, Street-Porter starred in an ITV2 reality show called Deadline, serving as a tough-talking editor who worked with a team of celebrity \\"reporters\\" whose job it was to produce a weekly gossip magazine. The celebrities in question had to endure the Street-Porter tongue as she decided each week which of them to fire. In 2011, Street-Porter became a regular panellist on ITV's chat show Loose Women. In 2013, she appeared in Celebrity MasterChef reaching the final three. She also appeared in the television show QI. Since 1 September 2014, Street-Porter has co-hosted BBC One cookery programme A Taste of Britain with chef Brian Turner and ran for 20 episodes in one series. Street-Porter has appeared on numerous reality TV shows, including Call Me a Cabbie and So You Think You Can Teach; the latter saw her trying to work as a primary school teacher. She conducted numerous interviews with business figures and others for Bloomberg TV. Newspaper work Street-Porter became editor of The Independent on Sunday in 1999. Despite derision from her critics, she took the paper's circulation up to 270,460, an increase of 11.6 per cent. In 2002, Street-Porter became editor- at-large as well as writing a regular column. Editor-at-large column Following the death of Ian Tomlinson, Street-Porter dedicated her editor-at- large column in the Independent on Sunday to painting a picture of Tomlinson as a \\"troubled man with quite a few problems\\": > Knowing that he was an alcoholic is critical to understanding his sense of > disorientation and his attitude towards the police, which might on first > viewing of the video footage, seem a bit stroppy. Other activities The Clerkenwell house commissioned by Janet Street-Porter A prominent rambler, Street-Porter was president of the Ramblers' Association for two years from 1994. She walked across Britain from Dungeness in Kent to Conwy in Wales for the television series Coast to Coast in 1998. Street-Porter also walked from Edinburgh to London in a straight line in 1998, for a television series and her book, As the Crow Flies.As the Crow Flies, Metro Books, London (1998) In 1994, for the documentary series The Longest Walk, Street-Porter visited long-distance walker Ffyona Campbell on the last section of her round-the-world walk. In 1966, Street-Porter appeared as an extra in the nightclub scene in Blowup, dancing in a silver coat and striped trousers. In 2003, she wrote and presented a one-woman show at the Edinburgh Festival titled All the Rage. She published the autobiographical Baggage in 2004, about her childhood in working class London. Its sequel is titled Fallout. Life's Too F***ing Short is a volume which presents, as she puts it, her answer to \\"getting what you want out of life by the most direct route.\\" Personal life While studying architecture, she married another student, Tim Street- Porter. She has been married four times and is now in a relationship with restaurateur Peter Spanton. She has no children. She currently lives in Thurlton in Norfolk, Kent and London. She previously had a home in Nidderdale, North Yorkshire. An active member of the Nidderdale community, she contributed her time and energy to a number of local causes. She was the president of the Burley Bridge Association, leading a campaign for a crossing over the River Wharfe linking North and West Yorkshire. She was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2016 Birthday Honours for services to journalism and broadcasting. Health Since the Coronavirus outbreak, Street-Porter has guest appeared on This Morning to review the political decisions taken by the government alongside Matthew Wright, via video call from her home in Kent. Street-Porter was diagnosed with skin cancer in January 2020. On 23 June 2020, she announced her news on Loose Woman from home via video call due to Coronavirus restrictions.

He was born in South Africa to British parents. Early life and family Parris is the eldest of six children (three brothers and two sisters) and grew up in several British territories and former territories: South Africa, Cyprus, Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), Swaziland (now Eswatini) and Jamaica, where his father was working as an electrical engineer. His parents ended up working and living in Catalonia, Spain, where Parris later bought a house. Education Parris was educated at Waterford Kamhlaba United World College of Southern Africa, an independent school just outside Mbabane in Swaziland, and Clare College, Cambridge, where he gained a first class degree in law and was a member of the Liberal Club. He won a Paul Mellon scholarship and studied international relations at Yale University. He has said that an early reading of Animal Farm made him a Conservative, as \\"An admiration for [the pigs'] intelligence and sense of order dawned in me.\\" Early career At the age of 19, Parris drove across Africa to Europe in a Morris Oxford; the trip was traumatically punctuated when he and his female companion were attacked, and he was forced to witness her rape.Chance Witness, pp. 94‚Äì95 Parris was offered a job as an MI6 officer,Chance Witness, p.134 but instead worked for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office for two years. In 1976 he left this secure career because he did not like its formality, and because he wanted to become a Member of Parliament. He eventually joined the Conservative Research Department and moved on to become correspondence secretary to Margaret Thatcher. He was awarded an RSPCA medal (presented by Thatcher, then Leader of the Opposition), for jumping into the River Thames and rescuing a dog.Chance Witness, p.197 Parliamentary career Parris was the Conservative MP for the parliamentary constituency of West Derbyshire from 1979 to 1986. Competing prospective candidates for the seat included Peter Lilley and Michael Howard. He voiced support for gay rights. Parris left politics to pursue a career in journalism. Radio and television Parris is now a radio and television presenter, The Times columnist, and pundit. As an MP he took part in a World in Action documentary during 1984 requiring him to live in Newcastle for a week on ¬£26.80, the then state social security payment set for a single adult by the government he supported as a Conservative.\\"British Film Industry: WORLD IN ACTION > FOR THE BENEFIT OF MR PARRIS\\" Thames TV, 23 January 1984\\"ITV TV Classics ‚Äì World In Action\\" Published 4 May 2007, retrieved 16 July 2009 The experiment came to an embarrassing end when he ran out of money for the electricity meter. Twenty years later, in 2004, he attempted the experiment again for the documentary For the Benefit of Mr Parris, Revisited.\\"British Film Industry: FOR THE BENEFIT OF MR PARRIS, REVISITED\\" ITV1, 29 January 2004 Parris resigned as an MP by applying for the Crown position of Steward of the Manor of Northstead and left Parliament specifically to take over from Brian Walden as host of ITV's influential Sunday lunchtime current-affairs series Weekend World in 1986. The series, broadcast since 1977 with Walden at its helm, ran for two more years under Parris before being cancelled in 1988. He presents BBC Radio 4's Great Lives biography series, and has appeared on the comedy news programme Have I Got News for You and presented After Dark. In 2007, Parris presented two light-hearted but caustic documentaries for Radio 4 on politicians' use of clich√© and jargon, entitled Not My Words, Mr Speaker. On 8 July 2011, on Radio 4's Any Questions, at the height of the furore surrounding the alleged illegal and corrupt activities of News of the World journalists, Parris eulogised the newspaper and gave an enthusiastic appreciation of what he considered the virtues and positive achievements of Rupert Murdoch. In December 2017 Parris appeared, in a cameo role, in the Anniversary edition of BBC's The League of Gentlemen. Writing and journalism Parris is a prolific writer and has written many books on politics and travel. In 1991, a compilation of his pieces in The Times appeared, entitled So Far, So Good. Since then there have been further compilations. Scorn, a book he has edited of quotations about curses, jibes and general invective, was published in October 1994. He has achieved continuing success as a parliamentary reporter and columnist through his knowledge and understanding of politicians and ability to write well about them. He worked as parliamentary sketch writer for The Times newspaper from 1988 to 2001 and has had weekly columns in The Times and The Spectator magazine. In 2004, Parris became Writer of the Year in Granada Television's What the Papers Say Awards. In part, this was for reporting on elections in Iraq and Afghanistan. His previous accolades include Columnist of the Year in the 1991 and 1993 British Press Awards, and in the What the Papers Say Awards 1992. In 1990 he received the London Press Club's Edgar Wallace Outstanding Reporter of the Year Award. In 2005, Parris published A Castle in Spain about his family's project to refurbish a derelict sixteenth-century mansion, L'Avenc, in Catalonia, close to the foothills of the Pyrenees, and make his home there. In 2011, Total Politics said that Parris's column \\"is considered essential reading by many in Westminster. He has a penchant for holding opinions that go against the grain. Parris has written scathingly about the localism agenda, and was a long-time defender of the yah-boo politics of PMQs, although he recently changed his mind.\\" Parris's writing has often attracted wider comment. For example, in a 2007 article in The Times he wrote a satirical article which stated, \\"A festive custom we could do worse than foster would be stringing piano wire across country lanes to decapitate cyclists.\\",What‚Äôs smug and deserves to be decapitated?

It was meant humorously but so many cyclists have taken it seriously that I plainly misjudged. I am sorry.\\" In the same year Alastair Campbell called Parris \\"a little shit\\" in his diaries, to which Parris responded \\"I'd rather be a little shit than a big cunt\\". Parris criticised the initial 2015 leadership election for the Labour Party, referring to recent rule changes that allowed any individual who donated ¬£3 to the Labour Party to vote in the leadership elections. Following a second leadership election, which incumbent leader Jeremy Corbyn won with an increased majority, Channel 4 presenter Krishnan Guru-Murthy said that Parris and Michael Dobbs commented that Corbyn's reelection \\"will break the Labour Party\\". In October 2017, the commentator Iain Dale placed Parris at Number 84 in his list of 'The Top 100 Most Influential People on the Right', describing him as \\"the pre-eminent columnist of his generation\\". In June 2020 Parris wrote an excoriating article on Boris Johnson saying, \\"He never had any judgment or strategic vision. Mr Johnson was only ever a shallow opportunist with a minor talent to amuse\\".The Times \\"Comment\\" 6 June 2010: \\"Johnson has been tested and found wanting\\" Travel writing Parris has made several expeditions abroad. They include Mount Kilimanjaro in 1967 and in 1989; Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo) in 1973; the Sahara in 1978; Peru; Bolivia. In 1990 he published Inca-Kola about his travels in Peru. He spent the Antarctic winter of 2000 on the French possession of Grande Terre, part of the Kerguelen Archipelago in the Indian Ocean, with a few dozen over- winterers, mostly researchers. One of them was fatally shot in an accident during his stay, about which he wrote for The Times.Matthew Parris's account of stay on Kerguelen in 2000, The Times Personal life Parris claims he attempted to out himself in a late-night debate in the House of Commons in 1984, but nobody noticed. He announced that he was gay in one of his weekly newspaper columns and admitted that he cruised Clapham Common for sex. He was once beaten up on Clapham Common while looking for sex. In an interview on Newsnight, during the Ron Davies scandal of 1998, he told Jeremy Paxman that there were two gay members of the then current Labour Cabinet, one being Peter Mandelson. He has stated that there are between 30 and 60 unannounced gay members of the British Parliament. In August 2010, in a list compiled by the Independent on Sunday, Parris was voted the 49th most influential LGBT person in Britain. In August 2006 Parris entered into a civil partnership with his long-term partner, Julian Glover, a speech writer for David Cameron and a former political journalist at The Guardian. At the time of their partnership, they had been together for 11 years. Parris owns homes in Spain, Derbyshire (where he keeps pet alpacas) and the Docklands in East London. He is the honorary patron of Clare Politics, a student-run politics society at Clare College, Cambridge. He was a keen marathon runner, taking part in the London Marathon several times. His personal best was 2:32:57, achieved in 1985 at the age of 35, a record which Total Politics in 2018 said \\"looks unlikely to be smashed any time soon\\"; John Lamont, the fastest of 15 MPs in the marathon that year, finished at 3:38:03. Parris decided that he wanted to go out on top, and arguing that serious running is not good for one's health, he stopped running marathons after that. No British MP, sitting or retired, has bettered Parris' marathon-running time.

Weet-Bix is a high-fibre and low-sugar breakfast cereal manufactured in Australia and New Zealand by the Sanitarium Health Food Company.  History  Weet-Bix in a bowl Weet-Bix was developed by Bennison Osborne in Sydney, Australia in the mid-1920s. Osborne set out to make a product more palatable than Granose, a biscuit that was marketed by the Sanitarium Health Food Company at that time. On 19 August 1926, he lodged an application for registration of the trademark Weet-Bix, a name which he had devised. Production began at 659 Parramatta Road, Leichhardt,\\"The Sanitarium Health & Wellbeing Company\\", 15 May 2013, eud.adventist.org under the management of Osborne and with the financial backing of Arthur Shannon who created the company \\"Grain Products\\" to manufacture the cereal. Osborne's friend Malcolm Ian Macfarlane from New Zealand joined him to take on a marketing role. The product was so successful that in October 1928, Shannon sold the rights in the product to the Australasian Conference Association Limited (Sanitarium Health Food Company, a wholly owned subsidiary and venture of the Seventh-day Adventist Church in Australia). Macfarlane suggested that they ship the product to New Zealand, where it proved so successful that it became difficult to adequately supply the market from Australia. Osborne and MacFarlane went to New Zealand and factories were established in Auckland and Christchurch. However, once again, Shannon sold out to the Australasian Conference Association Limited. Osborne and Macfarlane then exported the product to South Africa and with Shannon's financial backing, went to that country and a factory was built in Cape Town, with Osborne managing sales. This enterprise was also subsequently sold, this time to Bokomo. While in South Africa, Osborne and Macfarlane sought to obtain more satisfactory financial backing to secure Osborne's product. A group was formed, Osborne refined the product and he and Macfarlane went to England to form the British & African Cereal Company, Ltd., which they registered in London in 1932, Company No. 00267687 as a Private Company, with the proprietor shown as Weetabix Limited of Weetabix Mills, Burton Latimer, Kettering. All shares in the Company were specified to be under the control of the Directors, the first of whom were Bennison Osborne, Malcolm Ian Macfarlane, Alfred Richard Upton and Arthur Stanley Scrutton. For the purpose of differentiating the product from that sold in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, the product was named \\"Weetabix\\". Osborne and Macfarlane became the joint managing directors with Osborne controlling production and Macfarlane controlling marketing. Sites for the factory were examined, with Burton Latimer in Northamptonshire eventually being chosen, due in part to the offer of a disused flour mill by a Mr. George, who requested shares in the Company and who was subsequently offered a seat on the existing board of directors. In 1933, Macfarlane left the Company to pursue other business interests, leaving Osborne as the sole managing director. George eventually became chairman of the board. Osborne sold his shareholding to the directors in July 1936, at which time the Company was renamed \\"Weetabix Limited\\". Osborne proceeded at that time to the United States, establishing a Weetabix factory in Clinton, Massachusetts. However, the venture was unsuccessful. Weetabix eventually entered the US market from Canada via Clinton, Massachusetts, the site of the original US factory. Gluten Free Weet-Bix In July 2014 Sanitarium introduced Gluten Free Weet- Bix, produced from sorghum grains.[http://www.sanitarium.com.au/about- us/sanitarium-news/2014/gluten-free-week-bix-welcome-back-to-weet-bix Introducing Gluten Free Weet-Bix, www.sanitarium.com.au, July 2014] Retrieved 17 June 2015 Earlier in 2014, the company had recommissioned their Perth-based Weet-Bix factory into a dedicated gluten free manufacturing facility to produce this new product. Brand popularity Weet-Bix is seen in both Australia and New Zealand as an iconic national foodstuff. An online poll of 16,000 people in 2006 identified it as Australia's favourite trademark.\\"Weet- Bix Top Trademark\\", ABC News, September 26, 2006. The product has been marketed in Australia since 1985 with the catchphrase \\"Aussie Kids are Weet- Bix kids\\". Based on its success in Australia, a similar catchphrase was adopted six months later in New Zealand: \\"Kiwi Kids are Weet-Bix kids\\".

Laubier - Alvinella pompejana gen.sp. nov., Ampharetidae aberrant des sources hydrothermales de la ride Est-Pacifique - Oceanologica Acta, 1980 It was described as a deep-sea polychaete that resides in tubes near hydrothermal vents, along the seafloor. In 1997, marine biologist Craig Cary and colleagues found the same worms in a new section of Pacific Ocean, near Costa Rica, also attached to hydrothermal vents. The new discovery and subsequent work led to important progress in the scientific knowledge of these special worms.NSF-OLPA - Scientists Succeed at First-Ever Attempt to Sequence DNA at Sea (2001) They can reach up to in length and are pale gray, with red tentacle-like gills on their heads. Perhaps most fascinating, their tail ends are often resting in temperatures as high as , while their feather-like heads stick out of the tubes into water that is a much cooler, . Scientists are attempting to understand how Pompeii worms can withstand such extreme temperatures by studying the bacteria that form a \\"fleece-like\\" covering on their backs. Living in a symbiotic relationship, the worms secrete mucus from tiny glands on their backs to feed the bacteria, and in return, they are protected by some degree of insulation. The bacteria have also been discovered to be chemolithotrophic, contributing to the ecology of the vent community. Recent research suggests the bacteria might play an important role in the feeding of the worms. Attaching themselves to black smokers, the worms have been found to thrive at sustained temperatures of from and even for a short time, making the Pompeii worm the most heat-tolerant complex animal known to science after the tardigrades (or water bears), which are able to survive temperatures over 150 ¬∞C. Biology Reaching a length of up to , Pompeii worms have \\"hairy\\" backs; these \\"hairs\\" are actually colonies of bacteria such as Nautilia profundicola, which are thought to afford the worm some degree of insulation. Glands on the worm's back secrete a mucus on which the bacteria feed, a form of symbiosis. The Pompeii worms form large, aggregate colonies enclosed in delicate, paper-thin tubes. The Pompeii worm has a feather-shaped head. The plume of tentacle-like structures on it are gills, coloured red by haemoglobin. Name Pompeii worms get their name from the Roman city of Pompeii that was destroyed during an eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79. Its family name Alvinellidae and genus name Alvinella both derive from DSV Alvin, the three-person submersible vehicle used during the discovery of hydrothermal vents and their fauna during the late 1970s. The family Alvinellidae contains eight other species, but none matches the Pompeii worm's heat tolerance. Symbiotic bacteria While it is not yet known precisely how the Pompeii worm survives these severe vent conditions, scientists suspect the answer lies in the fleece-like bacteria on the worm's back; this layer may be up to 1 cm thick. The bacteria may possess special proteins, \\"eurythermal enzymes\\", providing the bacteria--and by extension the worms--protection from a wide range of temperatures. The bacteria may also provide thermal insulation. Studies are hampered by the difficulties of sampling; to date, Pompeii worms have not survived decompression. Study of the Pompeii worm's seemingly life-sustaining bacteria could lead to significant advances in the biochemical, pharmaceutical, textile, paper, and detergent industries. Behavior Pompeii worms simultaneously keep their heads (including the gills) in much cooler water while their tails are exposed to hot water. Since their internal temperature has yet to be measured, a Pompeii worm may survive exposure to hot water by dissipating heat through its head to keep its internal temperature within the realm previously known to be compatible with animal survival. Thought to subsist on vent microbes, the Pompeii worm pokes its head out of its tube home to feed and breathe. Its posterior end is exposed to extreme temperatures; the anterior end stays at a much more comfortable .

The active ingredient in most decongestants is either pseudoephedrine or phenylephrine (the latter of which has disputed effectiveness). Intranasal corticosteroids can also be used as decongestants and antihistamines can be used to alleviate runny nose, nasal itch, and sneezing. Topical decongestants on topical application as dilute solution (0.05‚Äì0.1%) produce local vasoconstriction. Regular use of decongestants for long periods should be avoided because mucosal ciliary function is impaired: atrophic rhinitis and anosmia (loss of the sense of smell) can occur due to persistent vasoconstriction. Decongestants can be absorbed from the nose via an inhaler and produce systemic effects, mainly central nervous system stimulation and rise in blood pressure. These drugs should be used cautiously in hypertensives and in those receiving monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), as they can cause hypertensive crisis. Expectorants such as guaifenesin are a related type of drug which help to clear mucus. Medical uses Decongestants are used to treat nasal congestion, for instance in allergies, infections like the common cold, influenza, and sinus infection, and nasal polyps. A 2016 Cochrane review found insufficient evidence to support the use of intranasal corticosteroids in the relief of common cold symptoms; however, the review was based on three trials and the quality of the evidence was regarded as very low. Pharmacology The vast majority of decongestants act via enhancing norepinephrine (noradrenaline) and epinephrine (adrenaline) or adrenergic activity by stimulating the Œ±1-adrenergic receptor since they mediate vasoconstriction and constricting nasal vasculature causes decongestion of nasal mucosa. This induces vasoconstriction of the blood vessels in the nose, throat, and paranasal sinuses, which results in reduced inflammation (swelling) and mucus formation in these areas. Decongestant nasal sprays and eye drops often contain oxymetazoline and are used for topical decongestion. Pseudoephedrine acts indirectly on the adrenergic receptor system, whereas phenylephrine and oxymetazoline are direct agonists. The effects are not limited to the nose, and these medicines may cause hypertension (high blood pressure) through vasoconstriction; it is for this reason that people with hypertension are advised to avoid them. Most decongestants, however, are not pronounced stimulants, due to lack of response from the other adrenoreceptors. Besides hypertension, common side-effects include sleeplessness, anxiety, dizziness, excitability, and nervousness. Topical nasal or ophthalmic decongestants quickly develop tachyphylaxis (a rapid decrease in the response to a drug after repeated doses over a short period of time). Long-term use is not recommended since these agents lose effectiveness after a few days.

He was the first person in Britain to have been both a member of the Cabinet and the editor of a major daily newspaper, The Daily Telegraph. Early life and career Deedes was the second child and only son of landowner Herbert William Deedes and his wife Melesina Gladys, daughter of Philip Francis Chenevix Trench. His younger sister Margaret Melesina married the 21st Baron FitzWalter. He was brought up in the family home of Saltwood Castle until it was sold in 1925. He was educated at Harrow until after his father suffered heavy financial losses from the Wall Street Crash of 1929. Deedes was forced to leave school a year early and finish his exams with a tutor. Denied a university career, Deedes began his career as a reporter on the Morning Post in 1931, joining the Daily Telegraph when it took over the Post in 1937. Between 1931 and the beginning of the war in 1939, he shared a home in Bethnal Green, with his uncle Wyndham Deedes. Deedes fought with the British Army in the Second World War, being based initially at Shrapnel Barracks in Woolwich as an Officer in the 2nd Battalion, Queen's Westminsters, one of the Territorial units of the King's Royal Rifle Corps. He gained the Military Cross near Hengelo, The Netherlands in April 1945. He was also the only officer to serve in 12th King's Royal Rifle Corps (2nd Queen's Westminsters) for the duration of the war. His battalion served as the motorised battalion of 8th Armoured Brigade in the North-west Europe campaign. Marriage and children He was married to Evelyn Hilary Branfoot, who died in May 2004, by whom he had two sons (one of whom died young) and three daughters, Juliet, Jill and Lucy. A convinced Christian like his father, he lived very unpretentiously on the edge of Romney Marsh, Kent, where his wife, Hilary, kept a menagerie of farm animals. He was never particularly well-off, preferring to use public transport whenever possible. His son, Jeremy Deedes, is a director of the Telegraph Group of companies and was (2008-2012) a director of lobbyists Pelham Bell Pottinger. He has been a Director of the Tote, Chairman of The Sportsman newspaper, and is currently a director of Warwick Racecourse.http://www.pelhambellpottinger.co.uk/profiles/profile?profile_id=3&role;_id=2 Lucy Deedes is a former Master of Foxhounds and was the first wife of Crispin Money-Coutts, the 9th Baron Latymer. She is the mother of society magician Drummond Money-Coutts and the journalist Sophia Money-Coutts. Politics Deedes came from a family with a tradition of public service. He was very proud of the fact that there had been a Deedes member of parliament in every century since 1600. Deedes was elected as the Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) for Ashford in 1950. First serving as a junior minister under Winston Churchill for three years, he later entered Harold Macmillan's Cabinet in 1962 as Minister without Portfolio. He left the Cabinet in 1964, as Minister of Information, and subsequently stood down as an MP at the October 1974 election. Journalism and later life He was editor of The Daily Telegraph from 1974 to 1986 and, after he was replaced by Max Hastings, continued his career as a journalist. His tenure was noted for battles with the print unions. Deedes was created a life peer on 23 September 1986, becoming Baron Deedes, of Aldington in the County of Kent, but he always preferred to be addressed as \\"Bill\\", rather than \\"Lord Deedes\\". After the 1999 Australian republic referendum, Deedes wrote in The Daily Telegraph: \\"I have rarely attended elections in any country, certainly not a democratic one, in which the newspapers have displayed more shameless bias. One and all, they determined that Australians should have a republic and they used every device towards that end.\\"Deedes, Bill; The Daily Telegraph; 8 November 1999 He continued to comment on social and political issues through his newspaper columns until his death. In his later years, he gained a cult fanbase after two memorable appearances on Have I Got News for You and was, at the age of 88, the oldest guest ever to have appeared on the programme until 2012, when Baroness Trumpington appeared at the age of 90. He was also a stalwart member of the Carlton Club and was appointed as an ambassador for UNICEF in 1998, running high-profile campaigns against landmines. In 2006, he wrote in an opinion piece for the Daily Telegraph that Islam \\"is the only faith on Earth that persuades its followers to seek political power and impose a law ‚Äî sharia ‚Äî which shapes everyone's style of life\\" and added that Islam \\"forbids\\" Muslims from conforming with British society.Muslims can never conform to our ways - Daily Telegraph. 20 October 2006 He continued to write into his 94th year, with his final article, published on 3 August 2007, about Darfur.Darfur is as bad as Nazi Germany - and I know - Daily Telegraph. 3 August 2007 He died on 17 August 2007 at his home in Kent, at 94, after a short illness. The residential street Bill Deedes Way, in the village of Aldington, near Ashford, is named after him. Popular culture=Scoop According to many sources, Deedes was the journalist used by Evelyn Waugh as the model and inspiration for the hapless William Boot, protagonist of the satirical novel Scoop. Deedes himself said he \\"spent part of my life brushing aside the charge,\\" but admitted \\"that my inexperience and naivety as a reporter in Africa might have contributed a few bricks to the building of Boot.\\"W.F. Deedes, At War With Waugh (London: Macmillan, 2003), p.102-103 The two had reported together in 1936, trying to cover the Second Italo-Abyssinian War; Deedes arrived in Addis Ababa aged 22 with almost 600 pounds of luggage.W.F. Deedes, At War With Waugh (London: Macmillan, 2003), p.3 Berhanu Kebele, Ethiopian ambassador to London, pointed out that Deedes's sharp journalistic instincts ensured Italian excesses were kept in the public eye.Letter to the Daily Telegraph on 27 August 2007(Issue no 47,347) Barring the question of age, a more appropriate model for Boot is William Beach Thomas who, according to Peter Stothard, \\"was a quietly successful countryside columnist and literary gent who became a calamitous Daily Mail war correspondent\\" in World War I.The Times Hay, we got it wrong 29 May 2007 Dear Bill Deedes was close to Margaret Thatcher and her husband Denis. The spoof letters \\"from\\" Mr. Thatcher which appeared in satirical magazine Private Eye throughout the Thatcher years were always addressed to Dear Bill ‚Äì the \\"Bill\\" in question was usually assumed to be Deedes; however some instalments (e.g. 16 May and 28 November 1986) would suggest otherwise. The two men regularly played golf together, with Deedes claiming it was a public service to take the spouse of the Prime Minister away from the stress of being married to the country's head of government. The Eye also based its long-running editorial comment, \\"Shome mishtake shurely?\\", on Deedes' distinctive slur.

He also wrote extensively on Chicago sociology/symbolic interactionism, sociology of work, social worlds/arenas theory, social psychology and urban imagery. He published over 30 books, chapters in over 30 other books, and over 70 journal articles. Strauss, whose grandparents were German immigrants in the United States, was born in New York City and grew up in Mount Vernon, New York. His physician recommended that Strauss move to Arizona after high school because he suffered from bronchial problems. However, he moved to the University of Virginia in 1935, where he received his B.S. in Biology in 1939. From there he went to the University of Chicago, where he received his M.A. in sociology (1942) and his Ph.D. in the same field (1945). It was also there where he studied symbolic interactionism under Herbert Blumer, but ultimately completed his doctoral dissertation under the supervision of Ernest Burgess.Baszanger‚Äå, Isabelle (1998) \\"The Work Sites of an American Interactionist: Anselm L. Strauss, 1917-1996\\", Symbolic Interaction, 21(4), 353‚Äì377. During the years 1944 to 1947, Strauss was on the faculty of Lawrence College. From there he moved to Indiana University (1946‚Äì1952), where he met and collaborated with Alfred Lindesmith; in 1949, they published their very influential book, Social Psychology. That volume was translated into Swedish, German and Japanese and the eighth edition in English was published in 1999. In 1952, Strauss returned to the University of Chicago as assistant professor. During that time, he worked with Prof. Everett Hughes, and became associated with a group of colleagues who would become known as the \\"Second Chicago School\\"Becker, Howard S. (1999) \\"The Chicago School, So- Called\\", Qualitative Sociology, 22(1), 3-12. (e.g., Howard S. Becker and Erving Goffman). In 1960, he went to the School of Nursing at the University of California, San Francisco where he founded the Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences. He chaired the department until 1987, although even as a professor emeritus he continued his research and teaching activities. During his time as chair, he was a consultant to the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1962 and 1970. While at the University of California, San Francisco, Strauss and Barney Glaser originated grounded theory, which is widely used within qualitative research. Strauss was elected Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1980. In that year he also received the Charles H. Cooley Award from the Society for the Study of Symbolic Interactionism. Between 1955 and 1980, he was an invited visiting professor at the universities of Frankfurt and Konstanz in Germany, Cambridge and Manchester in England, Paris in France, and Adelaide in Australia. Strauss married Frances Cooperstein in 1940 and was survived by her, his nephews Ted and Elliot Zucker and four grand-nephews and nieces, including Jonathan Zucker.

NASA commonly employs the terms \\"L-minus\\" and \\"T-minus\\" during the preparation for and anticipation of a rocket launch, and even \\"E-minus\\" for events that involve spacecraft that are already in space, where the \\"T\\" could stand for \\"Test\\" or \\"Time\\", and the \\"E\\" stands for \\"Encounter\\", as with a comet or some other space object. Other events for which countdowns are commonly used include the detonation of an explosive, the start of a race, the start of the New Year, or any anxiously anticipated event. An early use of a countdown once signaled the start of a Cambridge University rowing race.Everett, William. On the Cam: Lectures on the University of Cambridge in England. Cambridge, Mass.: Sever and Francis, 1865, p. 192. One of the first known associations with rockets was in the 1929 German science fiction movie Frau im Mond (English: Woman in the Moon) written by Thea von Harbou and directed by Fritz Lang in an attempt to increase the drama of the launch sequence of the story's lunar-bound rocket. A gallery of behind-the-scenes shots of movies featuring space travel or aliens. Page 68, photo caption: \\"Directed by Fritz Lang (third from right), the silent film \\"Woman in the Moon\\" (1929) is considered one of the first serious science fiction films and invented the countdown before the launch of a rocket. Many of the basics of space travel were presented to a mass audience for the first time.\\"  Rocketry  A countdown is a carefully devised set of procedures ending with the ignition of a rocket's engine. Depending on the type of vehicle used, countdowns can start from 72 to 96 hours before launch time. During countdown: * Aerospace personnel bring the rocket vehicle to the launch site and load it with payload and propellants; * Launch-center computers communicate with sensors in the rocket, which monitor important systems on the launch vehicle and payload; * Launch personnel monitor the weather and wait for the launch window; * Security personnel prevent unauthorized persons from entering the \\"keep-out\\" area.Angelo, Joseph A. Space Technology. 2003, Greenwood Publishing Group; , , p. 143 The procedures for each launch are written carefully. For the Space Shuttle, a five-volume set, Shuttle Countdown (KSC S0007), often referred to as \\"S0007\\", was used. Rosie Carver, a technical writer for United Launch Alliance, has created at least 15,000 procedures for more than 300 missions since the Solar Maximum Mission, which launched Feb. 14, 1980. These documents are living documents, which reflect new issues and solutions as they develop. Each mission requires approximately 100 procedure books.NASA, \\"Launching by the Book\\", April 30, 2007. NASA Proceeding with the countdown depends on several factors, such as the proper launch window, weather that permits a safe launch, and the rocket and payload working properly. Countdown clock at NASA's Kennedy Space Center at L-11 hours (28 April 2011) of STS-134, . The launch weather guidelines involving the Space Shuttle and expendable rockets are similar in many areas, but a distinction is made for the individual characteristics of each. The criteria are broadly conservative and assure avoidance of possibly adverse conditions. They are reviewed for each launch. For the Space Shuttle, weather \\"outlooks\\" provided by the U. S. Air Force Range Weather Operations Facility at Cape Canaveral began at Launch minus 5 days in coordination with the NOAA National Weather Service Spaceflight Meteorology Group at the Johnson Space Center in Houston. These include weather trends and their possible effects on launch day. A formal prelaunch weather briefing was held on Launch minus 1 day, which is a specific weather briefing for all areas of Space Shuttle launch operations. The launch window is a precise time during which aerospace personnel launch a rocket so the payload can reach the proper orbital destination.Angelo 2003: 144 A hold is the suspension of the normal countdown process. This can be done to investigate a technical process that has gone wrong, or because of marginal weather at the launch pad. Some holds are planned: they are done so the launch-support computers can run automatic checks on the rocket. Under some circumstances, a countdown may be recycled to an earlier time. When that happens, launch personnel begin following the countdown checklist from the earlier point. During communications for a countdown, the launch team uses acronyms to keep channels open as much as possible.

In the context of a rocket launch, the \\"L minus Time\\" is the physical time before launch, e.g. \\"L minus 3 minutes and 40 seconds\\". \\"T minus Time\\" is a system to mark points at which actions necessary for the launch are planned - this time stops and starts as various hold points are entered, and so doesn't show the actual time to launch. The last ten seconds are usually counted down aloud \\"Ten seconds to liftoff. Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.\\" After a launch, most countdown clocks begin to show Mission Elapsed Time, which is typically shown as \\"T plus.\\" The adjacent picture shows \\"+ 00:00:07\\", approximately seven seconds after liftoff. In Fritz Lang's film Frau im Mond, after each number the phrase \\"seconds to go\\" was repeated.  Film  Newer (1959) SMPTE countdown on the head leader of a film reel At the start of films, a countdown sequence is printed on the head leader, and is used to synchronize film reel changeovers (switching between reels of film). In film (but not television) the 'Academy Leader' countdown first used in 1930 is in units of feet rather than time units; it starts at 11 and ends at 3 where it cuts to black for the last few feet. In 1959, SMPTE leader was created and measures seconds, not feet. It starts at 8 and cuts to black on the first frame of 2, which is accompanied by a 'pop.' This leader eventually displaced the older Academy and was the only leader used by the end of the optical (film) projection era. New Year's Eve In many New Year's Eve celebrations, there is a countdown during the last seconds of the old year until the beginning of the new year. In Times Square on New Year's Eve, besides the 60-Second Countdown at 11:59 P.M., there are six 20-second hourly countdowns in which people can practice their countdown skills from 5:59 P.M. to 10:59 P.M. The aforementioned countdowns are also the countdowns to the end of each hour.

The Lotka‚ÄìVolterra equations, also known as the predator‚Äìprey equations, are a pair of first-order nonlinear differential equations, frequently used to describe the dynamics of biological systems in which two species interact, one as a predator and the other as prey. The populations change through time according to the pair of equations: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\frac{dx}{dt} &= \\\\alpha x - \\\\beta x y, \\\\ \\\\frac{dy}{dt} &= \\\\delta x y - \\\\gamma y, \\\\end{align} where : is the number of prey (for example, rabbits); : is the number of some predator (for example, foxes); :\\\\tfrac{dy}{dt} and \\\\tfrac{dx}{dt} represent the instantaneous growth rates of the two populations; : represents time; : are positive real parameters describing the interaction of the two species. The Lotka‚ÄìVolterra system of equations is an example of a Kolmogorov model, which is a more general framework that can model the dynamics of ecological systems with predator‚Äìprey interactions, competition, disease, and mutualism. History The Lotka‚ÄìVolterra predator‚Äìprey model was initially proposed by Alfred J. Lotka in the theory of autocatalytic chemical reactions in 1910. This was effectively the logistic equation, originally derived by Pierre Fran√ßois Verhulst. In 1920 Lotka extended the model, via Andrey Kolmogorov, to \\"organic systems\\" using a plant species and a herbivorous animal species as an example and in 1925 he used the equations to analyse predator‚Äìprey interactions in his book on biomathematics. The same set of equations was published in 1926 by Vito Volterra, a mathematician and physicist, who had become interested in mathematical biology. Volterra's enquiry was inspired through his interactions with the marine biologist Umberto D'Ancona, who was courting his daughter at the time and later was to become his son-in-law. D'Ancona studied the fish catches in the Adriatic Sea and had noticed that the percentage of predatory fish caught had increased during the years of World War I (1914‚Äì18). This puzzled him, as the fishing effort had been very much reduced during the war years. Volterra developed his model independently from Lotka and used it to explain d'Ancona's observation. The model was later extended to include density-dependent prey growth and a functional response of the form developed by C. S. Holling; a model that has become known as the Rosenzweig‚ÄìMacArthur model. Both the Lotka‚ÄìVolterra and Rosenzweig‚ÄìMacArthur models have been used to explain the dynamics of natural populations of predators and prey, such as the lynx and snowshoe hare data of the Hudson's Bay Company and the moose and wolf populations in Isle Royale National Park. In the late 1980s, an alternative to the Lotka‚ÄìVolterra predator‚Äìprey model (and its common-prey-dependent generalizations) emerged, the ratio dependent or Arditi‚ÄìGinzburg model. The validity of prey- or ratio-dependent models has been much debated. The Lotka‚ÄìVolterra equations have a long history of use in economic theory; their initial application is commonly credited to Richard Goodwin in 1965 or 1967. Physical meaning of the equations The Lotka‚ÄìVolterra model makes a number of assumptions, not necessarily realizable in nature, about the environment and evolution of the predator and prey populations: #The prey population finds ample food at all times. #The food supply of the predator population depends entirely on the size of the prey population. #The rate of change of population is proportional to its size. #During the process, the environment does not change in favour of one species, and genetic adaptation is inconsequential. #Predators have limitless appetite. In this case the solution of the differential equations is deterministic and continuous. This, in turn, implies that the generations of both the predator and prey are continually overlapping. Prey When multiplied out, the prey equation becomes :\\\\frac{dx}{dt} = \\\\alpha x - \\\\beta x y. The prey are assumed to have an unlimited food supply and to reproduce exponentially, unless subject to predation; this exponential growth is represented in the equation above by the term Œ±x. The rate of predation upon the prey is assumed to be proportional to the rate at which the predators and the prey meet, this is represented above by Œ≤xy. If either or is zero, then there can be no predation. With these two terms the equation above can be interpreted as follows: the rate of change of the prey's population is given by its own growth rate minus the rate at which it is preyed upon. Predators The predator equation becomes :\\\\frac{dy}{dt} = \\\\delta xy - \\\\gamma y. In this equation, represents the growth of the predator population. (Note the similarity to the predation rate; however, a different constant is used, as the rate at which the predator population grows is not necessarily equal to the rate at which it consumes the prey). The term represents the loss rate of the predators due to either natural death or emigration, it leads to an exponential decay in the absence of prey. Hence the equation expresses that the rate of change of the predator's population depends upon the rate at which it consumes prey, minus its intrinsic death rate. Solutions to the equations The equations have periodic solutions and do not have a simple expression in terms of the usual trigonometric functions, although they are quite tractable. If none of the non-negative parameters vanishes, three can be absorbed into the normalization of variables to leave only one parameter: since the first equation is homogeneous in , and the second one in , the parameters Œ≤/Œ± and Œ¥/Œ≥ are absorbable in the normalizations of and respectively, and into the normalization of , so that only remains arbitrary. It is the only parameter affecting the nature of the solutions. A linearization of the equations yields a solution similar to simple harmonic motion with the population of predators trailing that of prey by 90¬∞ in the cycle. center A simple example Population dynamics for baboons and cheetahs problem mentioned aside. Phase-space plot for the predator prey problem for various initial conditions of the predator population. Suppose there are two species of animals, a baboon (prey) and a cheetah (predator). If the initial conditions are 10 baboons and 10 cheetahs, one can plot the progression of the two species over time; given the parameters that the growth and death rates of baboon are 1.1 and 0.4 while that of cheetahs are 0.1 and 0.4 respectively. The choice of time interval is arbitrary. One may also plot solutions parametrically as orbits in phase space, without representing time, but with one axis representing the number of prey and the other axis representing the number of predators for all times. This corresponds to eliminating time from the two differential equations above to produce a single differential equation :\\\\frac{dy}{dx} = - \\\\frac{y}{x} \\\\frac{\\\\delta x - \\\\gamma}{\\\\beta y -\\\\alpha} relating the variables x and y. The solutions of this equation are closed curves. It is amenable to separation of variables: integrating :\\\\frac{\\\\beta y - \\\\alpha}{y} \\\\,dy + \\\\frac{\\\\delta x - \\\\gamma}{x} \\\\,dx = 0 yields the implicit relationship : V = \\\\delta x - \\\\gamma \\\\ln(x) + \\\\beta y - \\\\alpha \\\\ln(y), where V is a constant quantity depending on the initial conditions and conserved on each curve. An aside: These graphs illustrate a serious potential problem with this as a biological model: For this specific choice of parameters, in each cycle, the baboon population is reduced to extremely low numbers, yet recovers (while the cheetah population remains sizeable at the lowest baboon density). In real-life situations, however, chance fluctuations of the discrete numbers of individuals, as well as the family structure and life-cycle of baboons, might cause the baboons to actually go extinct, and, by consequence, the cheetahs as well. This modelling problem has been called the \\"atto-fox problem\\", an atto-fox being a notional 10‚àí18 of a fox. Phase-space plot of a further example 300x300pxA less extreme example covers: = 2/3, = 4/3, = 1 = . Assume quantify thousands each. Circles represent prey and predator initial conditions from = = 0.9 to 1.8, in steps of 0.1. The fixed point is at (1, 1/2). Dynamics of the system In the model system, the predators thrive when there are plentiful prey but, ultimately, outstrip their food supply and decline. As the predator population is low, the prey population will increase again. These dynamics continue in a cycle of growth and decline. Population equilibrium Population equilibrium occurs in the model when neither of the population levels is changing, i.e. when both of the derivatives are equal to 0: :x(\\\\alpha - \\\\beta y) = 0, :-y(\\\\gamma - \\\\delta x) = 0. The above system of equations yields two solutions: :{y = 0,\\\\ \\\\ x = 0} and :\\\\left{y = \\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{\\\\beta},\\\\ \\\\ x = \\\\frac{\\\\gamma}{\\\\delta} \\\\right}. Hence, there are two equilibria. The first solution effectively represents the extinction of both species. If both populations are at 0, then they will continue to be so indefinitely. The second solution represents a fixed point at which both populations sustain their current, non-zero numbers, and, in the simplified model, do so indefinitely. The levels of population at which this equilibrium is achieved depend on the chosen values of the parameters Œ±, Œ≤, Œ≥, and Œ¥. Stability of the fixed points The stability of the fixed point at the origin can be determined by performing a linearization using partial derivatives. The Jacobian matrix of the predator‚Äìprey model is :J(x, y) = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\alpha - \\\\beta y & -\\\\beta x \\\\ \\\\delta y & \\\\delta x - \\\\gamma \\\\end{bmatrix}. and is known as the community matrix. =First fixed point (extinction)= When evaluated at the steady state of (0, 0), the Jacobian matrix J becomes :J(0, 0) = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\alpha & 0 \\\\ 0 & -\\\\gamma \\\\end{bmatrix}. The eigenvalues of this matrix are :\\\\lambda_1 = \\\\alpha, \\\\quad \\\\lambda_2 = -\\\\gamma. In the model Œ± and Œ≥ are always greater than zero, and as such the sign of the eigenvalues above will always differ. Hence the fixed point at the origin is a saddle point. The stability of this fixed point is of significance. If it were stable, non-zero populations might be attracted towards it, and as such the dynamics of the system might lead towards the extinction of both species for many cases of initial population levels. However, as the fixed point at the origin is a saddle point, and hence unstable, it follows that the extinction of both species is difficult in the model. (In fact, this could only occur if the prey were artificially completely eradicated, causing the predators to die of starvation. If the predators were eradicated, the prey population would grow without bound in this simple model.) The populations of prey and predator can get infinitesimally close to zero and still recover. =Second fixed point (oscillations)= Evaluating J at the second fixed point leads to :J\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\gamma}{\\\\delta}, \\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{\\\\beta}\\\\right) = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & -\\\\frac{\\\\beta \\\\gamma}{\\\\delta} \\\\ \\\\frac{\\\\alpha \\\\delta}{\\\\beta} & 0 \\\\end{bmatrix}. The eigenvalues of this matrix are :\\\\lambda_1 = i \\\\sqrt{\\\\alpha \\\\gamma}, \\\\quad \\\\lambda_2 = -i \\\\sqrt{\\\\alpha \\\\gamma}. As the eigenvalues are both purely imaginary and conjugate to each others, this fixed point is elliptic, so the solutions are periodic, oscillating on a small ellipse around the fixed point, with a frequency \\\\omega = \\\\sqrt{\\\\lambda_1 \\\\lambda_2} = \\\\sqrt{\\\\alpha \\\\gamma} and period T = 2{\\\\pi}/(\\\\sqrt{\\\\lambda_1 \\\\lambda_2}). As illustrated in the circulating oscillations in the figure above, the level curves are closed orbits surrounding the fixed point: the levels of the predator and prey populations cycle and oscillate without damping around the fixed point with frequency \\\\omega = \\\\sqrt{\\\\alpha \\\\gamma}. The value of the constant of motion V, or, equivalently, K = exp(V), K = y^\\\\alpha e^{-\\\\beta y} x^\\\\gamma e^{-\\\\delta x}, can be found for the closed orbits near the fixed point. Increasing K moves a closed orbit closer to the fixed point. The largest value of the constant K is obtained by solving the optimization problem :y^\\\\alpha e^{-\\\\beta y} x^\\\\gamma e^{-\\\\delta x} = \\\\frac{y^\\\\alpha x^\\\\gamma}{e^{\\\\delta x+\\\\beta y}} \\\\longrightarrow \\\\max\\\\limits_{x,y>0}. The maximal value of K is thus attained at the stationary (fixed) point \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\gamma}{\\\\delta}, \\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{\\\\beta}\\\\right) and amounts to :K^* = \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{\\\\beta e}\\\\right)^\\\\alpha \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\gamma}{\\\\delta e}\\\\right)^\\\\gamma, where e is Euler's number.

The mountain range is located in the eastern United States, and extends 550 miles southwest from southern Pennsylvania through Maryland, West Virginia, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Georgia. This province consists of northern and southern physiographic regions, which divide near the Roanoke River gap. To the west of the Blue Ridge, between it and the bulk of the Appalachians, lies the Great Appalachian Valley, bordered on the west by the Ridge and Valley province of the Appalachian range. The Blue Ridge Mountains are noted for having a bluish color when seen from a distance. Trees put the \\"blue\\" in Blue Ridge, from the isoprene released into the atmosphere, thereby contributing to the characteristic haze on the mountains and their distinctive color. Within the Blue Ridge province are two major national parks ‚Äì the Shenandoah National Park in the northern section, and the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in the southern section ‚Äì and eight national forests including George Washington and Jefferson National Forests, Cherokee National Forest, Pisgah National Forest, Nantahala National Forest and Chattahoochee National Forest. The Blue Ridge also contains the Blue Ridge Parkway, a long scenic highway that connects the two parks and is located along the ridge crest-lines with the Appalachian Trail. Geography Although the term \\"Blue Ridge\\" is sometimes applied exclusively to the eastern edge or front range of the Appalachian Mountains, the geological definition of the Blue Ridge province extends westward to the Ridge and Valley area, encompassing the Great Smoky Mountains, the Great Balsams, the Roans, the Blacks, the Brushy Mountains (a \\"spur\\" of the Blue Ridge) and other mountain ranges. The Blue Ridge Mountains as seen from Blowing Rock, North Carolina. The Blue Ridge extends as far south as Mount Oglethorpe in Georgia and as far north into Pennsylvania as South Mountain. While South Mountain dwindles to mere hills between Gettysburg and Harrisburg, the band of ancient rocks that form the core of the Blue Ridge continues northeast through the New Jersey and Hudson River highlands, eventually reaching The Berkshires of Massachusetts and the Green Mountains of Vermont. The Blue Ridge contains the highest mountains in eastern North America south of Baffin Island. About 125 peaks exceed in elevation. The highest peak in the Blue Ridge (and in the entire Appalachian chain) is Mt. Mitchell in North Carolina at . There are 39 peaks in North Carolina and Tennessee higher than ; by comparison, in the northern portion of the Appalachian chain only New Hampshire's Mt. Washington rises above 6,000 feet. Southern Sixers is a term used by peak baggers for this group of mountains. The Blue Ridge Parkway runs along crests of the Southern Appalachians and links two national parks: Shenandoah and Great Smoky Mountains. In many places along the parkway, there are metamorphic rocks (gneiss) with folded bands of light-and dark-colored minerals, which sometimes look like the folds and swirls in a marble cake. Geology Chimney Rock Mountain Overlook in North Carolina Most of the rocks that form the Blue Ridge Mountains are ancient granitic charnockites, metamorphosed volcanic formations, and sedimentary limestone. Recent studies completed by Richard Tollo, a professor and geologist at George Washington University, provide greater insight into the petrologic and geochronologic history of the Blue Ridge basement suites. Modern studies have found that the basement geology of the Blue Ridge is made of compositionally unique gneisses and granitoids, including orthopyroxene- bearing charnockites. Analysis of zircon minerals in the granite completed by John Aleinikoff at the U.S. Geological Survey has provided more detailed emplacement ages. The northernmost extension of the Blue Ridge Mountains, in northern Maryland Many of the features found in the Blue Ridge and documented by Tollo and others have confirmed that the rocks exhibit many similar features in other North American Grenville-age terranes. The lack of a calc- alkaline affinity and zircon ages less than 1.2 billion years old suggest that the Blue Ridge is distinct from the Adirondacks, Green Mountains, and possibly the New York-New Jersey Highlands. The petrologic and geochronologic data suggest that the Blue Ridge basement is a composite orogenic crust that was emplaced during several episodes from a crustal magma source. Field relationships further illustrate that rocks emplaced prior to 1.078‚Äì1.064 billion years ago preserve deformational features. Those emplaced post-1.064 billion years ago generally have a massive texture and missed the main episode of Mesoproterozoic compression. The Blue Ridge Mountains began forming during the Silurian Period over 400 million years ago. Approximately 320 million years ago, North America and Europe collided, pushing up the Blue Ridge. At the time of their emergence, the Blue Ridge were among the highest mountains in the world and reached heights comparable to the much younger Alps. Today, due to weathering and erosion over hundreds of millions of years, the highest peak in the range, Mount Mitchell in North Carolina, is only 6,684 feet high ‚Äì still the highest peak east of the Mississippi River in the US. History Lynchburg, Virginia The English who settled colonial Virginia in the early 17th century recorded that the native Powhatan name for the Blue Ridge was Quirank. At the foot of the Blue Ridge, various tribes including the Siouan Manahoacs, the Iroquois, and the Shawnee hunted and fished. A German physician-explorer, John Lederer, first reached the crest of the Blue Ridge in 1669 and again the following year; he also recorded the Virginia Siouan name for the Blue Ridge (Ahkonshuck). At the Treaty of Albany negotiated by Lieutenant Governor Alexander Spotswood (1676‚Äì1740), of Virginia with the Iroquois between 1718 and 1722, the Iroquois ceded lands they had conquered south of the Potomac River and east of the Blue Ridge to the Virginia Colony. This treaty made the Blue Ridge the new demarcation point between the areas and tribes subject to the Six Nations, and those tributaries to the Colony. When colonists began to disregard this by crossing the Blue Ridge and settling in the Shenandoah Valley in the 1730s, the Iroquois began to object, finally selling their rights to the Valley, on the west side of the Blue Ridge, at the Treaty of Lancaster in 1744. During the 1863 Gettysburg Campaign of the American Civil War, the Army of Northern Virginia, Robert E. Lee commanding, slipped across the Potomac to begin the second invasion of the North. They moved slowly across the Blue Ridge, using the mountains to screen their movements until being decisively defeated and turned back in Pennsylvania at the Battle of Gettysburg. This was the key battle of the war, irrevocably turning the tide for the Union and removing any hope of foreign support for the Confederacy. Flora and fauna The forest environment provides natural habitat for many plants, trees, and animals. Flora The Blue Ridge Mountains have stunted oak and oak-hickory forest habitats, which comprise most of the Appalachian slope forests. Flora also includes grass, shrubs, hemlock and mixed-oak pine forests. While the Blue Ridge range includes the highest summits in the eastern United States, the climate is nevertheless too warm to support an alpine zone, and thus the range lacks the tree line found at lower elevations in the northern half of the Appalachian range. The highest parts of the Blue Ridge are generally vegetated in dense Southern Appalachian spruce-fir forests. Fauna The area is host to many animals, including: *Many species of amphibians and reptiles *A large diversity of fish species, many of which are endemic *American black bear *Songbirds and other bird species *Bobcat *Coyote *Red fox *Gray fox *Grouse *Whitetail deer *Elk *Wild boar *Wild turkey In music *West Virginia's state song, Take Me Home, Country Roads by John Denver, prominently mentions the Blue Ridge Mountains along with the Shenandoah River (both found in the state's Eastern Panhandle). *Laurel and Hardy, an early 20th century comedy duo, featured the song \\"The Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia\\" in one of their films, \\"Way Out West\\" in 1937.

These arms are visible in Norwich Cathedral and on Bishop Moore's monument in Ely CathedralSee image of Ely monument Cathedrals John Moore (1646‚Äì1714) was Bishop of Norwich (1691‚Äì1707) and Bishop of Ely (1707‚Äì1714) and was a famous bibliophile whose vast collection of books forms the surviving \\"Royal Library\\" within Cambridge University Library. Origins Bishop John Moore was descended from the ancient family of De La Moor (later Moore), of Moore Hayes in the parish of Cullompton in Devonshire, England. He was born in Market Harborough in Leicestershire, the son of Thomas Moore (1621‚Äì1686), an ironmonger of Market Harborough, by his wife Elizabeth Wright, daughter of Edward Wright of Sutton in the parish of Broughton, Leicestershire. The Bishop's paternal grandfather was Rev. John Moore (c.1595‚Äì1657) a clergyman of Puritan views and an author of pamphlets against enclosures, who was a younger son of Sir John Moore of Moor Hayes, knighted at the Palace of Westminster by King Edward VI in 1549, by his wife Katherine Pomeroy, a daughter of Sir Thomas Pomeroy (1503-1566),Vivian, Lt.Col.

Career He was educated at Clare Hall, Cambridge where he subsequently became a Fellow in 1667. He was Rector of Blaby in Leicestershire from 1676 to 1687, and subsequently became Rector of St Ann's, Westminster and St Andrew, Holborn. By 1670 he was a member of the household of Heneage Finch, 1st Earl of Nottingham, whom he served as chaplain. He supported the Glorious Revolution of 1688 and was appointed a Royal Chaplain to the new King William III. Moore was appointed Bishop of Norwich in 1691. He was a Whig in politics, and supported the Low Church party. He gave practical support to leading theologians, such as Richard Bentley, Gilbert Burnet and John Strype, and he found preferment for Samuel Clarke, William Whiston (whose undergraduate study he subsidised) and Samuel Knight. Moore was translated to the See of Ely in 1707. When it was proposed that Bentley should be appointed Bishop of Chichester (1709), the support of Moore was enlisted on his behalf. As Visitor of Trinity College, Cambridge, he presided at the trial of Bentley and during the sessions at his London townhouse of Ely Palace he caught a cold. He died in Ely on 31 July 1714 and was buried in Ely Cathedral. Bibliophile At the time of his death in 1714, Moore's collection of books and papers contained over 30,000 items, and may have been the largest in England. To celebrate his coronation, King George I caused it to be purchased intact, at a cost of 6,000 guineas, and donated it to Cambridge University Library. Moore's library alone contained nearly double the previous material in that library. While some material has been removed over the years, the gift is still largely intact, and is called \\"The Royal Library\\" in honour of its patron. Notable books in his library include the Book of Deer and the Treatise of Love. Marriages Moore married twice: *Firstly to Rose Butler, daughter of Neville Thomas Alexander Butler by his wife Cicely Aglionby; *Secondly (as her third husband) to Dorothy Barnes, daughter of William Barnes of Sadberge, County Durham, and widow of Sir Richard Browne, 3rd Baronet (c. 1656‚Äì1689) (Browne baronets, of London, cr.1660), who was killed in Flanders in 1689 by Colonel Billingsley.See further readingMark Noble & James Granger (1806) A biographical history of England, from the Revolution to the end of George I's Reign (Vol 2)William Courthope (1835), Synopsis of the extinct baronetage of England ReferencesFurther reading *Peter Fox (editor); Cambridge University Library: the Great Collections; 1998, Cambridge University Press, , (Paperback ).

The Army service component command of United States Southern Command, its area of responsibility includes 31 countries and 15 areas of special sovereignty in Central and South America and the Caribbean. It is headquartered at Fort Sam Houston. The Sixth Army saw extensive service in the South Pacific during World War II, including in New Britain, New Guinea, and the Philippines. Postwar it served stateside training army forces until its inactivation during force reduction in 1995. The army was reactivated in 2007. History The Sixth United States Army was activated in January 1943, commanded by Lieutenant General Walter Krueger. Under the code name Alamo Force, it assumed control of the majority of US Army units involved in Operation Cartwheel, the campaign to isolate and neutralize the Japanese base at Rabaul in New Britain. Following the completion of Cartwheel, Sixth Army joined Australian Army and other US forces on the north coast of New Guinea. Similar in conception to the island hopping operations of the central Pacific, the object of the attacks was to land, establish a garrison and airfield which could support the next strike, and then move on. In September 1944, Sixth Army was relieved from operations in New Guinea by the Eighth United States Army. On 20 October 1944, X Corps and XXIV Corps, under Sixth Army, invaded Leyte in the Philippines. By December, Leyte was secured, and the Sixth Army was relieved again by Eighth Army to prepare for the invasion of Luzon. As a prelude to that invasion, the island of Mindoro was invaded by the Western Visayan Task Force comprising the 19th and 503rd Regimental Combat Teams. Sixth Army took part in the Invasion of Lingayen Gulf on 9 January 1945 with the subordinate units of I and XIV Corps. Sixth Army units fought south until they met up those of Eighth Army advancing from around Manila. Sixth Army then continued to clear the north of Luzon until the end of the war. Sixth Army was to have provided the ground forces for the first phase of the invasion of Japan, but the surrender changed that. Occupation duty then followed for a short while until Sixth Army returned to the United States, headquartered at the Presidio of San Francisco. Sixth Army then took responsibility for training of Army forces from part of the continental United States, until it was inactivated as part of force reductions in June 1995. Reactivation In 2007 it was decided that US Army South would be redesignated as US Army South (Sixth Army) under the Army modularization program.

Shayler was prosecuted under the Official Secrets Act 1989 for passing secret documents to The Mail on Sunday in August 1997 that alleged that MI5 was paranoid about socialists, and that it had previously investigated Labour Party ministers Peter Mandelson, Jack Straw and Harriet Harman. Early life Shayler was born in Middlesbrough, England. When he was 10 his family left the northeast. He attended John Hampden Grammar School in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire whose head teacher, according to Shayler himself, once described him as \\"a born rebel who sails close to the wind ... and suffers neither fools nor their arguments gladly\\". Beginning in 1984, Shayler attended the University of Dundee where he was editor of the student newspaper Annasach and was responsible for publishing extracts of the book Spycatcher by another former MI5 officer Peter Wright (banned in Britain at the time).BBC: Troubled history of the Official Secrets Act He graduated with a 2:1 (2nd class honours upper division) degree in English in July 1989. After leaving university he worked as a journalist at The Sunday Times newspaper although his employment was terminated six months later. MI5 career Shayler joined MI5 in October 1991 after responding to an oblique job advertisement in the 12 May edition of The Observer titled \\"Godot isn't coming\\", a reference to the play Waiting for Godot in which Godot never arrives. The advert asked if applicants had an interest in current affairs, had common sense and an ability to write. Believing the job was media related, Shayler applied.Ronson, J,(2011), The Psychopath Test, Picador: London, p.201 He started work in F branch, which dealt with counter-subversion, including the monitoring of left-wing groups and activists, where he worked vetting Labour Party politicians prior to the 1992 election, later being transferred to T branch, which handled Irish terrorism, in August 1992. Shayler moved again, to G9 branch, responsible for Middle Eastern terrorism, where he reportedly headed the Libyan desk as G9A/5. It was during his tenure at the Libyan desk that he claims that he learned of the MI6 plot to assassinate Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi from his MI6 counterpart David Watson (PT16B) and Richard Bartlett (PT16) who had overall control and responsibility for the operation. He left the service in October 1996. After MI5 Shayler stated that MI6 had been involved in a failed assassination attack on Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in February 1996 without the permission of the then foreign secretary Malcolm Rifkind. The plot involved paying the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group with supporters in London and links to Al-Qaeda, ¬£100,000 to carry out the attack. The group was paid to plant a bomb underneath Gaddafi's motorcade. The attack happened in March 1996 in Gaddafi's native Sirte, a coastal city. The bomb was planted under the wrong car and failed to kill Gaddafi but did result in the deaths of several innocent civilians. In November 1999 he sent a dossier of detailed evidence of this including the names of those involved to then home secretary Jack Straw who stated that he was \\"looking into the matter\\" as well as Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee and the police. In 2005, the LIFG was banned as a terrorist group in Britain. Shayler claimed the intelligence services were deliberately planting stories in newspapers and the mainstream media by feeding willing journalists with misinformation, such as a November 1996 article in The Sunday Telegraph by Con Coughlin linking Gaddafi's son with a currency counterfeiting operation, citing the source as a British banking official when in reality the source was MI6. This was later confirmed when Gaddafi's son served the paper with a libel writ which later admitted the true source of the information. According to Shayler the 1994 bombing of the Israeli embassy in London was known to the intelligence services before it happened, and could have been prevented. The British government later placed an injunction on the republication of Shayler's claims although this was later lifted on 2 November 1997 allowing the paper to print his claims of how the bombing of the Israeli Embassy in London in 1994 could have been prevented if the service had acted on prior knowledge it had obtained. On 19 June 1998 he told The Spectator magazine that the security service had information that could have prevented the 1993 Bishopsgate bombing. After revealing information to The Mail on Sunday in August 1997, Shayler fled the day prior to publication, first to Utrecht in the Netherlands and then later to France with his girlfriend and former colleague Annie Machon and was arrested by French police on 1 August 1998 with an extradition warrant on the request of the British government and then held in La Sant√© Prison for four months under the prisoner number 269151F. On 18 November 1998 the French courts determined the British government's extradition request was politically motivated and therefore not grounds for extradition. In 2000, Shayler appeared on Have I Got News for You via satellite, where he was the subject of a number of jokes. Return and trial David Shayler talking at an anti-war meeting at Sheffield University In August 2000, Shayler voluntarily returned to the UK on condition he was not remanded in custody pending his trial. He was arrested and subsequently released on bail. He was charged with three counts of breaching the Official Secrets Act 1989 on 21 September 2000, one charge of passing on information acquired from a telephone tap (a breach of Section Four of the Act), and two others of passing on information and documents obtained by virtue of his membership of the service (a breach of Section One of the Act). The judge at the trial was Alan Moses.Paul Daley \\"Judge gags media in tell-all spy case\\", Sydney Morning Herald, 10 October 2002 At pre-trial hearings he ruled that Shayler had to disclose all information and argument he intended to present to the jury to the judge and prosecution beforehand. At the trial Shayler represented himself, claiming that the Official Secrets Act was incompatible with the Human Rights Act and that it was not a crime to report a crime although these arguments were dismissed by the court with the latter being ruled irrelevant. Shayler's defence attempted to argue that there were no other avenues to pursue his concerns with the service and its performance. The judge ruled that while this was true it was irrelevant. The judge instructed the jury to return a guilty verdict and that the House of Lords had ruled in another case that a defendant could not argue that he had revealed information in the public interest. After more than three hours of deliberation the jury found him guilty. In November 2002 he was sentenced to 6 months in prison, of which he served three weeks in Belmarsh prison and just under five weeks in Ford Open Prison, with the four months served on remand in France being taken into consideration. He was finally released on 23 December 2002, although he was electronically tagged and under a 7pm to 7am curfew for a further seven weeks. Lifestyle and beliefs=9/11 Truth movement Following the release of the 9/11 Commission Report, David Shayler joined the 9/11 Truth movement, which maintains as its primary tenet the belief that the official explanation for the September 11, 2001 attacks is partly (or completely) fraudulent. Shayler claims the planes seen crashing into the World Trade Center were switched out planes with detonation pods underneath, as well as saying that the attack on the Pentagon was not the result of a plane impact. In February 2007, Shayler appeared in Ireland with Annie Machon and William Rodriguez. Both Shayler and his former partner, Machon, have repeatedly claimed that the mainstream British media has misreported their statements and judgments passed against them in an attempt to smear their reputations. Claims of divinity Shayler speaks positively about David Icke, an individual who has claimed to be the son of God: \\"David has done some enormously important work. I see him as the John the Baptist to my Christ. I have spoken to him on the phone and suggested we meet.\\" Shayler has also claimed divinity himself. Shayler has said he is committed to destroying what he calls the \\"Zionist empire\\". Transvestism In an article in the London Evening Standard in 2009, Shayler further discussed the Messiah claim and revealed that he was living as a woman in a squat in Abinger Hammer, Surrey. His former girlfriend, Annie Machon, claims Shayler's long battle with the intelligence services led him to suffer a breakdown. Shayler has since told newspapers that his transvestite 'alter ego' is called Delores Kane.

Typically, this uses relatively simple, repetitive activities to process large volumes of similar information. For example: stock updates applied to an inventory, banking transactions applied to account and customer master files, booking and ticketing transactions to an airline's reservation system, billing for utility services. The modifier \\"electronic\\" or \\"automatic\\" was used with \\"database processing\\" (DP), especially c. 1960, to distinguish human clerical data processing from that done by computer.  History  A punched card from the mid-twentieth century. Herman Hollerith then at the U.S. Census bureau devised a tabulating system that included cards (Hollerith card, later Punched card), a punch for holes in them representing data, a tabulator and a sorter, The system was tested in computing mortality statistics for the city of Baltimore. In the first commercial electronic data processing Hollerith machines were used to compile the data accumulated in the 1890 U.S. Census of population. Hollerith's Tabulating Machine Company merged with two other firms to form the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company, later renamed IBM. The punch-card and tabulation machine business remained the core of electronic data processing until the advent of electronic computing in the 1950s (which then still rested on punch cards for storing information). 1967 letter by the Midland Bank to a customer, on the introduction of electronic data processing Electronic data processing in the Volkswagen factory Wolfsburg, 1973 The first commercial business computer was developed in the United Kingdom in 1951, by the J. Lyons and Co. catering organization.World‚Äôs First Business Computer, LEO, Turns 60 , TechWeek Europe This was known as the 'Lyons Electronic Office' ‚Äì or LEO for short. It was developed further and used widely during the 1960s and early 1970s. (Lyons formed a separate company to develop the LEO computers and this subsequently merged to form English Electric Leo Marconi and then International Computers Limited.) By the end of the 1950s punched card manufacturers, Hollerith, Powers-Samas, IBM and others, were also marketing an array of computers.Goldsmith J A. Choosing your Computer. The Accountant 14 June 1958. Early commercial systems were installed exclusively by large organizations. These could afford to invest the time and capital necessary to purchase hardware, hire specialist staff to develop bespoke software and work through the consequent (and often unexpected) organizational and cultural changes. At first, individual organizations developed their own software, including data management utilities, themselves. Different products might also have 'one-off' bespoke software. This fragmented approach led to duplicated effort and the production of management information needed manual effort. High hardware costs and relatively slow processing speeds forced developers to use resources 'efficiently'. Data storage formats were heavily compacted, for example. A common example is the removal of the century from dates, which eventually led to the 'millennium bug'. Data input required intermediate processing via punched paper tape or punched card and separate input to a repetitive, labor-intensive task, removed from user control and error-prone. Invalid or incorrect data needed correction and resubmission with consequences for data and account reconciliation. Data storage was strictly serial on paper tape, and then later to magnetic tape: the use of data storage within readily accessible memory was not cost- effective until hard disk drives were first invented and began shipping in 1957. Significant developments took place in 1959 with IBM announcing the 1401 computer and in 1962 with ICT (International Computers & Tabulators) making delivery of the ICT 1301. Like all machines during this time the processor together with the peripherals ‚Äì magnetic tape drives, disks drives, drums, printers and card and paper tape input and output required considerable space in specially constructed air conditioned accommodation. Often parts of the punched card installation, in particular sorters, were retained to present the card input to the computer in a pre-sort form that reduced the processing time involved in sorting large amounts of data. Data processing facilities became available to smaller organizations in the form of the computer services bureau. These offered processing of specific applications e.g. payroll and were often a prelude to the purchase of customers' own computers. Organizations used these facilities for testing programs while awaiting the arrival of their own machine. These initial machines were delivered to customers with limited software. The design staff was divided into two groups. Systems analysts produced a systems specification and programmers translated the specification into machine language. Literature on computers and EDP was sparse through articles appearing in accountancy publications and material supplied by the equipment manufacturers. The first issue of The Computer Journal published by The British Computer Society appeared in mid 1958. The UK Accountancy Body now named The Association of Chartered Certified Accountants formed an Electronic Data Processing Committee in July 1958 with the purpose of informing its members of the opportunities created by the computer. The Committee produced its first booklet in 1959, An Introduction to Electronic Computers. Also in 1958 The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales produced a paper Accounting by Electronic Methods. The notes indicated what appears capable and the possible implications of using a computer. Progressive organizations attempted to go beyond the straight systems transfer from punched card equipment and unit accounting machines to the computer, to producing accounts to the trial balance stage and integrated management information systems. New procedures redesigned the way paper flowed, changed organizational structures, called for a rethink of the way information was presented to management and challenged the internal control principles adopted by the designers of accounting systems.Mitchell R. baba Control with a Computer. The Accountant 3 November 1962. But the full realization of these benefits had to await the arrival of the next generation of computers  Today  As with other industrial processes commercial IT has moved in most cases from a custom-order, craft-based industry where the product was tailored to fit the customer; to multi-use components taken off the shelf to find the best-fit in any situation. Mass-production has greatly reduced costs and IT is available to the smallest organization. LEO was hardware tailored for a single client. Today, Intel Pentium and compatible chips are standard and become parts of other components which are combined as needed. One individual change of note was the freeing of computers and removable storage from protected, air-filtered environments. Microsoft and IBM at various times have been influential enough to impose order on IT and the resultant standardizations allowed specialist software to flourish. Software is available off the shelf: apart from products such as Microsoft Office and IBM Lotus, there are also specialist packages for payroll and personnel management, account maintenance and customer management, to name a few. These are highly specialized and intricate components of larger environments, but they rely upon common conventions and interfaces. Data storage has also been standardized. Relational databases are developed by different suppliers to common formats and conventions. Common file formats can be shared by large main-frames and desk-top personal computers, allowing online, real-time input and validation. In parallel, software development has fragmented. There are still specialist technicians, but these increasingly use standardized methodologies where outcomes are predictable and accessible. At the other end of the scale, any office manager can dabble in spreadsheets or databases and obtain acceptable results (but there are risks, because many don't know what Software testing is). Specialized software is software that is written for a specific task rather for a broad application area. These programs provide facilities specifically for the purpose for which they were designed.

A trained operator uses keyboard or stenography methods to transcribe spoken speech into written text. Speech to text software is used when voice writers provide CART. The text is recorded with the exact words that were spoken, relaying a reliable and accurate translation that is broadcast to the recipient on a screen, laptop, or other device. Speech to text software is used when voice writers provide CART. CART professionals have qualifications for added expertise (speed and accuracy) as compared to court reporters and other stenographers. CART is useful for making communication accessible to those who are deaf or hard of hearing as real-time speech-to-text serves many with hearing loss and deafness. Captioning is mandated by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) as an auxiliary aid or service. CART is a viable option to use in conjunction with or instead of a sign language interpreter, however, the decision made about which medium should be used should be based on the needs of the individuals who require the service. In schools with deaf and hard-of-hearing students, CART is used in the classroom: the provider types using stenography, and the students see the words on a screen enabling them to follow along in class and not be left behind. The cost of CART services ranges from $60 to $200 per hour. Because of this, some people look to Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) as a more cost effective service. However, ASR is not as accurate and can be delayed in response, making it less useful in classroom situations, but as technology progresses, ASR is likely to improve. CART can also be useful for people whose first language is different from the language being used, to understand speakers with different voices and accents in many group situations (at work, in education, community events), to have a \\"transcript', and for learning languages. Remote CART is done with the trained operator at a remote location. A voice connection such as a telephone, cellphone, or computer microphone is used to send the voice to the operator, and the real-time text is transmitted back over a modem, Internet, or other data connection. Some people use CART as the short form of computer assisted realtime transcription. The service is identical. In some countries, CART may be referred to as Palantype, Velotype, STTR (speech to text reporting).

The light station property was transferred to the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society (GLSHS), the Michigan Audubon Society (MAS), and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) in 1996. The three entities share governance of the site. The museum is operated by the GLSHS. The museum exhibits artifacts from shipwrecks from the Whitefish Point Underwater Preserve and the bell from the wreck of the SS Edmund Fitzgerald. Admission to the museum includes a tour of historic buildings with displays that interpret the Great Lakes maritime, United States Coast Guard, and US Life-Saving Service history. History=Whitefish Point stakeholders An active navigational light has operated at Whitefish Point since 1848. The United States Coast Guard (USCG) stationed personnel at Whitefish Point until 1971 when the navigational equipment was automated. Whitefish Township was successful in its bid to place the Whitefish Point light, the oldest active light on Lake Superior, on National Register of Historic Places in 1973.Lively (2002), pp. 3, 4. The MAS secured a license from the Coast Guard in 1976 for access to the Whitefish Point Light Station property for the study of migrating birds. In 1978, the Whitefish Point Bird Observatory (WPBO) was formed as an affiliate of the MAS and began monitoring migrating birds at Whitefish Point.Lively (2002), pp. 4, 5. The GLSHS was formed by a group of divers in 1978 as a private, nonprofit organization.GLSHS program areas (2011)Lively (2002), p. 5. Its mission is \\"to promote and augment an understanding and appreciation of maritime history with particular emphasis on the Great Lakes museum facilities.\\"GLSHS tax exempt organization overview (2011). In 1983, the GLSHS obtained a 25-year lease from the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to operate a museum at the Whitefish Point Light Station. The GLSHS began obtaining public funds in 1984 from federal and state agencies.Lively (2002), p. 7. Pre-transfer from Coast Guard In 1990, the GLSHS signed an agreement with Whitefish Township that gave residents and visitors public access to Lake Superior, parking, and the restrooms at Whitefish Point.Lively (2002), pp. 9. In 1992, the state of Michigan filed a lawsuit against the GLSHS for removal of artifacts from shipwrecks on the Great Lakes bottomlands in violation of Michigan's Antiquities Act of 1980.Schumacher (2005), pp. 158-159. The Michigan Department of Natural Resources (DNR) obtained a search warrant in 1992 and raided the GLSHS offices and museum and found evidence that GLSHS had \\"removed about 150 artifacts from wrecks located on state-claimed bottomlands.\\" In 1993, the state reached a settlement agreement with the GLSHS that loaned the artifacts back to them for display in the Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum.MacInnis (1998), p. 101. In 1992, the stakeholders at the former Whitefish Point Light Station developed the Whitefish Point Comprehensive Plan. The stakeholders included Whitefish Township, the MAS, DNR, GLSHS, and USCG. The plan was developed with the purpose of discussion of land transfer of the Whitefish Point Light Station from the USCG and \\"proper land usage in terms of existing and future developments... to ensure that, through proper planning, the unique but somewhat fragile environment of the Coast Guard Site is fully protected.\\"Lively (2002), pp. 10, 78. In 1993, the GLSHS announced their intentions to seek a legislative transfer from the USCG so that they could hold of the of the Whitefish Point Light Station. In 1994, the GLSHS was involved in the removal of trees and the construction of an overflow parking lot. This led to a public meeting that discussed concerns about overdevelopment of the former light station. On March 31, 1995, the GLSHS announced their intention to build \\"a new museum wing dedicated to Fitzgerald memorabilia.\\" On July 4, 1995, the GLSHS participated in the salvage of the bell from the wreck of the SS Edmund Fitzgerald. Experts at Michigan State University spent hundreds of hours conserving the bell and applying a protective coating. GLSHS's decision to have the protective coating stripped off and the bell shined was controversial.Schumacher (2005), pp. 172‚Äì173. The bell became the centerpiece in the Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum as a memorial to the Fitzgerald crewmembers and all lost mariners.Schumacher (2005), p. 167. The GLSHS was involved in controversy again when it announced plans to take the Fitzgerald bell on a touring exhibition. GLSHS dropped its effort after family members of the Fitzgerald crew objected to using the bell as a \\"traveling trophy.\\"Schumacher (2005), p. 172. In 1996, GLSHS published their plans \\"to secure approval for controlled new construction at Whitefish Point... [to] include expansion of the Shipwreck Museum and a new building for the Shipwreck Coast Gift Shop.\\" Transfer from Coast Guard Aerial view of the Whitefish Point Light Station on July 21, 1947. Colored areas are added to 1947 photograph to indicate changes to the site since 1983 - red denotes proposed museum wings.Lively (2002), P. 37. In 1995, the MAS and WPBO took a public stand calling for the transfer of the entire Whitefish Point Light Station to the USFWS. U.S. Rep. Bart Stupak authored transfer legislation for the Whitefish Point Light Station that included \\"a reversionary clause which would stipulate that the property would revert to the Coast Guard if not used appropriately.\\" The USFWS's request to Stupak for the transfer of the light station was made public with assurances that no changes would be made to the GLSHS museum operation. A group called the Friends of Whitefish Point organized over their opposition of overdevelopment and private ownership of the light station property. They presented a petition with 1,600 signatures to Stupak that supported the transfer of the entire light station property to USFWS. In 1995, Stupak announced that he hadn't made a final decision, saying, \\"To tell those people [GLSHS] they can no longer run their museum because Fish and Wildlife wants it would be wrong.\\" Stupak maintained that the transfer legislation would not go \\"before a committee or the house floor with disagreement among the affected parties.\\" After Stupak's earlier support to transfer of all of Whitefish Point Light Station property to GLSHS, he introduced a bill in 1996 that would transfer to the land to the GLSHS, WPBO, and USFWS. The Michigan Department of Natural Resources requested that \\"the legislation be rewritten to remove authorization to expand the gift shop and other facilities.\\" The Michigan State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) objected to Stupak's bill that allowed \\"'unchecked development' in violation of the National Historic Preservation Act.\\" The Coast Guard Authorization Act of 1996 was enacted that gave the Coast Guard the authority to convey the Whitefish Point Lighthouse property to the stakeholders. The Coast Guard transferred a parcel to the GLSHS for the interpretation of maritime history. The GLSHS parcel included all but one of the historic structures at Whitefish Point. The WPBO received for research. The USFWS received to be managed as part of the Seney National Wildlife Refuge. The stakeholders were issued land patents in 1998 and again in 2000 to correct an error in the original patents.Lively (2002), pp. 10-11. The transfer legislation requires that each recipient maintain their parcel in accordance with the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 and other applicable laws. The statute stipulates that development or expansion at the Whitefish Point Light requires written consent by the stakeholders, that full consideration is given to public comment, and it is \\"consistent with preservation of the Property in its predominantly natural, scenic, historic, and forested condition\\" Events leading to Human Use/Natural Resource Management Plan for Whitefish Point On November 1, 1998, the GLSHS announced their plans for the Great Lakes mariners project as \\"a carefully planned expansion for the museum's facilities\\". They planned two new wings for the museum with one wing featuring a theater and 125-seat lecture hall and \\"multi-purpose building... to house restrooms, inventory, larger sales area, and administrative offices.\\" The GLSHS constructed a gift-shop/office building in 1999 that would become known as the multi-purpose building. The size of the building exceeded the largest historic structure on the site by more than .Lively (2002), p. 52. In November 2000, MAS filed a lawsuit against the GLSHS and USFWS. The lawsuit accused the GLSHS of overdeveloping the Whitefish Point Light Station in violation of its federal land patent and the USFWS of not protecting the site.Lively (2002), p. 13. The lawsuit was dismissed in 2001 when the parties arrived at a settlement agreement that appointed a mediator to negotiate the Human Use/Natural Resource Management Plan for Whitefish Point to regulate land use and any development at Whitefish Point. MAS acknowledged the museum's growth was not the sole cause of Whitefish Point's popularity that drew many visitors for sunbathing and ship watching. GLSHS agreed there must be a limit to development at Whitefish Point although it still intended to build museum wings. In August 2002, a petition to recall the Whitefish Township supervisor placed \\"GLSHS at the center of local controversy\\". The Township Board of Trustees resolved the controversy on September 5, 2002 by accepting the supervisor's resignation and \\"disassociating the township from a scheme to convert of wilderness Lake Superior lakeshore into a Shipwreck Museum cruise ship landing.\\" GLSHS filed a lawsuit against the mediator and MAS on September 24, 2002 claiming breach of contract because SHPO was brought into the planning process at Whitefish Point. GLSHS claimed private property rights and therefore, SHPO had no authority to regulate development on the historic parcel they held by federal patent. The legislation that transferred the light station property to the stakeholder required \\"a reasonable opportunity for public comment on... development or expansion, and full consideration has been given to such public comment\\". The stakeholders and the court appointed mediator, Jim Lively of the Michigan Land Use Institute, held public hearings on the new management plan for Whitefish Point on December 3, 2002. Prior to receiving public comment, Lively summarized the plan by explaining that it allowed two new wings for the Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum, would greatly alter the current parking areas by returning part of it to natural habitat, and would restrict people to trails. The public comments at the hearing were \\"fairly evenly matched... with the employees and board members of GLSHS supporting the plan and the residents and property owners of Whitefish Township primarily entering the official record in opposition.\\" Reasons for opposition to plan included \\"increased foot and vehicular traffic, possible habitat loss, septic system monitoring, parking issues, building expansion, new construction, and possible contamination from lead, mercury, and other pollutants.\\"Lively (2002), pp. 66-72. GLSHS lawsuit was dismissed on December 19, 2002 after all three stakeholders signed the mediated Human Use/Natural Resource Plan that secured SHPO's involvement at Whitefish Point.Casselman (2009), p. 7. The new plan replaced the 1992 Comprehensive Plan for Whitefish Point. The GLSHS, MAS, and USFWS comprise the Whitefish Point Joint Committee that governs Whitefish Point through the Management Plan with USFWS having final oversight as stipulated in the transfer legislation. Museum complex Since 1984, the GLSHS was awarded numerous grants used to restore or renovate historic buildings at Whitefish Point Light Station for the interpretation of Great Lakes maritime, USCG, and US Life-Saving Service history.Shipwreck Journal (2009/2010), pp. 6-7. Many of the buildings are open to the public with an admission fee to the museum. The museum complex includes the both modern and historic structures. Modern structures The bell from the SS Edmund Fitzgerald on display at the Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum Museum: the GLSHS opened its first museum exhibits to the public in 1985. In 1986, the society secured funds and constructed the Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum. The museum is the second largest building at Whitefish Point. The museum features artifacts retrieved from local shipwrecks, including the bell from the SS Edmund Fitzgerald.GLSHS museum campus (2010) The museum displays artifacts loaned from the state of Michigan from the following wrecks in the Whitefish Point Underwater Preserve: the Comet, John B. Cowle, Drake, Samuel Mather, Miztec, Myron, Niagara, John M. Osborn, Sagamore, ', and Vienna. Gift Shop Building/Administrative Building: this is the largest building at Whitefish Point, constructed in 1999 by the GLSHS. The main level is used as a GLSHS gift shop, the lower level has public restrooms, and the upper level is used for GLSHS offices. Historic structures Whitefish Point light tower in 2007 before start of restoration Light tower: the first light tower was built with stone in 1848 and its lens used whale oil to produce a light. The stone tower proved inadequate against Lake Superior's storms. In 1861, the stone tower was replaced with the present steel tower by the order of President Lincoln. Over the years the light had several different lens. The Crouse & Hinds aerobeacon lens installed in 1968Lively (2002), p. 20. was replaced in 2011 with a light-emitting diode (LED) lantern with a reduced range of . The GLSHS renewed a historic preservation easement with Michigan's SHPO and was awarded $40,000 Michigan Lighthouse Assistance grants in 2008 and 2010 to strip the paint from the 150-year-old tower, conduct lead paint abatement, and prime and repaint the tower. The GLSHS projects completion of light tower painting project in 2011. In 2010, GLSHS began permitting the public to climb the light tower for a fee of $5.00 per person after the Coast Guard's high voltage navigation equipment was removed.Shipwreck Journal (2010), p. 2. The Whitefish Point light was automated in 1971 but remains an active aid to navigation.Lively (2002), pp. 9-10. Fog signal building: the original fog signal building was destroyed in a storm in 1935. The building was replaced with a brick structure in 1937. It was used to house steam boilers, clock timing apparatus, radio equipment, diesel generators, and equipment to operate 3 large diaphone horns until 1982. The Coast Guard replaced the diaphone horns with an electronic fog horn in 1983 that sounded from the light tower. The Coast Guard stopped fog signals from Whitefish Point in 1995. The GLSHS abandoned their 1996 plans to demolish the fog signal building and started restoration of the exterior of the building in 2002. The GLSHS uses the fog signal building as a ground maintenance facility not open to the public.Lively (2002), p. 21. Lookout tower: it was built at the Whitefish Point Life-saving Station in 1923 for a 24-hour watch during the shipping season. It was abandoned by the Coast Guard in 1955. The GLSHS moved the lookout tower to its present location and restored it in 1998. It is not open to the public. Lightkeeper's quarters: this two-story frame building was originally constructed in 1861 as a dwelling for the lightkeeper and his family. Its interior was later reconstructed as two-family duplex to also house the assistant lightkeeper and his family. It housed Coast Guard personnel until 1970. In 1996, the GLSHS restored the building to its 1920 era condition. It is open to the public with a museum admission fee. Assistant U.S. Coast Guard Chief's Quarters: this two-story dwelling was constructed in 1925 for the light station Chief and family. The GLSHS exhibited shipwreck artifacts in the first story of this building from 1985 until it constructed the museum in 1987. The first floor of the building is now used as 35-seat theater that shows a 20-minute video about the SS Edmund Fitzgerald as part of the museum tour. Crews quarters: the original location of this two-story frame building was threatened by shore erosion. It was sold to private owners and moved from the Whitefish Point Light Station. The GLSHS bought the building in 1990 and moved it back to a new location. GLSHS moved it again in 1999 to comply with the historic zone created by SHPO. GLSHS started renovation of the building in 2002 using $630,280 in TEA-21 federal grant funds. GLSHS announced that it would use the building as overnight rental housing for membership development that would not compete with the lodging establishments in the town of Paradise. The building is not open to the general public.Lively (2002), p. 52, 58. Boat house: the Coast Guard constructed three boat houses at Whitefish Point.Lively (2002), p. 4. It is believed that the only remaining boat house was moved to its present location in the 1950s. GLSHS completed restoration of the boat house in 2001. The building displays a full-size replica Beebe- McClellan surfboat and exhibits on the U.S. Life-Saving Service and U.S. Coast Guard Rescue Station as part of the museum tour for an admission fee. Frame storage building: the Coast Guard constructed this building for firewood storage. GLSHS uses it as a gift shop. Chief's garage: the Coast Guard constructed a 3-car garage in 1940 that has remained in the same location. The WPBO uses the building as the \\"Owls Roost\\" gift shop, a bird banding lab, and a base for educational tours. Other historic structures: an 1861 steel lamp oil house and a 1910 alcohol house have remained on the site since they were constructed. They were used to store fuel sources for the light before it was electrified in 1931. Other features U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service sign at Whitefish Point Whitefish Point is a popular spot for ship watchers, bird watchers and rock collectors. Important features include: *Whitefish Point Unit of Seney National Wildlife Refuge: The USFWS manages the transferred to them from the former Whitefish Point Light Station as part of the Seney National Wildlife Refuge. In conjunction with the WPBO and other conservation groups, the USFWS added acres and more than of Lake Superior shoreline as critical piping plover habitat to Whitefish Point unit on August 30, 2012. The land of the Whitefish Point Unit is \\"Wooded Dune and Swell Complex\\" that is distinctive to the Great Lakes region. It supports a diversity of species, including lady slippers, starflower, bunchberry, Labrador-tea, and a variety of trees. Whitefish Point is on a world migratory flyway. The data collected by the WPBO led to establishing Whitefish Point as a Globally Important Bird Area. In 2001, USFWS designated all of its Whitefish Point property as critical habitat for the piping plover.Casselman (2009), pp. 6-7. In 2009, the piping plover began nesting at Whitefish Point again for the first time in at least two decades. *Whitefish Point Bird Observatory operates as a non-profit, affiliate education and research facility of the Michigan Audubon Society at Whitefish Point. Location The museum complex is situated literally at the end of the road about north of Paradise in Chippewa County in the northeastern Upper Peninsula of Michigan. It is located at the termination of Whitefish Point Road and the entry of Whitefish Bay on Lake Superior.

It is also cultivated widely across the temperate zone for its tuber, which is used as a root vegetable.Purdue University Center for New Crops & Plants Products: Helianthus tuberosus Description Helianthus tuberosus is a herbaceous perennial plant growing to tall with opposite leaves on the upper part of the stem but alternate below.Dickinson, T.; Metsger, D.; Bull, J.; & Dickinson, R. (2004) ROM Field Guide to Wildflowers of Ontario. Toronto:Royal Ontario Museum, p. 170. The leaves have a rough, hairy texture. Larger leaves on the lower stem are broad ovoid-acute and can be up to long. Leaves higher on the stem are smaller and narrower. The flowers are yellow and produced in capitate flowerheads, which are in diameter, with 10‚Äì20 ray florets and 60 or more small disc florets. The tubers are often elongated and uneven, typically long and thick, and vaguely resembling a ginger root in appearance, with a crisp and crunchy texture when raw. They vary in colour from pale brown to white, red, or purple. Food use Before the arrival of Europeans, Native Americans cultivated H. tuberosus as a food source. The tubers persist for years after being planted, so that the species expanded its range from central North America to the eastern and western regions. Early European colonists learned of this, and sent tubers back to Europe, where it became a popular crop and naturalized there. It later gradually fell into obscurity in North America, but attempts to market it commercially have been successful in the late 1900s and early 2000s.Gibbons, Euell. 1962. Stalking the wild asparagus. David McKay, New York The tuber contains about 2% protein, no oil, and little starch. It is rich in the carbohydrate inulin (8 to 13%), which is a polymer of the monosaccharide fructose. Tubers stored for any length of time convert their inulin into its component fructose. Jerusalem artichokes have an underlying sweet taste because of the fructose, which is about one and a half times as sweet as sucrose.Levetin, Estelle and Karen McMahon. Plants and Society: 231. Print. 2012. Wasps feeding on the stems of Jerusalem artichokes It has also been reported as a folk remedy for diabetes : since inulin is not assimilated in the intestine, it doesn't cause a glycemic spike as potatoes would. Temperature variances have been shown to affect the amount of inulin the Jerusalem artichoke can produce. It makes less inulin in a colder region than when it is in a warmer region. Etymology Jerusalem artichoke flowers Despite one of its names, the Jerusalem artichoke has no relationship to Jerusalem, and it is not a type of artichoke, though the two are distantly related as members of the daisy family. The origin of the \\"Jerusalem\\" part of the name is uncertain. Italian settlers in the United States called the plant , the Italian word for sunflower, because of its familial relationship to the garden sunflower (both plants are members of the genus Helianthus). Over time, the name girasole (pronounced closer to in southern Italian dialects) may have been changed to Jerusalem. In other words, English speakers would have corrupted \\"girasole artichoke\\" (meaning, \\"sunflower artichoke\\") to Jerusalem artichoke. Another explanation for the name is that the Puritans, when they came to the New World, named the plant with regard to the \\"New Jerusalem\\" they believed they were creating in the wilderness. Also, various other names have been applied to the plant, such as the French or Canada potato, topinambour, and lambchoke. Sunchoke, a name by which it is still known today, was invented in the 1960s by Frieda Caplan, a produce wholesaler who was trying to revive the plant's appeal. The artichoke part of the Jerusalem artichoke's name comes from the taste of its edible tuber. Samuel de Champlain, the French explorer, sent the first samples of the plant to France, noting its taste was similar to that of an artichoke.Marcelle Bienvenu, \\"Topinambour, or Jerusalem, or ground artichokes are a terrific pick: Cooking Creole\\"  NOLA.com.Stanley J. Kays, Stephen F. Nottingham, Biology and Chemistry of Jerusalem Artichoke: Helianthus tuberosus L., CRC Press, 2007, 496 p. (), p. 7. The name topinambur, in one account, dates from 1615, when a member of the Brazilian coastal tribe called the Tupinamb√° visited the Vatican at the same time that a sample of the tuber from Canada was on display there, presented as a critical food source that helped French Canadian settlers survive the winter. The New World connection resulted in the name topinambur being applied to the tuber, the word now used in French, German, Italian, Romanian, Russian, and Spanish.Handbuch des speziellen Gem√ºsebaus, page? History Jerusalem artichokes were first cultivated by the Native Americans, this extensive cultivation obscures the exact native range of the species. The French explorer Samuel de Champlain discovered that the native people of Nauset Harbor in Massachusetts had cultivated roots that tasted like artichoke. The following year, Champlain returned to the same area to discover that the roots had a flavour similar to chardCooke, Nathalie. Dickenson, Victoria. What's to eat? Entrees in Canadian food history. Montreal: McGill-Queen's U Press, 2010. 21-54. Print. and was responsible for bringing the plant back to France. Some time later, Petrus Hondius, a Dutch botanist, planted a shrivelled Jerusalem artichoke tuber in his garden at Terneuzen and was surprised to see the plant proliferate. Jerusalem artichokes are so well suited for the European climate and soil that the plant multiplies quickly. By the mid-1600s, the Jerusalem artichoke had become a very common vegetable for human consumption in Europe and the Americas, and was also used for livestock feed in Europe and colonial America. The French in particular were especially fond of the vegetable, which reached its peak popularity at the turn of the 19th century. The Jerusalem artichoke was titled 'best soup vegetable' in the 2002 Nice Festival for the Heritage of the French Cuisine. The French explorer and Acadia's first historian, Marc Lescarbot, described Jerusalem artichokes as being \\"as big as turnips or truffles\\", suitable for eating and taste \\"like chards, but more pleasant\\". In 1629, English herbalist and botanist, John Parkinson, wrote that the widely grown Jerusalem artichoke had become very common and cheap in London, so much so \\"that even the most vulgar begin to despise them\\". In contrast, when Jerusalem artichokes first arrived in England, the tubers were \\"dainties for the Queen\\". Lewis and Clark ate the tubers, prepared by an indigenous woman, in modern-day North Dakota. They have also been called the \\"Canadian truffle\\". Cultivation and use Young plants in a garden Sunroot tubers Unlike most tubers, but in common with many other members of the Asteraceae (including the artichoke), the tubers store their carbohydrate as inulin (not to be confused with insulin) rather than as starch. So, Jerusalem artichoke tubers are an important source of inulin used as a dietary fiber in food manufacturing. Crop yields are high, typically 16‚Äì20 tonnes/ha for tubers, and 18‚Äì28 tonnes/ha green weight for foliage. Tubers remaining in the ground lie dormant over winter and can handle temperatures as low as -30 ¬∞ C. Jerusalem artichoke also has potential for production of ethanol fuel, using inulin-adapted strains of yeast for fermentation. The tubers are used for cooking and baking in the same ways as potatoes:, but unlike the potato they can also be eaten rawHave you heard about Jerusalem artichokes? https://hungry-pumpkin.com/post/have-you-heard-about-jerusalem-artichokes/. They have a similar consistency, and in their raw form have a similar texture, but a sweeter, nuttier flavor. When raw and sliced thinly, they are fit for a salad. Their inulin form of carbohydrates give the tubers a tendency to become soft and mushy if boiled, but they retain their texture better when steamed. The inulin cannot be broken down by the human digestive system but it is metabolized by bacteria in the colon. This can cause flatulence and, in some cases, gastric pain. John Gerard's Herbal, printed in 1621, quotes the English botanist John Goodyer on Jerusalem artichokes:Gerard's Herbal, cited in Davidson A. (1999). The Oxford Companion to Food, first edition. Oxford University Press . Jerusalem artichokes have 650 mg potassium per 1 cup (150g) serving. They are also high in iron, and contain 10-12% of the USRDA of fiber, niacin, thiamine, phosphorus, and copper.USDA Agricultural Research Service, http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/Data//SR20/reports/sr20fg11.pdf Jerusalem artichokes can be used as animal feed, but they must be washed before being fed to most animals. Pigs can forage, however, and safely eat them directly from the ground. The stalks and leaves can be harvested and used for silage, though cutting the tops greatly reduces the harvest of the roots. Fermented products In Baden-W√ºrttemberg, Germany, over 90% of the Jerusalem artichoke crop is used to produce a spirit called \\"\\", \\"Topi\\" or \\"Rossler\\".C.A.R.M.E.N. e.V.: Topinambur - Energiepflanze f√ºr Biogasanlagen. In: Newsletter \\"nawaros\\" 11/2007, Straubing. By the end of the 19th century, Jerusalem artichokes were being used in Baden to make a spirit called \\"Jerusalem Artichoke Brandy\\", \\"Jerusalem Artichoke\\", \\"Topi\\", \\"Erd√§pfler\\", \\"Rossler\\", or \\"Borbel\\". Jerusalem artichoke brandy smells fruity and has a slight nutty-sweet flavour. It is characterised by an intense, pleasing, earthy note. The tubers are washed and dried in an oven before being fermented and distilled. It can be further refined to make \\"Red Rossler\\" by adding common tormentil, and other ingredients such as currants, to produce a somewhat bitter and astringent decoction. It is used as digestif and as a remedy for diarrhea or abdominal pain. Marketing scheme In the 1980s, the Jerusalem artichoke also gained some notoriety when its seeds were planted by Midwestern US farmers at the prodding of an agricultural attempt to save the family farm. This effort was an attempt to teach independent farmers to raise their own food, feed, and fuel. Little market existed for the tuber in that part of the US at the time, but contacts were made with sugar producers, oil and gas companies, and the fresh food market for markets to be developed. Fructose had not yet been established as a mainstay, nor was ethanol used as a main fuel additive as it is today. The only real profit in this effort were realized by a few first-year growers (who sold some of their seed to other farmers individually as well as with the help of the company attempting this venture). As a result, many of the farmers who had planted large quantities of the crop lost money.\\"Jerusalem Artichoke \\", Commercial Vegetable Production Guides, Oregon State University The effort to save the family farm, however, was not a part of our nation's goal to control the farm market, so falsifications and inaccurate understandings forced the closure of this effort. In a phone call from then Sec. of Agriculture, John Block, it was stated, \\"We don't want to save the family farm, but need to eliminate a certain percentage of them\\".

They grow to tall, with large bipinnate leaves and large compound umbels of white or greenish-white flowers. Found mainly in China, its main use was for medicine. It shows variations in fruit anatomy, leaf morphology and subterranean structures. The genes are extremely polymorphic. Some species can be found in purple moor and rush pastures. Characteristics Angelica species grow to tall, with large bipinnate leaves and large compound umbels of white or greenish-white flowers. Their large, sparkling, starburst flowers are pollinated by a great variety of insects (the generalist pollination syndrome), the floral scents are species-specific, and even specific to particular subspecies.

The most notable of these is garden angelica (A. archangelica), which is commonly known simply as angelica. Natives of Lapland use the fleshy roots as food and the stalks as medicine. Crystallized strips of young angelica stems and midribs are green in colour and are sold as decorative and flavoursome cake decoration material, but may also be enjoyed on their own. The roots and seeds are sometimes used to flavour gin. Its presence accounts for the distinct flavour of many liqueurs, such as Chartreuse. Among the Sami people of Lapland, the plant is used to make a traditional musical instrument the fadno. Seacoast angelica (A. lucida) has been eaten as a wild version of celery. In parts of Japan, especially the Izu Islands, the shoots and leaves of ashitaba (A. keiskei) are eaten as tempura, particularly in the spring. A. sylvestris and some other species are eaten by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including bordered pug, grey pug, lime-speck pug and the V-pug. A. dawsonii was used by several first nations in North America for ritual purposes. A. atropurpurea is found in North America from Newfoundland west to Wisconsin and south to Maryland, and was smoked by Missouri tribes for colds and respiratory ailments. This species is very similar in appearance to the poisonous water hemlock. The boiled roots of angelica were applied internally and externally to wounds by the Aleut people in Alaska to speed healing. The herb, also known by the Chinese name, bai zhi, and Latin name, radix angelicae dahurica, is used medicinally in traditional Chinese medicine.

A stenomask is useful for speech recognition applications, because it allows voice transcription in noisy environments. Perhaps more importantly, a stenomask silences the user's voice so that it does not interfere with the surrounding environment such as a court or a classroom. The user can verbally identify the speaker, indicate gestures and unspoken answers, and describe activities as they take place.Voice Writing: The Method , National Verbatim Reporters Assoc, retrieved 13 Mar 2007 An operator of a stenomask can be trained to \\"re-voice\\" everything he or she hears into a stenomask connected to a speech recognition system, for a real-time text transcription of everything spoken. This allows a \\"voice writer\\" to produce instant text feeds within a courtroom and distribute them in plain text format immediately after a proceeding. The equipment can also interface with litigation management software. A trained operator using a stenomask connected to a pre-trained speech recognition system can exceed 180 words per minute while at the same time exceeding 95 percent accuracy. They may also modify the pronunciation of the words they are speaking in order to improve accuracy. In comparison to conventional approaches like Gregg shorthand and stenotype technology, the main disadvantage of stenomask technology is the visual appearance of the operator when speaking into the stenomask. As the Dallas Morning News put it, they \\"can channel ... their inner Darth Vader.\\" Microphones that work much like a stenomask are used by aircraft ground crews to communicate with cockpit crews in airport environments with extreme engine noise, and are usually part of their headsets. History The stenomask was developed by Horace Webb and two colleagues in the early 1940s. He was proficient with Gregg shorthand, but sought a more accurate and faster system of transcription, as shorthand notes can become unmanageable with fast talkers or difficult terminology. Furthermore, until speech recognition software became accurate enough for everyday use in the mid-1990s, shorthand reporters would verbally dictate transcription notes into typewritten form, resulting in about two hours dictation for every hour transcribing. Thus, Webb thought he could \\"repeat it with my voice instead of with a pen\\". After much experimentation ‚Äî first with a cigar box and then a tomato juice can ‚Äî he arrived at a solution using a microphone inside a military aviator's rubber oxygen mask, paired with a coffee pot filled with sound-absorbing material. The result was eventually deemed by the United States Navy to be the most accurate method of transcription among \\"all known systems of verbatim reporting\\", and was subsequently adopted for use in their court reporting.The Horace Webb Story , National Verbatim Reporters Assoc, retrieved 13 Mar 2007 ReferencesExternal links * National Verbatim Reporters Association Category:Speech recognition Category:Court reporting Category:Assistive technology Category:Transcription (linguistics) ","title":"Stenomask"},{"id":"462606","text":"Baron Kerry is an ancient title in the Peerage of Ireland. It was created circa 1223 for Thomas Fitzmaurice. In 1325, Maurice FitzMaurice, 4th Baron of Kerry, murdered Diarmaid √ìg MacCarthy (son of Cormac M√≥r MacCarthy) in the courtroom at Tralee. For this act, Maurice was tried and attainted by the parliament in Dublin and his lands forfeited, but after his death they were restored to his brother John FitzMaurice, 5th Baron of Kerry. In 1537 the eleventh Baron was created Baron Odorney and Viscount Kilmaule in the Peerage of Ireland. However, these titles became extinct on his death in 1541 while he was succeeded in the Barony of Kerry by his younger brother. The twenty-first Baron was created Earl of Kerry in the Peerage of Ireland in 1723. His younger son John Petty was created Earl of Shelburne in the Peerage of Ireland in 1753 and his son, the second Earl of Shelburne, was created Marquess of Lansdowne in 1784. In 1818 the latter's son, the third Marquess, succeeded his cousin as 4th Earl of Kerry and 24th Baron Kerry.

He achieved international fame through his television series The Paul Daniels Magic Show, which ran on the BBC from 1979 to 1994. He was known for his catchphrase, \\"You'll like this... not a lot, but you'll like it!\\" and for his marriage to his assistant, Debbie McGee. He was awarded the \\"Magician of the Year\\" Award by the Academy of Magical Arts in 1982, the first magician from outside the United States to receive it. He also won the Golden Rose of Montreux in 1985. He was a Member of the Inner Magic Circle with Gold Star. He has been described as \\"The Godfather of Magic\\" and has been repeatedly credited with inspiring many top professional magicians to start in the profession. Daniels was outspoken on matters including politics, current affairs, magic, entertainment, and fellow celebrities. He also appeared in reality television shows. He was described by Lord Michael Grade, former controller of both the BBC and ITV, when talking of Paul on BBC News in 2016, as 'a genius', 'a brilliant showman' and a 'pillar of Saturday Night for the BBC in their golden era of ratings'.  Early life  Newton Edward Daniels was born on 6 April 1938 in the South Bank area of Middlesbrough, the son of Handel Newton \\"Hughie\\" Daniels and Nancy (n√©e Lloyd). He was of Welsh descent. His father was a cinema projectionist at the Hippodrome Theatre and a worker for ICI in Wilton, North Riding of Yorkshire. After completing his education at Sir William Turners Grammar School on Coatham Road in Coatham, North Riding of Yorkshire and holding his first job as a junior clerk in the treasurer's office of Eston Council, Daniels served as a conscript in the 1st Battalion, Green Howards, during his national service. He was posted to the British garrison in Hong Kong before training as an accountant in local government. Even in his early age, Daniels had thinning hair, which he claimed to be an act of \\"magic\\". He later sported a wig for much of his television career. After working as a junior clerk and then as an auditor in local government, he joined his parents in their grocery business. He later set up his own shop, at one point a mobile shop, but eventually gave this up in favour of his growing career as a magician. In 2012 Daniels explained the origin of his stage name to The Guardian, saying: \\"I borrowed the name Paul from my first son, who was born in 1960. I was born Newton Edward Daniels, everyone called me Ted, but Paul worked better for showbusiness\\".The Guardian  Showbusiness career  Daniels' interest in magic began at the age of 11 when, during a holiday, he read a book called How to Entertain at Parties. He began performing magic as a hobby, occasionally entertaining at parties and youth clubs and later doing shows for fellow servicemen during his national service. After returning to civilian life he continued to develop his magic by performing in clubs in the evenings while working at his grocery business during the day. At one point he worked with his first wife Jackie under the name of \\"The Eldani's\\", an anagram of Daniels. It was while working the clubs that he developed what would become his long-running catchphrase, \\"You'll like this ... not a lot, but you'll like it.\\" He stated that he first came up with the line at a club in Bradford as a way to deal with a heckler. A major turning point in Daniels' career came in 1969 when he was offered a summer season in Newquay in Cornwall. He decided to sell his grocery business and try magic as a full-time career. He made his television debut on the long-running talent show Opportunity Knocks in 1970, and came second. Television producer Johnnie Hamp saw Daniels in that show and later gave him a regular spot on a show comp√®red by Bernard Manning, The Wheeltappers and Shunters Social Club, for Granada Television. In 1978 ITV gave Daniels his own Sunday night show, Paul Daniels' Blackpool Bonanza. His first series for the BBC was For My Next Trick, where Daniels appeared with several other magicians and singer Faith Brown. This led to Daniels presenting his own television series, The Paul Daniels Magic Show, on BBC1 from 1979 until 1994. As well as featuring tricks and illusions for pure entertainment, he also included a regular segment (the \\"Bunco Booth\\") in which he exposed the confidence tricks of street charlatans. He also replicated the kind of results that have impressed researchers of the paranormal and parapsychologists in a segment called Under Laboratory Conditions, thereby demonstrating his scepticism about claims made in these fields. Daniels starred in his own stage show, It's Magic, at the Prince of Wales Theatre from 10 December 1980 until 6 February 1982. At that time, the show was one of the longest-running magic shows ever staged in London. By this point he was already working with his future wife, Debbie McGee, whose role as his assistant would become a major feature of his act. She had first worked with him on his summer season show in Great Yarmouth in 1979. In addition to his magic shows he hosted other television series during the 1980s and 1990s, including three BBC1 quiz shows: Odd One Out, Every Second Counts and Wipeout (all of which were based on short-lived American game shows), and the children's television programme Wizbit (also for the BBC), about a magician called Wizbit and a rabbit called Woolly, who lived in Puzzleopolis. In 1987, Daniels hosted a controversial Halloween live special of his magic show where he replicated a Harry Houdini escape from an iron maiden. The trick was deliberately staged to give the illusion that the escape had gone tragically wrong and Daniels had been killed ‚Äì he was later broadcast as having successfully escaped from the device. He was the subject of This Is Your Life in 1988 when he was surprised by Michael Aspel. Daniels and McGee were the focus of one of the episodes of the 2001 BBC documentary series When Louis Met..., presented by Louis Theroux, with Daniels additionally appearing on Da Ali G Show in an Ali G costume, and was interviewed by Caroline Aherne in her guise as Mrs Merton. In 2004, Daniels and McGee appeared in the Channel 5 reality TV show, The Farm, and in 2006, they appeared in the ITV show The X Factor: Battle of the Stars. They were the first act voted off the show, after singing \\"Let Me Entertain You\\" by Robbie Williams. Daniels and McGee also made a guest appearance in the Wife Swap series in early 2007, with McGee changing places with journalist and presenter Vanessa Feltz. In 2010, he competed in Strictly Come Dancing with his partner Ola Jordan. They were consistently criticised by the judges and were the second couple to leave the competition. In August 2011, while filming a scene for ITV's Sooty, Daniels was struck by a flying pizza, thrown by the puppet Sooty. He got a piece of pizza in his eye and called in to a cottage hospital for them to rinse it out. Later that month, he appeared with his son, Martin, on episode 9 of the first season of Penn & Teller: Fool Us. On 10 October 2012, Daniels and McGee appeared on All Star Mr & Mrs on ITV. In 2008 and 2010, Daniels toured with 'The Best of British Variety Tour', with acts including Cannon and Ball, Christopher Biggins, Frank Carson and The Krankies, where he closed the first half of the show. In 2013, Daniels and Debbie McGee toured their 'First Farewell Tour', followed by a tour 'comically' entitled 'Back Despite Popular Demand Tour' a year later. They toured 'The Intimate Tour' in 2015. They starred in the Pantomime 'Aladdin', at the Ipswich Regent Theatre from December 2015 until January 2016, completing the run a few days before Paul was taken ill.  Awards  Daniels was awarded the \\"Zina Bennett Trophy\\" from the British Ring of the International Brotherhood of Magicians in 1964 while he was known as \\"Ted Daniels\\" Daniels was awarded the \\"Magician of the Year‚Äô\\" Award by the Academy of Magical Arts in 1982, becoming the first magician from outside the US to receive it. An Easter special of The Paul Daniels Magic Show won the Golden Rose of Montreux Award at the International TV Festival in Switzerland in 1985. Daniels was the recipient of The Maskelyne, awarded for services to British Magic by The Magic Circle in 1988.Dawes, EA and Bailey, M: Circle Without End: The Magic Circle 1905‚Äì2005, page 89. Jeremy Mills Publishing, 2005. He was awarded The Devant, for services to International Magic by The Magic Circle in 2007 and was bestowed The Carlton Comedy Award in 2012 by the same organization. Daniels was also awarded the \\"Great Lafayette Award\\" by the Edinburgh International Magic Festival in 2011.  Politics and other views  Daniels was a supporter of the Conservative Party. He was reported to have considered leaving the UK with the election of a Labour Party government at the 1997 general election. Daniels later said that his views had been misrepresented and he would only have considered leaving if they raised income tax. Daniels stated that he had limited sympathy with the homeless because he had come from a \\"very poor\\" background and \\"grafted\\" to achieve his success. In 2011, he tweeted that he did not consider the term \\"Paki\\" to be any more offensive than the word \\"Brit\\" and described those who held the opposite view of being excessively politically correct. Daniels was personally affected by the winter storms of 2013‚Äì2014 and described himself in an interview for Channel 4 News as a climate change sceptic, instead attributing flooding to changes in procedures of The Environment Agency, particularly with regard to dredging. He supported the hereditary system in the House of Lords, expressing pro-aristocratic views. On the subject of criminal justice, he once publicly offered to help murderer Ian Huntley end his own life. Daniels refused to attend magic conferences in the UK since they \\"...were ruined for me by bitchiness and jealousy...now I only go to foreign conventions where, to be honest, I am greeted with respect and civility AND I have tons of 'foreign' magician friends.\\" He was dismissive of modern illusionists, once describing David Blaine as \\"not very original\\". He commented on other television personalities such as Anne Robinson and Chris Morris, claiming that Robinson had hated him ever since his 1987 Halloween special hoax performance, while describing Morris as \\"just nasty.\\" He was dismissive of the younger generation of impressionists, saying: \\"Forget Alistair McGowan. There's been no-one good since Mike Yarwood.\\" Daniels was also critical of journalists, stating \\"I don't really understand why journalism has to be so nasty, so sarcastic and intrusive\\". Following the Jimmy Savile sexual abuse scandal in 2012, Daniels said that while he believed Savile, a fellow BBC broadcaster, was \\"undoubtedly a bad guy\\", he questioned whether some accusers were \\"for real\\". His comments were criticised by the NSPCC and Mark Williams-Thomas, the former child protection officer who had exposed Savile's crimes. Williams-Thomas accused Daniels of \\"belittling\\" the victims of Jimmy Savile in one of his blog posts. The entry was later removed from the blog.  Personal life  Daniels married his first wife, Jacqueline Skipworth (born 1942), in 1960; she was 17 and he was 21. They had three sons together: Gary, Paul, and magician Martin. All three sons occasionally appeared on The Paul Daniels Magic Show in varying capacities. Daniels's father often made props for the show, such as wooden boxes for the Selbit Sawing illusion, whilst his mother sewed the stage curtains for his theatre tours. Daniels married his second wife, long-time assistant Debbie McGee, on 2 April 1988 in Buckinghamshire. The couple met in London in May 1979 during rehearsals for Daniels's summer season show in Great Yarmouth that year. When they married, he was 50 and she was 29. McGee went on to work with Daniels in his 1980 summer show in Bournemouth and then his London stage show It's Magic before being offered the role of assistant in his long-running television series. Their relationship gradually became more established, and he proposed in 1987. Early in their marriage, they lived in a house in Denham that once belonged to Roger Moore. In 1998, they moved to a house on the banks of the River Thames in Wargrave, Berkshire. Daniels's autobiography, Under No Illusion, includes descriptions of his and McGee's joking life: \\"I was writing and needed to concentrate, so I had a 'Do Not Disturb' sign on my back. Eventually I went to bed and Debbie was lying stark naked on the bed ‚Äì eat your heart out fellas! She was wearing the sort of sleeping blindfold you get on long-haul flights. Printed on it was 'Do Not Disturb'. But further down her body she had a sign that said 'Disturb'!\\" Daniels also claimed in the book to have had, as of 2000, sexual relations with more than 300 women. He said that he had a \\"passionate\\" encounter with a schoolgirl hitch-hiker in 1969 when he was aged 30, though he ejected her from the car upon realising her age. Daniels maintained a website that included personal information, a detailed blog, and podcasts. In 2012, Daniels cut off his left index finger and the tip of his ring finger in an accident with a circular saw, in the garden shed of his Wargrave home. He drove himself from his home to hospital in Henley-on-Thames, where the index finger was reattached. Health problems and death On 20 February 2016, Daniels had a fall and was taken to hospital, where he was treated by medical staff for suspected pernicious anemia. However it was later discovered that he had an incurable brain tumour. He died less than a month later, on 17 March, at the age of 77. Tributes included one from fellow magician Dynamo: ‚ÄúPaul was truly a giant of the entertainment world who really defined magic for over 20 years,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAs a working-class magician from the North, he was personally a huge inspiration for me and I know that he has inspired countless magicians around the world and will forever be known as one of the all-time greats.‚Äù  References = Bibliography  * Paul Daniels, Under No Illusion, Blake Publishing (May 2000),  External links  * * Paul Daniels' weblog *  Videoclips   Category:1938 births Category:2016 deaths Category:BBC television presenters Category:Deaths from cancer in England Category:Comedians from Yorkshire Category:Conservative Party (UK) people Category:Deaths from brain tumor Category:English game show hosts Category:English magicians Category:English television presenters Category:People educated at Sir William Turner's Grammar School, Redcar Category:People from South Bank Category:People from Wargrave Category:Television personalities from Yorkshire Category:The X Factor (British TV series) contestants Category:British magicians ","title":"Paul Daniels"},{"id":"462612","text":"Bromothymol blue (also known as bromothymol sulfone phthalein and BTB) is a pH indicator. It is mostly used in applications that require measuring substances that would have a relatively neutral pH (near 7). A common use is for measuring the presence of carbonic acid in a liquid. It is typically sold in solid form as the sodium salt of the acid indicator. Structure and properties The protonated form of bromothymol blue has its peak absorption at 427 nm thus transmitting yellow light in acidic solutions, and the deprotonated form has its peak absorption at 602 nm thus transmitting blue light in more basic solutions. Highly acidic Bromothymol blue is magenta in color. The general carbon skeleton of bromothymol blue is common to many indicators including chlorophenol red, thymol blue, and bromocresol green. The presence of one moderate electron-withdrawing group (bromine atom) and two moderate donating groups (alkyl substituents) are responsible for bromothymol blue's active indication range from a pH of 6.0 to 7.6. While the conjugation is responsible for the length and nature of the color change range, these substituent groups are ultimately responsible for the indicator's active range. Structure at different pH ranges Bromothymol blue is sparingly soluble in oil, but soluble in water, ether, and aqueous solutions of alkalis. It is less soluble in nonpolar solvents such as benzene, toluene, and xylene, and practically insoluble in petroleum ether. Synthesis and preparation Bromothymol blue is synthesized by addition of elemental bromine to thymol blue in a solution in glacial acetic acid. To prepare a solution for use as pH indicator, dissolve 0.10 g in 8.0 cm3 N/50 NaOH and dilute with water to 250 cm3. To prepare a solution for use as indicator in volumetric work, dissolve 0.1 g in 100 cm3 of 50% (v/v) ethanol. Uses Different colors of bromothymol blue at marked pH conditions. Bromothymol blue may be used for observing photosynthetic activities, or as a respiratory indicator (turns yellow as CO2 is added). A common demonstration of BTB's pH indicator properties involves exhaling through a tube into a neutral solution of BTB. As carbon dioxide is absorbed from the breath into the solution, forming carbonic acid, the solution changes color from green to yellow. Thus, BTB is commonly used in science classes to demonstrate that the more that muscles are used, the greater the CO2 output. Bromothymol blue has been used in conjunction with phenol red to monitor the fungal asparaginase enzyme activity with phenol red turning pink and bromothymol blue turning blue indicating an increase in pH and therefore enzyme activity. However, a recent study suggests that methyl red is more useful in determining activity due to the bright yellow ring form in the zone of enzyme activity. A less diverse but wider range of the different colors shown by bromothymol blue. The magenta color on the left-hand side is bromothymol blue with concentrated hydrochloric acid. It may also be used in the laboratory as a biological slide stain. At this point, it is already blue, and a few drops are used on a water slide. The cover slip is placed on top of the water droplet and the specimen in it, with the blue coloring mixed in. It is sometimes used to define cell walls or nuclei under the microscope. Bromothymol is used in obstetrics for detecting premature rupture of membranes. Amniotic fluid typically has a pH > 7.2, bromothymol will therefore turn blue when brought in contact with fluid leaking from the amnion. As vaginal pH normally is acidic, the blue color indicates the presence of amniotic fluid. The test may be false-positive in the presence of other alkaline substances such as blood or semen, or in the presence of bacterial vaginosis.

It was created in 1602 for Edward Bruce, later Master of the Rolls, with remainder to his heirs and assigns whatsoever. In 1604 he was also made Lord Bruce of Kinloss, with remainder to his heirs male, and in 1608 Lord Bruce of Kinloss, with remainder to any of his heirs. He was succeeded by his son, the second Lord, who was killed in a duel in 1613. His younger brother, the third Lord, was created Earl of Elgin and Lord Bruce of Kinloss (a third separate barony) in 1633, with remainder to heirs male whatsoever, bearing the name and arms of Bruce. In 1641 he was also created Baron Bruce (designated \\"of Whorlton in the County of York\\") in the Peerage of England. He was succeeded by his son, the second Earl. He was created Baron Bruce of Skelton, Viscount Bruce and Earl of Ailesbury in the Peerage of England in 1664. His grandson, the fourth Earl of Elgin, was the last male descendant of the first Lord Kinloss and had no male heirs of his own. He therefore chose as his heir his nephew the Hon. Thomas Brudenell, fourth son of George Brudenell, 3rd Earl of Cardigan. In 1746 he was given the additional title of Baron Bruce (designated \\"of Tottenham in the County of Wilts\\") with remainder to the Hon. Thomas. On his death in 1747 the earldom of Ailesbury, viscountcy of Bruce, Whorlton barony Bruce, and barony of Bruce of Skelton became extinct. The rest of his titles took three different lines of descent. He was succeeded in the three lordships of Bruce of Kinloss and the earldom of Elgin by his kinsman the ninth Earl of Kincardine (see Earl of Elgin and Earl of Kincardine for later history of these peerages). The Tottenham barony of Bruce passed according to the special remainder to his nephew Thomas, the second Baron. (The Earldom of Ailesbury was created anew for Thomas; see the Marquess of Ailesbury for later history of these titles). The status of the lordship of Kinloss became uncertain. However, in 1868 the Committee for Privileges of the House of Lords decided that the rightful heir to the title was James Brydges, 3rd Duke of Chandos, as the son of Lady Mary Bruce, daughter of the fourth Earl of Elgin. However, he never assumed the title. On the death of the Duke, the dukedom became extinct. The heir to the lordship of Kinloss was his only child, Anne, Duchess of Buckingham and Chandos and de jure eighth Lady Kinloss, the wife of Richard Temple-Grenville, 1st Duke of Buckingham and Chandos. In 1868 her grandson, Richard Temple-Grenville, 3rd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos, established his right to the lordship before the Committee for Privileges of the House of Lords, and became the tenth Lord Kinloss. On his death in 1889 the dukedom became extinct, while the lordship passed to his eldest daughter Mary. the title is held by the latter's great-granddaughter, the thirteenth Lady, who succeeded her mother in 2012. The family seat is North View House, near Sheriff Hutton, North Yorkshire.

It is located by the shore of Southampton Water, and has a ferry service connecting it to Southampton. Hythe has a small shopping area, a pier, and a marina for yachts. History The name Hythe means landing-place or haven.Hythe, Old Hampshire Gazetteer Hythe is recorded in a Parliamentary roll from 1293.History , Hythe Online The Hythe ferry (\\"Hitheferye\\") to Southampton is marked on a map by Christopher Saxton of 1575, and on a map by John Harrison in 1788. Hythe was part of the parish of Fawley, although it became a separate ecclesiastical parish in 1841.Victoria County History, (1912), A History of the County of Hampshire: Volume 5, Fawley The current church, of Saint John the Baptist, was erected in 1874. It is of red brick with Bath Stone dressings. There were at one time stocks in the village. The Hampshire Advertiser, 23 Dec 1837, reports the death of John Richards of Hythe (1764-1837) and notes 'the father of the deceased founded the neat little village of Hythe: previous to his time there was no building there of greater pretensions than the huts of a few fishermen. The elder Mr Richards, when he established a shipbuilding yard at Heath (as it was then called) built houses for his workmen and the village soon sprang up.' At the beginning of the 20th century, Hythe was a \\"little fishing village\\"; with an hourly steamboat service to Southampton, and with the clubhouse of Hythe Yacht Club at the end of the pier. Hythe remained part of the civil parish of Fawley until 1913, when it became part of the parish of Dibden.Relationships / unit history of Dibden, A Vision of Britain through Time Thanks in part to the British Power Boat Company and its excellent access to the English Channel, during World War II Hythe was used as a port for the \\"little ships\\" of the Royal Navy, the Motor Torpedo Boats and the RAF Air/Sea Rescue Boats. In 1960, The Hovercraft Development Company and Sir Christopher Cockerell, its founder, moved to Hythe. There was also a small Royal Air Force base in Hythe known as RAF Hythe. Until its closure in September 2006 it was used by the United States Army to service and maintain watercraft.Workers bid farewell to RAF Hythe, BBC News, 29 September 2006 Part of the site is now used by the local Air Training Corps squadron. Hythe was a village up to the 1950s, but the expansion of Fawley Refinery led to a demand for more houses for workers, and Hythe and Dibden Purlieu were allowed to expand into a small town.Journal of the Town Planning Institute, (1953), Volume 39, page 87: \\"At Fawley the construction of Europe's largest oil refinery on Southampton Water has created a demand for more housing accommodation and it is proposed to satisfy this by expanding the existing villages of Hythe and Dibden Purlieu into a small town of 10,000.\\" In 1983, following the growth of Hythe, the parish of Dibden was renamed to Hythe and Dibden, to reflect the importance of Hythe as a new focal point of the Parish.What is the Parish Council , Hythe and Dibden Parish Council Geography Hythe has a small shopping area clustered around the High Street, which includes two supermarkets (a Waitrose and a Lidl), a public library, several charity shops, and small independent shops. The Hythe Pier, Railway and Ferry operates across Southampton Water to Southampton, and is the oldest working pier train in the world. Hythe's position makes it a good vantage point for viewing ocean liners arriving and departing at the port of Southampton, which attracts ship-watchers to the area. Hythe has a marina, at which a large number of yachts and boats are moored. Large and expensive houses are situated around the marina, overlooking the waterside. Ewart Court on Jones Lane in Hythe is home to Hythe and Dibden Cricket Club. The club was formed in 1948 with the amalgamation of The Hythe Club and The Dibden Purlieu Club. The Hythe club was formed in 1860. Hythe was home to the US Army between 1968 and 2006 at RAF Hythe. Following its closure, RAF Hythe was bought by the South East England Development Agency (SEEDA), who turned the site into a marine business park, Hythe Marine Park. Every year, usually around August, the marina hosts the RNLI (Royal National Lifeboat Institution) Great Waterside Raft Race, where teams race rafts in the Solent Estuary to raise money in support of the nearby Calshot RNLI station. British Power Boat Company The British Power Boat Company, which manufactured racing boats and later military patrol boats, was formed on 30 September 1927 when Hubert Scott-Paine bought and renamed Hythe's shipyard, with the intention of transforming it into one of the most modern mass production boat building yards in the country. Together with his chief designer, Fred Cooper, the company produced many racing boats which won numerous awards around Europe, including Miss England II and Miss Britain III. From 1930 the British Power Boat Company supplied seaplane tenders to the Air Ministry, commencing with RAF200, a -footer. In 1931 the Royal Air Force seconded T. E. Lawrence - later known as \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" - in his service name T.E. Shaw, to liaise with Scott-Paine on the design, trials and operations of the boat. Lawrence lodged in the village from 1931‚Äì2, in Myrtle Cottage at the junction of St John Street and Shore Road. The tenders were initially powered by twin 100bhp Meadows petrol engines giving a maximum speed of 29 knots, with some later versions fitted with Perkins S6M diesels. Sport and leisure Hythe has a non-League football club Hythe & Dibden FC, which plays at Clayfields Sports Ground, as well as New Forest Area cricket club Hythe & Dibden. Not far away is Applemore Recreation Centre, near Applemore College, where the New Forest district council supplies facilities, which include swimming, archery, basketball, tennis, squash and more. Hythe's proximity to Southampton Water makes water sports easily accessible, via Hythe Marina, Hythe Marina's slipway or Hythe Sailing Club. The slipway is used for the annual RNLI Raft Race. Hythe Sea Scouts also have good access to the water - their hut adjacent to Hythe Sailing Club. As a Royal Navy recognised group, the group has acquired a variety of kayaks, canoes and dinghies through funding. The building is currently undergoing maintenance due to erosion of the coastline putting the group at threat of being 'washed away'. A significant funding campaign, lead by Chris Godfrey, raised over ¬£80,000 to secure the ground beneath the scout hut.

Later, during the American Civil War, he joined the Colorado volunteers, rising to the rank of Captain in the Union Army. Silas Soule was in command of Company D, 1st Colorado Cavalry, which was present at Sand Creek on November 29, 1864, when he refused an order to join the Sand Creek massacre. During the subsequent inquiry, Soule testified against the massacre's commanding officer, John Chivington, and soon after, he was murdered in Denver. Early life  Silas Soule as one of \\"The Immortal Ten\\" Silas Soule was born into a family of abolitionists in Bath, Maine. He was raised in Maine and Massachusetts and, in 1854, his family became part of the newly formed New England Emigrant Aid Company, an organization whose goal was to help settle the Kansas Territory and bring it into the Union as a free state. His father and brother arrived in Kansas, near Lawrence (of which the Soule family was one of the founding families), in November 1854. Silas, his mother and two sisters came the following summer. Shortly after the family's arrival at Coal Creek, a few miles south of Lawrence near present-day Vinland, Amasa Soule, Silas's father, established his household as a stop on the Underground Railroad. At the young age of 17, Silas was escorting slaves, escapees from Missouri, north to freedom. His sister, Anne Julia Soule Prentiss, told of her family's early experience in Maine, Massachusetts and Kansas in a 1929 interview: \\"Our house was on the 'Underground Railway'. John Brown was often there... My brother, Silas, and Brown were close friends. Silas went out on many a foray with him. I recall well when Brown came to our cabin one night with thirteen slaves, men, women and children. He had run them away from Missouri. Brown left them with us. Father would always take in all the Negroes he could. Silas took the whole thirteen from our home eight miles to Mr. Grover's stone barn...\\"\\"She Looks Back Seventy-five Years to the Founding of Lawrence\\", The Kansas City Star, January 13, 1929, section C. \\"Bleeding Kansas\\" During these pre-war years, pro-slavery forces from Missouri and abolitionist forces from Kansas were engaged in open warfare. The fight was whether Kansas would be admitted to the Union as a slave or as a free state. This conflict, often called \\"Bleeding Kansas\\", enhanced the reputation of Silas Soule as a brave and resourceful fighter. In July 1859, Soule was part of an action on the Missouri border. Twenty pro-slavery men had crossed into Kansas to look for escaped slaves. They ambushed a party led by Dr. John Doy, a physician in Lawrence, escorting 13 former slaves (eight men, three women and two children) toward safety in Iowa. The men from Missouri arrested Dr. Doy and sold the former slaves. Doy was soon tried and convicted in Missouri for abducting slaves and sentenced to five years in the local penitentiary. Soule and a group of other men from Lawrence decided to free Doy. Soule was sent into the jailhouse in St. Joseph where Doy was being held. Soule convinced the jailkeeper that he had a message from Doy's wife. The note, in fact, read \\"Tonight, at twelve o'clock.\\" Later that night, they overpowered the jailer, freed Doy, and led him across the Missouri back to Kansas.The Thrilling Narrative of Dr. John Doy, of Kansas or, Slavery As It Is, Inside and Out. Thayer and Eldridge, Boston, 1860. Kansas State Historical Society, Topeka. When they reached Lawrence, they had their photo taken. This photo of \\"The Immortal Ten,\\" now held by the Kansas State Historical Society, is widely circulated. His skills at prison escapes came into use once again when John Brown was captured after his raid on Harper's Ferry where Brown was tried, convicted and sentenced to death by hanging. In November 1859, Soule visited the incarcerated Brown and offered to plan a jailbreak and help him flee from Virginia to hide out up north either in New York state or Canada. However, Brown told Soule that he had already decided to become a martyr for the abolitionist cause and willingly allowed himself to be hanged, hoping his death would help bring on a war between North and South, frustrating Soule's planned rescue attempt. Thomas Wentworth Higginson put together a rescue attempt of two of Brown's men, Albert Hazlett and Aaron Stevens, during which Soule posed as a drunken Irishman and got himself arrested for brawling. Put into the Charles Town jail for the night, he charmed the jailer and contacted the two men as well as John Brown once again with a second offer to help all three of them escape. Brown, Hazlett and Stevens all refused to be sprung from the jail. Afterwards, Soule traveled to Boston, where he often met with various abolitionists and also befriended the poet Walt Whitman.Tom Bensing, Silas Soule: A Short, Eventful Life of Moral Courage, Dog Ear Press, 2012. Life in Colorado and the Civil War Captain Silas Soule (front row, right) with Major Edward W. Wynkoop during a peace meeting with the Cheyenne chiefs on September 28, 1864 In May 1860, Soule, along with his brother William L.G., and his cousin, Sam Glass, went to the gold fields in Colorado.Letter of May 9, 1860, written at Coal Creek, Kansas, to Thayre, Eldridge and Hinton. Kansas State Historical Society. He dug for gold and worked in a blacksmith shop. In 1861, after the breakout of the Civil War, Soule enlisted in Company K, 1st Colorado Infantry (the 1st Regiment of Colorado Volunteers) and took part in the victorious New Mexico Campaign of 1862, including the key Battle of Glorieta Pass. He made his way up the ranks, and in November 1864 was assigned the command of Company D, 1st Colorado Cavalry (the 1st Colorado Volunteer Cavalry Regiment). The Sand Creek Massacre On November 29, 1864, Captain Soule and his company were with the regiment at Sand Creek, Colorado. A fellow abolitionist, Colonel John Chivington, ordered the cavalry to attack Black Kettle's encampment of Cheyenne and Arapaho there. Soule saw that the Cheyenne were flying the Union flag as a sign of peace, and, when told to attack, he and Lieutenant Joseph Cramer ordered their men to hold their fire and stay put. Most of Chivington's other forces, however, attacked the camp. The resulting action became known as the Sand Creek massacre, one of the most notorious acts of mass murder in the United States history. Soule described what followed in a letter to his former commanding officer and friend, Major Edward W. Wynkoop: The massacre sparked outrage and shock around the country. The Army began an investigation into the \\"battle\\", and Soule formally testified against Chivington in a court of inquiry in January 1865. His testimony about the events at Sand Creek led, in part, to Congress refusing the Army's request for thousands of men for a general war against the Plains Indians. Marriage On April 1, 1865, Silas married Thersa A. \\"Hersa\\" Coberly. Just 22 days later, their marriage ended when he was murdered. Silas Soule's memorial plaque in downtown Denver Death On April 23, 1865, 80 days after testifying, and three weeks after getting married, Captain Soule was on duty as a Provost Marshal in Denver when he went to investigate guns being fired at 10:30 pm. With his pistol out, Soule went around a corner and faced Charles Squier. Soule fired the first shot and wounded Squier's left arm, but Squier fired a bullet into Soule's right cheek bone. Soule was dead before help could arrive. Squier dropped his pistol and ran before he could be arrested by the authorities. Soule's death came just a little over two weeks before the end of the Civil War. Squier was turned in and was jailed awaiting trial. He escaped and fled to New York where his father was. Once there he held various jobs, and tried to rejoin the Army but was rejected. Squier then fled to Central America trying to avoid the law. His legs were crushed in a railroad accident and he later died from gangrene in 1869. Despite his crime, he was buried in New York with honors.http://www.kclonewolf.com/History/SandCreek/Bio/silas-soule- biography.html Remembrance Capt. Soule and Lt. Cramer were both buried at Riverside Cemetery in Denver. Native American anniversary events held annually in remembrance of the Sand Creek Massacre begin at the cemetery where representatives from the Northern Cheyenne tribe of Montana, the Northern Arapaho tribe of Wyoming, the Southern Cheyenne and Arapaho tribes of Oklahoma, the National Park Service and History Colorado decorate the graves of Soule and Cramer.

Previously, this applied to the Giants and Dodgers as well, before they moved out of New York City. Every historic and current venue for such games has been accessible via the New York City Subway, hence the name of the series. The term's historic usage has been in reference to World Series games played between the city's teams. The New York Yankees have appeared in all Subway Series games as they have been the only American League (AL) team based in the city, and have compiled an 11‚Äì3 all-time series record in the 14 championship Subway Series. Since 1997, the term Subway Series has been applied to interleague play during the regular season between the Yankees and New York City's National League (NL) team: the New York Mets. The Mets and Yankees also played each other in the 2000 World Series, in which the Yankees won. 19th century Trolley Series Although organized games between all-stars from New York teams against all-stars from Brooklyn teams date back to the 1850s, the first actual New York-Brooklyn \\"World Championship Series\\" occurred in 1889, a full nine years before Brooklyn was incorporated into the City of New York by the Greater New York Act of 1898, when the New York Giants squared off against (and defeated) the Brooklyn Bridegrooms, also called the \\"Trolley Dodgers\\", of the American Association. The following season, Brooklyn withdrew from the Association and joined the League, setting the stage for many future intra- city competitions. Some might argue that the 1889 Series would qualify as a \\"Trolley Series\\", but would not qualify as a Subway Series since New York's subway did not open until 1904. The 1906 World Series between the Chicago Cubs and the Chicago White Sox is also loosely referred to as a Subway Series, though the term Crosstown Series is more commonly used. The term is also inaccurate, since Chicago had surface systems from 1892 till the building of the State Street Subway in 1943. Early and mid-20th century Subway Series By the 1920s, the subway had become an important form of public transport in the city and provided a convenient form of travel between the three city ballparks: the Polo Grounds, in upper Manhattan; Yankee Stadium, in the Bronx; and Ebbets Field in Brooklyn. The 155th Street elevated and subway stations, the 161st Street station, and the Prospect Park respectively, served the ballparks. (New York's subway and elevated systems‚Äîthe IRT, BRT/BMT, and IND‚Äîwere in competition with each other until 1940.) In the case of the World Series contests listed, the entire Series could be attended by using the subway. The date of the first usage of the term \\"Subway Series\\" is uncertain. The term \\"Nickel Series\\" (a nickel was the old subway fare) appeared in newspapers by 1927, and \\"Subway Series\\" appeared by 1928. \\"Subway Series\\" was clearly already a familiar concept by 1934, as discussed in this article about that year's All-Star Game to be held in New York, discussing the \\"subway series\\" possibility for the Giants and Yankees. (Ultimately, no New York team made it to the 1934 post-season.). Yankees‚ÄìGiants The 1921 and 1922 match-ups were played in a single ballpark, as both the Giants and Yankees then played at the Polo Grounds. The Giants won both of these World Series against the Yankees, the first two Subway Series played. Despite cordial relations just a few years before when the Yankees allowed the Giants to share their home at Hilltop Park for a year in 1911 and the Giants more than returning the favor in kind by sharing Polo Grounds with the Yankees since 1913, the Yankees were issued an eviction notice in mid-1920 ending their lease after the 1922 season. The Yankees opened their new ballpark in 1923. Fortunes changed immediately for the Yankees as they defeated the Giants this time in the third straight year of World Series competition between the two teams. Their new home would host the Yankees' first of 11 Subway World Series victories that year and first of an unprecedented 26 World Series until the stadium closed in 2008. The venues for the 1923, 1936, 1937, and 1951 World Series--the Polo Grounds and the old Yankee Stadium--were a short walk apart across the Macombs Dam Bridge over the Harlem River. Yankees‚ÄìDodgers The term was used again in 1941 when the Dodgers made their first World Series appearance since 1920. Multiple Hall of Famers took part in these contests between the \\"Bronx Bombers\\" and \\"Dem Bums from Brooklyn\\" and the games involved numerous achievements including Jackie Robinson breaking the color barrier as the first African-American baseball player in the World Series and Don Larsen's performance in pitching the only perfect game in post-season history. The seven matchups between the Yankees and the Dodgers between 1941 and 1956 cemented the term as being mostly associated with the New York vs. Brooklyn contests, during the time when New York City was retroactively dubbed by historians as \\"The Capital of Baseball\\". Despite Brooklyn's repeated success at winning the National League pennant, it was only able to win one World Series (1955) against the Yankees.

The match-ups were known as the \\"City Series\\" and were sometimes played in October while other teams played in the World Series. However, after 1940, this became difficult because the Yankees would routinely appear in the World Series. In the 17 years from 1941 to 1957 (after which the Giants and Dodgers left New York City for California), the Yankees appeared in the World Series 12 times, failing to reach the Series only in 1944, 1945, 1946, 1948, and 1954. Before New York's two National League teams left the city, the Yankees and Dodgers played an annual midseason exhibition game called the Mayor's Trophy Game to benefit sandlot baseball in New York City. The proceeds raised by the Yankees were given to leagues in Manhattan and the Bronx, while proceeds raised by the Dodgers went to leagues on Long Island and Staten Island. The annual charity event was discontinued following the 1957 season, when the Dodgers moved to Los Angeles and the Giants moved to San Francisco. leaving the Yankees as the only major league team in the city. The game was revived in 1963, after the National League returned to New York with the expansion New York Mets in 1962. After dwindling interest and public bickering between the owners of both teams, the Mayor's Trophy Game was discontinued following the 1983 season. It was revived again as a pre-Opening Day series titled the \\"Mayor's Challenge\\" and held in 1989. Modern usage Subway Series 2008, Johnny Damon with the Yankees (left) and Brian Schneider with the Mets A full house at the new Yankee Stadium for a Subway Series game against the Mets on June 13, 2009. The Mets won the game 6-2. In modern usage, the term \\"Subway Series\\" generally refers to a series played between the two current New York baseball teams, the New York Yankees and the New York Mets. Their stadiums remain directly accessible by subway: Yankee Stadium via the 161st Street‚ÄìYankee Stadium station, and Citi Field via the Mets‚ÄìWillets Point station. It can also refer to any time two New York City-based teams play each other, such as the Knicks and Nets in the NBA, and the Rangers and Islanders in the NHL. All of these teams' venues are easily accessible via the New York City Subway as well. With the departure of the Dodgers and Giants in the 1950s New York was left without a crosstown rivalry. Even with the Mets joining MLB they were placed in the National League opposite of the Yankees. When interleague play was introduced in 1997 the teams finally got to play one another in a competitive fashion. The rivalry has included heated moments such as the Roger Clemens and Mike Piazza feud. Currently the Yankees lead the \\"Subway Series\\" 71-55 all time.  Mets-Yankees  The Mets and Yankees first met in a regular season game on June 16, 1997 with the introduction of interleague play. The Yankees won the game 6-3. The Yankees took the next two games to win the series, all three being played at Yankee Stadium. 1999 marked the first year of this rendition of the Subway Series to be two three game series, three hosted by the Mets and three hosted by the Yankees. The Mets won the series for the first time in 2004, four games to two. The Yankees lead the series all time with 11 series wins to the Mets 3 series wins with there being 10 ties. The Yankees lead in head to head wins 75-52, counting postseason. The first two series in the rivalry were only one three game series hosted by one team, alternating each year. From 1999 to 2012 the series was changed to two three game series, with each team hosting three games. This format changed in 2013 to a two series of two games hosted by each team, except in years that the AL East and NL east play each year when it goes back to a three game series. The Mets and Yankees have played each other in games that live on as classics. The Yankees beat the Mets in the 2000 World Series 4 games to 1. This series included the infamous Mike Piazza and Roger Clemens incident. Clemens, of the Yankees, threw part of a broken bat at Piazza, of the Mets, after a hit. On June 12, 2009 Luis Castillo of the Mets dropped a popup hit by Alex Rodriguez giving the Yankees a win in the series. On May 19, 2006 David Wright, the Mets' third baseman, had a walk off hit off of Yankees' star reliever Mariano Rivera to cap off a Mets comeback. 2000 World Series The name \\"Subway Series\\" was commonly applied to the 2000 World Series between the New York Yankees and the New York Mets. The Yankees won four games to one and celebrated their 26th championship in front of Mets fans at Shea Stadium. This was the only time that visiting teams had ever won a World Series at Shea Stadium. The other two times the World Series ended at Shea Stadium, in and , it ended with the Mets winning. During the 2000 World Series, the City of New York decorated some of the trains that ran on the train (which went to Shea Stadium in Queens, home of the Mets) and train (which went to the old Yankee Stadium in the Bronx, home of the Yankees). The 7 trains were blue and orange and featured the Mets version of the \\"NY\\" logo, and the 4 trains were white with blue pinstripes and featured the Yankees version of the \\"NY\\" logo. Also, after each game in the series the city offered free subway rides home for attendees of the game. Yankee fans displayed signs that read \\"Yankees in 4 and not in 7\\", predicting that the Yankees would easily dispatch the Mets in a Series sweep as opposed to a difficult, full-length Series. The signs had the 4 in a dark green circle designating the number 4 train, and the 7 in a purple circle designating the number 7 train.

Earl of Kingston is a title in the Peerage of Ireland. It was created in 1768 for Edward King, 1st Viscount Kingston. The Earl holds the subsidiary titles Baron Kingston, of Rockingham in the County of Roscommon (created in 1764), Viscount Kingston, of Kingsborough in the County of Sligo (created in 1766), Baron Erris, of Boyle in the County of Roscommon (created in 1801), and Viscount Lorton, of Boyle in the County of Roscommon (created in 1806), also in the Peerage of Ireland. He is also a baronet in the Baronetage of Ireland. Between 1821 and 1869 the earls also held the title Baron Kingston, of Mitchelstown in the County of Cork (created in 1821), in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. Family history until 1755 The King family descends from Robert King, younger brother of John King, 1st Baron Kingston (a title which became extinct in 1761; see Baron Kingston). In 1682 Robert King was created a baronet, of Boyle Abbey in the County of Roscommon. He subsequently represented County Roscommon and Boyle in the Irish House of Commons. He was succeeded by his son, John, the second Baronet, who also represented County Roscommon and Boyle in the Irish Parliament. John died childless and was succeeded by his younger brother, Henry, the third Baronet, who like his father and brother represented County Roscommon and Boyle in Parliament. Henry was succeeded by his eldest son, Robert, the fourth Baronet, who sat as Member of Parliament for Boyle. In 1748, aged 24, Robert was created Baron Kingsborough in the Peerage of Ireland. However, he died unmarried only seven years later, at which time the barony became extinct. Family history 1755‚Äì1869 Lord Kingsborough was succeeded in the baronetcy by his younger brother, Edward, the fifth Baronet, who represented Boyle and County Sligo in the Irish Parliament. In 1764 Edward was raised to the Peerage of Ireland as Baron Kingston, of Rockingham in the County of Roscommon, a revival of the barony held by his kinsmen which had become extinct three years earlier. He was further honoured when he was made Viscount Kingston, of Kingsborough in the County of Sligo, in 1766, and Earl of Kingston in 1768, also in the Peerage of Ireland. He was succeeded by his son, Robert, the second Earl, who represented County Cork in the Irish House of Commons. He married his kinswoman, the heiress Caroline Fitzgerald (died 1823), daughter of Richard FitzGerald by the Honourable Margaret King, daughter of James King, 4th Baron King (of the first creation). Some detail is known about the lives of the second Earl and his wife, as they hired the pioneer educator and proto-feminist Mary Wollstonecraft as governess to their daughters. Her books Thoughts on the Education of Daughters and Original Stories from Real Life draw on her experiences under their roof at Mitchelstown Castle. The daughter she influenced the most was Margaret King, who, as Lady Mount Cashell, undertook a Grand Tour on the Continent, accompanied by her friend Catherine Wilmot, whose diaries were eventually published as An Irish Peer on the Continent, 1801‚Äì03 (1920). The second Earl was succeeded by his eldest son, George, the third Earl, who represented County Roscommon in the Irish Parliament and later sat in the British House of Lords as an Irish Representative peer. In 1821 he was created Baron Kingston, of Mitchelstown in the County of Cork, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, which gave him and his descendants an automatic seat in the House of Lords. His eldest son, Edward, Viscount Kingsborough, was an antiquarian and also represented County Cork in the British Parliament. Lord Kingsborough predeceased his father, unmarried, and the earldom devolved on his younger brother, Robert, the fourth Earl. Robert sat as Member of Parliament for County Cork but was later declared to be of an \\"unsound mind\\". He died unmarried and was succeeded by his younger brother, James, the fifth Earl, who died childless in 1869, when the barony of Kingston created in 1821 became extinct. Family history, 1869‚Äìpresent The fifth Earl was succeeded in the remaining titles by his first cousin, Robert King, 2nd Viscount Lorton, who became the sixth Earl. Robert was the son of General the Honourable Robert King, fourth son of the second Earl, who had been created Viscount Lorton in the Peerage of Ireland in 1806 (see Viscount Lorton for earlier history of this branch of the family). Robert, the sixth Earl, had previously represented County Roscommon in Parliament. He died in October 1869, only a month after succeeded in the earldom, and was succeeded by his elder son, Robert, the seventh Earl, who died two years later at the age of forty, without any male issue. The seventh Earl was succeeded by his younger brother, Henry, the eighth Earl, who was Lord-Lieutenant of County Roscommon and sat in the House of Lords as an Irish Representative peer. Henry married Frances Margaret Christina King-Tenison, daughter of Edward King-Tenison, of Kilronan Castle, County Roscommon, and assumed in 1883 by Royal licence the additional surname of Tenison. He was succeeded by his second but only surviving son, Henry, the ninth Earl, who fought in both the Second Boer War and the First World War and sat in the House of Lords as an Irish Representative peer. As of 2012 the titles are held by the ninth Earl's great-grandson, Robert, the twelfth Earl, who succeeded in 2002, the titles having descended from father to son. As of 31 July 2012, the twelfth Earl has not successfully proven his succession to the baronetcy and is therefore not on the Official Roll of the Baronetage. The baronetcy is considered dormant.succession-to-baronetcy. Other family members Several other members of the King family may also be mentioned. The Honourable Sir Henry King, fourth son of the second Earl, was a politician and soldier. The Honourable James William King, younger son of the second Earl, was a rear-admiral in the Royal Navy. George King, son of Reverend the Honourable Richard FitzGerald King, younger son of the second Earl, was a major-general in the British Army. The Honourable Laurence Harman King-Harman, younger son of the first Viscount Lorton, was the father of Edward King- Harman, a politician (see also Stafford-King-Harman baronets), and Sir Charles King-Harman, High Commissioner to Cyprus.

In general, a chief of staff provides a buffer between a chief executive and that executive's direct-reporting team. The chief of staff generally works behind the scenes to solve problems, mediate disputes, and deal with issues before they are brought to the chief executive. Often chiefs of staff act as a confidante and advisor to the chief executive, acting as a sounding board for ideas. Ultimately the actual duties depend on the position and the people involved.

By 14, upstate New York rappers began making music to his tracks. Under the guidance of local music producer Gene Griffin, Riley formed the short-lived group Kids at Work. At the age of 18, Riley produced Kool Moe Dee's 12\\" single \\"Go See the Doctor\\". Released on an independent label in 1986, the song became a crossover hit, reaching No.89 on the Billboard Hot 100. Riley had previously worked on the production of Doug E. Fresh and the Get Fresh Crew's \\"The Show\\" in 1985. Career In 1987, Riley, Aaron Hall, and Timmy Gatling formed the R&B; group Guy. Managed by Gene Griffin, Riley's work with Guy pioneered the \\"new jack swing\\" style of R&B.; Riley infused his own blend of hip-hop beats, R&B; progressions and the gospel vocal stylings of Hall to create the archetypal new jack swing sound on Guy's eponymous debut. In 1989, Riley produced Big Daddy Kane's \\"I Get The Job Done\\", as well as other work for The Jacksons, The Winans and James Ingram. He also created the highly successful remix of Jane Child's \\"Don't Wanna Fall in Love\\", which became a crossover pop smash. After the release and tour of Guy's second album, The Future, Riley co-produced half of Michael Jackson's Dangerous album on the recommendation of Jackson's long-time producer Quincy Jones. After the disbandment of Guy in 1992, Riley moved to production, performance on and promotion of Wreckx-N-Effect's second album Hard or Smooth. In late 1991, Riley formed a second group, Blackstreet. The group would go on to release several major hits, including \\"Don't Leave Me\\" (1997), the number one single \\"No Diggity\\" (1996, featuring Dr. Dre and Queen Pen), and \\"Girlfriend/Boyfriend\\" (1999, with Janet Jackson, Eve, and Ja Rule). By 2011, the group had disbanded and reformed several times. In 2000, Riley worked with Spice Girl Melanie B on the tracks \\"ABC 123,\\" \\"I Believe\\", and \\"Pack Your S**t\\" for her solo debut album Hot. He also worked on an album with Outsiderz 4 Life, producing \\"Wil' Out\\" and other songs. At the start of 2006, he was part of the New Jack Reunion Tour, featuring Blackstreet and Guy, in addition to After 7, SWV, and Tony Toni Ton√©. In May 2006 Riley announced that he would be working on two key projects: a new Blackstreet album and a new Guy album. In 2008, Riley was the victim of a Ponzi scheme that left him bankrupt. In June 2008, a fire destroyed Riley's Virginia Beach recording studio. Fire investigators said that an electrical problem caused the blaze that burned the abandoned recording studio. The Virginia Beach Fire Department said lightning in the area also could have been a factor, although there was no direct strike. The empty studio was for sale and was insured for $336,000. In 2009, Riley performed with Guy at the BET Awards. In the same year, Riley worked with Amerie and Robin Thicke on their respective albums. Leading on from his work on Snoop Dogg's album Ego Trippin', Riley became part of the production supergroup QDT, which features DJ Quik as well as Snoop Dogg. Riley produced and co-wrote the song \\"Teeth\\" with Lady Gaga for her EP The Fame Monster. Speaking in March 2010 to Blues & Soul's Pete Lewis ‚Äì Riley said that he was no longer affiliated with Guy (Riley had last performed with the group in October 2010). Riley also said that the current line-up of Blackstreet consisted of himself, Chauncey Hannibal, Dave Hollister and Sherman 'J-Stylz' Tisdale. He confirmed that he was working on a new Blackstreet album, though intended to release his own album ‚Äì entitled 'TRX' ‚Äì first. Artists he could possibly be working with for the project included Stevie Wonder and Elton John, plus his own new, upcoming acts. However, Hannibal stopped performing with the group and the lineup became Riley, Hollister, Mark Middleton and Eric Williams. In 2012, Hannibal returned to Blackstreet. Middleton and Williams left the group. As of 2019, the group's lineup now consists of Riley, Dave Hollister, J-Stylz, and Rodney Poe under the name \\"Blackstreet 2.\\" In an August 2010, co-executor of the Michael Jackson estate, John Branca, confirmed that a posthumous album of Michael Jackson would be released, containing work done in the previous five years with producers Neff-U, Christopher \\"Tricky\\" Stewart and Riley, as well as work written and produced solely by Jackson himself. The album Michael was released on December 14, 2010 in the United States. After the release, several people questioned some of the music Riley produced for the project. Riley insisted all of the songs were sung by Jackson and claimed that vocal artifacts were added from overprocessing Jackson's voice. However, Riley made comments in an interview with Dan Dodds (aka Soul Jones) in which he stated that there were some elements of his voice in the music. \\"They may use some elements from me, put together ideas but I haven't been working on the new album\\" Riley is reported to have said. Recently, Riley has stepped into the Korean music market. Riley worked with singer/rapper Jay Park on an English track titled \\"Demon\\", which was originally meant for Michael Jackson. Riley produced a mini album for the Korean girl group Rania. Riley is one of the producers part of the production team QDT, with DJ Quik and Snoop Dogg. He produced the tracks \\"Believe\\" and \\"Flow\\" for the Twenty album of the R&B; group Boyz II Men. He has also produced Korean girl group Girls' Generation's single \\"The Boys\\" for the group's first international release. He has also produced songs for Girls' Generation's labelmates SHINee and EXO. He worked with Shinee on \\"Beautiful\\", \\"Shine\\", and \\"Dangerous\\" from their two part third Korean studio album. Riley also produced the songs \\"MILK\\" and \\"All Night\\" for f(x)'s third studio album Red Light and the song \\"What Is Love\\" for Exo.

It concerns the realisation of humble video store worker Steve Baxter (played by Christopher Eccleston) that he is in fact the Son of God, and has just a few days to find the human race's Third Testament and thus avert the Apocalypse. It was written by Russell T Davies (later head writer of the 2005 series of Doctor Who), and produced by the independent Red Production Company. The programme was originally commissioned as four one-hour episodes by Channel 4 in 1999; however, when new executives took over running the drama department at that channel, they decided not to pursue the project. Davies and Red's founder Nicola Shindler took the project to the BBC, who quickly turned it down; it found a home on ITV, a channel that had gained a reputation for producing mainstream, unchallenging, \\"middle-of- the-road\\" drama in recent years.Davies relates the story of the route to production of The Second Coming on the commentary track included on the DVD release. Carlton DVD 3711504783. Screened over two successive evenings in prime time on Sunday and Monday, 9‚Äì10 February 2003, The Second Coming gained viewing figures of over six million. Davies, who is an atheist, has said his intention was to provoke debate and get people thinking about religion. Storyline Steven Baxter (Christopher Eccleston) addresses the crowd who have come to worship him outside the police station in the first episode. Steven Baxter, a good-hearted but slightly awkward video shop worker from Manchester, disappears for forty days and forty nights after a drunken night out with his friends to celebrate his best friend Judy's divorce, during which he shared a kiss with her. He is found wandering Saddleworth Moor, and he claims to be the second coming of Jesus. At first he is met with scepticism, and is even locked up. One of the few people who believes him is a young Catholic priest, who mentions an obscure Christian text that mentions that the lamb will be sent to the city of the North, followed by a series of numbers that turned out to be map co-ordinates. The recent death of the Pope is also seen as a sign. Steve escapes and, after one final night out before starting his duties, decides to indicate he is really the son of God to humanity by turning night into day over the small area of the football stadium at Maine Road (he lets people know about it by advertising on the internet). The feat attracts the attention of the world's media. Steve then announces he must find the third testament within five days. He states that humanity needs to start taking responsibility for their actions, and that everyone, regardless of their religion or origin, needs to begin again and forget past conflicts. He also says that Christians should not boast about being right, then reveals that currently Heaven is empty, while Hell is bursting at the seams. There is much hysteria and panic; particularly when The Devil and several demons possess people (only indicated by silver eyes) to cause trouble. Satan takes possession of a man named Johnny Tyler that Judy met through a dating agency. He eventually reveals to Judy he wants Steve to fail and fall into despair, so that after Armageddon God will judge Steve's actions as a human and send him to hell, and they can rule together. In a deleted scene, it is revealed Satan also wants God to return to being the merciless, angry God of the Old Testament. Later, it is revealed that Steve's earthly father could not have fathered him as he was born sterile, another indicator that Steve is really the son of God. There is also media frenzy surrounding the events, especially after a tape is leaked of Steve saying that the world will end if the testament is not found, and he is taken into police protection. Some of Steve's friends accept him as the Messiah - Pete (who kept his Christianity hidden, not knowing how his friends would react) and Fiona (who becomes crazed, as this is the first time she has ever believed). Judy (an atheist), remains sceptical. She and Steve have some heated arguments (at one point, in a fit of anger, Steve is tempted to use his godly powers to kill her), especially as despite being the son of God, Steve is neither omniscient (relying on information \\"downloading\\" into his head, which frustrates him too) nor omnipotent (e.g., he cannot heal the sick). Steve later says that he does have powers, but he refuses to use them as he could get power mad, and reiterates it is up to humanity to sort themselves out this time. Judy is also confronted by several demons and manipulated into situations to get her to believe, which is part of Satan's plan to have Steve fall into despair. During the next few days, Steve miraculously survives several attempts made on his life, including a bomb going off in a pub in which he is drinking. The devil and his demons also attempt to turn his father Frank against him, getting him hooked on drugs and alcohol and convincing him that he is now a joke in the public's eyes (one deleted scene saw him watching Bernard Manning on TV making jokes at his expense). Frank tries to shoot Steve, but ends up killing Pete. After her husband leaves her, Fiona attempts suicide and tries to kill her children too. Also during this time Judy and Steve's relationship grows deeper, and they have sex. Steve himself has no idea what the third testament will be; he receives too many candidates to figure out which one is the real one. The Chief Superintendent of the police, who is also possessed by a demon, has them thrown out, saying that even if it were there, Steve would not be able to make his broadcast to the world. Having failed to discover the Testament, the people of the world hide in their homes, fearing the world's end. Steve then visits Judy in hope of trying to work out what the testament is, and Judy reveals to him that it is the record she is making of events. Judy, who is filmed night and day by cameras from the world's media around her house, makes spaghetti and laces it with rat poison, but announces this to Steve before presenting it to him. She states that it is Judgement Day, but for Steve and God, stating that it has been the existence of God or the argument about it which has led humanity to do so many bad things to one another. Steve is persuaded by Judy that he must die, and moreover make it permanent (in the sense of ceasing to exist rather than returning to heaven), so that humanity fights for itself rather than relying on the evils of fundamentalism. This will not only be the death of him, but of God, Satan, Heaven and Hell - the end of all religion. She also says that the absence of any kind of afterlife may scare people into living their lives properly. Steve does not believe her at first, thinking she was influenced by the demons. He does one last divine \\"download\\" and, to his horror, realises that this is indeed the Third Testament, \\"the closing of the family business.\\" He is scared at first, but then decides that it is time to die, and he eats his Last Supper. Henceforth, the world goes back to normal, with a few people referring to Judy as \\"the woman who killed God\\", but she otherwise goes back to living an ordinary insignificant life, having married the policeman who guarded her despite everyone else leaving their jobs and posts in fear of the apparent apocalypse. Judy sees Johnny Tyler (who has no memory of being possessed) and asks him if she did the right thing, but he cannot answer (suggesting that the audience needs to decide for itself whether she did or not). An earlier draft of the script features a twist ending in which Judy is married to Steve, who has simply given up his divinity and become human again, with only her recognising him. However, Davies was advised against ending the story this way by his friend and fellow writer Paul Abbott, who felt that it cheated the audience. Production Lesley Sharp as the initially sceptical Judy. Davies originally conceived the idea for the programme while on a car journey from Manchester to Liverpool with his friend, the television producer Tony Wood. His initial pitch to Nicola Shindler described a scene from the second episode, with the Son of God having returned to Earth, made love to the woman he loves and her asking him if he loves her. The eventual production for ITV was produced by Anne Harrison-Baxter and directed by Adrian Shergold, with Davies and Shindler as executive producers. Davies himself directed some of the second unit material featuring real-life television personalities such as Richard and Judy and Trisha Goddard commenting on Steven Baxter, seen throughout the programme along with news reports featuring real-life newsreaders such as Jon Snow and Krishnan Guru-Murthy. The bulk of filming took place during the summer of 2002. The change from four one-hour episodes to two ninety-minute instalments necessitated the cutting of much material from what would originally have been episode three, the opening half of the eventual second episode. Most of this material centred around Steve's friends and family being tested by the devil's servants as well as Steve's mother, who in the final edit is removed altogether and referred to only as having died some time beforehand. Some of this material was shot, and the scenes that did not make the programme were included as bonus features on the DVD release of the serial, released the week after the programmes's UK broadcast. Also included on the disc was an audio commentary from Davies and Shergold. The first episode, shown at 9pm on Sunday 9 February gained an average overnight viewing figure of 6.3 million, winning its timeslot ahead of the nearest competition, a documentary on the actor Christopher Reeve on BBC One, which gained 5.5 million, a 21% share. The second episode lost a sixth of its audience, with an average of 5.4 million viewers, beaten by the drama series In Deep on BBC One, which gained a figure of 6.6 million. The Second Coming has also been shown in other countries ‚Äì BBC America broadcast the drama in the United States in late 2003; it has also been seen in Canada on Showcase, in Australia on the ABC, and in New Zealand by TVNZ. Some versions shown overseas are shorter, with certain scenes cut and the ending coming after the 'documentary' scenes rather than the very final scene in the supermarket car park seen in the UK version. Critical reception Johnny Tyler (Mark Benton), the Devil's representative on Earth. Critical reaction to the production was generally positive. The Observer newspaper's reviewer, Kathryn Flett, said that \\"the boldness of the subject matter was complemented by a script of considerable depth and humour, and there were performances of Bafta- grabbing brilliance from everybody involved\\". She particularly praised the performances of the two leads: \\"Christopher Eccleston, never knowingly under- intense, was perfectly cast as the Everybloke suddenly gifted with the ability to provide answers to the big questions and perform medium-sized miracles... Sharp, burdened (or perhaps liberated?) by bad hair and make-up for most of the film proved herself yet again to be one of Britain's finest actresses.\\" The Daily Mail reviewer Peter Paterson was equally positive, commenting that: \\"There's nothing TV executives like less than having to field endless complaints by outraged viewers, and last night's proceedings will attract them in swarms. To invite such protest by screening something as provocative and out of the usual rut of ITV1's standard fare is certainly courageous.\\" In The Times, Paul Hoggart's verdict on the first episode was that: \\"It is intelligent, often amusing, and, at times, passionate and provocative. It throws down a gauntlet to religion, especially in tonight's conclusion, and something happens at the end which is probably deeply blasphemous... There are some clunks and bumps in the script, but most are smoothed over by excellent acting.\\" Writing in The Guardian to preview the drama before it aired, Mark Lawson said that: \\"Transmuting different genres like wine made from water ‚Äî comedy into romance into thriller ‚Äî Eccleston, Sharp, Davies and his director Adrian Shergold have created a world in which it soon ceases to seem odd that God chose Manchester. Steve only knows how they did it, but they have.\\" Commenting on the US showing on BBC America, New York Magazine reviewer John Leonard called it \\"...an interesting argument about the cost benefits of the possible death of God. Rough, rude, and wonderfully acted.\\" The Second Coming featured in two major categories at the 2004 British Academy Television Awards, the most important TV awards ceremony in the UK. In the Best Actor category Christopher Eccleston lost out to Bill Nighy (for State of Play) while the production itself was beaten by Charles II: The Power and The Passion in the Best Drama Serial category. Delivering the Huw Wheldon Lecture at the Royal Television Society's annual convention in Cambridge in September 2005, Paul Abbott praised The Second Coming as one of the few genuinely innovative British television drama productions of recent years, describing it as: \\"...a television masterpiece. It grappled with the most colossal subject matter in the return of a messiah to earth. Not in a Robert Powell way. Modern earth. Manchester, actually. And mainly the scruffy end.\\" Trivia British electronica duo Orbital sampled the speech given by Steve Baxter (Christopher Eccleston) for the track \\"You Lot\\" on their 2004 Blue Album.

He had been accused of treason for having opposed Caesar in the civil war in Africa, but was defended so eloquently by Cicero that he was pardoned and allowed to return to Rome. He later conspired with Brutus, with whom he assassinated Julius Caesar on March 15, 44 BC. Civil war Quintus Ligarius was a member of an equestrian Sabine family. He had gone to Africa as legate to the provincial governor Gaius Considius Longus, who later returned to Rome leaving him in control.John Hazel, Who's Who in the Roman World, Routledge, London, 2001, p.168. After Pompey was defeated by Caesar at the Battle of Pharsalus, Pompey's ally Publius Attius Varus occupied Africa, hoping to restore the Pompeian cause. Ligarius became one of his assistants in the continuing battle against Caesar. He was present at the Battle of Thapsus. After the Pompeian defeat, he was captured at Hadrumetum. He was spared by Caesar, but he was not allowed back into Italy.Harold C. Gotoff, Cicero's Caesarian Speeches: A Stylistic Commentary, University of North Carolina Press, 1993, p.xxxiii. Trial Ligarius' brothers asked Cicero to intercede on behalf of their exiled relative. Cicero secured a meeting with Caesar, who seemed receptive, but then an order was made to arrest Ligarius on charges that are no longer clear, but appear to have involved the claim that he conspired with King Juba I of Numidia. The prosecution seems to have emerged from a grudge held by Quintus Aelius Tubero over an incident when Ligarius denied Tubero's family help when he was in charge of Africa. At the trial Cicero gave an impassioned speech in Ligarius' defence, known as the Pro Ligario. He ignored the actual charges, but instead made an emotional appeal for reconciliation and clemency, warning of the dangers of vendettas. According to Plutarch, \\"Caesar was emotionally overcome, his body shook, and some documents fell from his hand. And so under compulsion he acquitted Ligarius.\\" Christian Meier, (trans David McLintock), Caesar, Basic Books, 1995, p.484 Conspirator The acquittal allowed Ligarius to return to Rome. Plutarch writes that he did not forgive Caesar for pardoning him. This hatred, and his friendship with other Liberators, caused him to join the assassination plot. According to Plutarch, Ligarius was ill in bed when he was visited by Brutus. He told Brutus that he would be made well again by helping him with his plot.David F. Epstein, \\"Caesar's Personal Enemies on the Ides of March\\", Latomus, T. 46, Fasc. 3 July-September 1987, pp. 566-570 Plutarch refers to him as \\"Caius Ligarius\\" in the passage, but the context strongly implies that he is referring to the same person who was tried and acquitted. Although no author specifically identifies Ligarius as a victim of the proscriptions of the triumvirs in 43 BC, there is little doubt, as Cicero mentions that there were three brothers, and Appian mentions three brothers with this name who perished in the proscriptions.Cicero, Pro Ligario, 12.Appian, Bellum Civile, iv. 22, 23. In Shakespeare Ligarius is a character in William Shakespeare's tragedy Julius Caesar. He is called \\"Caius Ligarius\\", which is the name used by Plutarch when describing the episode of his sickness. He is depicted, following Plutarch, as a sickly man, though strong in mind, with a grudge against Caesar for reprimanding him for admiring Pompey. His absolute trust in Brutus sets up the role of Brutus as a moral model whose leadership is necessary to bring others on board.Alfred Harbage, William Shakespeare: A Reader's Guide, Noonday Press, New York, 1963, p.255 Though part of the conspiracy, he does not participate in the assassination itself.F. E. Halliday, A Shakespeare Companion, 1550-1950, Funk & Wagnalls, 1952, p.361.

Of the 129 Haganah fighters and Jewish kibbutzniks who died during the defence of the settlement, Martin Gilbert states that fifteen were murdered on surrendering.Martin Gilbert, Jerusalem - Illustrated History Atlas,, V. Mitchell 1994, page 93. Controversy surrounds the responsibility and role of the Arab Legion in the killing of those who surrendered. The official Israeli version maintains that the kibbutz residents and Haganah soldiers were massacred by local Arabs and the Arab Legion of the Jordanian Army as they were surrendering. The Arab Legion version maintains that the Legion arrived too late to prevent the kibbutz attack by men from nearby Arab villages, which was allegedly motivated by a desire to avenge the massacre of Deir Yassin and the destruction of one of their villages several months earlier.Henry Laurens, La Question de Palestine, vol.2, Fayard 2007 p.96.:'According to the Arab Legion version, the Jordanian soldiers arrived too late to impede the massacre by villagers who were keen to avenge Deir Yassin and the losses they had sustained since November (it should be kept in mind that it was the colony that opened hostilities in December by destroying a nearby village)'. Selon la version de la L√©gion, les soldats jordaniens sont arriv√©s trop tard pour emp√™cher le massacre de la part des villageois d√©sireux de venger Deir Yassin et leurs pertes depuis le mois de novembre (il faut rappeler que c'est la colonie qui a ouvert les hostilit√©s en d√©cembre en d√©truisant un village voisin).' Laurens adds:'Le plus probable est que tout se soit pass√© dans la plus grande confusion' (Most probably, everything took place in a situation of enormous confusion.) The surrendering Jewish residents and fighters are said to have been assembled in a courtyard, only to be suddenly fired upon; it is said that many died on the spot, while most of those who managed to flee were hunted down and killed. Four prisoners survived the massacre and were transferred to Transjordan.Meron Benvenisti,\\"Sacred Landscape: The Buried History of the Holy Land since 1948, University of California Press, 2000 p.116 Immediately following the surrender on May 13, the kibbutz was looted and razed to the ground. The members of the three other kibbutzim of the Gush Etzion surrendered the next day and were taken as POWs to Jordan. The bodies of the victims were left unburied until, one and a half years later, the Jordanian government allowed Shlomo Goren to collect the remains, which were then interred at Mount Herzl. The survivors of the Etzion Bloc were housed in former Arab houses in Jaffa.Gershom Gorenberg, Occupied Territories: The Untold Story of Israel's Settlements,I.B.Tauris, 2007 p. 20. Background Kfar Etzion was a kibbutz founded in 1943, for military and agricultural ends,Larry Collins, Dominique Lapierre, O Jerusalem,(1972) Granada Books 1982, p. 217 about 2 km west of the road between Jerusalem and Hebron. By the end of 1947, there were 163 adults and 50 children living there. Together with three nearby kibbutzim established 1945‚Äì1947, it formed Gush Etzion (the Etzion Bloc). According to one member of the settlement, relations were good between settlers and local Arabs, with attendance at each other's weddings, until November 1949.Margalit Zisman, cited Michael Petrou, Is This Your First War?: Travels Through the Post-9/11 Islamic World, Dundurn, 2012 p. 167 Funeral procession leaving from Jewish Agency building, Jerusalem The United Nations partition plan for Palestine of November 29, 1947 placed the bloc, an enclave in a purely Arab area, inside the boundaries of the intended Arab state,Avi Shlaim, 'Israel and the Arab Coalition in 1948,' in Albert H.

(2005), pp. 535-56. where, moreover, Jewish settlement was to be forbidden through a transitional period.Benny Morris, The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem Revisited, Cambridge University Press, 2004, p. 370. For Hebronite Arabs, the bloc constituted an 'alien intrusion' on ground that had been wholly Arab for centuries,' though it had been built on land either purchased by Jews (1928) or acquired by them through a complex circumvention of Mandatory law in 1942.Larry Collins, Dominique Lapierre, O Jerusalem,(1972) Granada Books 1982 p.216.'In 1942, by a complex legal manoeuvre, the Fund circumvented the restrictions on Jewish land purchases set out by the British government's 1939 White Paper and acquired the land of a nearby German monastery whose monks had been interned as enemy aliens by the British. On an April night one year later, three women and ten men slipped through the darkness to lay claim to the monastery and officially establish the settlement of Kfar Etzion.' According to Henry Laurens, Kfar Etzion had started hostilities in the area in December by destroying a local Arab village.Henry Laurens (scholar), La Question de Palestine, vol.2, Fayard 2007 p.96. On 10 December, a convoy from Bethlehem en route to the Gush Etzion bloc was ambushed and 10 of its 26 passengers and escorts were killed.Yoav Gelber,Palestine, 1948: War, Escape and the Emergence of the Palestinian Refugee Problem,Sussex University Press p.26. Though on January 5, the children and some women had been evacuated with British assistance, and though David Shaltiel recommended its evacuation, the Haganah, on Yigal Yadin's counsel, decided against withdrawing from the settlements for several reasons: they commanded a strategic position on Jerusalem's southern approach from Hebron,Mark Daryl Erickson, Joseph E. Goldberg, Stephen H. Gotowicki, Bernard Reich, Sanford R. Silverburg (1996). An Historical Encyclopedia of the Arab- Israeli Conflict, p. 149. Greenwood; and were considered, in the words of Abdullah Tall, a 'sharp thorn stuck in the heart of a purely Arab area'. Several relief convoys from the Haganah in Jerusalem had been ambushed. In the months prior to May 15, Haganah militiamen in the bloc's kibbutzim repeatedly fired on Arab civilians, and British traffic, including convoys, moving between Jerusalem and Hebron, under instruction to do so in order to draw and drain Arab forces from the fight for Jerusalem.Henry Laurens, La Question de Palestine, Fayard 2007, p. 96.Benny Morris, The Road to Jerusalem: Glubb Pasha, Palestine and the Jews, I.B.Tauris, 2003, pp. 135-37. On two occasions, April 12 and May 3, Arab Legion units were ambushed, and several legionnaires killed or wounded by the bloc militias, - Kfar Etzion soldiers being directly involved in the incident on April 12Chronology of International Events and Documents, Volume 4 Royal Institute of International Affairs, 1947 p.270:'12 April. ‚Äî Jews in the Kfar Etzion settlement near the Jerusalem-Tel Aviv road fired on an Arab convoy and the Arabs fought back.' \\\\- Arab irregular forces made small-scale attacks against the settlements. An emergency reinforcement convoy attempting to march to Gush Etzion under cover of darkness was discovered and its members killed by Palestinian Arab forces. Despite some emergency flights by an Auster from Jerusalem and Piper Cubs out of Tel Aviv onto an improvised airfield, adequate supplies were not getting in. As the end of the British Mandate drew closer, the fighting in the region intensified. Although the Arab Legion was theoretically in Palestine under British command, they began to operate more and more independently. On March 27, land communication with the rest of the Yishuv was severed completely when the Nebi Daniel Convoy was ambushed on its return to Jerusalem, and 15 Haganah soldiers died before the remainder were extricated by the British. It was ambushes by the Etzion Bloc militias conducted against Arab Legion units on April 12 and May 4 that, according to a Hanagah analysis, tipped the Legion's policy towards the bloc from one of isolating it to destroying it.Benny Morris,The Road to Jerusalem, p. 137. On May 4, following the last ambush of a Legion convoy, a joint force of British, Arab Legion and irregular troops launched a major punitive attack on Kfar Etzion. The Haganah abandoned a few outposts but generally resisted, and the attack failed, leaving 12 Haganah soldiers dead, 30 wounded, with a similar number of Arab legionnaires killed, and several dozen wounded. Units from the bloc may have attacked Arab traffic the following day, but the failure of the Legion's assault led Hebronites and Legion units to plan a final attack and destroy the Etzion Bloc militarily.Benny Morris,The Road to Jerusalem, pp. 137-38. The final assault on Kfar Etzion began on May 12. Parts of two Arab Legion companies, assisted by hundreds of local irregulars, had a dozen armored cars and artillery, to which the Jewish defenders had no effective answer. The commander of Kfar Etzion requested from the Central Command in Jerusalem permission to evacuate the kibbutz, but was ordered to stay. Later in the day, the Arabs captured the Russian Orthodox monastery, which the Haganah used as a perimeter fortress for the Kfar Etzion area, killing twenty-four of its thirty-two defenders. On May 13, an attack broke through Kfar Etzion's defences and reached the settlement's centre effectively cutting off the perimeter outposts from each other.B. Morris, The Road to Jerusalem: Glubb Pasha, Palestine and the Jews. pp. 135-38, 2003. Massacre Kfar Etzion 1945 1:250,000 Arab Legion Major Abdullah el Tell (far right) with Captain Hikmat Mihyar (far left) pose with two of the four Jewish survivors of the Fall of Gush Etzion. Around May 13, 1948 In the Israeli mainstream version, when the hopelessness of their position became undeniable on May 13, dozens of defenders, the haverim, of Kfar Etzion laid down their arms and assembled in the courtyard, where they suddenly began to be shot at. Those not slain in the first volleys of fire pushed past the Arabs, and either escaped to hide, or gathered their weapons,Dov Knohl,Siege in the Hills:: The Battle of the Etzion Bloc, T. Yoseloff, 1958, p. 334. and were hunted down.Benny Morris, The Road to Jerusalem: Glubb Pasha, Palestine and the Jews,pp. 138-39 The number of people killed and the perpetrators, the Arab legion or local village irregulars or both, are in dispute. According to one account, the main group of about 50 defenders were surrounded by a large number of Arab irregulars, who shouted \\"Deir Yassin!\\" and ordered the Jews to sit down, stand up, and sit down again, when suddenly someone opened fire on the Jews with a machine gun and others joined in the killing. Those Jews not immediately cut down tried to run away but were pursued. According to Meron Benvenisti, hand grenades were thrown into a cellar, killing a group of 50 who were hiding there. The building was blown up. According to other sources, 20 women hiding in a cellar were killed.Ruth Gruber ,Israel on the seventh day, Hill and Wang, 1968 p.30.'Twenty women who had hidden in a cellar were massacred by Arabs with hand grenades.' David Ohana writes that 127 Israeli fighters were killed on the last day.David Ohana, The Origins of Israeli Mythology: Neither Canaanites Nor Crusaders, Cambridge University Press, 2012, p. 104. Arab losses during the two day battle, according to a Haganah estimate, numbered 69: 42 irregulars, and 27 legionnaires.Benny Morris, ibid. p269 n.398. A number of Israeli histories of the Kfar Etzion massacre (such as Levi, 1986, Isseroff, 2005) state that the defenders had put out the white flag and lined up to surrender in front of the school building of the German monastery. An Arab version recounts that a white flag was flown, and drew the Arabs into a trap where they were fired on. Benny Morris cites a Legion officer's statement that the defenders had not formally surrendered, that some resistance continued, with shooting at Arabs, after others had surrendered, that local villagers shot legionnaires trying to defend prisoners, and that legionnaires had to shoot some villagers engaged in the killings.Benny Morris, The Road to Jerusalem: Glubb Pasha, Palestine and the Jews, p.139. The figure of 127 massacred appears to include both those who surrendered only to be slain, and the defenders who had been killed in battle over 12‚Äì13 May.Benny Morris, ibid. p269 n.398. In another account, after the 133 defenders had assembled, they were photographed by a man in a kaffiyeh, and then an armored car apparently belonging to the Arab Legion opened fire with its machine gun, and then Arab irregulars joined in. A group of defenders managed to crawl into the cellar of the monastery, where they defended themselves until a large number of grenades were thrown into the cellar. The building was then blown up and collapsed on them. About 129 persons died in the battle and its aftermath. Only three of the remaining Kfar Etzion residents and one Palmach member survived. According to their own testimony, the circumstances of their survival were as follows. * Yaacov Edelstein and Yitzhak Ben-Sira tried to hide amongst a jumble of boulders and branches, but they were discovered by a \\"wrinkled, toothless, old Arab\\" who told them \\"Don't be afraid.\\" Then a group of Arab irregulars rushed up and threw them against a wall. The old Arab tried to shield them with his body. As they argued, two Arab Legionnaires came up and took the two Jews under their protection. * Nahum Ben-Sira, the brother of Yitzhak, was away from the main group when the massacre started. He hid until nightfall then escaped to a nearby kibbutz. * Alisa Feuchtwanger (Palmach) tried to hide in a ditch with several others. They were discovered and all were murdered except Alisa, who was dragged away by several Arab irregulars. As the group were trying to rape her, an Arab Legion officer (Captain Hikmat Mihyar) arrived, shot two of the perpetrators and sent the rest away. Afterwards the officer gave her bread, waited until she finished eating, and said to her (quote) \\"You are under my protection\\". She testified that while the officer took her to safety, he shot dead wounded Jews. Both Alisaa and Nahum said that the Legion soldiers actively participated in the Massacre. Names of fallen in Kfar Etzion Memorial A total of 157 defenders died in the battle of Gush Etzion (Levi, 1986), including those killed in the massacre at Kfar Etzion. About 2/3 of them were residents and the remainder were Hagana or Palmach soldiers. On the following day, the Arab irregular forces continued their assault on the remaining three Etzion settlements. Fearing that the defenders might suffer the same fate as those of Kfar Etzion, Zionist leaders in Jerusalem negotiated a deal for the surrender of the settlements on condition that the Arab Legion protected the residents. The Red Cross took the wounded to Jerusalem, and the Arab Legion took the remainder as prisoners of war. In March 1949 320 prisoners from the Etzion settlements were released from the \\"Jordan POW camp at Mafrak\\", including 85 women.Moshe Dayan, 'The Story of My Life'. . Page 130. Out of a total of 670 prisoners released. Aftermath On October 28, 1948, the Arab village al-Dawayima was conquered by the IDF 89th Commando Battalion. They then committed the Al-Dawayima massacre, as the villagers were blamed for the Kfar Etzion massacre. Estimates of the number of murdered Arab villagers range from 80‚Äì100 to 100‚Äì200, depending on the source.Benny Morris (2008), 1948: An History the First Arab-Israeli War, p. 333Saleh Abdel Jawad (2007), Zionist Massacres: the Creation of the Palestinian Refugee Problem in the 1948 War, in E. Benvenisti & al, Israel and the Palestinian Refugees, Berlin, Heidelberg, New-York : Springer, pp. 59-127 The bodies of the murdered of Kfar Etzion were left at the site for a year and a half, until in November 1949, the Chief Military Rabbi, Shlomo Goren was allowed to collect their bones. They were buried in a full military funeral on November 17 in Mount Herzl in Jerusalem. Their communal grave was the first grave in what is today the military cemetery of Mount Herzl. The Etzion Bloc became a symbol of Zionist heroism and martyrdom among Israelis immediately after its fall, and this importance continues. The date of the massacre was enshrined as Israel's Day of Remembrance. The site of the Etzion Bloc was recaptured by Israel during the 1967 war. The children who had been evacuated from the Bloc in 1948 led a public campaign for the Bloc to be resettled, and Prime Minister Levi Eshkol gave his approval. Kfar Etzion was re-established as a kibbutz in September 1967, as the first Israeli settlement in the West Bank after the war.

Duklja (, Diokleia; ; Serbian Cyrillic: –î—É–∫—ô–∞) was a medieval South Slavic state which roughly encompassed the territories of present-day southeastern Montenegro, from the Bay of Kotor in the west to the Bojana river in the east, and to the sources of the Zeta and Moraƒça rivers in the north. First mentioned in 10th‚Äì and 11th century Byzantine chronicles, it was a vassal of the Byzantine Empire until it became independent in 1040 under Stefan Vojislav ( 1034‚Äì43) who rose up and managed to take over territories of the earlier Serbian Principality, founding the Vojislavljeviƒá dynasty. Between 1043 and 1080, under Mihailo Vojislavljeviƒá ( 1050‚Äì81), and his son, Constantine Bodin ( 1081‚Äì1101), Duklja saw its apogee. Mihailo was given the nominal title King of Slavs by the Pope after having left the Byzantine camp and supported an uprising in the Balkans, in which his son Bodin played a central part. Having incorporated the Serbian hinterland (the core of the earlier Serbian Principality, known as Ra≈°ka) and installed vassal rulers there, this maritime principality emerged as the most powerful Serb polity, seen in the titles used by its rulers (\\"Prince of Serbia\\", \\"of Serbs\\"). However, its rise was short- lived, as Bodin was defeated by the Byzantines and imprisoned; pushed to the background, his relative and vassal Vukan became independent in Ra≈°ka, which continued the fight against the Byzantines while Duklja was struck with civil wars. Between 1113 and 1149 Duklja was the centre of Serbian‚ÄìByzantine conflict, with members of the Vojislavljeviƒá as prot√©g√©s of either fighting each other for power. Duklja was then incorporated as a crown land of the Grand Principality of Serbia ruled by the Vukanoviƒá dynasty, subsequently known as Zeta, remaining so until the fall of the Serbian Empire in the 14th century. Etymology In historiography, K. Jirechek was the first to use \\"Duklja\\". Doclea was originally the name of the Roman city on the site of modern Podgorica (Ribnica), built by Roman Emperor Diocletian, who hailed from this region of Roman Dalmatia. The Romanized Illyrian tribe known as Docleatae that inhabited the area derived their name from the city. In later centuries, the Romans hypercorrected the name to Dioclea, wrongly guessing that an i had been lost due to vulgar speech patterns. Duklja is the later Slavic version of the name of this region, attributed to the principality under Byzantine suzerainty (\\"Diokleia\\", ŒîŒπŒøŒ∫ŒªŒµŒØŒ±). The demonym, or tribal name, appearing in De Administrando Imperio was \\"Dioklƒìtianoi\\" (ŒîŒπŒøŒ∫ŒªŒ∑œÑŒπŒ±ŒΩŒøŒØ). Geography According to De Administrando Imperio (948‚Äì952), in chapter 35, Diokleia (ŒîŒπŒøŒ∫ŒªŒµŒØŒ±) included the \\"large, inhabited cities\\" of Gradetai, Nougrade, and Lontodokla. Gradetai may have been Starigrad, Nougrade may have been Prevlaka, while the location of Lontodokla is uncertain. According to the later, somewhat dubious source, Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja, a ruler named Hvalimir who was alleged to be an ancestor of Jovan Vladimir (ca. 990‚Äì1016), held Zeta and its towns, and the following counties: Lusca (Lu≈°ka), Podlugiae (Podlu≈æje), Gorsca (Gorska), Cupelnich (Kupelnik), Obliquus (Oblik), Prapratna, Cermeniza (Crmnica) and Budua (Budva) with Cuceva (Kuƒçevo) and Gripuli (Grbalj). Since the 12th century, the term Zeta began to replace the name Duklja. De Administrando Imperio According to the 10th-century De Administrando Imperio (DAI), written by the Byzantine emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos, a second migration of Slavs into the Balkans occurred during the reign of Heraclius ( 610‚Äì640). DAI mentions Croats and Serbs having settled the Western Balkans, the Serbs having founded \\"baptized Serbia\\" (known erroneously in historiography as Ra≈°ka) which included the land of Bosna. The other presumably Serb-inhabited lands (or principalities) that were mentioned in the DAI included the maritime Paganija, Zahumlje, Travunija and Kanalites, while Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos does not provide information about Serb settlement in Duklja. All of the maritime lands bordered Serbia to the north. Ethnic composition The DAI claims that Duklja had been made desolate by the Avars and \\"repopulated in the time of the Emperor Heraclius, just as were Croatia and Serbia\\" (i.e. in the first half of the 7th century), by Slavs.Moravscik, 1967, p. 165 While he clearly states that the neighboring principalities of Serbia, Zahumlje, Travunia, and Pagania had been settled by the 'unbaptized Serbs', he mentions Duklja simply as having been settled by 'Slavs'. Although in the scholarship it is often considered as a Serbian principality, the statements of various Byzantine writers in which the Diocleans are also called as Serbs, Croats, and Dalmati do not allow equalization of Duklja inhabitants until 12th century either with the Serbs or with the Croats. Scholars have debated at length as to the reliability of DAI. For example, Florin Curta, among others, suggested that the DAI was a political document, rather than a strictly historical one and that it probably indicates that the coastal ≈æupanijas were under the authority of the Serbian prince, ƒåaslav Klonimiroviƒá, in the mid-10th century. Tibor ≈Ωivkoviƒá and Neven Budak also concluded that a closer reading suggests that the Constantine consideration about regional ethnic identity is based on Serbian political rule and expansion in the 10th century which does not indicate ethnic origin. John V.A. Fine argues \\"given that Serbs settled in regions along its borders, presumably this would have also been a Serb region\\".Fine, 1991, p. 53 Ivo Banac proposed that the DAI mention that a part of the Croats \\"split off and took control of Illyricum and Pannonia\\" after settling western part of the province of Dalmatia could be connected to Duklja, while Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja calls that area as Red Croatia. The dubious Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja, compiled in 1298‚Äì1301 by a Cistercian monk in the service of Paul I ≈†ubiƒá of Bribir, nevertheless if does again promote mere Byzantine confusion over Serbs and Croats, with other historical sources does allude to the existence of Croats and their political influence far into Montenegrin inland until the late 12th century. Ultimately, the origins of Duklja are not known with certainty, for the literary evidence often rests on semi-legendary genealogies. Moreover, what actually constituted a people (gens) in the Middle Ages has been rigorously debated. There is no clear evidence that peoples known as Serbs or Croats migrated en masse as coherent nations.Curta (2006, p 141, footnote 64) The argument gains weight in light of Hew Evans' remarks about the absence of any archaeological evidence pertaining to the migration of any group into present-day Croatia between c.650 and c. 800 Rather, some sort of group identity began to form within the Balkans from the late 7th century as Slavic notables formed a system of alliances. This coincides with the final demise of Avar hegemony over the western Balkans. \\"The Croats and Serbs have also been seen as rebels who broke away from the Avars to set up their own states in the 620s with the blessing of Emperor Heraklios. But the only evidence is an anachronistic story preserved in De Administrando Imperio which seems to have been invented in the late 9th or early 10th century to give historical precedent to current Byzantine policies.\\" At the same time, the Byzantines had begun to re-establish some control in parts of the Balkans after the 7th-century collapse of imperial control. The establishment of the Byzantine theme of Dyrrhachium facilitated diplomatic contacts between the East Romans and the Adriatic Sclaviniae. Both Florin Curta and John Fine, among other medievalists, have argued that ethnonyms such as Serb or Croat were primarily political labels referring to a dux and his retinue of nobles, while on a lower level it also referred the mass of commoners who inhabited the territory under the (often nominal and transient) rule of such leaders. There is little evidence that a modern notion of nation-type ethnicity, and the values associated with it, existed in medieval societies. \\"some have concluded that the \\"Croat\\" refer not to ethnic identity, but to an elite\\" Rather, for the general masses, identity was rooted primarily with one's own clan, village and region. As Fine states, \\"In this large region settled by Slavs, all of whom spoke the same language, certain political entities emerged, and that is all that they were, political entities\\".Fine, 2006, p. 31 Duklja was one such polity, and its subsequent history was closely intertwined with that of Serbia/Rascia and the Byzantine Empire, and as well as Rome and 'western' powers. As such Duklja is seen as one of the medieval Serb states and was the political and cultural predecessor of modern Montenegro.Hupchik, 2002, p. 54: \\"Jovan Vladimir, who ruled a renewed Serb state centered on Zeta (present-day Montenegro)\\"The New Cambridge Medieval History, IV. 1024‚Äì 1198. Part II. Page 136. \\"In 1018 when Basil II conquered Bulgaria a number of Serbian principalities also fell under Byzantine rule. These included Raska.., Duklja.., Tribenje..., Zahumlje.., and BosniaStephenson, 2003, pp. 42‚Äì43: Ljutovid's claim to be strategos not only of Zahumlje, but all Serbia suggests that he had been courted by the Emperor and awarded nominal rights over neighboring lands, including Duklja\\" Early history Little is known about Duklja prior to the 11th century. The main source on the history of early South Slavic states is De Administrando Imperio by Emperor Constantine VII (compiled before 952). The work mentions virtually nothing about Duklja apart from that it was settled by Slavs and was ruled by the Byzantine Emperors. It probably did not exist as an established, independent polity before the late 10th century. The Byzantines ruled over coastal cities such as Doclea, Bar, Kotor, and the hinterland surrounding these. Archaeological evidence (a personal seal belonging to \\"Peter of Diokleia\\") suggests that local officials governed this small region in the name of the Emperor. The Slav regions that were not directly under Byzantine rule (such as Travunia) were organized into numerous ≈æupa, (roughly, a county) ruled by local families. Slav raids on Eastern Roman territory are mentioned in 518, and by the 580s they had conquered large areas referred to as Sclavinia (\\"Slavdom\\", from Sklavenoi).\\"Slavyane v rannem srednevekovie\\" Valentin V. Sedov, Archaeological institute of Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, 1995, p. Duklja was settled by Slavs predominantly during the 7th century, although the area was subject to raids by Avars and Slavs from the 6th century. Being a mountainous region, it perhaps served as an area of refuge for pre-Slavic populations.Fine, 1991, p. 37 Prince Vi≈°eslav (fl. 768‚Äì814), the first known Serbian monarch by name, ruled the hereditary lands (≈Ωupanias, \\"counties\\") of Neretva, Tara, Piva, Lim. He managed to unite several more provinces and tribes into what would become the Serbian Principality. Vi≈°eslav was succeeded by his son Radoslav and then Prosigoj, during which time \\"the Serbs inhabit the greater part of Dalmatia\\" (Royal Frankish Annals, 822). Prince Vlastimir further united Serbian tribes against the growing threat from the Bulgarian Empire, his realm spanned over southwestern Serbia, much of Montenegro, eastern Herzegovina and southeastern Bosnia. Prince Petar Gojnikoviƒá defeated Ti≈°emir of Bosnia, annexing the valley of Bosna.The early medieval Balkans, p. 148 He then expanded along the Neretva, annexing the Narentines, where he seems to have come into conflict with Michael Vi≈°eviƒá, a Bulgarian ally and the ruler of Zahumlje (with Trebinje and most of what would later be Duklja).Fine, 1991, p. 149 Michael Vi≈°eviƒá heard of the possible alliance between Serbia and the Byzantines, and warned Symeon. Symeon defeats PetarFine, 1991, p. 150 and in the following years there is a power struggle between the Bulgars and Byzantines over Serbian overlordship.Fine, 1991, p. 141 Prince ƒåaslav ruled over a confederacy of tribes covering an expansive area.The early medieval Balkans, p. 160 He took over regions previously held by Michael, who disappears from sources in 925.The entry of the Slavs into Christendom, p. 209 According to some sources, ƒåaslav's 'state' was based from the hinterland of Kotor. Greek \\"+ Petar archont of Dioklia AMIN\\" (right). After ƒåaslav died in ca. 960, Rascia (the hinterland) was annexed by the Byzantines, and Serbia dissolved into several principalities, and the mentions of the first dynasty end. A Peter, whose seal has been found, was the archon Diokleias probably at the turn of the 11th century. A Serbian diplomatic mission, likely sent from Duklja, arrived at the Byzantine capital of Constantinople and was recorded in a charter of the Great Lavra Monastery, written in 993.Ostrogorsky 1956, pp. 273‚Äì5. In the 11th century, Jovan Vladimir ruled Duklja, with his court centered in Bar on the Adriatic coast; he held much of the Pomorje under his control including Travunija and Zachlumia. His realm may have stretched west- and northwards to include some parts of the Zagorje (inland Serbia and Bosnia) as well. Vladimir's pre-eminent position over other Slavic nobles in the area explains why Emperor Basil approached him for an anti-Bulgarian alliance. With his hands tied by war in Anatolia, Basil required allies for his war against Tsar Samuel, who ruled the Bulgarian empire stretching over Northern Bulgaria, Western Bulgaria, Macedonia, Serbia, Ra≈°ka and Epirus. In retaliation, Samuel invaded Duklja in 1009, and pushed through Dalmatia up to the city of Zadar, incorporating Bosnia and Serbia into his realm. After defeating Vladimir, Samuel reinstated him as a vassal Prince. We do not know what Vladimir's connection was to the previous Serbian dynasty as much of what is written in the Chronicles of the Priest of Duklja about the genealogy of the Doclean rulers is mythological.Fine Vladimir was murdered by Vladislav, Samuel's brother and successor, circa 1016 AD. The last prominent member of his family, his uncle Dragimir, was killed by some local citizens in Kotor in 1018. That same year, the Byzantines had defeated the Bulgarians, and in one masterful stroke re-took virtually the entire Balkans. Rise The Byzantine victory over the Bulgarians was a critical development in Balkan history. The Byzantines ruled most of the Balkans ‚Äì Bulgaria, Serbia, Duklja, and Bosnia all fell back under Byzantine rule for the first time since the 6th century. Over much of the 11th century, we hear very little about events from the interior. Central Serbia was probably under the jurisdiction of the strategos (governor) of Sirmium ‚Äì Constantine Diogenes. Some historians suggest that Duklja was ruled directly by the strategos of Dyrrhachium, while others posit that a native prince (whose name has not survived) was allowed to remain, ruling as a Byzantine vassal. Either way, the Slavic nobility was under Byzantine control. Short-lived as it was, Vladimir's influence in Balkan politics shifted the centre of Serbian rule from inland Serbia to the coast. This was a \\"renewed Serbian state centered on Duklja\\".Hupchik, p. Over much of the 11th century, we hear very little about events from the interior. Central Serbia was probably under the jurisdiction of the strategos (governor) of Sirmium ‚Äì Constantine Diogenes. Some historians suggest that Duklja was ruled directly by the strategos of Dyrrhachium, while others posit that a native prince (whose name has not survived) was allowed to remain, ruling as a Byzantine vassal. Either way, the Slavic nobility was under Byzantine control. In the 1030s, as Skylitzes and Kekaumenos have written, Stefan Vojislav, who held the title of \\"archont, and toparch of the kastra of Dalmatia, Zeta and Ston\\",Kekaumenos, ed Litavrin, 170‚Äì2 led the \\"Serbs who renounced Byzantine rule\\".Fine, p. 202 According to the CPD, he was a nephew of Vladimir. In 1034, he took \\"Duklja\\" while the Byzantines were switching thrones. The Byzantines retaliated by sending in troops from Dyrrhachium and captured Vojislav, who was taken prisoner to Constantinople. He managed to escape and began a guerrilla resistance from Duklja's mountains. He defeated several Byzantine expeditions and liberated most of Duklja. A Slav rebellion centered on Belgrade, organised by Peter Delian in the late 1030s, worked in Vojislav's favour by diverting attention from Duklja. He used this to assert rule from his capital in Scutari, and extended his rule from Duklja to Travunia and a part of Zachlumia. He besieged the Byzantine city of Dyrrhachium and held the lands surrounding it.Fine, 1991, pp. 203, 206‚Äì207 In 1042, another Byzantine attack was defeated. The Byzantines had sent a \\"coalition\\" of vassal Slavic chiefs to fight Voislav. The coalition consisted of the ≈Ωupan of Bosnia, Knez (Prince) Ljutovid of Zachlumia and the ≈Ωupan of Raska. Fine suggests that under Byzantine dominance, \\"Rascia\\" had in the 1040s emerged as yet another Serbian state (roughly centered on what is now southern Serbia and Kosovo. Vojislav won a great victory against his attackers. He overthrew ljutovid and placed the region entirely under his control. Duklja was undoubtedly the leading Slavic state. Principality of Doclea (Duklja) half 11th century. Vojislav probably died in 1043. Of his 5 sons, Mihailo (Michael) eventually secured rule by 1046. He was an apt diplomat, he fostered good relations with the Byzantines by marrying one of the Emperor's relatives, earning himself the title protostrator. He also entered diplomatic relations with the western powers by marrying one of his sons, Constantine Bodin, to the daughter of the Norman governor of Bari. Michael conquered Rascia from the Byzantines in the 1060s and assigned one of his sons, Petrislav as ruler. In 1072, he supported another Slav rebellion in Macedonia by sending a force led by his son Constantine Bodin. After initial success, The Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja claims that Bodin was proclaimed Tsar Peter III of Bulgaria. A Byzantine retaliation, however, resulted in Bodin's capture, only to be freed by Venetian mercenaries hired by his father. Mihailo I of Duklja, the first recognized ruler of Duklja on a fresco in the Church of St. Michael in Ston: He was crowned King of Slavs and known as Ruler of Serbs and Tribals. At some point during his rule, Michael acquired the title of King. Most scholars place this date to 1077, when he received a legate from the Pope referring to him as the King of Slavs. However, Curta suggests that Michael may have been King as early as 1053, since he proclaimed himself 'King' sometime after receiving the protostrator title from the Emperor. However, formal recognition as King in medieval Europe required acknowledgement either from the Pope or the Byzantine Emperor. Either way, he was King by 1077. When Michael died in 1081, he was succeeded by his son Constantine Bodin. The Normans attacked southern Dalmatia, capturing Dyrrhachium and Ragusa. Bodin was expected to aid the Emperor at Dyrrhachium, instead he remained idle (possibly as part of a pre- conceived plan with the Normans) and watched the Byzantines get utterly defeated. During his early rule, energy spent consolidating his rule and meddling with Byzantine-Norman matters diverted Bodin's attention from other parts of his realm. The \\"Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja\\" notes that Bodin sent expedition into Bosnia and Rascia. Since his father, Michael, had already captured Raska earlier, it must have slipped out of Duklja's control. Bodin successfully marched against Raska and placed his cousins Vukan and Marko (the sons of Petrislav) as ≈æupans. He also captured Bosnia, and placed one of his courtiers, Stipan, to rule in his name. Although Bodin was recognised as 'King of Duklja and Dalmatia, there is no evidence to suggest that Bosnia, Zachlumia, Duklja and Rascia were incorporated into an integrated kingdom. Each region retained its own hereditary nobility, but were under the political and military sway of Duklja. 1080 AD. The zenith of Dukljan power By 1085 the Byzantines got the upper hand in their wars with the Normans, recapturing Dyrrachium and Ragusa. In 1090, they punished Bodin for his impudence, possibly capturing him for the second time, and not much is known about him subsequently until he dies in c. 1101. Raska, Zahumlje and Bosnia probably broke free from Dukljan vassalage. In the 10th century, following the Synod of Split, Split gained jurisdiction over much of the Dalmatian coast, except southern regions (including most of Duklja), which were under the Archbisphopric of Dyrrhachium. However, Split's pre-eminent position was soon challenged by other cities vying for metropolinate status ‚Äì Bar and Dubrovnik (Ragusa). The East-West Schism would soon have a great impact upon Serbia, not only religiously, but also politically. Since Serbia was positioned at the border zone between Roman and Constantinopolitan jurisdiction, Serb rulers tried to exploit this rivalry to their advantage. The Slavs who lived along the southern Dalmatian coast fell under the religious jurisdiction of Rome, via the Archbishops of Split, Bar and Ragusa. The rest, in the hinterland stretching to Serbia, were under the Patriarch of Constantinople via the Archbishops of Ohrid, Sirmium and Dyrrhachium. King Mihailo's prerogative was to establish an autocephalous Slavic Church ‚Äì an independent state requires an independent church. For political reasons, he turned to Rome, since at the time he was in less than amicable relations with Byzantium. Michael presumed that the Pope would jump at the chance to expand his jurisdiction in southern Dalmatia, but Michael's wish was not easily forthcoming. Although some studies have stated that his request to raise Bar to an Archbishopric was granted in 1067, it seems that the cited bull is not authentic. In 1089, Constantine Bodin managed to raise the bishopric of Bar to an Archbishopric, by supporting the pope against an antipope. The suffragan bishops were to be: Kotor, Ulcinj, Svaƒç, Skadar, Drivast, Pula, Ras, Bosnia and Trebinje.Fine, 1991, p. 223 In obtaining its promotion, it acquired a much larger diocese, including territory that earlier had not been under the pope ‚Äì territories of the metropolitan of Durazzo and Archbishop of Ochrid, two sees that recognized the jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. The Bar Archbishopric's new territory were merely theoretical ‚Äì the pope's edict could only affect the churches that recognized Rome. Making Rascia a suffragan to Bar had little meaning, as most of its churches were under Constantinople, and there is no evidence of Vukan changing adherence to Rome. Durazzo and Ochrid may have suffered minimal territorial losses along the coast, Duklja was briefly a subject to Rome, however inland Duklja was not affected, and along with much of Duklja's coast (like most of Kotor) was to retain its loyalty to Orthodoxy. Decline With Bodin gone, his Norman wife, Jaquinta, feared that Bodin's nephew, Branislav, would try to seize power before her young children could take the throne. She ordered the arrest of Branislav and his family and Branislav died in captivity, while his other 6 brothers and sons found asylum in Ragusa. Thus in the haste to claim the throne, seeds of family hatred were planted among the extended family. After Bodin died, his half-brother Dobroslav II gained the throne of Duklja. Seeing a weak Duklja, the Byzantines started to meddle, sending Koƒçopar, one of Branislav's exiled brothers to capture the throne. He managed to get assistance from Vukan of Ra≈°ka, and together they beat Dobroslav. However, there was a falling out between Koƒçopar and Vukan. Vukan drove out Koƒçopar, who then died in exile. The Doclean nobles then elected a Vladimir, yet another relative, who ruled in peace as a Byzantine vassal. But Jaquinta had not given up. After Vladimir died, she had Dobroslav II (who was still in jail) castrated and blinded in case he were to gain the throne, thus securing the throne for her son ƒêuraƒë (George), c. 1114‚Äì18. She had gained support from an anti-Byzantine faction of nobles. Branislav's family again fled to Byzantine safety, this time in Dyrrhachium. There they gained support from the Byzantines, who ousted ƒêuraƒë and imprisoned Jaquinta. Grube≈°a, one of Branislav's sons, was placed on the throne in 1118. He ruled peacefully until 1125. ƒêuraƒë had fled to Rascia, and secured the support of the new Rascian Grand ≈Ωupan, Uro≈°, believed to be the nephew of Vukan. Uro≈° was aligned with the Hungarians, and was anti-Byzantine. He invaded Duklja and placed ƒêuraƒë back on the throne. Yet another Byzantine intervention ousted ƒêuraƒë for the second time, capturing him, and he died in captivity. Gradinja, one of Grube≈°a's brothers was then placed as King, the last ruler to hold such a title in Duklja. He died a natural death in 1146, and was succeeded by his son Radoslav. Radoslav only bore the title Knez (Prince). Duklja's long internecine strife was devastating for its status, as it was reduced back to a Principality dependent on Byzantine support, and was increasingly losing territory to Raska. By the time of Radoslav's reign as prince, he only held a small strip of land on the Dukljan coast (From Kotor to Ulcinj). By 1166, much of Duklja was occupied by Rascia, and in 1186, Stefan Nemanja annexed Duklja in its entirety after defeating the last Doclean prince ‚Äì Mihailo.

SOCA was a national law enforcement agency with Home Office sponsorship, established as a body corporate under Section 1 of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005. It operated within the United Kingdom and collaborated (through its network of international offices) with many foreign law enforcement and intelligence agencies. The Agency was formed following a merger of the National Crime Squad, the National Criminal Intelligence Service (elements of which were incorporated into AVCIS), the National Hi-Tech Crime Unit (NHTCU), the investigative and intelligence sections of HM Revenue & Customs on serious drug trafficking, and the Immigration Service's responsibilities for organised immigration crime. The Assets Recovery Agency became part of SOCA in 2008, while the Serious Fraud Office remained a separate agency. SOCA Officers could be designated the powers of a constable, customs officer or immigration officer and/or any combination of these three sets of powers. The Director General of SOCA (or his designate) was responsible for determining which powers were given to members of staff which could be altered depending on the nature of the investigation.Legislation.gov.uk Those police powers requiring a constable to be in uniform could not be exercised by SOCA Officers as the agency was non- uniformed. SOCA operated with greater powers in England and Wales than in Scotland and Northern Ireland and as such worked with the Scottish Crime and Drug Enforcement Agency and the Organised Crime Task Force (Northern Ireland), which shared some of its functions in their respective jurisdictions. In June 2011, the coalition government announced that SOCA's operations would be merged into a larger National Crime Agency to launch in 2013. The new agency, created through the Crime and Courts Act 2013, commenced operations on 7 October 2013. Overview The creation of the agency was announced on 9 February 2004 as one of the elements of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005, which also restricts protests and demonstrations in central London, and alters powers of arrest and the use of search warrants. According to Home Office figures organised crime costs the UK around ¬£20 billion each year, with some estimates putting the figure as high as ¬£40 billion.Home Office figures on organised crime SOCA had a national remit and the role of the agency was to support individual Police forces in the investigation of crime and conduct independent investigations with regard to serious organised crime. SOCA was an agency which had the role of \\"reducing harm\\", not specifically the arrest and conviction of offenders. Elements of the media attempted to draw parallels between the organisation and the Federal Bureau of Investigation of the United States: indeed, parts of the press labelled SOCA the \\"British FBI.\\" SOCA was subject to similar internal and external governance mechanisms as the police service. The SOCA Professional Standards Department was responsible for receiving, investigating and monitoring the progress of public complaints about the misconduct of SOCA officers. Serious complaints regarding SOCA were dealt with by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) now the Independent Office of Police Conduct (IOPC).IPCC to oversee public complaints against SOCA The IPCC would decide the appropriate method of investigation. In general terms, the IPCC would handle complaints against SOCA officers in the same manner as complaints against police officers or officers of HMRC. The Police Ombudsman of Northern Ireland (PONI) dealt with complaints in Northern Ireland. In Scotland, this was the responsibility of the Lord Advocate. There was also a bespoke inspection regime for SOCA, provided through Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC).FAQ's Serious and Organised Crime Website Governance The agency was an executive non-departmental public body sponsored by, but operationally independent from, the Home Office. It was funded by the UK's central government, with a provisional budget for 2006/7 of ¬£457m, of which ¬£416m funded on-going resources and ¬£41m was capital investment. At formation it was intended to have around 4,200 employees, of which 400 were support staff. Of the remaining workforce, half would be criminal investigators and the other half would focus on analysis and intelligence. SOCA co-operated closely with the police, intelligence agencies, HM Revenue and Customs, foreign police forces and others. SOCA was led by a board comprising non-executive and executive members. The founding non- executive chairman, responsible for the overall approach of the Agency, was Sir Stephen Lander, former Director General of the Security Service (MI5). Lander was succeeded by Sir Ian Andrews, a former MOD Civil Servant. The other original non-executive directors of the board were Stephen Barrett, Elizabeth France, Ken Jarrold, Janet Paraskeva and General Sir Roger Wheeler. Prior to closure, the non-executive directors were Peter Clarke, Sue Garrard, Francis Plowden and Dr Martyn Thomas. The original executive directors of the board were David Bolt, Malcolm Cornberg, Paul Evans and Trevor Pearce, and today they are Malcolm Cornberg, Paul Evans, Trevor Pearce and Brad Jones. The agency's headquarters were in Victoria, not far from New Scotland Yard. There was also an office in Vauxhall, South London, not far from the Palace of Westminster and the SIS Building. The founding Director General was Bill Hughes, formerly of the National Crime Squad. Hughes retired in 2010 and was succeeded by Trevor Pearce, who until then was Executive Director of SOCA's Enforcement Directorate. The board directed that around 40% of its effort should be devoted to combating drug trafficking, 25% to tackling organised immigration crime, around 10% to fraud, 15% on other organised crime and the remaining 10% on supporting other law enforcement agencies. Organisation The organisation was split into three major directorates: *Strategy and Prevention - Responsible for driving SOCA strategy and reflecting government priorities. Bringing together those functions focussed on preventative activity with partners such as disruption of criminal activities and denial of assets. *Operational Delivery - Responsible for identifying how and where the desired impact and response can be achieved, planning and executing operations and the subsequent criminal justice and other disruptive interventions. *Capability and Service Delivery - Supporting activities The Agency had to deal with the effects of significant budget cuts that have affected both its strategy for dealing with organised crime and its ability to retain experienced police officers. The Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (CEOP) operated as an independent component of SOCA and was staffed by SOCA officers. The task of online child protection had previously been (in part) the responsibility of the NHTCU. CEOP recently announced the opening of the CEOP Academy, designed to be a centre of excellence in this area of law enforcement.CEOP Academy CEOP works in conjunction with New Scotland Yard Child Abuse Investigation Command which has its own hi-tech unit.Child Abuse Investigation Command ‚Äì New Scotland Yard On 1 April 2012, the Missing Persons Bureau, Central Witness Bureau, Specialist Operations Centre, Crime Operational Support and Serious Crime Analysis Section transferred from the National Policing Improvement Agency to SOCA, as an interim measure ahead of the proposed establishment of the National Crime Agency in 2013. CEOP became an independent command of the National Crime Agency when it began operations on 7 October 2013. Operations=National Central Bureau SOCA acted as the UK point of contact for Interpol, Europol and the Schengen Information System. In this capacity SOCA maintained the following functions: * Single point of contact for International enquiries from SOCA and all UK Police and law enforcement agencies. * 24/7 capacity for Interpol with direct connections to their databases and provides a specialist service to Europol through Europol Liaison Officers. * Coordination of all inbound and outbound Cross Border Surveillance requests with Schengen partners. * Dedicated Fugitives Unit that acts as the UK Central Authority for all European Arrest Warrants (EAW). Serious Crime Analysis Section (SCAS) The Serious Crime Analysis Section moved to SOCA from the National Policing Improvement Agency on 1 April 2012 in advance of the planned establishment of the National Crime Agency in 2013. SCAS is based at Foxley Hall in the grounds of the Police Staff College, Bramshill in Hampshire. It was originally formed by the Home Office in 1998 to identify the potential emergence of serial killers and serial rapists at the earliest stage of their offending. This scope has since broadened to include the analysis by specialist staff of rapes, serious sexual assaults and motiveless or sexually motivated murders. Criminal case files are received by SCAS from all police forces in the UK at an early stage in the investigations. The information is coded and placed on a single database, ViCLAS (Violent Crime Linkage Analysis System). The system was developed in Canada by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. The investigating officer receives a report from a crime analyst with a number of key elements designed to assist the investigation. It will identify if there are grounds to believe that the offender has previously been identified. It will also provide a breakdown of the behaviour exhibited in the offence, often with a statistical description of some of the elements involved. This can alert an investigator to the importance of some aspects of the offence not immediately apparent. SCAS are also responsible for identifying good practice, or \\"what works\\", so the analyst's report may contain \\"investigative suggestions\\" that might guide the officer to a specific line of enquiry not yet considered. The report may also suggest possible suspects that the unit has identified from a number of databases. When a prime suspect has been identified and charged with an offence, senior analysts are able to provide specialist evidence in court, to assist with the prosecution of offenders. Crime Operational Support The Crime Operational Support unit also moved to SOCA, and provides specialist operational skills and to assist in the resolution of exceptional crime series and operational critical incidents. Four regional teams of investigative advisers support regional investigations, and are themselves supported by the specialist skills of crime investigation officers, behavioural investigative advisers and geographic profilers. The unit identifies best practice in investigations, and makes these known through workshops and seminars. Missing Persons Bureau The Missing Persons Bureau (MPB) transferred to SOCA in April 2012 along with SCAS. It had previously been based at New Scotland Yard until April 2008 when it was moved to the NPIA and based in Bramshill. The bureau acts as the centre for the exchange of information connected with the search for missing persons nationally and internationally. It is responsible for cross-matching missing persons with unidentified persons or bodies, as well as maintaining an index of dental records of missing persons and unidentified bodies. The MPB also manages a missing persons and Child Rescue Alert website, and analyses data to identify trends and patterns in disappearances. National Injuries Database The National Injuries Database also transferred from the NPIA. It provides additional support to police forces by providing analysis of weapons and wounds, and seeking to identify similarities to aid investigators in determining which weapon may have been used. The database holds over 4,000 cases of suspicious deaths, murders and clinical cases, and contains over 20,000 images. Money laundering SOCA via the UK Financial Intelligence Unit took over responsibility for dealing with suspicious activity reports (SARs), previously made to the National Criminal Intelligence Service (NCIS) under the money laundering legislation. NCIS received just under 200,000 SARs in 2005 and throughout its active life was widely critical of the banking and financial services sector, and the Financial Services Authority, for not being more transparent or forthcoming in reporting their customers suspicious activity. Despite criticism from professional representative bodies that the disclosure rules are too broad, SOCA has said that up to one in three SARs lead to or add substantially to terrorism investigations; that HMRC estimates that around one in five SARs identifies new subjects of interest, and one in four SARs lead to direct tax enquiries; and that many arrests and confiscations of criminal assets. The Assets Recovery Agency became part of the Serious Organised Crime Agency from April 2008. The power to launch civil recovery proceedings has been extended to the three main prosecutors in England and Wales; the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), the Revenue and Customs Prosecutions Office (RCPO) and the Serious Fraud Office (SFO). It will also be extended to the Public Prosecution Service in Northern Ireland and the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service in Scotland.Proposed merger of the Assets Recovery Agency and the Serious Organised Crime Agency Computer crime Officers from the former National Hi-Tech Crime Unit (NHTCU) became SOCA's e-crime unit. However, the remit of this unit is much narrower than that of the body it replaced. In particular, the NHTCU had established a confidentiality charter to encourage victims of computer crime to contact the police in confidence, because many corporate victims in particular do not report attacks due to fears of bad publicity. The loss of the confidentiality charter has been widely criticised. although similar protection is now provided by the same Act of Parliament used to create SOCA. The Metropolitan Police is to help bridge the gap left by the disbandment of the NHTCU through an expansion of its Computer Unit and the formation of the Police Central e-crime Unit (PCeU), which will work closely with the new National Fraud Reporting Centre (NFRC) from 2009.Government pledges funding for e-crime unit ‚Äì 30 Sep 2008 ‚Äì Computer Weekly Website outages The SOCA public information website, hosted by a third party, was subjected to a number of Distributed denial-of-service attack (DDOS) attacks.

The character was created by writer Steve Gerber and artist Val Mayerik. Howard the Duck first appeared in Adventure into Fear #19 (cover-dated Dec. 1973) and several subsequent series have chronicled the misadventures of the ill-tempered, anthropomorphic \\"funny animal\\" trapped on a human-dominated Earth. Echoing this, the most common tagline of his comics reads 'Trapped In a World He Never Made!' Howard's adventures are generally social satires, while a few are parodies of genre fiction with a metafictional awareness of the medium. The book is existentialist, and its main joke, according to Gerber, is that there is no joke: \\"... that life's most serious moments and most incredibly dumb moments are often distinguishable only by a momentary point of view.\\" This is diametrically opposed to screenwriter Gloria Katz, who, in adapting the comic to the screen, declared, \\"It's a film about a duck from outer space ... It's not supposed to be an existential experience\\". Howard the Duck was portrayed by Ed Gale and voiced by Chip Zien in the 1986 Howard the Duck film adaptation, and was later voiced by Seth Green in the films Guardians of the Galaxy and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, both set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The character also made a nonspeaking cameo appearance in Avengers: Endgame. Publication history Howard the Duck's first appearance in Adventure into Fear #19 (Dec. 1973). Art by penciler Val Mayerik and inker Sal Trapani. Howard the Duck was created by writer Steve Gerber and penciler Val Mayerik in Adventure into Fear #19 (Dec. 1973) as a secondary character in that comic's \\"Man-Thing\\" feature. He graduated to his own backup feature in Giant-Size Man-Thing #4‚Äì5 (May and Aug. 1975), confronting such bizarre horror-parody characters as Garko the Man-Frog and Bessie the Hellcow, before acquiring his own comic book title with Howard the Duck #1 in 1976.Sanderson \\"1970s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 174: \\"Gerber and artist Frank Brunner quickly brought Howard back ... in his own comic book.\\" Gerber wrote 27 issues of the series (for the most part ditching the horror parodies), illustrated by a variety of artists, beginning with Frank Brunner. For Gerber, Howard was a flesh and blood duck and that, \\"If Wile E. Coyote gets run over by a steamroller, the result is a pancake-flat coyote who can be expected to snap back to three dimensions within moments; if Howard gets run over by a steamroller, the result is blood on asphalt.\\" Gene Colan became the regular penciller with issue #4. Gerber later said to Colan: \\"There really was almost a telepathic connection there. I would see something in my mind, and that is what you would draw! I've never had that experience with another artist before or since.\\" Sporting the slogan \\"Get Down, America!\\", the All- Night Party was a fictional political party that appeared in Gerber's Howard the Duck series during the U.S. Presidential campaign of 1976,Sanderson \\"1970s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 177: \\"Howard the Duck ended up being nominated as [a] presidential candidate!\\" and led to Howard the Duck allegedly receiving thousands of write-in votes in the actual election. Gerber addressed questions about the campaign in the letters column of the comic book and, as Mad Genius Associates, sold merchandise publicizing the campaign. Marvel attempted a spin-off with a short-lived Howard the Duck newspaper comic strip from 1977 to 1978, at first written by Gerber and drawn by Colan and Mayerik, later written by Marv Wolfman and drawn by Alan Kupperberg. Gerber gained a degree of creative autonomy when he became the comic series' editor in addition to his usual writing duties. With issue #16, unable to meet the deadline for his regular script, Gerber substituted an entire issue of text pieces and illustrations satirizing his own difficulties as a writer.Howard the Duck #16 at the Grand Comics Database The Walt Disney Company contacted Marvel in 1977 over concerns that the visual design of Howard infringed on their trademark for Donald Duck. Marvel agreed to a redesign of the character by Disney artists. A key feature of the redesign was that the character would wear pants. In 1978, Gerber was removed from the newspaper strip and the comic-book series due to chronic problems with deadlines. His final issue of the comic- book series was #27 (September 1978). The series continued for four more issues with stories by Marv Wolfman, Mary Skrenes, Mark Evanier, and Bill Mantlo. The final episode of the newspaper strip was published on October 29, 1978. Issue #31 (May 1979) of the comic-book series announced on its letters page that it would be the final issue of Howard the Duck as a color comic. Marvel then relaunched the series that year as a bimonthly magazine, with scripts by Mantlo, art by Colan and Michael Golden and unrelated backup features by others. The magazine was canceled after nine issues. On August 29, 1980, after learning of Marvel's efforts to license Howard for use in film and broadcast media, Steve Gerber filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against Marvel corporate parent Cadence Industries and other parties, alleging that he was the sole owner of the character. This was one of the first highly publicized creator's rights cases in American comics, and attracted support from major industry figures, some of whom created homage/parody stories with Gerber to fund a lawsuit against Marvel; these included Destroyer Duck with Jack Kirby. The lawsuit was settled on September 24, 1982, with Gerber acknowledging that his work on the character was done as work-for-hire and that Marvel parent Cadence Industries owned \\"all right, title and interest\\" to Howard the Duck and the Howard material he had produced. On November 5, 1982, Judge David Kenyon approved the motion and dismissed the case. The only new story featuring the character between 1981 and 1986 appeared in Bizarre Adventures #34 (1983) Scripted by Steven Grant, it featured a suicidal Howard being put through a parody of It's a Wonderful Life. The original comic book series reappeared with issue #32 (January 1986). It featured a story that had been written by Grant four years earlier. Steve Gerber had submitted a script for the issue, but withdrew after it had been revised to conform to editorial guidelines. Issue #33 (October 1986), scripted by Christopher Stager, featured a parody of the film Bride of Frankenstein. Howard co-creator Val Mayerik co- plotted the story and provided the art. It was released alongside an adaptation of the Howard the Duck feature film, which was published in Marvel Super Special #41 (November 1986) and a three-issue comic-book series. Gerber returned to Howard in 1989 in The Sensational She-Hulk #14‚Äì17. The character was again living with Beverly Switzler, now working as a rent-a-ninja. How they got back together was never explained. Beverly was not involved in the story in which She-Hulk takes Howard on a trip through several dimensions with a theoretical physicist from Empire State University. Gerber's next story featuring Howard appeared in Spider-Man Team-Up #5 (December 1996), around the same time he was writing a \\"Savage Dragon/Destroyer Duck\\" crossover for Image. He had the idea to create an unofficial crossover between the two issues, where the characters would meet momentarily in the shadows, but which would not affect either story. Soon after, Gerber discovered that Howard was scheduled to appear in Ghost Rider vol. 3, #81 (Jan. 1997) alongside Devil Dinosaur and Moon Boy, and issues of Generation X, as well as the three issue Daydreamers miniseries by J.M. DeMatteis. Gerber was not pleased with this development, and changed the \\"unofficial crossover\\" somewhat. In Spider-Man Team-Up #5, Spider-Man, Beverly and Howard meet the Elf with a Gun and two shadowy figures (presumed to be Savage Dragon and Destroyer Duck) in a darkened warehouse, grab a disc, then leave shortly afterwards. But in the Savage Dragon/Destroyer Duck crossover comic, Elf with a Gun creates thousands of clones of Howard and Beverly during a fierce battle. As Savage Dragon and Destroyer Duck escape the warehouse, they reveal that they rescued the \\"real\\" Howard and Beverly, while Spider-Man left with two of the clones. Howard has his feathers dyed green, and is renamed \\"Leonard the Duck\\", and Beverly has her hair dyed black and is renamed \\"Rhonda Martini\\". Leonard later had a cameo appearance in Savage Dragon #41, and Leonard and Rhonda have a single-panel cameo when they meet Gerber's Nevada in Vertigo Comics' Winter's Edge #2. In 2001, when Marvel launched its MAX imprint of \\"mature readers\\" comics, Gerber returned to write a six-issue Howard the Duck miniseries illustrated by Phil Winslade and Glenn Fabry. Featuring several familiar Howard the Duck characters, the series, like the original one, parodied a wide range of other comics and pop culture figures, but with considerably stronger language and sexual content than what would have been allowable 25 years earlier. The series has Doctor Bong causing Howard to go through multiple changes of form, principally into a mouse (as a parody of Mickey Mouse, in retaliation for the Disney-mandated redesign), and entering a chain of events parodying comics such as Witchblade, Preacher and several others, with Howard ultimately having a conversation with God in Hell. Howard had cameo appearances in She-Hulk (vol. 2) #9 in February 2005 and in She-Hulk vol. 3 #3/#100 in February 2006 (issue #3 was also the numbered as the 100th total issue of all the various She-Hulk series). In 2007, he returned in Howard the Duck vol. 4 #1-4, a miniseries by writer Ty Templeton and artist Juan Bobillo. This series was rated for ages 9 and up, though one issue was published with a Marvel Zombies tie-in cover with a parental advisory claim. In November 2014, Marvel announced an ongoing series starting in March 2015 featuring Howard as a private investigator on Earth. The creative team consisted of writer Chip Zdarsky and artist Joe Quinones. Howard the Duck (vol. 5) ran for 5 issues before Marvel relaunched many of their existing titles with the All-New, All- Different Marvel line of comics. This led to a reboot produced by the same creative team starting with Howard the Duck (vol. 6) #1 in November 2015.James Whitbrook (2015-06-29). \\"Marvel Just Revealed Its Entire \\"All-New, All- Different\\" Comic Universe\\". Io9.com. Retrieved 2020-07-12. This series included a two-part crossover with The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl. The 11th and last issue was released in October 2016. Fictional character biography Howard's first appearance in comics is when he is abruptly abducted from his home planet by an unseen force and randomly dropped into the Florida Everglades by the demon-lord Thog the Nether-Spawn. He meets the Man-Thing, who had been attacked by Korrek of Katharta, and the three of them are confronted by warriors of the Congress of Realities. He then meets Dakimh the Enchanter and Dakimh banishes the warriors and transports Howard, Man-Thing, and Korrek to his castle, where they are joined by Jennifer Kale. They then travel to the realm of Therea and destroy Thog the Nether-Spawn. Howard then accidentally falls off the inter-dimensional stepping stones that the group were traveling on and materializes in Cleveland, Ohio, where he battles Garko the Man-Frog. Howard is arrested at this time for disturbing the peace and is mistaken for a mutant during a strip search, but is released because the police fear he has mutant abilities. Howard also briefly encounters and kills a vampiric cow named Bessie the Hellcow. Howard makes friends with an artists' model named Beverly Switzler and a bizarre series of encounters follow. He battles Pro-Rata, the cosmic accountant, then meets Spider-Man at the end of the battle. He battles Turnip-Man and the Kidney Lady, who would become a semi-recurring character over the years, then learns the fictional martial art of \\"Quack-Fu\\". Howard then encounters the Winky Man, who is actually the sleepwalking alter-ego of Beverly's artist friend, Paul Same, who would become a series regular and later become the pair's roommate. Howard also briefly becomes a wrestler. Howard and Beverly hit the road, seeking shelter in a gothic mansion where they battle a girl named Patsy and her giant, animated- to-life gingerbread man. They eventually end up in New York City, where Howard is nominated for President of the United States by the All-Night Party and he later battles the Band of the Bland, alongside the Defenders. A doctored-photo scandal leads him to Canada where he defeats a supervillain, the Beaver, who caused the scandal. The Beaver falls to his death in a battle with Howard. Howard then suffers a nervous breakdown and flees Bev and their situation on a bus. Unfortunately, the bus' passengers are all believers in various weird cults, and try to interest Howard in them. His seatmates are Winda Wester and the Kidney Lady, a woman who believes that the soul of a person lives in their kidneys and attempts to stop anything she sees as \\"anti-kidney health.\\" After the bus crashes, Howard and Winda are sent to a mental institution. There he meets Daimon Hellstrom, and is briefly possessed by Hellstrom's demonic soul, becoming the new Son of Satan. Beverly and Paul manage to get them both back to Cleveland. Later, while on the S. S. Damned, a cruise ship returning from scenic Bagmom, Howard and Beverly are taken captive by Lester Verde. Verde had known Beverly in college and had a crush on her and had assumed the identity of the supervillain Doctor Bong, who illegally marries Beverly against her will and transforms Howard into a human. After escaping back to New York and being restored to his natural form, Howard is hired as a dishwasher by Beverly's uncle, Lee Switzler. Howard is later reunited with Dakihm the Enchanter, the Man-Thing, Korrek and Jennifer Kale, and they all battle the demon Bzzk'Joh. Korrek pilots the ship the Epoch Weasel and drops Howard back off at Cleveland before he and their allies fly away. Howard finally meets up with the cruise ship that rescued Paul and Winda from Doctor Bong, and finds that Paul and Winda have befriended socialite Iris Raritan. Howard is later kidnapped by the Ringmaster and his Circus of Crime. Winda is abandoned by Paul and Iris and Paul is shot and left in a coma. After defeating the Circus of Crime, Howard is plagued by pessimistic dreams and goes his way alone, just as he had at the series' beginning. Writer Bill Mantlo, beginning with issue #30, returned the series to its former status quo, bringing Beverly back into the picture and having her divorce Doctor Bong. Howard's creator Steve Gerber, who left the series after issue #27, originally intended for Beverly and Bong's marriage to be lasting and for Beverly to be written out of the series from that point on. Howard and Beverly's friend Paul, who had ended up in a coma after he had previously been shot by the Ringmaster, awakens from his coma and is released from the hospital. Beverly's uncle Lee brings everyone back to Cleveland and employs Howard as a cab driver, while Paul, back to being a somnambulist after his release from the hospital, becomes Winda's boyfriend. Howard dons a suit of \\"Iron Duck\\" armor made by Claude Starkowitz, a man who has delusions of being related to Tony Stark and dreams of being the personal armorer to Iron Man, and battles Doctor Bong in the final issue of the original 70s Howard the Duck series (issue #31). Howard later encounters Dracula and even once returns to Duckworld. At the end of the nine-issue magazine series, Howard leaves Beverly (at her request) and is later offered a genetically-constructed female duck mate, whom he does not take to. On a later occasion, She-Hulk accidentally pulls Howard though a cosmic wormhole along with theoretical physicist Brent Wilcox and they are able to prevent other universes from crowding out Earth-616. During this time, Howard meets a character called the Critic, travels to a dimension known as the Baloneyverse and again battles a group called the Band of the Bland, whom he had previously battled with the Defenders. In an encounter with Peter Parker and Ben Reilly (the then-current Spider-Man), Howard gets a rematch with the Circus of Crime and the Circus is defeated. During the fight, Howard and Beverly get stuck in a warehouse full of anthropomorphic ducks, briefly meeting the Savage Dragon and Destroyer Duck. Parker and Reilly leave the warehouse believing that they have the correct versions of Howard and Beverly with them. However, in the Savage Dragon/Destroyer Duck companion story that takes place simultaneously and that was written by Gerber, it is explained that the version of Howard and Beverly that left the warehouse with Parker and Reilly are simply clones taken by mistake and that the real Howard and Beverly actually left the scene with Savage Dragon and Destroyer Duck . The sorceress Jennifer Kale, in a weekly attempt to return Howard to his home world, inadvertently teleports Devil Dinosaur and Moon-Boy into her New York apartment. The disoriented dinosaur attempts to eat Howard, but spits him out when shot with John Blaze's hellfire gun. Devil Dinosaur and Moon-Boy then rampage through the city before being subdued by Ghost Rider (Daniel Ketch). Howard says that he relates to the pair being trapped in a world they never made before wandering off. Heroes Reborn After a brief series of adventures with Generation X, Howard gets a job as a department store Santa Claus, which gets him dragged to the North Pole where the real Santa Claus has sold out to HYDRA. Howard goes through several dimensions, apparently through the power of Man-Thing, who can now talk but does not understand this new, unknown ability, and lands on a version of Duckworld where his parents are essentially Ward and June Cleaver, he has a sister named Princess, and he is regarded as a hero because his activities on Earth-616 were recognized by Duckworld's version of Reed Richards. This origin traces the source of these dimensions to be projections from Franklin's mind. Throughout the course of the adventure, Howard has a romance with Tana Nile, culminating in a kiss, after which he apologizes and tells her of his attachment to Beverly. When Franklin understands that he has shaped all of these worlds, the group finds themselves back in the Man-Thing's swamp. While Man-Thing becomes a self-appointed guardian to Franklin Richards, Howard goes off on his own and is captured by the Cult of Entropy, who wrap him in swaddling clothes. Although last seen in the swamp, Howard states that he was thrown into baggage and transported on a plane. The cult wants Howard because he has part of the Nexus of All Realities, which shattered during Heroes Reborn, inside of him. Man-Thing then enters Howard's mouth, and Howard vomits him back out with the fragment, but Man-Thing is left desiccated and practically dead. Howard then encounters Namor, who thought he had slain Man- Thing, but Howard explains that he would not be lugging his friend's body around if that were the case. Howard sets the Man-Thing down in the water, and he revives during Howard's conversation with Namor. Once he sees that the Man- Thing is alive and well, he bids Namor farewell and says that he is returning to Cleveland. Years later, back with Beverly, he undergoes further shapeshifting experiences after an accident at a chemical facility of Doctor Bong's. Beverly is hired by Bong's Globally Branded Content Corporation, which manufactures boy bands from protein vats based on the sexual arousal of a focus group of gay men. Attempting to destroy an escapee whom Beverly has taken in, Bong inadvertently knocks Howard into a vat, which changes him, unstably, into a rat. When Howard later showers, he changes his form multiple times before again permanently returning to the form of the giant rat. Verde then goes to the press and claims that his building was attacked by Osama el- Barka (\\"Osama the Duck\\" in Arabic). Howard and Beverly are sent back on the road after the junkyard office where they are living is destroyed by a S.W.A.T. team. Denied admittance to every possible shelter due to lack of funds, the pair and their dog find a sign for the Boarding House of Mystery, but are taken to the police station for questioning and strip searches by Suzy Pazuzu, with whom Beverly had attended high school. One of the officers on the case is the same beat cop who mistook Howard for a mutant many years before. Suzy is the inheritor of the doucheblade, which starts to take her over when she wears an enchanted bracelet. In a skirmish, the bracelet is caught by Howard causing him to be the wielder of the doucheblade. The doucheblade causes its holder to grow enormous bare breasts and armor in a parody of Witchblade, and, possessed by this, Howard kills the male lover of a businessman who works with Verde as he and Verde break into Suzy's house. Arriving at the Boarding House of Mystery, Howard and Beverly encounter Cain and Abel, the latter with a rock stuck in his head that allows him only moments of lucidity. There, they are granted their every wish, including Howard's return to his true form, and Beverly never being poor again, and meet parodies of John Constantine, Wesley Dodds, the Endless, Spider Jerusalem, and Gerber's own Nevada (called Utah), all characters from DC Comics' Vertigo imprint. The downside to the House is that everyone staying there gets their every wish; so Che Guevara can have his revolution, but someone else can easily slaughter him. One tenant, a writer named Mr. Gommorah (a parody of Spider Jerusalem), later takes Beverly and Howard to be on the Iprah show with the topic \\"Why Women Give It to Men Who Don't Get It\\", guest starring Dr. Phlip. Upon leaving the House of Mystery, Howard is once again transformed into an anthropomorphic mouse. It is revealed that Iprah has been merged with an experiment by the Angel Gabriel called Deuteronomy, intended to replace God, because God has been spending all his time in a bar in Hell since 1938. Deuteronomy is a creature half-id and half-superego, while Iprah is an all-ego promoter of self-indulgent pop psychology. Considering her dangerous, Gabriel sends the cherub Thrasher to resurrect Sigmund Freud, whose cigar blasts out half of Thrasher's brains (being immortal, this just makes him act drunk). Iprah destroys Freud, but Howard blasts her with the cigar, separating her from Deuteronomy. Puffing on the cigar, Howard disintegrates and arrives in Hell. He is eventually freed by Yah, a being who claims to be \\"God\\". Civil War Sometime later, Howard attempts to register under the Superhero Registration Act during the superhero Civil War, but learns his socially disrupted life has created so many bureaucratic headaches that the government's official policy is that Howard does not exist. This lack of government oversight delights him: \\"For the rest of my life, no more parking tickets, or taxes, or jury duty. Heck, I couldn't even vote if I wanted to!\\" In this story, Howard says he was pressured to give up his cigars. After he defeats the supervillain M.O.D.O.T.‚Äôs (Mobile Organism Designed Only for Talking) scheme to control the public through mass media, his attorney, Jennifer Walters, successfully restores his citizenship, including all relevant responsibilities. Secret Invasion Howard the Duck is briefly seen as part of the superpowered army gathered to battle invading Skrull forces. He is seen armed with a pistol and wearing a Skrull's hand around his neck. He is later seen kicking a Skrull during interrogation after the invasion. Brian Michael Bendis has commented when asked of Howard: \\"That character has shown up in six issues I've done, and I've never typed the words Howard the Duck.\\" Marvel Zombies 5 In Marvel Zombies 5, Howard the Duck of Earth-616 teams up with Machine Man to travel across the multiverse fighting zombies. Fear Itself During the Fear Itself storyline, Howard forms a team called the Fearsome Four with She-Hulk, Frankenstein's Monster and Nighthawk to stop the Man-Thing when he goes on a rampage in Manhattan, due to the fear and chaos he senses on the citizens. They later discover a plot by Psycho-Man to use the Man-Thing's volatile empathy to create a weapon. Spider-Man: Back in Quack Howard and Beverly are brainwashed and forced to work for Save Our Offspring From Indecency (S.O.O.F.I.) as Cynical Duck and Swizzle. They promote S.O.O.F.I. at a public speech held for them by J. Jonah Jameson. Spider-Man later interrupts a S.O.O.F.I. indoctrination at the New York Public Library, and Beverly and the other S.O.O.F.I.s see Spidey as a semi-demonic figure and attack him. Spidey escapes with Howard and breaks his brainwashing when Beverly is threatened. Howard quickly explains S.O.O.F.I.'s goals to Spider-Man. As Spider-Man publicly announces his long-standing support for S.O.O.F.I., Howard confronts Bev as she stands beside the Supreme S.O.O.F.I. Howard is able to break through to Beverly, reminding her of their past together. The Supreme S.O.O.F.I. orders the S.O.O.F.I.s to throw the pair into the special Blanditron at Guantanamo Bay, but Beverly keeps them at bay with a whip. Spidey attacks the S.O.O.F.I.s and unmasks the Supreme S.O.O.F.I., while the others escape through their teleporter. Howard states that he believes S.O.O.F.I. will lay low for a while after such a defeat and he also hopes that the group's Florida Everglades base might lead them to meet up with the Man-Thing. The Ducky Dozen Because of his experience with zombie-infested worlds and his leadership of Machine Man, Howard is chosen as the leader of, as he dubs them, the Ducky Dozen. The team is composed of him, several Golden Age heroes, Dum-Dum Dugan, and Battlestar, who is also a veteran of a zombie incident. Upon entering Earth-12591, the Ducky Dozen fight hordes of zombie Nazis and Asgardians, but suffer grave losses as the team's members are either killed or zombified during the battle. After successfully accomplishing their mission, Howard, Dugan, Taxi Taylor and Battlestar are the only members to survive and return to Earth-616 along with the Riveter, the only survivor of Earth-12591's resistance team, the Suffragists. Wolverine and the X-Men Howard later teams up with his friend Doop to battle the Robo-Barbarians in Dimension ZZZ. They beat the horde back with nothing but a broken sword, a rubber chicken with nails in it and a gun that shoots bees. Original Sin After the death of Uatu the Watcher and the activation of the secrets buried in his eye, Howard discovers that he has the potential to be the most intelligent being in Duckworld. After evading a squirrel while driving, he is thrown flying from his vehicle but uses his intellect to calculate a way to land safely in a nearby dumpster. Back to New York Howard returns to his business as a private eye, working in the same building as She-Hulk, in Brooklyn. One of his first new clients is Jonathan Richards, who hires Howard to retrieve a necklace stolen by the Black Cat. With the help of Tara Tam, his new friend and assistant, Howard manages to recover the necklace. However, on his way to give it back to Richards, he finds himself kidnapped by the Collector and allied with the Guardians of the Galaxy to escape the villain, who was attempting to add Howard to his collection of rare space objects and entities. Upon returning to Earth, Howard is robbed by May Parker, Spider-Man's aunt, and later re-encounters the Ringmaster, who is revealed to have brainwashed the elderly into committing robberies. After recovering the necklace for a third time, Howard is approached by Richards in the middle of his fight against the Ringmaster and Richards reveals himself to be Talos the Untamed, who reveals that the necklace was part of a marginally powerful item known as the Abundant Glove. With help from Doctor Strange, Howard and Tara locate the final piece of the Abundant Glove, but are unable to put it back together when Talos grabs it and proceedes to use it to wreak havoc on the city. Talos is confronted by numerous heroes while Howard and Tara take cover. Howard is able to point out that Tara, who is revealed to possess shapeshifting powers similar to that of a Skrull, could help him defeat Talos. Tara used her powers to impersonate Skrull Emperor Kl'rt (the Super-Skrull), distracting Talos long enough for Howard to snatch the Abundant Glove from his hand. Talos is later apprehended by the Fantastic Four and everything returns to normal. Afterwards, with the help of new arrival Gwenpool, Howard prevented HYDRA from infecting the world with a deadly virus. He also has a crossover event with The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl. Howard the Duck is shown to be living in the She-Hulk's apartment building when Patsy Walker moved out. Civil War II During the Civil War II storyline, Howard the Duck is among the building tenants that learn from Patsy Walker what happened to She-Hulk following the fight against Thanos. War of the Realms Howards last name, Duckson, is revealed in War of the Realms: War Scrolls #1. Powers and abilities Howard has no superhuman powers, but he is skilled in the martial art known as Quak-Fu, enough to defeat, or at least to hold his own against, far larger opponents. He has shown some degree of mystic talent in the past, to the point that Stephen Strange taught some spells to Howard and even offered to train him, but Howard declined. On one occasion, Howard used a suit of powered armor known as the \\"Iron Duck\\" armor designed by Claude Starkowitz. Besides its property as body armor, the suit was equipped with foot-mounted leaping coils, a chest-mounted searchlight, and flamethrowers in both arms. Characteristics and associations Howard the Duck is a three-foot-tall anthropomorphic duck. He generally wears a tie and shirt and is almost always found smoking a cigar. Originally, like many cartoon ducks, he wore no pants; Disney threatened legal action due to Howard's resemblance to Donald Duck, and Marvel redesigned that aspect of the character by writing into the script that Howard was the target of anti-nudity protests, and was forced to do business with \\"Wally Sidney\\", a failed cartoonist who made his fortune through a chain of conservative clothing retailers known as \\"Sidney World\\". Howard tries on various outfits, including ones akin to Donald Duck's sailor uniform and Uncle Scrooge's coat and top hat, before settling on his new attire of a business suit complete with trousers. Although Howard sulks that he has lost, Beverly reassures him that she does not want him to be a victim of a mob, and loves him no matter what he wears. Howard has an irritable and cynical attitude towards the often bizarre events around him; he feels there is nothing special about him except that he is a duck, and though he has no goals other than seeking comfort and to be left alone, he is often dragged into dangerous adventures simply because he is visibly unusual. His series' tagline, \\"Trapped in a world he never made\\", played off the genre trappings of 1950s science fiction. His near-constant companion and occasional girlfriend is former art model and Cleveland native Beverly Switzler. Like Howard, Beverly wants an ordinary life but is frequently singled out for her appearance, though as a beautiful woman rather than a duck. His other friends include Paul Same (a painter who briefly became a sleepwalking crime-fighter named the Winky Man), Winda Wester (a lisping ing√©nue with psychic powers), and country music singer Dreyfuss Gulch. Howard has worked with Spider-Man and the Man-Thing on various occasions. Howard found himself on Earth due to a shift in the \\"Cosmic Axis\\" from a world similar to Earth, but where there are \\"more ducks\\" and \\"apes don't talk\\". In the black-and-white Howard the Duck magazine series, writer Bill Mantlo theorized that Howard came from an extra-dimensional planet called Duckworld, a planet similar to Earth where ducks, not apes, had evolved to become the dominant species. In 2001, Gerber dismissed this idea, calling it \\"very pedestrian\\" and 'comic-booky' ‚Äî in the worst sense of the term.\\" Gerber stated that Howard came from an alternate Earth populated by a variety of anthropomorphic animals and not Duckworld. A panel in Fear #19, prior to Howard's introduction, depicts Howard or someone like him near an anthropomorphic mouse and an anthropomorphic dog, in a panel about hypothetical other dimensions. Gerber later depicted his character Destroyer Duck as existing in such a world. His antagonists (who usually appear in a single story each) are often parodies of science fiction, fantasy, or horror characters, as well as frequent parodies of political figures and organizations. The chief recurring villain, Lester Verde, better known as Doctor Bong ‚Äì modeled on Doctor Doom and writers Bob Greene and Lester Bangs ‚Äì is a former tabloid reporter who has the power to \\"reorder reality\\" by smashing himself on the bell-shaped helmet on his head and his main goal is to marry Beverly. Beverly eventually agreed to marry him to save Howard from Bong's evil experimentation, but the two were divorced shortly thereafter. Doctor Bong would reappear in issues of She-Hulk and Deadpool in the mid-1990s. Other recurring villains include the Kidney Lady, an older woman who has been convinced by her former lover that the soul is in the kidneys and attacks anything she sees as a threat to them, and Reverend Jun Moon Yuc and his Yuccies, a parody of Reverend Sun Myung Moon and the Unification Church (\\"Moonies\\"). Another important villain was the organization S.O.O.F.I. (Save Our Offspring From Indecency), whose leader was implied to be Anita Bryant, though she looked like an old, fat Elvis Presley with a smiley face/orange on her head. Other Marvel Comics characters occasionally appeared with Howard, including Spider-Man, the Son of Satan and the Ringmaster. Omega the Unknown appeared to him in a dream, as did Spider-Man and the founding members of the rock group Kiss on other occasions. Seemingly an autodidact, Howard at various times references Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Albert Camus (whose novel The Stranger Gerber considers the principal influence on the comic series), the Bront√´ sisters, and other figures of philosophical and political significance. In a parody of the Marvel comic character Shang-Chi, Howard was trained in the martial art of Quak-Fu. In the 2001 miniseries, as a mocking gesture toward Disney's mascot Mickey Mouse and as a reference to a previous lawsuit with the company over Howard's similarity to Donald Duck, Howard was turned into various other animals, but primarily appeared in the series as an anthropomorphic mouse. Other versions=Amalgam Comics In the Amalgam Comics universe, Howard the Duck is fused with Lobo to become Lobo the Duck. This character is featured in its own one-shot comic book which (like almost all of the other Amalgam Comics) \\"falsely\\" implied that the one-shot was a continuation of multiple other, pre-existing Lobo The Duck stories. In the letters page of Bat-Thing #1, there was mention of a fictional upcoming 'special issue' featuring Howard the Mxyzptlk, presumably a merging of Howard with Mister Mxyzptlk. Marvel Zombies An alternate version of Howard the Duck becomes infected with the zombie plague, and eats the brains of the alternate-Ash that is native to the zombie version of the Marvel Universe. He is swiftly slain by the Scarlet Witch and the original Ash Williams of the Evil Dead series. MC2 In the Marvel Comics 2 universe, Howard is seen as a blindfold-wearing martial arts teacher, a reference harkening back to his mastery of \\"Quack Fu\\" in the original 1970s series. Ultimate Marvel In the miniseries Ultimate Comics: Armor Wars, a billboard advertising for \\"HDTV\\" is seen in the first panel, showing Howard. Universe X * While Howard does not appear, the Beast says, \\"I still feel badly about Howard,\\" who had been \\"hunted down and consumed\\". * In the original draft for Earth X, Howard was supposedly served as a feast during the Skull's invasion of New York City. The scene was cut due to space constraints. Spider-Gwen On Earth-65 in the Spider-Gwen series, a human named Howard T. Duck is the President of the United States. Legion of Howards In a parody of the Spider-Verse event, Howard and Leo Fitz team up with a group of Howards from across the Multiverse who collectively call themselves the Legion of Howards. Their ranks include: * Howard the Duck - A version of Howard who wields Mjolnir and possesses the power of Thor. * Sister Howard the Duck - A female version of Howard who is a nun on her world. * Howard the Roboduck - A Japanese-style giant mecha piloted by an alternate version of Beverly Switzler. * The Ever-Lovin' Blue-Eyed Howard the Duck - A version of Howard who possesses the abilities and appearance of the Thing. * Strange-Duck - A mystical version of Howard who acts as his world's Sorcerer Supreme. In other media=Film * Lucasfilm and Universal Pictures produced the 1986 film Howard the Duck, in which Howard the Duck was voiced by Chip Zien and performed by an assortment of stunt actors in a duck suit ranging from Peter Baird, Ed Gale, Jordan Prentice, Tim Rose, Steve Sleap, Lisa Sturz, and Mary Wells. The only character borrowed from the Marvel Comics mythos was Beverly Switzler, though this version was a rock singer. In the film, Howard is brought to Cleveland by a laser spectroscope experiment gone awry which additionally summoned an evil alien, one of the Dark Overlords of the Universe, who intended to sacrifice all human life in order to free the others of its kind from their celestial prison. The film was widely panned and was a box office bomb. There was a novelization and a comic book adaptation of the film. * Howard the Duck appears as a CGI character in films set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, voiced by Seth Green. ** Howard the Duck is first seen in Guardians of the Galaxy (2014). He is seen as a living exhibit in the Collector's museum during Gamora's visit. After Collector's tormented assistant grabs the Infinity Stone which causes an explosion, Howard is among the creatures in Collector's cages that are set free. Howard is later shown in a post-credits scene having a drink with the Collector and Cosmo the Spacedog in the wrecked archives of the Collector's lair. In August 2014, Guardians of the Galaxy director James Gunn said, \\"It's possible Howard could reappear as more of a character in the Marvel [Cinematic] Universe. But if people think that's going to lead to a Howard the Duck movie, that's probably not going to happen in the next four years. Who knows after that?\\" ** Howard the Duck's next appearance is in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017). Howard is shown having a drink at a bar while he is flirting with a woman on Contraxia. ** Howard was to be included in a cameo appearance in Avengers: Infinity War (2018) but was cut, and was to be voiced by Ken Jeong rather than Seth Green. While not featured in Infinity War, however, Howard has been confirmed to have survived Thanos' snap, which erased half of the universe's population at the end of the film. **Howard can be seen armed with a blaster in a crowd of heroes in the final battle of Avengers: Endgame. ** In a June 2018 interview, Lea Thompson said that she was going to Marvel to pitch a new Howard the Duck movie, and expressed hope at directing it. Television * Howard the Duck appears in the Ultimate Spider-Man animated series, voiced initially by Kevin Michael Richardson (in \\"Awesome\\"), and subsequently by Seth Green (in \\"Return to the Spider-Verse Part 2\\"). He has sporadic appearances. In the episode \\"Awesome\\", he is found by Spider-Man in a lab on the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier but declares him too weird to use for a science project with Luke Cage; Howard states to Spider-Man that he knows Quak Fu. In the episode \\"Carnage\\", Howard has a cameo appearance in Peter Parker's imagination when trying figure out what Peter's transformation will be after the Green Goblin's injection with the Carnage symbiote. In the episode \\"Guardians of the Galaxy\\", Howard is mentioned among Star Lord's list of Earth's mightest heroes before Spider-Man. The episode \\"Return to the Spider-Verse Part 2\\" featured a pirate version of the character. He was Web Beard, the Sea Lord's first mate on a pirate ship version of Groot until he started to have a disagreement with Web Beard enough to lead the pirate versions of Rocket Raccoon and Cosmo the Spacedog into a mutiny after Web Beard hoarded the treasure for himself. When Howard was trying to get Web Beard, Spider-Man and Kid Arachnid to walk the plank, the Kraken ended up attacking. Spider-Man and Kid Arachnid persuaded Web Beard and Howard to put aside their differences in order for everyone to help repel the Kraken. After that was done, Howard agreed to serve Web Beard again. * Howard the Duck has a non-voiced cameo appearance in Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H.. In the episode \\"The Collector\\", he is seen in one of the Collector's pods who admires the 'ultra rare hero', stating that he is in mint condition. * Howard the Duck appears in the Guardians of the Galaxy animated series, voiced again by Seth Green. He appears in the episode \\"Lyin' Eyes\\" where Drax the Destroyer and Rocket Raccoon find him in a display case at an auction house on Knowhere. When he sees Rocket Raccoon and Drax the Destroyer, Howard turns away and continues reading his newspaper. In the episode \\"Happy Together\\", he encounters his old acquantance Rocket Raccoon with the rest of the Guardians of the Galaxy at Starlin's where he will give the group some units if they obtain a specific item for him that is in Kallusian space. That item turned out to belong to the Kree. During the exchange on a planet that has an acid volcano, Howard gets away while the Guardians of the Galaxy deal with Phyla-Vell. Howard then hands the Kree item to the Collector as Howard asks why the Collector wanted the Guardians of the Galaxy set up. He is told the group broke the Collector's things. In the episode \\"Long Distance Runaround\\", the Guardians of the Galaxy catch up to Howard on Knowhere and apprehend him where he admitted setting them up in exchange that the Collector lets him see the outside of his ship. After Cosmo the Spacedog helps the Guardians of the Galaxy get away from Phyla-Vell, the Collector sabotaged the Milano to head to Hala to attack it. After the Collector shrinks Hala, Howard leaves in a small spacecraft having left a tracker for Collector's ship that the Guardians of the Galaxy used to find it. In the episode \\"With a Little Help From My Friends,\\" Howard the Duck is on Conjunction when Star-Lord shows up looking for wrestlers to help fight the Serpent. Though Howard the Duck proved himself to Star-Lord when he used a bubble device to trap the Champion of the Universe. * Hulu intended to air an animated series to be written and executive produced by Kevin Smith and Dave Willis. Howard would have teamed up with MODOK, Hit-Monkey, Tigra, and Dazzler in the animated The Offenders special. In January 2020, it was announced that the Howard the Duck series, along with Tigra & Dazzler were cancelled, making The Offenders unlikely. Video games * Alongside the film, Activision released a namesake Howard the Duck video game for the Commodore 64, MSX, Amstrad CPC and ZX Spectrum. * Howard the Duck appears as an ability card in the crossover game Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3, which itself is an updated version of Marvel vs Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds. * Howard the Duck appears as a playable character in Lego Marvel Super Heroes. He is shown to be armed with a rocket launcher. In a bonus mission narrated by Deadpool, Howard the Duck and the Vulture storm Marvel Comics HQ and hold the artists there hostage in an attempt to get their own movies. During his battle against Mister Fantastic and Spider-Man, Howard humorously defeats himself by accidentally knocking himself back with his rocket launcher. * Howard the Duck is a playable character in the Facebook game Marvel: Avengers Alliance. * Howard the Duck is a playable character in the game Marvel: Contest of Champions, wearing his Iron Duck suit or as Venom The Duck. * Howard the Duck is a rare playable character in the match-three mobile game Marvel Puzzle Quest. His comic book covers are only available during the \\"Duck Season\\" in-game event, which is only held infrequently. As Howard was introduced on April 1, 2016, many players were convinced that it was an April Fool's Day joke played by the game's developers. * Howard the Duck appears as a playable character in Lego Marvel Super Heroes 2, voiced by Greg Miller. While he still has some of his abilities, Howard can assume an Iron Duck form where he wears a duck version of the Iron Man armor. In a bonus mission narrated by Gwenpool, Howard the Duck sneaks into the Chrono-Con event at Timely Comics HQ with help from Forbush Man as part of his plot to promote a Howard the Duck video game. Another bonus mission has Howard the Duck, Ms. Marvel, and Spider-Man II rescuing Gwenpool from the Teuthidans who have set up a ransom exchange at the nearest \\"World of Water and Splash Pools\\". Theme park * At Disney California Adventure, Howard the Duck can occasionally be heard over the intercom in the exit hall of Guardians of the Galaxy ‚Äì Mission: Breakout!, mocking the Collector's misfortune of the Guardians and creatures having escaped from his collection. Howard is voiced by Seth Green, reprising his role from the Guardians of the Galaxy film series. Other comics * In Savage Dragon/Destroyer Duck #1 (Nov. 1996), Gerber claims that Howard and Beverly Switzler changed their names to Leonard the Duck and Rhonda Martini, remained in the Image Universe and \\"were last sighted in Chicago boarding the Amtrak for Buffalo\\" while the duck who returned to Marvel is \\"only an empty trademark, a clone whose soul departed him at the corner of Floss and Regret\\". This was done because Tom Brevoort invited Gerber to write the comic, claiming he was the only one to write Howard, then Gerber noticed the Howard guest appearances in Ghost Rider and Generation X and felt as though he had been tricked. * In the Don Simpson's Megaton Man feature, a comedy relief character is Gower Goose, an intended parody of Howard. * In the Claypool Comics series Elvira Mistress of the Dark, Gordon the Goose (clearly modelled on Howard) appears, together with Dorkheem the Sorcerer and the Heap-Thing, in issues #49, 58, and 59. * In America's Best Comics' Top 10 #8 a duck appearing to be Howard (with his distinctive blue hat & jacket) can be seen at the Transworld Transport Terminus. * In several issues of The Maxx, Howard appears, along with many other characters, seemingly cut and pasted into the story. * In Adam Beechen's ending of Doctor Fate: More Pain Comics, which Gerber left unfinished when he died, Howard, who is heard but unseen (his speech balloon ends with \\"waaugh\\"), dispatched the Elf with a Gun to destroy Negal and Ymp, then invited for one last drink with Yah, Bev, Thunny, and Megs before Yah goes back \\"upstairs\\". * He is also seen being roasted in one of the Deadpool Kills The Marvel Universe issues, where the reporter states that Deadpool has gone into a killing spree, looking for heroes and villains alike, and also some characters that were never too special to begin with. Newspaper comic strip Between June 6, 1977 and October 29, 1978, Howard the Duck appeared in a syndicated daily comic strip that comic strip historian Allan Holtz has described as having low distribution and that was eventually replaced by the Incredible Hulk comic strip. Among the handful of newspapers it appeared in (syndicated by the Register and Tribune Syndicate) were the Toronto Star and Spokane Daily Chronicle. A total of eleven story arcs, as well as a number of single-joke strips, constitute the 511 individual strips that were printed. The strip started with original stories written by Steve Gerber and illustrated by Gene Colan: \\"Pop Syke -- The Consciousness of Success\\", \\"The Cult of Entropy\\" and \\"Fred Feenix the Self-Made Man\\". The latter was started by Colan and completed by Val Mayerik, who stayed on to do two additional Gerber-scripted stories: \\"The Sleigh Jacking\\" and \\"In Search of the Good Life\\". These were followed by an adaptation of the \\"Sleep of the Just\\" story from issue #4 of the Marvel comic, scripted by Gerber and illustrated by Alan Kupperberg. Gerber was fired from the strip in early 1978 over chronic problems with deadlines. He was replaced by Marv Wolfman as writer, while Alan Kupperberg continued as artist. The remaining stories were: \\"Close Encounters of the Fowl Kind\\", \\"The Tuesday Ruby\\", \\"The Clone Ranger\\", \\"Bye Bye, Beverly\\" and \\"The Mystery of the Maltese Human\\". As the series drew to an end, its already meager list of client papers shrank, making copies of these last post-Gerber stories particularly hard to find. In November 1978, the first of a projected eight-issue series reprinting the entire strip was published by John Zawadzki. Titled It's Adventure Time With...Howard the Duck, only the initial issue was published. Radio In 1980, a pilot for a radio show version of Howard was recorded. James Belushi played the role of Howard, although the program was never aired.

Imprints typically have a defining character or mission. In some cases, the diversity results from the takeover of smaller publishers (or parts of their business) by a larger company. In the case of Barnes & Noble, imprints have been used to facilitate the venture of a bookseller into publishing. In the video game industry, some game companies operate various publishing labels with Take-Two Interactive credited as \\"the father of label\\" in their case the labels are wholly owned incorporated entities with their own publishing and distributing, sales and marketing infrastructure and management teams and their own respective subsidiaries also incorporated (Rockstar North Limited, 2K Vegas, Inc.). This model has influenced rivals including Activision Blizzard, ZeniMax, Electronic Arts from 2008‚Äì2018, Warner Bros. Interactive, Embracer Group, and Koei Tecmo.

Knopf, Inc. His contemporaries included the likes of Bennett Cerf and Donald Klopfer, and (of the previous generation) Frank Nelson Doubleday, J. Henry Harper and Henry Holt. Knopf paid special attention to the quality of printing, binding, and design in his books, and earned a reputation as a purist in both content and presentation. Biography Knopf was born into a Jewish family in New York City. His father, Samuel Knopf, was an advertising executive and financial consultant, his mother was Ida Japhe, a school teacher. Samuel Knopf was originally from Warsaw, Poland, but came to New York with his parents, where he worked his way up the directorship at a small mercantile bank. Alfred's mother, Ida, was from a Latvian Jewish family who settled in New York. For a time Knopf's parents lived in the Midwest and in Virginia. Ida committed suicide when Alfred was five years old and his sister Sophia was almost two. That same day, Alfred's father had filed for divorce in which he named Ida as an adulteress. His father later married Lillian Harris, who had a daughter, Bertha, from a previous marriage. With Lillian, Samuel had another son, Edwin H. Knopf, who worked for Alfred briefly, then became a film director and producer. Alfred attended Columbia University, where he was a pre-law student and a member of the Peithologian Society (a debating and literary club) and the Boar's Head Society. He began to show an interest in publishing during his senior year, becoming advertising manager of an undergraduate magazine. His interest in publishing was allegedly fostered by a correspondence with British author John Galsworthy. Galsworthy was the subject of Knopf's senior thesis and after visiting Galsworthy in England, Knopf gave up his plans for a law career, and upon his return went into publishing. Knopf was introduced to his future wife and business partner, Blanche Knopf, at a party at the Lawrence Athletic Club in 1911. Their relationship was built on their mutual interest in books. Blanche said of their relationship, \\"Alfred had realized I read books constantly and he had never met a girl who did.... I saw him and [all we did was] talk books, and nobody liked him--my family least of all. But I did, because I had someone to talk books to and we talked of making books...We decided we would get married and make books and publish them.\\" Alfred and Blanche were married on April 4, 1916. Knopf worked as a clerk at Doubleday (1912‚Äì1913), then as an editorial assistant to Mitchell Kennerley (1914). Knopf, along with Blanche Knopf, founded the publishing house Alfred A. Knopf in 1915. The company initially emphasized European, especially Russian, literature, hence the choice of the borzoi as a colophon. At that time European literature was largely neglected by American publishers; Knopf published authors such as Simone de Beauvoir, Albert Camus, Joseph Conrad, E. M. Forster, Sigmund Freud, Andr√© Gide, Franz Kafka, D. H. Lawrence, Thomas Mann, W. Somerset Maugham, T.F Powys, Wyndham Lewis and Jean-Paul Sartre. While Blanche was known to as a superb editor, Alfred was always interested in more of the sales side than in editing. Knopf also published many American authors, including Conrad Aiken, James Baldwin, James M. Cain, Theodore Dreiser, Shirley Ann Grau, Dashiell Hammett, Langston Hughes, Vachel Lindsay, H.L. Mencken, George Jean Nathan, John Updike, and Knopf's own favorite, Willa Cather. From 1924 to 1934, he published the famous literary magazine founded by Mencken and Nathan, The American Mercury. He often developed a personal friendship with his authors. Knopf's personal interest in the fields of history, sociology, and science led to close friendships in the academic community with such noted historians as Richard Hofstadter, Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., and Samuel Eliot Morison. A prominent Republican until Watergate, Knopf often drew legislators into lengthy correspondence by mail. He was also a member of the Peabody Awards Board of Jurors from 1940 to 1946. Knopf himself was also an author. His writings include Some Random Recollections, Publishing Then and Now, Portrait of a Publisher, Blanche W. Knopf: July 30, 1894-June 4, 1966, and Sixty Photographs. When the Knopfs' son Alfred A. Knopf Jr. left the company in 1959 to found Atheneum Publishers,Later acquired, in 1978, by Simon & Schuster Alfred and Blanche became concerned about the eventual fate of their publishing house, which had always been a family business. The problem was solved in 1960, when Knopf merged with Random House, which was owned by the Knopfs' close friends Bennett Cerf and Donald Klopfer. Knopf retained complete editorial control for five years, and then gave up only his right to veto other editors' manuscript selections. The editorial departments of the two companies remain separate, and Knopf, Inc., retains its distinctive character. Knopf called the merger \\"a perfect marriage.\\" Random House itself eventually became a division of Bertelsmann AG, a large multinational media company. The Knopf imprint remains in existence. Blanche Knopf died in June 1966. Alfred remarried in April of the following year, to Helen Norcross Hedrick. He died of congestive heart failure on August 11, 1984, at his estate in Purchase, New York. Personality Among other authors he rejected were Sylvia Plath, Jack Kerouac, Anne Frank, George Orwell, Jorge Luis Borges, Vladimir Nabokov, Isaac Bashevis Singer and Ana√Øs Nin.Oshinsky, David (September 9, 2007), \\"No Thanks, Mr Nabokov\\", The New York Times, Sunday Book Review. He turned down an early novel by Ursula K. Le Guin but encouraged her to keep writing.\\"The Art of Fiction No. 221: Ursula K. Le Guin,\\" in The Paris Review, Fall 2013, p. 57. This outspoken aspect of his character sometimes found voice in letters of complaint to hotels, restaurants, and stores that failed to meet his high standards. These letters grew increasingly frequent and more severe as he aged. One striking example is the six-year-long war of words he waged against the Eastman Kodak Company over a roll of lost film.

Several of its tributaries drain major parts of the center-southern and easternmost Coal Regions in the state. It flows for U.S. Geological Survey. National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map , accessed April 1, 2011 from Pottsville to Philadelphia, where it joins the Delaware River as one of its largest tributaries. In 1682 William Penn chose the left bank of the confluence upon which he founded the planned city of Philadelphia on lands purchased from the native Delaware nation. It is a designated Pennsylvania Scenic River, and its whole length was once part of the Delaware people's southern territories. The river's watershed of about lies entirely within the state of Pennsylvania, the upper portions in the Ridge-and-valley Appalachian Mountains where the folding of the mountain ridges metamorphically modified bituminous into widespread anthracite deposits located north of the Blue Mountain barrier ridge. Millions of tons of coal from Pennsylvania‚Äôs Anthracite Coal Region flowed by waterway and rail into Philadelphia, once America's largest city, to feed the iron and steel industry. The source of the Schuykill‚Äôs eastern branch is in lands now heavily mined situated one ridgeline south of Tuscarora Lake along a drainage divide from the Little Schuylkill about a mile east of the village of Tuscarora and about a mile west of Tamaqua, at Tuscarora Springs in Schuylkill County. Tuscarora Lake is one source of the Little Schuylkill River tributary. The West Branch starts near Minersville and joins the eastern branch at the town of Schuylkill Haven. It then combines with the Little Schuylkill River downstream in the town of Port Clinton. The Tulpehocken Creek joins it at the western edge of Reading. Wissahickon Creek joins it in northwest Philadelphia. Other major tributaries include: Maiden Creek, Manatawny Creek, French Creek, and Perkiomen Creek. The Schuylkill joins the Delaware at the site of the former Philadelphia Navy Yard, now the Philadelphia Naval Business Center, just northeast of Philadelphia International Airport. Major towns * Pottsville * Reading * Pottstown * Phoenixville * Norristown * Conshohocken * Philadelphia Name The Leni Lenape (called Delaware Indians by European settlers) were the original inhabitants of the area around this river. It remains unclear whether these people had a single name for this river. There is evidence that the Lenape called the river Ganshowahanna (which means falling or roaring watersDonnalley, Thomas K., Hand book of tribal names of Pennsylvania, together with signification of Indian words, Philadelphia:Donnalley, (1908), p. 37). There is also some belief that the Lenape called the river Tool-pay Hanna (Turtle River) or Tool-pay Hok Ing (Turtle Place).See The Schuylkill Center for Environmental Education There is a tributary named Tulpehocken near Reading, PA. The first European explorers of the river were from the Netherlands, Sweden, and then England. It was through historical documents called various names, including Manayunk, Manajungh, Manaiunk,See for example, Pennypacker, Samuel Whitaker, Annals of Phoenixville and Its Vicinity: From the Settlement to the Year 1871, Giving the Origin etc., Philadelphia:Bavis &Pennypacker;, 1872, p.1 and Lenni Bikbi. The Swedish explorer called it ' or alternately ' or the Linde River. The (then believed) headwaters of the river, up near Reading, was later called \\"Tulpehocken\\" by the English. The river was called the Dutch name ' (). As ' means \\"creek\\" (e.g. Dordtsche Kil) and ' (now spelled ') means \\"to hide, skulk\\" or \\"to take refuge, shelter\\", one explanation given for this name is that it translates to \\"hidden river\\", \\"skulking river\\" or \\"sheltered creek\\" and refers to the river's confluence with the Delaware River at League Island, which was nearly hidden by dense vegetation. This name has traditionally been credited to Arent Corsen (or Arendt Corssen), an agent of the Dutch West India Company who purchased land ‚Äúon the Schuylkill River‚Äù in 1633.Hanna, C.A., The Wilderness Trail, Volume 1, New York:Putnam‚Äôs Sons (1911), p. 108 Another explanation is that the name properly translates to \\"hideout creek\\" in one of the Algonquian languages spoken by a Leni Lenape in their confederation. Winter scene The Strawberry Mansion Bridge at dusk The Fairmount Water Works on the Schuylkill River were once the source of Philadelphia's water supply and are now an attraction in Fairmount Park. History The mighty Susquehannock confederation claimed the area along the Schuylkill as a hunting ground, as they did to the lands down along the Chesapeake Bay to the left bank Potomac River, across from the Powhatan Confederacy when traders first stopped in the Delaware and settlers arrived in the first decade of the 1600s. With ample tributary streams, the Schuylkill was ground zero during the early years of the Beaver Wars, during which the Delaware peoples became tributary to the victorious Susquehannocks, an Iroquoian people also often in contention with their relatives, both the Erie people west and northwest through the gaps of the Allegheny in eastern Ohio and northwestern Pennsylvania (between the upper Allegheny River and Lake Erie), and the Five Nations of the Iroquois, another Amerindian confederation eastwards from the right bank of the Genesee River through the Finger Lakes region of upper New York then down the Saint Lawrence. The Lenape had settlements on the river, including Nittabakonck (\\"place where heroes reside\\"), a village on the east bank just south of the confluence of Wissahickon Creek, and the Passyunk site, on the west bank where the Schuylkill meets the Delaware River. Patriot paper maker Frederick Bicking owned a fishery on the river prior to the Revolution, and Thomas Paine tried in vain to interest the citizens in funding an iron bridge over this river, before abandoning \\"pontifical works\\" on account of the French Revolution. In the next decades, pioneering industrialists Josiah White and protege & partner Erskine Hazard built iron industries at the Falls of the Schuylkill in Jefferson's administration, where White built a suspension bridge with cables made from their wire mill. During the war of 1812 the two took delivery of an ark of anthracite coal which was notoriously difficult to combust reliably and experimented with ways to use it industrially, providing the knowledge to successfully begin resolving the ongoing decades long energy crises around eastern cities. The two then heavily backed the flagging effort to improve navigation on the Schuylkill, which efforts date back to legislation measures as early as 1762. Needing energy resources, and by 1816 disenchanted with the lack of urgency found in other investors to accelerate the anemic (underfunded) construction rate of the Schuylkill Canal, the two jumped to option the mining rights of the Lehigh Coal Mine Company, which disenchanted stockholders were giving up on. They then waited until a charter to improve the Lehigh went delinquent, resulting in two groups of investors forming two complementary companies in 1818 that jump-started the industrial revolution: the Lehigh Coal Company and the Lehigh Navigation Company. Following White's bold plan, the latter company improved down river navigation on the Lehigh using his 'Bear Trap Locks' design to deliver over 365 tons of anthracite to Philadelphia docks by December 1820, four years ahead of promises to Stockholders. The success, along with the pending opening of the first operable sections of New York's Erie Canal spurred stockholders of the Schuylkill Canal to finally fund the works. A project which had languished for over a decade got capitalized and began operations in 1822--the same year the Lehigh companies combined into the Lehigh Coal & Navigation Company, having had to raise additional funds for repairs due to badly ice-damaged improvements, a common problem with northern canals. The success of these projects and the rosy promise of anthracite (a new wonder fuel in the day) to alleviate energy problems spurred canal construction for the next decade in the east, and commercial opportunities funded three decades of investment from Illinois to the Atlantic Ocean, including the ambitious 1824 Main Line of Public Works bill to connect Philadelphia with the newly emerging states of the Northwest Territory via the Allegheny & Ohio valleys at Pittsburgh and to Lake Erie-- leveraging the wide-ranging branches of the Susquehanna River in the state's center. In the 1830s railway technology and new railroads grew in leaps and bounds, and the Schuylkill Valley was at the heart of these developments, as well as the new Anthracite iron and mining industries. From 1820 to the 1860s Iron works, foundries, manufacturing mills, blast furnaces, rolling mills, rail yards, rail roads, warehouses and train stations sprang up throughout the valley. Tiny farm villages grew into vibrant company towns then transitioned into small cities as a major industry and supporting businesses transformed local economics and populations swelled.  Pollution Restoration of the river has been funded by money left for that purpose in Benjamin Franklin's will. The river is known to have been on fire more than once throughout history, for example in November 1892 when the surface film of oil that had leaked from nearby oil works at Point Breeze, Philadelphia, was ignited by a match tossed carelessly from a boat, with fatal results. Silt and coal dust from upstream industries, particularly coal mining and washing operations in the headwaters, led to extensive silting of the river through the early 20th century. The river was shallow and filled with extensive black silt bars. By the early 20th century, upstream coal operations contributed over 3 million tons of silt annually to the river. In 1948, led by then governor James H. Duff, a massive cleanup effort began. Twenty three impounding basins were excavated along the river, to receive dredged silt. The 1945 Desilting Act helped begin this cleanup task. The quality of the river has improved much over the past decades. A fish ladder to support shad migration has been constructed at the Manayunk dam. Mayfly hatches (signifying good water quality) now occur yearly along the Montgomery sections of the river. Transportation and recreation=Transportation The Schuylkill River valley was an important thoroughfare in the eras of canals and railroads. The river itself, the Schuylkill Canal, the Reading Railroad, and the Pennsylvania Railroad were vital shipping conduits from the second decade of the 19th century through the mid-20th century. The rise of trucking capabilities and state & county development of road and highway networks progressively took increasing amounts of business away from both competing transport industries. By the mid-1930s the canals inflexibility and a geographically limited pool of customers steadily shifting energy usage away from anthracite doomed most eastern canals, so the Lehigh, Delaware and Schuylkill Canals all ceased operations during the Great Depression years. The zooming rise of automobile ownership post-World War II, the development of suburbs, and dispersal of industrial buildings into far flung parks serviced by the government supported highways and new Interstate Highways doomed intercity rail transport; even as Interstate Commerce Committee regulations required railway operating companies to maintain passenger rail services past its economic viability--which costs further imperiled the railroad's profits leading to a widespread collapse of the industry in the 1960s and 1970s. Rail freight still uses many of the same valley rights-of-way that the 19th-century railroads used. Passenger and commuter rail service is more limited. Today, the old rail bed rights-of-way along the river between Philadelphia and Norristown contain SEPTA's Manayunk/Norristown Line (former Reading Railroad right-of-way) and the Schuylkill River Trail (former Pennsylvania Railroad right-of-way). There are efforts to extend both rail and trail farther upriver than they currently reach. The Schuylkill River Trail continues upriver from Norristown to Mont Clare, and designers plan to connect it to sections above Pottstown. SEPTA Regional Rail service currently does not go farther upriver than Norristown. Visions of resuming commuter rail service farther up the Schuylkill valley (\\"Schuylkill Valley Metro\\") have yet to become reality. The Schuylkill Expressway (I-76) and the Benjamin Franklin Highway (US 422) follow the course of the river from Philadelphia to Valley Forge to Reading. Above Reading, Pennsylvania Route 61 continues along the main river valley to Schuylkill Haven, then follows the east branch to Pottsville. U.S. Route 209 continues along the east branch of the river to its head in Tuscarora. In Philadelphia, Kelly Drive (formerly East River Drive), and Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive (formerly West River Drive) flank the river. Recreation The Schuylkill River is very popular with rowing, dragon boat, and outrigger paddling enthusiasts. The Schuylkill Navy was established on the riverside adjacent to the city of Philadelphia to promote amateur rowing in 1858. The Dad Vail Regatta, an annual rowing competition, is held on the river near Boathouse Row, as is the annual BAYADA Home Health Care Regatta, featuring disabled rowers from all over the continent, and in autumn the annual Head of the Schuylkill Regatta takes place in Philadelphia. Also, the Stotesbury Cup Regatta, the biggest high school regatta in the world, takes place there. The Chinese sport of dragon boat racing was introduced to the United States on the Schuylkill in 1983, and two major dragon boat regattas are held there in June and October of each year. Water skiing, swimming and other aquatic sports are also common outside of Philadelphia city limits. The Schuylkill River Trail, which generally follows the river bank, is a multi-use trail for walking, running, bicycling, rollerblading, and other outdoor activities. The trail presently runs from Philadelphia, through Manayunk to the village of Mont Clare, the latter of which are the locations of the last two remaining watered stretches of the Schuylkill Canal. There is also a section of trail starting at Pottstown and running upriver toward Reading. Plans are under way to complete the trail from the Delaware River to Reading. In popular culture The Schuylkill River looking north toward Center City Philadelphia from the South Street Bridge Television In the \\"Thunder Gun Express\\" episode of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, Frank Reynolds (played by Danny DeVito), steals a tourist ferry and travels down the Schuylkill River, noting that it's \\"the depository of all the unsolved crimes and murders in Philadelphia.\\" Also, in the \\"Mac Day\\" episode, Mac (played by Rob McElhenney), declares that part of his \\"Mac Day\\" will include the gang filming scenes for his series \\"Project Badass\\" over the Schuylkill River with his cousin Country Mac (played by Seann William Scott). In several episodes of Cold Case one or another of the Cold Case squad mentions finding \\"a floater in the Schuylkill.\\" Film In the 2019 film The Irishman, the Mob hitman Frank Sheeran, played by Robert De Niro, disposes of a gun he just used in a hit by tossing it into the Schuylkill River, noting, \\"There's a spot in the Schuylkill River everybody uses. If they ever send divers down there, they'd be able to arm a small country.\\" Music The Schuylkill River, and adjacent neighborhood of Manayunk, are featured as the setting for Audioslave's \\"Doesn't Remind Me\\" music video. In the music video for \\"Pain\\" by The War on Drugs (band), the band can be seen floating down the Schuylkill River while performing on a barge. Literature The angler, artist, and author Ron P. Swegman has made the Schuylkill River a focal point of two essay collections, Philadelphia on the Fly and Small Fry: The Lure of the Little. Both books describe the experience of fly fishing along the Philadelphia County stretch of the river in the 21st century. Beth Kephart published a series of poetic ruminations about the river in Flow: The Life and Times of Philadelphia's Schuylkill River in 2007. The river plays an important part of Jerry Spinelli's young adult fiction novel Maniac Magee. The titular character's parents died before the main timeline of the story when their commuter train plunged into the Schuylkill, and much of the main story takes place in the fictional town of Two Mills, which is based on Spinelli's home town of Norristown, Pennsylvania, also located on the Schuylkill near Philadelphia. Jules Verne's novel Robur the Conqueror starts out in Philadelphia on the banks of the Schuylkill River. The river is also the setting of the fictional estate White Acre in Elizabeth Gilbert's 2013 novel The Signature of All Things. Gilbert chose an actual mansion, the Hamilton house, nestled on the west side of the Schuylkill River in the Woodlands Cemetery, near 40th Street and Woodland Avenue, on which to base White Acre. The main protagonist of Ta-Nehisi Coates' The Water Dancer first arrives in a free Philadelphia at Gray's Ferry overlooking the Schuylkill.

The population was 3,895 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Bangor metropolitan statistical area. Dexter Regional High School, which serves Dexter as well as other nearby small towns, is located in the town. History Dexter was settled beginning in 1801 by Ebenezer Small, David Smith, and others from New Hampshire, and was originally called Elkinstown. When incorporated as a town in 1816, it named itself after Judge Samuel Dexter, who was then running for governor of Massachusetts (of which Maine was still a part). The town of Brooks in nearby Waldo County was incorporated the same year and named for the opposing candidate, John Brooks. Brooks won the election. The town of Dexter, however, achieved the greater prosperity. The town grew because of its location on the East Branch of the Sebasticook River, which provided excellent water power for mills. In 1818, Jonathan Farrar constructed a grist mill at the falls. The Dexter Historical Society today uses the building which replaced it in 1854 as part of its museum complex. The stream would also power five woolen mills, the oldest and largest of which was established by Amos and Jeremiah Abbott in 1836. Amos Abbott & Company, which closed in 1975, was the only textile mill in the United States owned by one family for such a long period. In the 1960s, the town's name became familiar throughout New England because of the pervasive log cabin style factory outlets of the Dexter Shoe Company, founded in a vacant Dexter woolen mill in 1958 by Harold Alfond.Harold Alfond Foundation Dexter's downtown is dominated by the Memorial Building, designed by John Morrison. At its top is the community's largest clock, named Nancy after the architect's wife. The tallest building in town is the Unitarian Universalist Church. It is also Dexter's oldest house of worship, built in 1826, but given a new steeple and vestibule by Boston architect Thomas W. Silloway in 1869. Five buildings in Dexter are listed on the National Register of Historic Places, including the Dexter Grist Mill; Universalist Church; Abbott Memorial Library by Boston architect J. Williams Beal; the Bank Block by Bangor architect George W. Orff; and \\"Zion's Hill\\", the Ralph Owen Brewster house by Portland architectural firm J. C. & J. H. Stevens.James Wintle, Local History of Dexter, Maine In 1848, the town was struck by a tornado which tore large trees out by their roots and destroyed even the strongest buildings.

Dexter is drained by the East Branch of the Sebasticook River, which flows from Lake Wassookeag and is part of the Kennebec River watershed. Dexter is almost exactly half-way between Bangor and Waterville. It is also almost exactly half-way between the geographic north pole and the equator.

University of T√ºbingen Picture showing a 'dead' OPFOR soldier with moulage. Moulage (French: casting/moulding) is the art of applying mock injuries for the purpose of training emergency response teams and other medical and military personnel. Moulage may be as simple as applying pre-made rubber or latex \\"wounds\\" to a healthy \\"patient's\\" limbs, chest, head, etc., or as complex as using makeup and theatre techniques to provide elements of realism (such as blood, vomitus, open fractures, etc.http://casemed.case.edu/simcenter/resources/moulage.cfm Moulage) to the training simulation. The practice dates to at least the Renaissance, when wax figures were used for this purpose.http://www.unmc.edu/news.cfm?match=12171 In Germany some universities and hospitals use their historical moulage collections for the training of students. The often very lifelike models are especially useful to show the students today the characteristics of rare diseases, such as skin tuberculosis or leprosy. Picture showing medical soldiers working on a training aid (dummy) with moulage. History Up until the 16th century, European scientists had little knowledge about human anatomy and anatomy of animals. Medical students of Bologna and Paris studied the books of Aristotle, Galen, and other Greek scholars. Four centuries after the invasion by the Arabs and the fall of Rome and Persia, many Greek books were translated into the Arabic language. European scientists then translated these Arabic books into the Latin and Greek languages. In the medical field, this led to a reliance on Galen as a medical authority in European countries. In European medical schools the professors of anatomy merely lectured from Galen, without any dissection of the human body, and Galen‚Äôs books were the only way to learn anatomy. Anatomical moulages (torso) Andreas Vesalius (1514‚Äì1564), a Flemish anatomist, was at first a \\"Galenist\\" at the University of Paris. When he moved to Italy and entered the University of Padua, he began dissecting human bodies. He studied many details of human anatomy and found that Galen made some anatomical mistakes. For example, Galen wrote that the sternum has seven segments, but Vesalius found it has three segments. Galen wrote that the bone of the arm is the longest bone in the human body, but Vesalius found that the bone of the thigh is actually the longest bone in human body. At age 25 Vesalius realized that the anatomical knowledge of Galen was derived from animal anatomy and therefore Galen had never dissected a human body. In 1543 Vesalius wrote an anatomical masterwork named in Latin De humani corporis fabrica libri septem (\\"On the fabric of the human body in seven books\\"), or in short De Fabrica. The book included drawings of human females and males with their skins dissected.http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/history_02Comparative Anatomy: Andreas Vesalius These pictures greatly influenced the creation of future anatomical wax models. The anatomical pictures of Vesalius were followed by those of Johann Vesling (\\"Veslingius\\") and Hieronymus Fabricius. By 1600 Fabricius had gathered 300 anatomical paintings and made an anatomical atlas named the Tabulae Pictae. Giulio Cesare Casseri (\\"Casserius\\"), Spighelius, and William Harvey are other followers of the pictures of Andreas Vesalius. The Tabulae anatomicae of Bartolomeo Eustachi (\\"Eustachius\\") (1552), printed in 1714, had a major effect on the history of anatomical wax models. This work so affected Pope Benedict XIV that he ordered construction of a museum of anatomy in Bologna In 1742, named Ercole Lelli and featuring anatomical wax models. Felice Fontana made cadaveric specimens into wax models by the casting method for anatomical teaching.Alessandro Riva, Gabriele Conti, Paola Solinas and Francesco Loy .The evolution of anatomical illustration and wax modelling in Italy from the 16th to early 19th centuries. J. Anat. (2010) 216, pp209‚Äì222, doi: 10.1111/j.1469-7580.2009.01157.x The history of wax models is ancient. Wax anatomical models were first made by Gaetano Giulio Zummo (1656‚Äì1701) who first worked in Naples, then Florence, and finally Paris, where he was granted monopoly right by Louis XIV. Later, Jules Baretta (1834‚Äì1923) made more than 2000 wax models in Hospital Saint-Louis, Paris, where more than 4000 wax models were collected. While wax models were being made, he made pleasant conversations with the patients, sang songs or at times played the piano. Moulages were made for the education of dermatologists around the world, but were eventually replaced by color slides. Wax sculpture, use in moulage The modeling of the soft parts of dissections, teaching illustrations of anatomy, was first practiced at Florence during the Renaissance. The practice of moulage, or the depiction of human anatomy and different diseases taken from directly casting from the body using (in the early period) gelatine moulds, later alginate or silicone moulds, used wax as its primary material (later to be replaced by latex and rubber). Some moulages were directly cast from the bodies of diseased subjects, others from healthy subjects to which disease features( blisters, sores, growths, rashes) were skilfully applied with wax and pigments. During the 19th century, moulage evolved into three-dimensional, realistic representations of diseased parts of the human body. These can be seen in many European medical museums, notably the Spitzner collection currently in Brussels, the Charite Hospital museum in Berlin and the Gordon Museum of Pathology at Guy's Hospital in London UK. A comprehensive book monograph on moulages is \\"Diseases in Wax: the History of Medical Moulage\\" by Thomas Schnalke (Author) the director of the Charite Museum and Kathy Spatschek (Translator). In the 19th century moulage was taken of medical patients for educational purposes. The prepared model was painted to mimic the original disease. Nowadays anatomicals model are an important instrument of education of human anatomy in department of anatomy and biological sciences in medical schools.Wax sculpture#Use in moulage  Modern Moulage  Example of moulage on a manikin Moulage has evolved dramatically since its original intent. In modern terms, the word moulage refers to the use of \\"special effects makeup (SPFX) and casting or moulding techniques that replicate illnesses or wounds\\" in simulation based techniques. Common examples include designing diabetic wounds, creating burns or other illness effects, like dermatological rashes. These illness and injury effects are applied to training manikins or Simulated/Standardized patients for training or other purposes. Simulation staff attend training to learn these techniques. It is argued that the use of moulage in simulation improves realism or participant buy-in. Moulage is an emerging field of research for paramedicine, radiography and medical education, with researchers exploring how moulage contributes to learning in training. Military training utilises highly- authentic moulage techniques to desensitise to graphic wounds, prepare for battle, and treat injuries. New advancements in the field include using tattooed injuries and moulage through augmented reality. The level of authenticity required for moulage remains unclear.

History The title of Lord Elphinstone was created by King James IV in 1510 for Sir Alexander Elphinstone of Elphinstone, who was killed at the Battle of Flodden three years later. He was succeeded by his son, the second Lord, killed at the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh in 1547. His grandson, the fourth Lord, served as Lord High Treasurer of Scotland. His great-great-great-great-grandson, the eleventh Lord, sat in the House of Lords as a Scottish Representative Peer from 1778 to 1794. He was succeeded by his son, the twelfth Lord, who was a Lieutenant- General in the Army, a Scottish Representative Peer from 1803 to 1807 and Lord Lieutenant of Dunbartonshire. His son, the thirteenth Lord, served as a Scottish Representative Peer between 1833 and 1834 and 1847 and 1849 and was also Governor of Bombay and of Madras. In 1859 he was created Baron Elphinstone, of Elphinstone in the County of Stirling, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. However, this title became extinct on his death in 1860 while he was succeeded in the lordship by his first cousin, the fourteenth Lord. He was the son of Admiral the Hon. Charles Elphinstone Fleeming, second son of the eleventh Lord. When he died the following year this line of the family also failed and he was succeeded by his second cousin, the fifteenth Lord. He was the grandson of the Hon. William Elphinstone, third son of the tenth Lord. Lord Elphinstone sat in the House of Lords as a Scottish Representative Peer from 1867 to 1885 and served as a Lord-in-waiting (government whip in the House of Lords) in the Conservative administrations of Benjamin Disraeli and Lord Salisbury. In 1885 he was created Baron Elphinstone, of Elphinstone in the County of Haddington, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. The Lords Elphinstone sat in the House of Lords in right of this title until the passing of the House of Lords Act 1999 removed the automatic right of hereditary peers to sit in the upper chamber of Parliament. He was succeeded by his son, the sixteenth Lord, who in 1910 married Lady Mary Bowes-Lyon, second daughter of Claude Bowes-Lyon, 14th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne, and elder sister of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, wife of King George VI and mother of Queen Elizabeth II. He was succeeded by his son, the seventeenth Lord, who was taken Prisoner of War on 12 June 1940. Between 1944 and 1945 he was one of the \\"Prominente\\" prisoners at Colditz Castle (Oflag IV-C). On his death in 1975 the titles passed to his nephew, the eighteenth Lord. the titles are held by the latter's son, the nineteenth Lord, who succeeded in 1994 at the age of fourteen. He is Chief of Clan Elphinstone. Lord Elphinstone is a third cousin of Prince William, Duke of Cambridge. Other members of the Elphinstone family include James Elphinstone, 1st Lord Balmerinoch, younger son of the third Lord Elphinstone. Lord Balmerinoch's younger son was James Elphinstone, 1st Lord Coupar. Another member was George Keith Elphinstone, 1st Viscount Keith; he was the fifth son of the tenth Lord Elphinstone. Lord Keith's daughter Margaret Keith, 2nd Baroness Keith (who had succeeded to the two baronies of Keith held by her father according to special remainders in the letters patent), inherited the Lordship of Nairne in 1837, a title which is now held by the Viscount Mersey.

It was acquired by Random House in 1973, which in turn was acquired by Bertelsmann in 1998 and remains part of that company today. Ballantine's logo is a pair of mirrored letter Bs back to back. The firm's early editors were Stanley Kauffmann and Bernard Shir-Cliff.  History  Following Fawcett Publications' controversial 1950 introduction of Gold Medal paperback originals rather than reprints, Lion Books, Avon and Ace also decided to publish originals. In 1952, Ian Ballantine, a founder of Bantam Books, announced that he would \\"offer trade publishers a plan for simultaneous publishing of original titles in two editions, a hardcover 'regular' edition for bookstore sale, and a paper-cover, 'newsstand' size, low-priced edition for mass market sale.\\" When the first Ballantine Book, Cameron Hawley's Executive Suite was published in 1952, the publishing industry saw that the simultaneous hardcover and paperback editions were obvious successes. Houghton Mifflin published the $3.00 hardcover at the same time Ballantine distributed its 35¬¢ paperback. By February 1953, Ballantine had sold 375,000 copies and was preparing to print 100,000 more. Houghton Mifflin sold 22,000 hardback copies in its first printing. Ballantine's sales soon totaled 470,000 copies. Instead of hurting hardback sales as some predicted, the paperback edition instead gave the book more publicity. After the film rights were sold to MGM, Robert Wise directed the 1954 film, nominated for four Academy Awards. On the heels of that kind of sales and publicity, other Ballantine titles were seen in spinner racks across the country. Executive Suite was followed by Hal Ellson's The Golden Spike (#2), Stanley Baron's All My Enemies (#3), Luke Short's Saddle by Starlight (#4, also with Houghton Mifflin), Ruth Park's The Witch's Thorn (#5, also with Houghton Mifflin), Emile Danoen's Tides of Tide (#6), Frank Bonham's Blood on the Land (#7), Al Capp's The World of Li'l Abner (#8, with Farrar, Straus & Young) and LaSelle Gilman's The Red Gate (#9). Science fiction and fantasy books During the early 1950s, Ballantine attracted attention as one of the leading publishers of paperback science fiction and fantasy, beginning with The Space Merchants (#21). The Frederik Pohl and C. M. Kornbluth novel had first appeared in Galaxy Science Fiction under the title Gravy Planet. Kauffman scored when he acquired and edited Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 (originally in Galaxy as a shorter version, \\"The Firemen\\"). Ballantine's science fiction line also included the unusual Star Science Fiction Stories. With cover paintings by Richard Powers, this innovative anthology series offered new fiction rather than reprints. Edited by Frederik Pohl, it attracted readers by successfully combining the formats of both magazines and paperbacks. In the early 1960s, the company engaged in a well-known rivalry with Ace Books for the rights to reprint the works of J. R. R. Tolkien and Edgar Rice Burroughs in paperback form. Ballantine prevailed in the struggle for the Tolkien work, with their editions of Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings including a message on the back cover from Tolkien himself urging consumers to buy Ballantine's version and boycott \\"unauthorized editions\\" (i.e. the version from Ace Books). A separate Canadian edition of the books was published with different front cover art work. Tolkien asked for (and received) permission to add the back cover message. Betty Ballantine recalled: \\"And we did put a little statement on the back covers saying that Ace was not paying royalties to Professor Tolkien, and everybody who admired Lord of the Rings should only buy our paperback edition. Well, everybody got behind us. There was literally no publication that did not carry some kind of outraged article. And of course, the whole science fiction fraternity got behind the book; this was their meat and drink.\\" In 1969, Lin Carter edited the Ballantine Adult Fantasy series, which brought a number of rare titles back into print, as well as launching Katherine Kurtz's Deryni series. During the mid-1970s, Ballantine published the Star Trek Logs, a ten-volume series of Alan Dean Foster adaptations of the animated Star Trek. In 1968, Ballantine published a non-fiction book related to Star Trek, The Making of Star Trek by Stephen E. Whitfield and Gene Roddenberry. In 1976, Ballantine published the novelization of a forthcoming science fiction film, Star Wars: From the Adventures of Luke Skywalker by George Lucas (ghostwritten by Alan Dean Foster). The book, like the film Star Wars released the following year, was an enormous success and sold out its initial print run. In the first three months, Ballantine sold 3.5 million copies. Cartoons, comics and humor books Grab Your Socks! After publishing The World of Li'l Abner, Ballantine introduced Shel Silverstein in 1956 with his Grab Your Socks! collection of cartoons from Pacific Stars and Stripes. Ballantine also published several collections of Jim Davis' comic strip Garfield. As an editor at Ballantine during the 1950s and 1960s, Bernard Shir-Cliff handled the Zacherley anthologies, the paperback of Hunter Thompson's Hell's Angels, Harvey Kurtzman's The Mad Reader and other early Mad paperbacks. He made four contributions to Mad and other magazines edited by Kurtzman. In 1956, Shir- Cliff edited a humor anthology, The Wild Reader, for Ballantine, including essays, poems and satirical pieces by Robert Benchley, Art Buchwald, Tom Lehrer, John Lardner, Shepherd Mead, Ogden Nash, S. J. Perelman, Frank Sullivan, James Thurber and others. The 154-page paperback was illustrated with cartoons by Kelly Freas who also did the front cover. Another contributor to both Ballantine and the Kurtzman magazines was the cartoonist-author Roger Price. He did two humor books for Ballantine.

The first few harmonic divisor numbers are :1, 6, 28, 140, 270, 496, 672, 1638, 2970, 6200, 8128, 8190 . Examples For example, the harmonic divisor number 6 has the four divisors 1, 2, 3, and 6. Their harmonic mean is an integer: : \\\\frac{4}{\\\\frac{1}{1}+\\\\frac{1}{2}+\\\\frac{1}{3}+\\\\frac{1}{6}}=2. The number 140 has divisors 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 10, 14, 20, 28, 35, 70, and 140. Their harmonic mean is: : \\\\frac{12}{\\\\frac{1}{1}+\\\\frac{1}{2}+\\\\frac{1}{4}+\\\\frac{1}{5}+\\\\frac{1}{7}+\\\\frac{1}{10} +\\\\frac{1}{14}+\\\\frac{1}{20}+\\\\frac{1}{28}+\\\\frac{1}{35}+\\\\frac{1}{70}+\\\\frac{1}{140}}=5 5 is an integer, making 140 a harmonic divisor number. Factorization of the harmonic mean The harmonic mean of the divisors of any number can be expressed as the formula :H(n) = \\\\frac{n\\\\sigma_0(n)}{\\\\sigma_1(n)} where is the sum of th powers of the divisors of : is the number of divisors, and is the sum of divisors . All of the terms in this formula are multiplicative, but not completely multiplicative. Therefore, the harmonic mean is also multiplicative. This means that, for any positive integer , the harmonic mean can be expressed as the product of the harmonic means for the prime powers in the factorization of . For instance, we have :H(4) = \\\\frac{3}{1+\\\\frac{1}{2}+\\\\frac{1}{4}}=12/7 :H(5) = \\\\frac{2}{1+\\\\frac{1}{5}} = 5/3, :H(7) = \\\\frac{2}{1+\\\\frac{1}{7}} = 7/4, and :H(140) = H(4 \\\\cdot 5 \\\\cdot 7) = H(4)\\\\cdot H(5)\\\\cdot H(7) = \\\\frac{12}{7}\\\\cdot \\\\frac{5}{3}\\\\cdot \\\\frac{7}{4} = 5.  Harmonic divisor numbers and perfect numbers  Demonstration, with Cuisenaire rods, of the perfection of the number 6 For any integer M, as Ore observed, the product of the harmonic mean and arithmetic mean of its divisors equals M itself, as can be seen from the definitions. Therefore, M is harmonic, with harmonic mean of divisors k, if and only if the average of its divisors is the product of M with a unit fraction 1/k. Ore showed that every perfect number is harmonic. To see this, observe that the sum of the divisors of a perfect number M is exactly 2M; therefore, the average of the divisors is M(2/œÑ(M)), where œÑ(M) denotes the number of divisors of M. For any M, œÑ(M) is odd if and only if M is a square number, for otherwise each divisor d of M can be paired with a different divisor M/d. But, no perfect number can be a square: this follows from the known form of even perfect numbers and from the fact that odd perfect numbers (if they exist) must have a factor of the form qŒ± where Œ± ‚â° 1 (mod 4). Therefore, for a perfect number M, œÑ(M) is even and the average of the divisors is the product of M with the unit fraction 2/œÑ(M); thus, M is a harmonic divisor number. Ore conjectured that no odd harmonic divisor numbers exist other than 1. If the conjecture is true, this would imply the nonexistence of odd perfect numbers.  Bounds and computer searches  W. H. Mills (unpublished; see Muskat) showed that any odd harmonic divisor number above 1 must have a prime power factor greater than 107, and Cohen showed that any such number must have at least three different prime factors. showed that there are no odd harmonic divisor numbers smaller than 1024. Cohen, Goto, and others starting with Ore himself have performed computer searches listing all small harmonic divisor numbers. From these results, lists are known of all harmonic divisor numbers up to 2√ó109, and all harmonic divisor numbers for which the harmonic mean of the divisors is at most 300.

It generally consists of a handle or block to which filaments are affixed in either a parallel or perpendicular orientation, depending on the way the brush is to be gripped during use. The material of both the block and bristles or filaments is chosen to withstand hazards of its intended use, such as corrosive chemicals, heat or abrasion. It is used for cleaning, grooming hair, make up, painting, surface finishing and for many other purposes. It is one of the most basic and versatile tools in use today, and the average household may contain several dozen varieties. History When houses were first inhabited, homeowners used branches taken from shrubs to sweep up dirt, hence using the first brushes. In 1859, the first brush factory in America was set up in New York. Manufacture A common way of setting the bristles, brush filaments, in the brush is the staple or anchor set brush in which the filament is forced with a staple by the middle into a hole with a special driver and held there by the pressure against all of the walls of the hole and the portions of the staple nailed to the bottom of the hole. The staple can be replaced with a kind of anchor, which is a piece of rectangular profile wire that is anchored to the wall of the hole, like in most toothbrushes. Another way to attach the bristles to the surface can be found in a fused brush, in which instead of being inserted into a hole, a plastic fibre is welded to another plastic surface, giving the option to use different diameters of bristles in the same brush. Configurations include twisted-in wire (e.g. bottle brushes), cylinders and disks (with bristles spread in one face or radially).

They began with the improvement of Scottish Lowlands farmland and the beginning of a transformation of Scottish agriculture from one of the least modernised systems to what was to become the most modern and productive system in Europe. The traditional system of agriculture in Scotland generally used the runrig system of management, which had possibly originated in the late medieval period. The basic pre-improvement farming unit was the (in the Highlands) and the fermetoun (in the Lowlands). In each, a small number of families worked open-field arable and shared grazing. Whilst run rig varied in its detail from place to place, the common defining detail was the sharing out by lot on a regular (probably annual) basis of individual parts (\\"rigs\\") of the arable land so that families had intermixed plots in different parts of the field. Use of the term The term Scottish Agricultural Revolution was used in the early twentieth century primarily to refer to the period of most dramatic change in the second half of the eighteenth century and early nineteenth century. More recently historians have become aware of a longer processes, with change beginning in the late seventeenth century and still continuing into the mid-nineteenth century. The expansion of the period covered has led some to question the concept of a revolution.I. D. Whyte and K. A. Whyte, The Changing Scottish Landscape: 1500‚Äì1800 (London: Taylor & Francis, 1991), , p. 126. History=Seventeenth century Runrig farming outside the town of Haddington, East Lothian c. 1690 Before the seventeenth century, with difficult terrain, poor roads and methods of transport there was little trade between different areas of the country and most settlements depended on what was produced locally, often with very little in reserve in bad years. Most farming was based on the lowland fermtoun or highland baile, settlements of a handful of families that jointly farmed an area notionally suitable for two or three plough teams, allocated in run rigs, of \\"runs\\" (furrows) and \\"rigs\\" (ridges), to tenant farmers. Most ploughing was done with a heavy wooden plough with an iron coulter, pulled by oxen, which were more effective in the heavy Scottish soil, and cheaper to feed than horses.J. Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470‚Äì1625 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), , pp. 41‚Äì55. Those with property rights included husbandmen, lesser landholders and free tenants. Below them were the cottars, who often shared rights to common pasture, occupied small portions of land and participated in joint farming as hired labour. Farms also might have grassmen, who had rights only to grazing.R. Mitchison, Lordship to Patronage, Scotland 1603‚Äì1745 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1983), , p. 82. Three acts of parliament passed in 1695 allowed the consolidation of runrigs and the division of common land.K. Bowie, \\"New perspectives on pre-union Scotland\\" in T. M. Devine and J. Wormald, eds, The Oxford Handbook of Modern Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), , p. 314. Eighteenth century After the union with England in 1707, there was a conscious attempt among the gentry and nobility to improve agriculture in Scotland. The Society of Improvers was founded in 1723, including in its 300 members dukes, earls, lairds and landlords.J. D. Mackie, B. Lenman and G. Parker, A History of Scotland (London: Penguin, 1991), , pp. 288‚Äì91.

In the first half of the century these changes were limited to tenanted farms in East Lothian and the estates of a few enthusiasts, such as John Cockburn and Archibald Grant. Not all were successful, with Cockburn driving himself into bankruptcy, but the ethos of improvement spread among the landed classes.I. D. Whyte, \\"Economy: primary sector: 1 Agriculture to 1770s\\", in M. Lynch, ed., The Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), , pp. 206‚Äì7. Sheep feeding on turnips, Auchindrain, ArgyllThe English plough was introduced along with foreign grasses, the sowing of rye grass and clover. Turnips and cabbages were introduced, lands enclosed and marshes drained, lime was put down, roads built and woods planted. Drilling and sowing and crop rotation were introduced. The introduction of the potato to Scotland in 1739 greatly improved the diet of the peasantry. Enclosures began to displace the runrig system and free pasture. There was increasing specialisation, with the Lothians became a major centre of grain, Ayrshire of cattle breeding and The Borders of sheep. Although some estate holders improved the quality of life of their displaced workers, the Agricultural Revolution led directly to what is increasingly becoming known as the Lowland Clearances,Robert Allan Houston and Ian D. Whyte, Scottish Society, 1500‚Äì1800 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005), , pp. 148‚Äì151. with hundreds of thousands of cottars and tenant farmers from central and southern Scotland emigrating from the farms and small holdings their families had occupied for hundreds of years, or adapting them to the Scottish Agricultural Revolution. Nineteenth century An 1851 illustration showing the reaping machine developed by Patrick Bell Improvement continued in the nineteenth century. Innovations included the first working reaping machine, developed by Patrick Bell in 1828. His rival James Smith turned to improving sub-soil drainage and developed a method of ploughing that could break up the subsoil barrier without disturbing the topsoil. Previously unworkable low-lying carselands could now be brought into arable production and the result was the even Lowland landscape that still predominates.G. Sprot, \\"Agriculture, 1770s onwards\\", in M. Lynch, ed., Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011), , pp. 321‚Äì3. While the Lowlands had seen widespread agricultural improvement, the financially broken Highland lairds took to replacing Highland agricultural practice with its own system of labour with Lowland agricultural practice plus labour in the Highland Clearances.M. Gray, The Highland Economy, 1750‚Äì1850 (London: Greenwood, 1976), . A handful of powerful families, typified by the dukes of Argyll, Atholl, Buccleuch, and Sutherland, owned enormous sections of Scotland and had extensive influence on political affairs (certainly up to 1885). As late as 1878, 68 families owned nearly half the land in Scotland.H. Pelling, Social Geography of British Elections 1885‚Äì1910 (1960, Gregg Revivals, rpt., 1994), , p. 373. Particularly after the end of the boom created by the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars (1790‚Äì1815), these landlords needed cash to maintain their position in London society. They turned to money rents and downplayed the traditional patriarchal relationship that had historically sustained the clans. Crofts at Borreraig on the island of Skye One result of these changes were the Highland Clearances, in which many tenants in the Highlands were evicted as lands were enclosed, principally so that they could be used for sheep farming. The clearances followed patterns of agricultural change throughout the UK, though were notorious as a result of the introduction of Lowland farmhands or practice into Highland agricultural land or practice, plus the lack of legal protection for year-by-year tenants under Scots law, and the abruptness of the change from the traditional clan system.E. Richards, The Highland Clearances: People, Landlords and Rural Turmoil (Edinburgh, Birlinn Press, 2008), . The result was a continuous exodus from the land‚Äîto the cities, or further afield to England, Canada, America or Australia.J. Wormald, Scotland: a History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005), , p. 229. Consequences The Lowland and Highland Clearances meant that many small settlements were dismantled, their occupants forced either to the new purpose-built villages built by the landowners such as John Cockburn's Ormiston or Archibald Grant's MonymuskD. Ross, Scotland: History of a Nation (Lomond Books, 2000), , p. 229. on the outskirts of the new ranch-style farms, or to the new industrial centres of Glasgow, Edinburgh, or northern England. Tens of thousands of others emigrated to Canada or the United States, finding opportunities there to own and farm their own land. In the Highlands many that remained were now crofters, living on very small rented farms with indefinite tenure used to raise various crops and animals. For these families kelping, fishing, spinning of linen and military service became important sources of additional revenue.M. J.

Thus, the angle Œ∏ does not change as its vertex is moved around on the circle. In geometry, an inscribed angle is the angle formed in the interior of a circle when two secant lines intersect on the circle. It can also be defined as the angle subtended at a point on the circle by two given points on the circle. Equivalently, an inscribed angle is defined by two chords of the circle sharing an endpoint. The inscribed angle theorem relates the measure of an inscribed angle to that of the central angle subtending the same arc. The inscribed angle theorem appears as Proposition 20 on Book 3 of Euclid‚Äôs \\"Elements\\". Theorem=Statement For fixed points A and B, the set of points M in the plane for which the angle AMB is equal to Œ± is an arc of a circle. The measure of ‚à† AOB, where O is the center of the circle, is 2Œ±. The inscribed angle theorem states that an angle Œ∏ inscribed in a circle is half of the central angle 2Œ∏ that subtends the same arc on the circle. Therefore, the angle does not change as its vertex is moved to different positions on the circle. ProofInscribed angles where one chord is a diameter= Case: One chord is a diameter Let O be the center of a circle, as in the diagram at right. Choose two points on the circle, and call them V and A. Draw line VO and extended past O so that it intersects the circle at point B which is diametrically opposite the point V. Draw an angle whose vertex is point V and whose sides pass through points A and B. Draw line OA. Angle BOA is a central angle; call it Œ∏. Lines OV and OA are both radii of the circle, so they have equal lengths. Therefore, triangle VOA is isosceles, so angle BVA (the inscribed angle) and angle VAO are equal; let each of them be denoted as œà. Angles BOA and AOV are supplementary. They add up to 180¬∞, since line VB passing through O is a straight line. Therefore, angle AOV measures 180¬∞ ‚àí Œ∏. It is known that the three angles of a triangle add up to 180¬∞, and the three angles of triangle VOA are: : 180¬∞ ‚àí Œ∏ : œà : œà. Therefore, : 2 \\\\psi + 180^\\\\circ - \\\\theta = 180^\\\\circ. Subtract 180¬∞ from both sides, : 2 \\\\psi = \\\\theta, where Œ∏ is the central angle subtending arc AB and œà is the inscribed angle subtending arc AB. =Inscribed angles with the center of the circle in their interior= Case: Center interior to angle Given a circle whose center is point O, choose three points V, C, and D on the circle. Draw lines VC and VD: angle DVC is an inscribed angle. Now draw line VO and extend it past point O so that it intersects the circle at point E. Angle DVC subtends arc DC on the circle. Suppose this arc includes point E within it. Point E is diametrically opposite to point V. Angles DVE and EVC are also inscribed angles, but both of these angles have one side which passes through the center of the circle, therefore the theorem from the above Part 1 can be applied to them. Therefore, : \\\\angle DVC = \\\\angle DVE + \\\\angle EVC. then let : \\\\psi_0 = \\\\angle DVC, : \\\\psi_1 = \\\\angle DVE, : \\\\psi_2 = \\\\angle EVC, so that : \\\\psi_0 = \\\\psi_1 + \\\\psi_2. \\\\qquad \\\\qquad (1) Draw lines OC and OD. Angle DOC is a central angle, but so are angles DOE and EOC, and : \\\\angle DOC = \\\\angle DOE + \\\\angle EOC. Let : \\\\theta_0 = \\\\angle DOC, : \\\\theta_1 = \\\\angle DOE, : \\\\theta_2 = \\\\angle EOC, so that : \\\\theta_0 = \\\\theta_1 + \\\\theta_2. \\\\qquad \\\\qquad (2) From Part One we know that \\\\theta_1 = 2 \\\\psi_1 and that \\\\theta_2 = 2 \\\\psi_2 . Combining these results with equation (2) yields : \\\\theta_0 = 2 \\\\psi_1 + 2 \\\\psi_2 therefore, by equation (1), : \\\\theta_0 = 2 \\\\psi_0. =Inscribed angles with the center of the circle in their exterior= Case: Center exterior to angle The previous case can be extended to cover the case where the measure of the inscribed angle is the difference between two inscribed angles as discussed in the first part of this proof. Given a circle whose center is point O, choose three points V, C, and D on the circle. Draw lines VC and VD: angle DVC is an inscribed angle. Now draw line VO and extend it past point O so that it intersects the circle at point E. Angle DVC subtends arc DC on the circle. Suppose this arc does not include point E within it. Point E is diametrically opposite to point V. Angles EVD and EVC are also inscribed angles, but both of these angles have one side which passes through the center of the circle, therefore the theorem from the above Part 1 can be applied to them. Therefore, : \\\\angle DVC = \\\\angle EVC - \\\\angle EVD . then let : \\\\psi_0 = \\\\angle DVC, : \\\\psi_1 = \\\\angle EVD, : \\\\psi_2 = \\\\angle EVC, so that : \\\\psi_0 = \\\\psi_2 - \\\\psi_1. \\\\qquad \\\\qquad (3) Draw lines OC and OD. Angle DOC is a central angle, but so are angles EOD and EOC, and : \\\\angle DOC = \\\\angle EOC - \\\\angle EOD. Let : \\\\theta_0 = \\\\angle DOC, : \\\\theta_1 = \\\\angle EOD, : \\\\theta_2 = \\\\angle EOC, so that : \\\\theta_0 = \\\\theta_2 - \\\\theta_1. \\\\qquad \\\\qquad (4) From Part One we know that \\\\theta_1 = 2 \\\\psi_1 and that \\\\theta_2 = 2 \\\\psi_2 . Combining these results with equation (4) yields : \\\\theta_0 = 2 \\\\psi_2 - 2 \\\\psi_1 therefore, by equation (3), : \\\\theta_0 = 2 \\\\psi_0. Corollary By a similar argument, the angle between a chord and the tangent line at one of its intersection points equals half of the central angle subtended by the chord. See also Tangent lines to circles. Applications The inscribed angle theorem is used in many proofs of elementary Euclidean geometry of the plane. A special case of the theorem is Thales' theorem, which states that the angle subtended by a diameter is always 90¬∞, i.e., a right angle. As a consequence of the theorem, opposite angles of cyclic quadrilaterals sum to 180¬∞; conversely, any quadrilateral for which this is true can be inscribed in a circle. As another example, the inscribed angle theorem is the basis for several theorems related to the power of a point with respect to a circle. Further, it allows one to prove that when two chords intersect in a circle, the products of the lengths of their pieces are equal.

It became extinct with the death of the twelfth earl in 2011. History The Percevals claimed to be an ancient Anglo-Norman family, a branch of the House of Yvery. This branch of the family traces its lineage to David Perceval, Lord of Tykenham, Rolleston, Sydenham, Moreland, Weley, and Wolmerton in Somerset, in the 16th century. His grandson was Sir Richard Percivale (1550‚Äì1620), agent of William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley. Sir Richard deciphered coded letters that gave Queen Elizabeth I the first intelligence of the Spanish Armada. He served as Secretary of the Court of Wards and Registrar of the Court of Wards in Ireland, where he acquired large estates. Sir Richard's son Sir Philip Perceval (1605‚Äì1647), obtained grants of forfeited lands in Ireland to the amount of 101,000 statute acres. His eldest son, John Perceval, on 9 September 1661, was created a Baronet, of Kanturk in the County of Cork, in the Baronetage of Ireland. The baronetcy was created by patent with a clause, that the eldest son, or grandson, would become a baronet after the age of 21, and during the lifetime of the father or grandfather, as the case would be.Gibson, Charles Bernard (1861). The history of the county and city of Cork, Volume 2, T.C. Newby. p. 68 footnote]) Robert (1657‚Äì1677), second son of the first baronet, was assassinated in 1677 by an unknown hand, in the Strand, London. The first baronet was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Baronet, who died unmarried at an early age and was succeeded by his younger brother, the third Baronet. He also died at an early age and was succeeded by his eldest son, the fourth Baronet. He died at the age of nine and the titles were inherited by his younger brother, the fifth Baronet, John Perceval. He represented Cork in the Irish House of Commons and Harwich in the British House of Commons and also served as the first President of the trustees of Georgia. Perceval was created Baron Perceval, of Burton in the County of Cork, in 1715, with remainder to the heirs male of his father, and Viscount Perceval, of Kanturk in the County of Cork, in 1722, and Earl of Egmont in 1733, with remainder to the heirs male of his body. All three titles were in the Peerage of Ireland. Perceval claimed descent from the Egmonts of Holland but the title of the earldom was taken from a place in County Cork where the family owned an estate. His son, the second Earl, was a prominent politician and notably served as First Lord of the Admiralty. In 1762 he was created Baron Lovel and Holland, of Enmore in the County of Somerset, in the Peerage of Great Britain, which gave him an automatic seat in the British House of Lords. His seventh son (second from his second marriage) was Prime Minister the Rt. Hon. Spencer Perceval (who was assassinated by John Bellingham in the lobby of the House of Commons, in 1812). Lord Egmont was succeeded by his eldest son, the third Earl, who sat as a Member of Parliament for Bridgwater. His grandson, the fifth Earl, briefly represented East Looe in the House of Commons. He was succeeded by his cousin, the sixth Earl, who had already succeeded his father as third Baron Arden (see below). He was Member of Parliament for West Surrey. On his death the titles passed to his nephew, the seventh Earl. He was the son of Reverend the Hon. Charles George Perceval, fourth son of the second Baron Arden. He represented Midhurst in Parliament as a Conservative. He was succeeded by his first cousin once removed, the eighth Earl. He was the grandson of Reverend the Hon. Arthur Philip Perceval, sixth son of the second Baron Arden. On the death in 1929 of his younger brother, the ninth Earl, this line of the family also failed and the titles became dormant. They were claimed by the late Earl's third cousin Frederick Joseph Trevelyan Perceval, who lived in Canada. He was the grandson of Frederick James Perceval, second son of Prime Minister Spencer Perceval, seventh son of the second Earl. He died in 1932 before he had established his claim. However, in 1939 the House of Lords allowed the claim of his only son Frederick George Moore Perceval, who became the eleventh Earl (his father having posthumously been deemed the tenth Earl). At his death in 2001, the eleventh Earl was succeeded in the earldom by his eldest and sole surviving son Thomas Frederick Gerald Perceval. The twelfth Earl never married, and upon his death on 6 November 2011 the earldom and all of its subsidiary titles became extinct.Fredrick and Constance Perceval Obituary, Calgary Herald The title of Baroness Arden, of Lohort Castle in the County of Cork, was created in the Peerage of Ireland in 1770 for Catherine Perceval, Countess of Egmont, second wife of the second Earl of Egmont. She was the daughter of the Hon. Charles Compton, younger son of George Compton, 4th Earl of Northampton. Lady Arden was succeeded by her eldest son, the second Baron. He represented Launceston, Warwick and Totnes in Parliament and served as Master of the Mint from 1801 to 1802. The latter year he was created Baron Arden, of Arden in the County of Warwick, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the third Baron, who in 1841 succeeded his cousin as sixth Earl of Egmont. Mount Taranaki/Egmont in New Zealand was named after the second Earl of Egmont by James Cook.

The film was written and directed by Tom Tykwer, and stars Franka Potente as Lola and Moritz Bleibtreu as Manni. The story follows a woman who needs to obtain 100,000 Deutschmarks in twenty minutes to save her boyfriend's life. Run Lola Run screened at the Venice Film Festival, where it competed for the Golden Lion. Following its release, the film received critical acclaim and several accolades, including the Grand Prix of the Belgian Syndicate of Cinema Critics, the Audience Award at the Sundance Film Festival, Best Film at the Seattle International Film Festival, and seven awards at the German Film Awards. It was also selected as the German entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 71st Academy Awards, though it was not ultimately nominated. Plot The house in Albrechtstra√üe (Berlin-Mitte) where the three episodes begin Lola receives a frantic phone call from her boyfriend Manni, a bagman responsible for delivering 100,000 Deutschmarks. Over the phone, Manni explains that he was riding the subway to the drop-off location of the money and panicked at the sight of ticket inspectors, exiting the train before realizing that he had left the money bag behind; he saw a homeless man examining it as the train pulled away. Manni is meeting his boss in 20 minutes and will be killed unless he has the money. He is about to rob a nearby supermarket to replace the funds. Lola implores Manni to wait for her and decides to ask her father, a bank manager, for help. Lola hangs up and runs down the staircase of her apartment building past a man with a dog. At the bank, her father is having a conversation with his mistress, who informs him that she is pregnant. When Lola arrives, her conversation with her father turns into an argument. He tells her that he is leaving her mother and that Lola is not his biological daughter. Lola runs to meet Manni, but arrives too late and sees him enter the supermarket with a gun. She helps him rob the supermarket of 100,000 marks, but on leaving, they find it surrounded by police. Surrendering, Manni throws the money bag into the air, which startles a police officer who accidentally shoots Lola dead. Events restart from the moment Lola leaves the house. This time, she trips over the man with the dog and now runs with a limp, so her arrival at the bank is delayed, allowing her father's mistress to add that Lola's father is not the father of her unborn child. A furious Lola overhears the conversation, grabs a security guard's gun, holds her father hostage, and robs the bank of 100,000 marks. When police mistake her for a bystander, she is able to leave and meet with Manni in time, but he is run over and killed by a speeding ambulance that Lola had distracted moments earlier. Events restart once more. This time, Lola leaps over the man and his dog, arriving at the bank earlier but not triggering an auto accident as she did the first two times. Consequently, her father's colleague arrives before her and takes her father away from the office. Lola now wanders aimlessly before entering a casino, where she hands over all the cash she has and plays roulette with a single 100-mark chip. She bets it on the number 20, which wins. Roulette pays 35 to 1, so she wins 3,500 more marks, which she immediately adds to her original chip on 20. She now makes a deafening scream, causing 20 to come up again. She leaves with a bag containing 129,600 marks, and runs to where Manni will be meeting his boss. Meanwhile, Manni spots the homeless man from the subway passing by on a bicycle with the money bag. Manni steals back the bag at gunpoint, giving the man his gun in exchange. Lola arrives to witness Manni handing off the money to his boss. Manni joins Lola, who is dishevelled and perspiring. As they walk along, Manni casually asks her what is in her bag.

Through brief flash-forward sequences of still images, Lola's fleeting interactions with bystanders are revealed to have surprising and drastic effects on their future lives, serving as concise illustrations of chaos theory's butterfly effect, in which minor, seemingly inconsequential variations in any interaction can blossom into much wider results than is often recognized. The film's exploration of the relationship between chance and conscious intention comes to the foreground in the casino scene, where Lola appears to defy the laws of chance through sheer force of will, improbably making the roulette ball land on her winning number with the help of a glass-shattering scream. The thematic exploration of free will vs. determinism is made clear from the start. In the film's brief prologue, an unseen narrator asks a series of rhetorical questions that prime the audience to view the film through a metaphysical lens touching on traditional philosophical questions involving determinism vs. philosophic libertarianism, as well as epistemology. The theme is reinforced through the repeated appearance of a blind woman who briefly interacts with Manni in each alternative reality, and seems to have supernatural understandings of both the present and potential futures in those realities. The film ultimately seems to favor a compatibilist philosophical view to the free will question as evidenced by the casino scene and by the final telephone booth scene in which the blind woman redirects Manni's attention to a passerby, which enables him to make an important choice near the film's climax. Several moments in the film allude to a supernatural awareness of the characters. For example, in the first reality, Manni shows a nervous Lola how to use a gun by removing the safety, while in the second timeline she removes the safety as though she remembers what to do. This suggests that she might have the memory of the events depicted in the previous timeline. Also, the bank's guard says to Lola \\"you finally came\\" in the third timeline, as if he remembered Lola's appearances in the previous two. Allusions to earlier films The film features two allusions to Alfred Hitchcock's film Vertigo. Like that film, it features recurring images of spirals, such as the Spirale bar behind Manni's phone box and the spiral staircase down which Lola runs. In addition, the painting on the back wall of the casino of a woman's head seen from behind is based on a shot in Vertigo: Tykwer disliked the empty space on the wall behind the roulette table and commissioned production designer Alexander Manasse to paint a picture of Kim Novak as she appeared in Vertigo. Manasse could not remember what she looked like in the film; therefore, he decided to paint the famous shot of the back of her head. The painting took fifteen minutes to complete.Tom Tykwer, commentary on the DVD edition of the film. The bed sheets in the red scenes also feature spiral designs which add to the allusion. Production=Soundtrack The soundtrack of the film, by Tykwer, Johnny Klimek, and Reinhold Heil, includes numerous musical quotations of the sustained string chords of The Unanswered Question, an early 20th-century chamber ensemble work by American composer Charles Ives. In the original work, the chords are meant to represent \\"the Silences of the Druids‚Äîwho Know, See and Hear Nothing.\\" The techno soundtrack established dialectical relation between motives of the movie: Rhythm, Repetition, and Interval among various spatio-temporal logics. This produces unification of contradictions like Time and Space or The cyclical and the linear.Puzzle films: complex storytelling in contemporary cinema, by Warren Buckland, Wiley-Blackwell, 2009, pages 137‚Äì138 Filming locations A supermarket in Berlin-Charlottenburg, which served as the filming location for Manni's and Lola's robbery.

Reception= Critical reception  , the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 93% of critics gave the film positive reviews, based on 82 reviews.

In contrasting reviews, Film Threats Chris Gore said of the film, \\"[It] delivers everything great foreign films should‚Äîaction, sex, compelling characters, clever filmmaking, it's unpretentious (a requirement for me) and it has a story you can follow without having to read those annoying subtitles.

It won several, including the Grand Prix of the Belgian Syndicate of Cinema Critics, the Audience Award at the Sundance Film Festival, Best Film at the Seattle International Film Festival, and seven separate awards at the German Film Awards.

The building was designed by New York-based John Burgee Architects with Philip Johnson in association with Houston-based Morris-Aubry Architects (now known as Morris Architects). Construction began in August 1981, and was completed in December, 1982. The tower is among Houston's most visible buildings as the 4th-tallest in Texas, and the 44th-tallest in the United States. The Williams Tower is the tallest building in Houston outside of Downtown Houston, and is the tallest skyscraper in the United States outside of a city's central business district. History Real estate developer Gerald D. Hines hired New York-based John Burgee Architects with Philip Johnson to design the building, in association with Houston-based Morris-Aubry Architects (now known as Morris Architects). Construction was completed in 1983. The building was named the Transco Tower after its first major tenant, Transco Energy Co. Transco Energy Co. merged with the Williams Companies in 1995 and in 1999 the name of the building was changed to the Williams Tower. In December 2002, Ryan John Hartley climbed the tower and jumped from about halfway up, resulting in his death, which was ruled a suicide. In 2008, Hines REIT Properties LP, an affiliate of Hines Real Estate Investment Trust Inc., purchased the Williams Tower for $271.5 million from Transco Tower Ltd., a partnership consisting of Kuwaiti investors represented by Atlanta-based Fosterlane Management Corp. The building was offered along with a parking garage, a tract across the street from the Williams Tower, and a 48% stake in the Williams Waterwall (now named the Gerald D. Hines Waterwall Park) and the surrounding park; prior to this transaction Hines had already owned the other 52% of the waterwall.\\"Project Sale: Williams Tower.\\" Houston Business Journal. Friday April 10, 2009. Modified on Saturday April 11, 2009. Retrieved on November 15, 2009. On the morning of September 13, 2008, during Hurricane Ike, the top of the tower was damaged near the rotating beacon and many windows were blown out. The skyscraper suffered over $3.5 million in wind damages. Twelve of the 49 elevators were damaged, most by water damage due to roof failures and others due to extreme building sway. Hines Real Estate Investment Trust Inc. put the Williams Tower up for sale in August 2012, selling it to Invesco Ltd. subsidiary Invesco Advisers Inc. for $412 million in March, 2013. Major tenants The building was originally named for its major tenant, Transco Energy corporation, now part of the Williams Companies, the tower's current namesake. Other major tenants include Quanta Services, Valaris plc, Cadence Bank and the Consulate General of Denmark. The tower also serves as the headquarters for the Hines companies. The beacon of the Williams Tower Significance At 64 stories and above the ground level, the Williams Tower is the tallest building in Houston outside of Downtown Houston. When it was constructed in 1983, it was also the world's tallest skyscraper outside of a city's central business district. The building was built to function as two separate towers stacked directly on top of one another, one comprising the first forty floors and the other the forty-first to sixty-fourth. The building has separate banks of elevators and lobbies for each of the two building sections. A majority of the bottom 40 floors are occupied by Williams. The remainder of the building is occupied by a variety of tenants. Williams Tower was named \\"Skyscraper of the Century\\" in the December 1999 issue of Texas Monthly magazine. Paul Gapp of the Chicago Tribune said that the building became an \\"instant classic\\" when it opened.

There are six elevators that take tenants to the 51st floor, where they can transfer to other elevators to get to the 49th through 64th floor of the building. There is no public observation deck. During the night-time hours, the building is defined by a 7,000 watt beacon that sweeps across the sky and can be seen up to 40 miles (65 km) away on a clear night. Topped by such a beacon, the tower hearkens back to the Palmolive Building in Chicago, Illinois. The building, along with its beacon, is a Houston landmark that identifies the Uptown Houston district. The building is connected to a 10 level, 3,208 car parking garage by a sky bridge. The bridge also connects the building to retail outlets, like The Galleria, and two Federal Aviation Administration-licensed helipads. In a grass field adjacent to the Williams Tower is the Gerald D. Hines Waterwall Park. Formerly privately owned in common with the tower, the waterwall and park have been owned by the Uptown Houston Tax Increment Reinvestment Zone, a non-profit local government corporation since 2008. Upward view of the Williams Tower during the day The Houston Business Journal said that the tower was \\"designed to be energy efficient\\". The building received the Environmental Protection Agency's Energy Star label for each year since 2000 in which the building was eligible to receive the award. As of 2009 the building managers are seeking to gain Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification from the United States Green Building Council. 250x250px See also * List of tallest buildings in Houston * List of tallest buildings in Texas * List of tallest buildings in the United States * List of tallest freestanding steel structures ReferencesExternal links * Williams Tower on CTBUH Skyscraper Center * Williams Tower at Houston Architecture Category:Skyscraper office buildings in Houston Category:Office buildings completed in 1983 Category:Philip Johnson buildings Category:John Burgee buildings Category:Postmodern architecture in Texas ","title":"Williams Tower"},{"id":"462774","text":"Florence Court Earl of Enniskillen is a title in the Peerage of Ireland. It was created in 1789 for William Cole, 1st Viscount Enniskillen. He had already been created Viscount Enniskillen in the Peerage of Ireland in 1776 and had inherited the title Baron Mount Florence, of Florence Court in the County of Fermanagh, which had been created in the Peerage of Ireland in 1760 for his father John Cole, who had earlier represented Enniskillen in the Irish House of Commons. Lord Enniskillen was succeeded by his son, the second Earl. He represented Fermanagh in the British House of Commons, served as Lord Lieutenant of County Fermanagh and sat as an Irish Representative Peer in the House of Lords at Westminster from 1804-40. In 1815 he was created Baron Grinstead, of Grinstead in the County of Wiltshire, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, which gave him and the later Earls an automatic seat in the House of Lords. His son, the third Earl, was a palaeontologist and also sat as Conservative Member of Parliament for Fermanagh. He was succeeded by his son, the fourth Earl, who represented Enniskillen in Parliament as a Conservative. His son, the fifth Earl, was Lord Lieutenant of Fermanagh. The title since 1963 The 5th Earl was succeeded by his nephew, Captain David Lowry Cole, M.B.E., M.L.C., who became the 6th Earl. He was the son of The Hon. Galbraith Lowry Egerton Cole, third son of the 4th Earl. David was also a nephew of The Hon. Berkeley Cole and a nephew-in-law to The 3rd Baron Delamere, as well as being a first-cousin of The 4th Baron Delamere. The Cholmondeley family, Barons Delamere, owned (and, in 2012, still own) the vast Soysambu Ranch in Kenya. David Enniskillen (as he was usually known to his family and friends) had been born and raised in the Colony of Kenya. He attended Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge, and then served with the Irish Guards during the Second World War, rising to the British Army rank of Captain. Following the war, the young Capt. D.L. Cole returned to Kenya, serving as a Provisional Commandant in the Kenya Police Reserve (the K.P.R.), 1953‚Äì55. He was appointed a M.B.E. for his services to the British Crown during the Mau Mau Uprising. Capt. D.L. Cole became very involved in colonial politics in Kenya in the late 1950s, serving as a Member of the Legislative Council (M.L.C.) in the final Legislative Council of Kenya, 1961‚Äì1963. He also took part in the conferences at Lancaster House leading up to Kenya's independence, which was achieved within the Commonwealth in December 1963. On 19 February 1963, while still serving as an M.L.C., a few months before Kenyan independence, Capt. Cole succeeded as The 6th Earl of Enniskillen. Shortly after succeeding to the Peerage, the new Lord Enniskillen returned to Northern Ireland. He and his American second wife, Nancy, a former junior diplomat with the United States Foreign Service, lived at Florence Court (newly restored by the National Trust) in southwest County Fermanagh from 1963‚Äì72, when they relocated to Kinloch House, , Amulree, Perthshire, Scotland. David Enniskillen served as a captain in the Ulster Defence Regiment (the U.D.R.), 1971‚Äì1973, during the very early years of The Troubles in Northern Ireland. He also served as Deputy Lieutenant of County Fermanagh, 1963‚Äì78. He lived at Kinloch House until his death in 1989, when he was buried in the grounds of Killesher Parish Church, the Church of Ireland neo-Gothic family church near the village of Florencecourt in south-west County Fermanagh. Nancy, Dowager Countess of Enniskillen (n√©e Nancy MacLennan), formerly of Bridgeport, Connecticut, was also buried at Killesher Parish Church in 1998. The 6th Lord Enniskillen had only two children, both by his first wife, Sonia Mary Syers, whom he married on 31 July 1940. They were divorced early in 1955. The two children were Andrew Cole (born 28 April 1942) and Linda Mar Cole (born 26 March 1944). From 1963-89, Andrew held the courtesy title Viscount Cole. Since the death of his father in 1989, Andrew has been The 7th Earl of Enniskillen (usually known to his family and friends as Andrew Enniskillen). Since February 1963, Linda has been known as Lady Linda Mar Cole. She married Richard Muir (possibly 'Sir' Richard), the presumed 4th Bt., in August 1975. Thus she is also known as Lady Linda Muir. The 7th Lord Enniskillen lives on his 40,000 acre estate near Lake Naivasha in the former 'White Highlands' in southern Kenya. The ancestral seat, certainly from the late 1750s, of the Cole family was Florence Court in south-west County Fermanagh. The house has been in the care of the National Trust since 1953. The last Earl to live in the country house was David, 6th Earl of Enniskillen (1918‚Äì1989), who left in 1972.

Don't Mess with Texas is a slogan for a campaign aimed at reducing littering on Texas roadways by the Texas Department of Transportation. The phrase \\"Don't Mess with Texas\\" is prominently shown on road signs on major highways, television, radio and in print advertisements. The campaign is credited with reducing litter on Texas highways roughly 72% between 1987 and 1990.Tim McClure and Roy Spence, Don't Mess with Texas: The Story Behind the Legend, Idea City Press, 2006, 15. The campaign's target market was 18- to 35-year-old males, which was statistically shown to be the most likely to litter. While the slogan was not originally intended to become a statewide cultural phenomenon, it did. Beyond its immediate role in reducing litter, the slogan has been popularly appropriated by Texans. The phrase has become \\"an identity statement, a declaration of Texas swagger\\". Though the origin of the slogan is not well known outside of Texas, it appears on countless items of tourist souvenirs. Since the phrase is a federally registered trademark, the department has tried at times to enforce its trademark rights with cease and desist letters, but has had very limited success. The slogan is the title of the book, Don‚Äôt Mess With Texas: The Story Behind the Legend. \\"Don't Mess with Texas\\" has been awarded a plaque on the Madison Avenue Walk of Fame and a place in the Advertising Hall of Fame, a distinction given to only two slogans annually. \\"Don't Mess with Texas\\" is also the official motto of the Virginia-class submarine USS Texas. In 2011 the result of a public vote for the best \\"Don't Mess with Texas\\" ad over the last 25 years was revealed, the winner was one created by the Commemorative Air Force (then called the Confederate Air Force). The ad involved the CAF's Boeing B-17 \\"Sentimental Journey\\" pursuing and retaliating against a truck from which trash was thrown.  History  The crest for the submarine USS Texas. The phrase \\"Don't Mess with Texas!\\" can be seen on the lower half of the crest. In 1985 the Texas Department of Transportation (TXDOT) asked Mike Blair and Tim McClure of GSD&M; to create a slogan for an anti-littering campaign. At the time the state of Texas spent about $20 million annually to clean litter from highways. McClure said that \\"bubbas in pickup trucks\\" who regularly littered beer cans and other items out of vehicle windows and ordinary Texans who believed that littering was a \\"God-given right\\" were targets of the advertising campaign. McClure said that he created the slogan when he saw garbage while walking near his house. Emanuella Grinberg of CNN said that McClure had \\"an eleventh hour 'aha' moment\\" when, after looking at the trash, he recalled his mother telling him that his room was messy. \\"McClure said 'It occurred to me that the only time I'd heard the word litter was in reference to dogs. Mess seemed like it would resonate better.'\\"Grinberg, Emanuella. \\"Why there's no messing with Texas.\\" CNN. July 1, 2011. 1 . Retrieved on July 3, 2011. The creators initially had difficulty convincing TXDOT to adopt the slogan. The creators said that the administrators were \\"buzz-cutted, conservative kind of characters.\\" The creators joked that the board members' average age was 107. McClure recalled that \\"The crowd was sprinkled with 'Keep America Beautiful' and 'Keep Texas Beautiful' folks, and our audience is 18-to-24 young males.\\" McClure added that \\"The 'Keep Texas Beautiful' lady said, 'Can we at least say please?' I said, 'No ma'am, you cannot use the line if you put please in front of it.' If not for the vision of Don Clark, the then Director of Travel and Information Division of the Texas Highway Department, the slogan would have never been used. Clark went ahead with the slogan without the support of the TXDOT administrators. After the first televised ad with Stevie Ray Vaughan aired, Clark jokes that he went to work the next day and was unsure if he would be fired. TXDOT decided to ask the public for comment and there was a resounding positive result. \\"Grinberg, Emanuella. \\"Why there's no messing with Texas.\\" CNN. July 1, 2011. 2 . Retrieved on July 3, 2011. The campaign began in 1985 with a series of bumper stickers. In 1986 the slogan premiered its first television advertisement, featuring Stevie Ray Vaughan, at the 50th Annual Cotton Bowl Classic on January 1, 1986, singing the \\"Eyes of Texas\\" with the line \\"Don't Mess with Texas\\" added at the end of the song. Since then, numerous musicians, athletes, celebrities and other famous Texans have appeared in \\"Don't Mess with Texas\\" radio and television public service announcements, including: * Lance Armstrong *Asleep at the Wheel * Erykah Badu * Marcia Ball *Joe \\"King\\" Carrasco * Johnny Dee and the Rocket 88's * Joe Ely *The Fabulous Thunderbirds *George Foreman *Tish Hinojosa * Los Lonely Boys * Jennifer Love Hewitt *Lyle Lovett *Billy Mays *Matthew McConaughey *Warren Moon *Willie Nelson * Slim Thug *Andy Pettitte *LeAnn Rimes * Shamu & the Texas Tuxedos *Stevie Ray Vaughan * Jerry Jeff Walker *George Strait * Owen Wilson * Chuck Norris * Papi Chulo * Whitney K Lane * Morgan Fairchild * Chamillionaire In a 12-year period over 26 television spots appeared. Due to the budget cuts of the Great Recession, TxDOT has expanded the use of the licence to sell \\"Don't Mess With Texas\\" related souvenirs in \\"state run rest areas, and travel information centers\\" in order to fill in its budget gaps. Until recently, the organization was forbidden to do so due to federal regulations. Unauthorized use of the trademark Since 2000, TXDOT has contacted over 100 companies and organizations with cease and desist letters regarding the unauthorized use of the trademark phrase. State officials claim that protecting the trademark helps the state preserve the slogan's anti- littering message. * A Texas-based company in Alabama used the slogan for a billboard campaign in February 2010 * The University of Texas at Austin agreed to stop selling T-shirts with the slogan after being contacted by the Texas Department of Transportation. * The department attempted to block the Texas Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League from the sale of \\"Don't Mess With Texas Women\\" T-shirts. *The author Christie Craig published a romance novel originally titled Don't Mess with Texas.

Thousands of cottars and tenant farmers from the southern counties (Lowlands) of Scotland migrated from farms and small holdings they had occupied to the new industrial centres of Glasgow, Edinburgh and northern England or abroad, or remaining upon land though adapting to the Scottish Agricultural Revolution. History As farmland became more commercialised in Scotland during the 18th century, land was often rented through auctions. This led to an inflation of rents that priced many tenants out of the market.bbc.co.uk: \\"Scotland's forgotten clearances\\" 16 May 2003 Furthermore, changes in agricultural practice meant the replacement of part-time labourer or subtenants (known as cottars, cottagers, or bondsmen) with full-time agricultural labourers who lived either on the main farm or in rented accommodation in growing or newly founded villages. This led many contemporary writers and modern historians to associate the Agricultural Revolution with the disappearance of cottars and their way of life from many parts of the southern Scotland. Many small settlements were torn down, their occupants forced either to the new purpose- built villages built by the landowners such as John Cockburn of Ormiston to house the displaced cottars on the outskirts of the new ranch-style farms, or to the new industrial centres of Glasgow, Edinburgh or northern England. In other areas, such as the southwest, landowners offered low rents and nearby employment to tenants they deemed to be respectable.Eric Richards, \\"Emigration from Scotland between the Wars: Opportunity of Exile?\\", International Migration Review, Vol. 34, No. 3, pp. 113-116. Autumn, 2000. Between 1760 and 1830, many tens of thousands of Lowland Scots emigrated mainly within Lowland Scotland, with some taking advantage of the many new opportunities offered in Canada to own and farm their own land. Most chose to remain, by choice, some out of an inability to secure transatlantic passage, or because of obligations in Scotland.

An important figure in the free jazz movement of the 1960s, she is perhaps best known for her jazz opera Escalator over the Hill (released as a triple LP set), as well as a book of compositions that have been performed by many other artists, including Gary Burton, Jimmy Giuffre, George Russell, Art Farmer, John Scofield and her ex-husband Paul Bley. Early life Carla Bley at Keystone Korner, San Francisco 1979 Bley was born in Oakland, California, United States, to Emil Borg (1899‚Äì1990), a piano teacher and church choirmaster, who encouraged her to sing and to learn to play the piano, and Arline Anderson (1907‚Äì1944), who died when Bley was eight years old. After giving up the church to immerse herself in roller skating at the age of fourteen,Ben Sidran, Talking Jazz: An Illustrated Oral History, Pomegranate Artbooks, 1992 she moved to New York at seventeen and became a cigarette girl at Birdland, where she met jazz pianist Paul Bley. She toured with him under the name Karen Borg, before she changed her name in 1957 to Carla Borg and married Paul Bley the same year adopting the Bley name.Philippe Carles, Andr√© Clergeat, and Jean-Louis Comolli, Dictionnaire du jazz, Paris, 1994 He encouraged her to start composing. The couple later divorced but she kept his surname professionally. Later life and career A number of musicians began to record Bley's compositions: George Russell recorded \\"Bent Eagle\\" on his 1960 release Stratusphunk in 1960; Jimmy Giuffre recorded \\"Ictus\\" on his album Thesis; and Paul Bley's Barrage consisted entirely of her compositions. Throughout her career Bley has thought of herself as a writer first, describing herself as 99 percent composer and one percent pianist.Review of Andando el Tiempo (2017), The Irish Times June 2, 2016 In 1964 she was involved in organising the Jazz Composers Guild, which brought together the most innovative musicians in New York at the time. She then had a personal and professional relationship with Michael Mantler, with whom she had a daughter, Karen, now also a musician in her own right. Bley and Mantler were married from 1965-91. With Mantler, she co-led the Jazz Composers' Orchestra and started the JCOA record label which issued a number of historic recordings by Clifford Thornton, Don Cherry and Roswell Rudd, as well as her own magnum opus Escalator Over The Hill and Mantler's The Jazz Composer's Orchestra LPs. Bley and Mantler were pioneers in the development of independent artist-owned record labels and also started the now defunct New Music Distribution Service which specialized in small, independent labels that issued recordings of \\"creative improvised music\\". She arranged and composed music for bassist Charlie Haden's Liberation Music Orchestra, and wrote A Genuine Tong Funeral for vibraphonist Gary Burton. Bley has collaborated with a number of other artists, including Jack Bruce, Robert Wyatt and Nick Mason, drummer for the rock group Pink Floyd. Mason's solo debut album Nick Mason's Fictitious Sports was entirely written by Bley and performed by her regular band with Mason as a guest, making it in effect a Carla Bley album in all but name. She has continued to record frequently with her own big band, which has included Blood, Sweat & Tears' notable Lew Soloff, and a number of smaller ensembles, notably the Lost Chords. Her partner is the bassist Steve Swallow. In 2005 she arranged the music for and performed on Charlie Haden's latest Liberation Music Orchestra tour and recording, Not in Our Name. She lives in Woodstock, New York.  Awards  Bley was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1972 for music composition. In 2009, she was awarded the German Jazz Trophy \\"A Life for Jazz\\".

It was owned by the Gembicki family, thanks to which it developed, and in 1679 Andrzej Gembicki referred to it as a town. It was granted town rights by King Augustus II the Strong in 1731. In the mid-18th century it was owned by magnate Stanis≈Çaw Poniatowski, father of the last Polish King Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski, and the Poniatowskis' Cio≈Çek coat of arms is the town's coat of arms since. In the 18th century Trzcianka was one of the leading clothmaking centers in Greater Poland, however, after the late 18th-century Partitions of Poland and the annexation of the town by Prussia, the local economy collapsed. In 1807 the town was regained by Poles and included within the short-lived Duchy of Warsaw, in 1815 it was re-annexed by Prussia, and from 1871 it was also part of Germany. In the final months of World War II, Soviet troops marching towards Berlin from the east entered the town on 27 January 1945. In that course, about 500 people committed suicide. Following the war the abandoned town was eventually restored to Poland. Culture There is a local historic museum (Muzeum Ziemi Nadnoteckiej) in Trzcianka.

He was a longtime reporter for ABC, the founding host of ABC's World News Now, weekend anchor of World News Tonight and the host of CNN's flagship evening program NewsNight with Aaron Brown. He was the anchor of the PBS documentary series Wide Angle from 2008 to 2009. He was a professor at the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication at Arizona State University from 2007 to 2014.

Upton December 13, 2011 In 1966, Brown dropped out of the University of Minnesota as a political science major and joined the U.S. Coast Guard reserves. He began his broadcasting career as a radio talk show host in Minneapolis and later in Los Angeles. Before his time at the national news networks, Brown was a Seattle broadcasting staple, spending more than 15 years at television stations there, first at the NBC affiliate and then the CBS affiliate. He was hired by Seattle's KING-TV in 1976, initially working as an assignment editor but soon becoming a reporter and eventually anchor. In 1986 he moved to KIRO-TV, where he anchored the evening newscast, and remained with KIRO until December 1991. ABC Brown was brought to New York City to be the founding anchor of the late-night news program World News Now. He also worked as a reporter for ABC's news operation. He left World News Now to work as a reporter for World News Tonight with Peter Jennings, as well as Nightline and various other ABC programming. He became the substitute anchor for Jennings and the permanent anchor of ABC's World News Tonight Saturday and Good Morning America Sunday. CNN9/11= Although Brown's first day at CNN was July 1, 2001, his first on-air broadcast was September 11, 2001. (Aaron Brown himself states that this is not a fact.). He received international recognition as well as winning the Edward R. Murrow Award for his reporting of the attacks from CNN's rooftop in Manhattan, as well as the World Trade Center site and the areas surrounding the remains of the Twin Towers in New York City. When the South Tower collapsed, Brown was listening to a report from the site of The Pentagon, where there was another attack. The building started to fall while Brown was offcamera, and he had to interrupt the reporter so he could report on what he had seen. Brown remarked that there was another massive explosion and that he could not see the building anymore (he was not aware that the entire building had fallen yet). As the second tower fell on live television, Brown fell silent, until he quietly said, \\"...good Lord...there are no words...\\" and resumed reporting after several seconds. CNN saw Brown as a prot√©g√© of Peter Jennings and wanted to duplicate Jennings' success for their network. CNN branded their flagship evening program NewsNight with Aaron Brown. Brown also served as host of CNN Presents and was assigned the lead anchor during breaking news and special events. =Post 9/11= He covered numerous other news events for CNN, including the War on Terrorism, the 2002 House and Senate elections, the Beltway sniper attacks and the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster. During the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Brown anchored from the CNN Center in Atlanta, providing viewers with the latest information from frontline reports as well as from Washington, D.C. and United States Central Command in Doha, Qatar. In 2003, he garnered negative press attention for continuing to play in the Bob Hope Classic golf tournament in Palm Desert, California, after the Columbia Space Shuttle disaster occurred. While other major news anchors such as Tom Brokaw, Peter Jennings, and Dan Rather immediately left their vacations, Brown did not come into the studio and instead continued playing golf. The New York Times reported that Brown had actually been trying to get back to the studios, but CNN didn't go to special lengths to move Mr. Brown into position because Miles O'Brien, the channel's space expert, was anchoring the unfolding events. During the United States 2004 presidential election, CNN used the NASDAQ Market Site for its election coverage, which some point to as the birth of the idea for Wolf Blitzer's The Situation Room. Brown was tasked to periodically make commentaries on the trends of the evening's results, while Anderson Cooper was then tasked at monitoring key Senate and House races. Brown won three Emmys, including one Emmy for his report \\"Streets of Iraq\\" during the Iraq War. In addition, Brown won a DuPont, two New York Film Society World medals and a George Foster Peabody Award. On November 3, 2005, CNN announced that Brown would be leaving the network, with Anderson Cooper's program Anderson Cooper 360¬∞ replacing NewsNight as the flagship program in CNN's evening lineup in an effort to shift toward a younger demographic. The two had shared anchoring duties in the 10:00 PM time slot through the early fall after Cooper's break out success covering Hurricane Katrina. Many said Brown's cerebral \\"news for grown-ups\\" style would be missed.Former CNN anchor Brown welcomes job at ASUAaron Brown On His Way Out Public broadcasting Brown was under contract with CNN until June 2007, which prevented him from doing interviews or returning to television.

Historically part of the North Riding of Yorkshire, it is south-south east of the county town of Northallerton. According to the 2011 UK Census, the population was 4,998. Thirsk is a popular tourist destination close to the Yorkshire Dales and the North York Moors. It was the home of author James Herriot and birthplace of Thomas Lord, after whom Lord's Cricket Ground is named. Thirsk Racecourse is on the western edge of the town. History Archeological finds indicate that there was a settlement here around 500‚Äì600 BC. The town is mentioned twice in the Domesday Book as Tresche, in the Yarlestre hundred. At the time of the Norman invasion, the manor was split between Orm and Thor, local Saxon landowners. Afterwards, it was split between Hugh, son of Baldric and the Crown. Most of the land was granted thereafter to Robert de Mowbray, after whom the surrounding vale is named. By 1145, what is now Old Thirsk was known as a borough, while the remaining land in the parish was subject to manorial rights. The manor continued to be in the possession of the Mowbrays, despite several claims, until the death of the 16th Lord Mowbray in 1476. With no direct succession, it passed to the daughter of Thomas de Mowbray, 1st Duke of Norfolk, who had married into the Berkeley family. Her son William de Berkeley, 1st Marquess of Berkeley then inherited it on her death. It remained with this family until 1723, when it was sold to Ralph Bell of Sowerby. It remained in the Bell family into the 20th century. The name is derived from the Viking (Old Norse) word √æresk meaning fen or lake. Political history The Mowbrays built a castle on the north side of Castlegate. It is not mentioned in the Domesday Book and an exact date is not recorded, but the castle was completely destroyed by 1176 after the uprising against Henry II. The Mowbrays then built a manor house on the site, but this was destroyed by the Scots in 1322. After the War of the Roses, Henry VII raised taxes, and that caused uprisings in the north. This led to the murder of Henry Percy, 4th Earl of Northumberland, allegedly on The Little Green, when he was sent to collect the taxes. However, other evidence points to the murder occurring in nearby South Kilvington. Industrial history A 1767 Act of Parliament provided for building a navigable waterway to the town from the River Swale along Cod Beck. The project ran out of funds and was never completed, although remains can be seen of the wharf and a lock near Lock Bridge. The Thirsk Poor Law Union was formed in 1837 and covered a large part of the North Riding of Yorkshire. A workhouse was erected in Sutton Road in 1838. A rail crash occurred at Manor House signal box on 2 November 1892, on the North Eastern Railway about north of Thirsk railway station, when an express train collided with the back of a goods train, both heading south in fog. There were 10 people killed and 43 injured. Another rail crash occurred on 31 July 1967 at Thirsk on the British Rail East Coast Main Line. An express train travelling north collided with a derailed freight train on the same line. Seven people were killed and 45 were injured. Social history Memorial to the author Thirsk was home to veterinary surgeon and author James Herriot (pen name of James Alfred Wight, OBE, FRCVS). He called Thirsk Darrowby in the semi-autobiographical books about a vet's life in the Yorkshire Dales. Wight and his business partner Donald Sinclair (Siegfried Farnon in the books) established their veterinary practice at 23 Kirkgate, which now houses The World of James Herriot museum dedicated to Herriot's life and works. Governance Thirsk is in the Thirsk and Malton Parliamentary constituency since its creation for the 2010 general election, before this it was in the Vale of York constituency. At the 2010 UK general election, Anne McIntosh was returned as the constituency's Member of Parliament. Representing the Conservative Party, she won the seat with 52.9% of the vote from a turnout of 50% of the eligible electorate. She stepped down at the 2015 UK general election, and was succeeded by Kevin Hollinrake. The town was a parliamentary borough that had representation in 1295 and then from 1547 to 1885. For the majority of the latter period, it was represented by two members until 1882 when it was reduced to one member. The constituency of Thirsk and Malton was originally created for the 1885 General Elections by the Redistribution of Seats Act of 1885 and existed until 1983. During that period it returned six Conservative party members to parliament, which included one by-election in 1915. It gives its name to the local district ward of Hambleton District Council and to the local electoral division of North Yorkshire County Council. The town returns one Councillor to the County Council and three Councillors to the District Council. The population of this ward at the 2011 Census was 5,988. The Civil Parish of Thirsk was created by the Local Government Act 1894. The Local Government Act 1972 afforded Parish Councils the opportunity to change titles. Thirsk renamed itself a Town Council. In so doing, the Chairman was also renamed as Mayor. The council is represented by eleven Councillors. Geography Cod Beck Weir, Thirsk The town lies in the Vale of Mowbray, north of York. Cod Beck runs through the centre of Thirsk. The area to the east of the river is called Old Thirsk. Thirsk is surrounded by a number of other villages having names of Danish origin (the -by suffix meaning village or farmstead). Examples are Thirlby, Boltby, Borrowby and Sowerby. The village of Sowerby merges into Thirsk and could be described as a suburb of the town, but they are separate parishes. The boundary between the two parishes runs east from the railway station behind the buildings along the A61 as far as Millbank Court from where it runs through the middle of the road. It continues to divide the highway through Westgate and Castlegate as far as the junction with Chapel Street down which it also runs dividing the street in two. It then crosses Cod Beck and runs along Moor Lane Stell before ending at Barbeck Bridge. Thirsk Industrial Estate lies outside the parish boundary. Bordering parishes include South Kilvington, Thornborough, Thornton- le-Moor, Newsham, Sandhutton and Carlton Miniott (also the location of Thirsk railway station). Demography The 1881 UK Census recorded the population of the parish as 3,337. The parish had a population of 4,703 according to the 2001 Census. The 2011 UK Census recorded the population as 4,998, an increase of 33% over the past 120 years, with a density of 3.9 people per hectare. Of the total population, 48.9% were male and 51.1% were female. The ethnic make up of the town was 94.3% White British, 3.0% Other White, 0.9% Asian British and 0.2% Black/Mixed and other Ethnic Groups. The religious composition of the town was 71.7% Christian, 27.4% None or no religion stated, 0.3% Muslim, 0.2% Buddhist, 0.1% Hindu, 0.1% Jewish and 0.0% Sikh. Economy Thirsk is built around a large medieval market square, which still hosts an open-air market each Monday and Saturday. The market was established in 1145 and is the focal point for local farmers, traders and visitors. The town was once known for its leather tanning and saddlery trade, but this was replaced in the 19th century by the production of farming implements. This was aided by the establishment of the Mechanics Institute in 1848. Thirsk has many facilities for tourists. The modern economy is based on hospitality, tourism, public administration, finance, manufacturing, construction, agriculture, small industrial, retail and service businesses. It is home to online retailer VetUK. The Herriot Museum, June 2018 Tourism is an important part of the economy, with accommodations, restaurants and pubs as well as attractions that encourage visitors. Users of the worldwide TripAdvisor site recommend the following as some of the best things to do in and near Thirsk: *Falconry UK Thirsk Birds of Prey Centre *Kilburn White Horse (hill carving) *World of James Herriot Museum *St Mary's Church *Sutton Bank National Park *Thirsk Museum *Larks Edge Alpacas *Garbutt Wood Nature Reserve Thirsk also has a livestock auction market on a large site at Blakey Lane on the A19, south-east of the town. Culture and community Thirsk has a museum with exhibits from across the whole history of the town. It is located in the house in which Thomas Lord was born. The adjoining village of Sowerby provides the town with its medical practices, cinema, town hall building and swimming pool. The Ritz Cinema, June 2018 The Ritz Cinema on Westgate, Sowerby is a small 200-seat (100 stalls, 100 balcony) cinema run by volunteers. It dates back to 1912 and is probably one of Britain's oldest operating cinemas. It shows in a period setting most of the current films and is run for residents and visitors to Thirsk and the local villages by a team of volunteers. In March 2012, the Ritz installed Digital projection equipment, purchased under a Digital Print Scheme through the Cinema Exhibitors' Association (CEA). Arts charity Rural Arts is based at The Courthouse on Westgate, Sowerby. Running since 1992, it has a wide range of services including an award-winning cafe, an art gallery, a workshop where visiting artists can run workshops, and meeting rooms which can be booked. It also works with professional companies through its ON Tour scheme. Running since 1999, this is a rural touring scheme that gets professional, high- quality performance into the rural areas of North Yorkshire. Thirsk Hall in Kirkgate is a grade II* listed three-storey town house built in 1720 and extended in 1770 by York architect John Carr. The market square adjacent to the clock tower was featured in the artwork to Pulp's 1995 album Different Class. Transport The station is north of York on the East Coast Main Line. The station is about outside the town centre and is actually on the edge of the village of Carlton Miniott. There are four tracks, but only the outer two have platforms. From satellite imagery it can look as if there are platforms on the inner two tracks, but examination on the ground shows this not to be true. The railway station is operated by TransPennine Express. Other train services are provided by the open-access operator Grand Central. Local bus services to and from York, Ripon and Northallerton and nearby villages and long distance National Express Coaches call at the bus stop in the market place. The main road running through the town is the A61, connecting Thirsk to Ripon. The A19 road now passes Thirsk to the east of the town, after a bypass was built in 1972. The former route of the A19 through the town is the A61 to the north to South Kilvington and the A170 to the south at the junction where the A19 joins the original route to the south. Education The town has many primary schools, Thirsk Community Primary, the others being in adjoining Sowerby and All Saints RC Primary School. It is within the catchment area of Thirsk School and Sixth Form College for secondary education. The current primary school was opened in 1979 with an extension added in 1991 to house extra classrooms, nursery section and medical facilities. Due to rises in the school population, some temporary build classrooms have also been erected on site. It is a mixed gender school catering for pupils between the ages of 3 and 11. It has a student capacity of 315 and as of 2013 was at 90.5% of that. Religion St Mary's Church The church on St James Green in Thirsk There is a 15th-century church dedicated to St Mary. The church is a Grade I Listed building. Before this building there had been smaller chapels erected in the town dedicated to St James, St Giles and St Nicholas. There is a Friends Meeting House in Kirkgate that has been there since at least 1799. There is a Wesleyan Chapel in St James' Green that was built in 1861. The Roman Catholic Church dedicated to All Saints was built in 1867 in Castlegate. The Primitive Methodists and the Congregationalists also used to have places of worship in the town. Sport Thirsk Racecourse is a thoroughbred horse racing venue consisting of a left handed oval of about one mile and two furlongs. The present course opened in 1923, but racing had taken place on the old course over 200 years earlier. The racecourse serves flat racing in the spring and summer months. Thirsk Cricket Club was founded in 1851 and play in the middle of the local racecourse. The club was a founder member of the York & District League in which they still compete. Also located at the facilities on the racecourse are Thirsk Hockey Club, who have been affiliated to the Yorkshire Hockey Association since 1923. Until the local Secondary School laid a floodlit artificial sports pitch, the club played on grass pitches that formed the out field of the Cricket Club. They still share the Cricket Clubhouse for social facilities. Thirsk Falcons FC are a football club that compete in the Teesside Football League, which is at the 13th level of the English football league system. Thirsk RUFC is a Rugby Union Club which competes in the Yorkshire Division 4 North West league. Other sports played in the town are Tennis, Bowls, Athletics and Archery. Thirsk has been on the route of the Tour de Yorkshire in 2016 and 2018.

Fasciculus Chemicus was revised by Dee sometime between 1631 and 1633 and translated from Latin into English by Elias Ashmole in 1650 under the anagrammatic pseudonym of \\"James Hasholle\\" (by substitution of the letter J for I). Arthur Dee however, was displeased with Ashmole's translation, and wrote to him: :I am sorry you or any man should take pains to translate any book of that art into English, for the art is vilified so much already by scholars that do daily deride it, in regard they are ignorant of the principles.

Published by Garland Press, N.Y., December 1996 Arthur Dee's principal sources in his alchemical anthology include Petrus Bonus, John Dastin, Gerhard Dorn, Raymund Lull and Michael Maier.

Multiplication During the 1650s an easing of regulations on the licensing of printing-presses and the subject-matter of leaflets, pamphlets and books occurred in England. This allowed the newly liberalised printing presses of the Protectorate of Oliver Cromwell to cater to the reading public's fears and speculations on England's future. The social uncertainties engendered by the social trauma of the Civil War, the execution of King Charles I and the establishment of the Commonwealth and Protectorate, resulted in a vigorous interest in esoteric topics during the 1650s decade in England. Dee's anthology was in the vanguard of a revived interest in alchemy in Britain throughout the 1650s, the foremost publication being Ashmole's major edition of British alchemical literature, Theatrum Chemicum Britannicum (1652). A manuscript copy of Fasciculus Chemicus is listed as once in the Library of Sir Thomas Browne.

Under Constantine, who introduced it on a wide scale, it had a weight of about 4.5 grams. It was largely replaced in Western Europe by Pepin the Short's currency reform, which introduced the silver-based pound/shilling/penny system, under which the shilling functioned as a unit of account equivalent to 12 pence, eventually developing into the French sou. In Eastern Europe, the nomisma was gradually debased by the Byzantine emperors until it was abolished by Alexius I in 1092, who replaced it with the hyperpyron, which also came to be known as a \\"bezant\\". The Byzantine solidus also inspired the originally slightly less pure dinar issued by the Muslim Caliphate. In late Antiquity and the Middle Ages, the solidus also functioned as a unit of weight equal to 1/72 of a pound.  Roman coinage  The solidus was introduced by Diocletian in as a replacement of the aureus, composed of relatively solid gold, minted 60 to the Roman pound. His minting was on a small scale, however, and the coin only entered widespread circulation under Constantine I after when it permanently replaced the aureus. Constantine's solidus was struck at a rate of 72 to a Roman pound (of about 326.6 g) of pure gold; each coin weighed 24 Greco-Roman carats (189 mg each),Porteous 1969 or about 4.5 grams of gold per coin. By this time, the solidus was worth 275,000 increasingly debased denarii, each denarius containing just 5% silver (or one twentieth) of the amount it had been three and a half centuries beforehand. With the exception of the early issues of Constantine the Great and the odd usurpers, the solidus today is a much more affordable gold Roman coin to collect, compared to the older aureus, especially those of Valens Honorius and later Byzantine issues. The solidus was maintained essentially unaltered in weight, dimensions and purity, until the 10th century. During the 6th and 7th centuries \\"lightweight\\" solidi of 20, 22 or 23 siliquae (one siliqua was 1/24 of a solidus) were struck along with the standard weight issues, presumably for trade purposes or to pay tribute. Many of these lightweight coins have been found in Europe, Russia and Georgia. The lightweight solidi were distinguished by different markings on the coin, usually in the exergue for the 20 and 22 siliquae coins, and by stars in the field for the 23 siliquae coins. Julian, . In theory, the solidus was struck from pure gold, but because of the limits of refining techniques, in practice - the coins were often about 23k fine (95.8% gold). In the Greek-speaking world during the Roman period, and then in the Byzantine economy, the solidus was known as the ŒΩœåŒºŒπœÉŒºŒ± (nomisma, plural nomismata).Porteous 1969 In the 10th century Emperor Nicephorus II Phocas (963‚Äì969) introduced a new lightweight gold coin called the tetarteron nomisma that circulated alongside the solidus, and from that time the solidus (nomisma) became known as the ·º±œÉœÑŒ¨ŒºŒµŒΩŒøŒΩ ŒΩœåŒºŒπœÉŒºŒ± (histamenon nomisma), in the Greek speaking world. Initially it was difficult to distinguish the two coins, as they had the same design, dimensions and purity, and there were no marks of value to distinguish the denominations. The only difference was the weight. The tetarteron nomisma was a lighter coin, about 4.05 grams, but the histamenon nomisma maintained the traditional weight of 4.5 grams. To eliminate confusion between the two, from the reign of Basil II (975‚Äì1025) the solidus (histamenon nomisma) was struck as a thinner coin with a larger diameter, but with the same weight and purity as before. From the middle of the 11th century the larger diameter histamenon nomisma was struck on a concave flan, while the smaller tetarteron nomisma continued to be struck on a smaller flat flan. Avitus tremissis, one-third of a solidus, 456\\\\. Former money changer Michael IV the Paphlagonian (1034‚Äì41) assumed the throne of Byzantium in 1034 and began the slow process of debasing both the tetarteron nomisma and the histamenon nomisma. The debasement was gradual at first, but then accelerated rapidly: about 21 carats (87.5% pure) during the reign of Constantine IX (1042‚Äì1055), 18 carats (75%) under Constantine X (1059‚Äì1067), 16 carats (66.7%) under Romanus IV (1068‚Äì1071), 14 carats (58%) under Michael VII (1071‚Äì1078), 8 carats (33%) under Nicephorus III (1078‚Äì1081) and 0 to 8 carats during the first eleven years of the reign of Alexius I (1081‚Äì1118). Alexius reformed the coinage in 1092 and eliminated the solidus (histamenon nomisma) altogether. In its place he introduced a new gold coin called the hyperpyron nomisma at about 20.5k fine (85%). The weight, dimensions and purity of the hyperpyron nomisma remained stable until the fall of Constantinople to the Crusaders in 1204. After that time the exiled Empire of Nicea continued to strike a debased hyperpyron nomisma. Michael VIII recaptured Constantinople in 1261, and the Byzantine Empire continued to strike the debased hyperpyron nomisma until the joint reign of John V and John VI (1347‚Äì1354). After that time the hyperpyron nomisma continued as a unit of account, but it was no longer struck in gold. From the 4th to the 11th centuries, solidi were minted mostly at the Constantinopolitan Mint, but also in Thessalonica, Trier, Rome, Milan, Ravenna, Syracuse, Alexandria, Carthage, Jerusalem and other cities. During the 8th and 9th centuries the Syracuse mint produced a large number of solidi that failed to meet the specifications of the coins produced by the imperial mint in Constantinople. The Syracuse solidi were generally lighter (about 3.8g) and only 19k fine (79% pure). Although imperial law forbade merchants from exporting solidi outside imperial territory, many solidi have been found in Russia, Central Europe, Georgia, and Syria. In the 7th century they became a desirable circulating currency in Arabian countries. Since the solidi circulating outside the empire were not used to pay taxes to the emperor, they did not get reminted, and the soft pure-gold coins quickly became worn. Through the end of the 7th century, Arabian copies of solidi ‚Äì dinars minted by the caliph Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan, who had access to supplies of gold from the upper Nile ‚Äì began to circulate in areas outside the Byzantine Empire. These corresponded in weight to only , but matched the weight of the lightweight (20 siliquae) solidi that were circulating in those areas. The two coins circulated together in these areas for a time. The solidus was not marked with any face value throughout its seven-century manufacture and circulation. Fractions of the solidus known as semissis (half-solidi) and tremissis (one-third solidi) were also produced. The word soldier is ultimately derived from solidus, referring to the solidi with which soldiers were paid.  Impact on world currencies  In medieval Europe, where the only coin in circulation was the silver penny (denier), the solidus was used as a unit of account equal to 12 deniers. Variations on the word solidus in the local language gave rise to a number of currency units:  France  Northern Gaul \\"sou\\", 440‚Äì450, 4240mg. In the French language, which evolved directly from common or vulgar Latin over the centuries, solidus changed to soldus, then solt, then sol and finally sou. No gold solidi were minted after the Carolingians adopted the silver standard; thenceforward the solidus or sol was a paper accounting unit equivalent to one-twentieth of a pound (librum or livre) of silver and divided into 12 denarii or deniers. The monetary unit disappeared with decimalisation and introduction of the franc during the French revolution (1st republic) in 1795, but the coin of 5 centimes, the twentieth part of the franc, inherited the name \\"sou\\" as a nickname: in the first half of the 20th century, a coin or an amount of 5 francs was still often referred to as cent sous. To this day, in French around the world, solde means the balance of an account or invoice, and is the specific name of a soldier's salary. Although the sou as a coin disappeared more than two centuries ago, the word is still used as a synonym of money in many French phrases: avoir des sous is being rich, √™tre sans un sou is being poor (same construction as \\"penniless\\").  Quebec  In Canadian French, and are commonly employed terms for the Canadian cent. and are also regularly used. The European French is not used in Quebec. In Canada one hundredth of a dollar is officially known as a cent (pronounced /s…õnt/) in both English and French. However, in practice, a feminine form of , (pronounced /s…õn/) has mostly replaced the official \\"\\" outside bilingual areas. Spoken use of the official masculine form of cent is uncommon in francophone-only areas of Canada. Quarter dollar coins in colloquial Quebec French are sometimes called (thirty cents), because of a series of changes in terminology, currencies, and exchange rates. After the British conquest of Canada in 1759, French coins gradually fell out of use, and became a nickname for the halfpenny, which was similar in value to the French . Spanish pesos and U.S. dollars were also in use, and from 1841 to 1858 the exchange rate was fixed at $4 = ¬£1 (or 400¬¢ = 240d). This made 25¬¢ equal to 15d, or 30 halfpence i.e. . In 1858, pounds, shillings, and pence were abolished in favour of dollars and cents, and the nickname began to be used for the 1¬¢ coin, but the term for a 25¬¢ coin has endured. In the vernacular Quebec French and are also frequently used to refer to money in general, especially small amounts.  Italy  The name of the medieval Italian silver soldo (plural soldi), coined since the 11th century, was derived from solidus. This word is still in common use today in Italy in its plural soldi with the same meaning as the English equivalent \\"money\\". The word \\"saldo\\", like the French solde mentioned above, means the balance of an account or invoice. It also means \\"seasonal rebate\\", probably by contamination between the original meaning and the English word \\"sales\\".  Spain and Peru, Portugal and Brazil  As with soldier in English, the Spanish and Portuguese equivalent is soldado (almost the same pronunciation). The name of the medieval Spanish sueldo and Portuguese soldo (which also means salary) were derived from solidus; the term sweldo in most Philippine languages (Tagalog, Cebuano, etc.) is derived from the Spanish. The Spanish and Portuguese word saldo, like the French solde, means the balance of an account or invoice. It is also used in some other languages, such as German and Afrikaans. Some have suggested that the Peruvian unit of currency, the sol, is derived from solidus, but the standard unit of Peruvian currency was the real until 1863. Throughout the Spanish world the dollar equivalent was 8 reales (\\"pieces of eight\\"), which circulated legally in the United States until 1857. In the US, the colloquial expression \\"two bits\\" for a quarter dollar, and the stock market currency real last used for accounting, traded in of a U.S. dollar until 2001, still echoes the legal usage in the US in the 19th century. The Peruvian sol was introduced at a rate of 5.25 per British Pound, or just under four shillings (the legacy soldus). The term soles de oro was introduced in 1933, three years after Peru had actually abandoned the gold standard. In 1985 the Peruvian sol was replaced at one thousand to one by the inti, representing the sun god of the Incas. By 1991 it had to be replaced with a new sol at a million to one, after which it remained reasonably stable.  United Kingdom  King Offa of Mercia began minting silver pennies on the Carolingian system . As on the continent, English coinage was restricted for centuries to the penny, while the scilling, understood to be the value of a cow in Kent or a sheep elsewhere, was merely a unit of account equivalent to 12 pence. The Tudors minted the first shilling coins. Prior to decimalization in the United Kingdom in 1971, the abbreviation s. (from solidus) was used to represent shillings, just as d. (denarius) and ¬£ (libra) were used to represent pence and pounds respectively. Under the influence of the old long S , the abbreviations \\"¬£sd\\" eventually developed into the use of a slash , which gave rise to that symbol's ISO and Unicode name \\"solidus\\".

His scientific interest was devoted to a broad spectrum of geological topics: volcanism, petrology, fossils, stratigraphy and mountain formation. His most remembered accomplishment is the scientific definition of the Jurassic system. Biography Statue of Buch sculpted by Richard Ohmann Buch studied with Alexander von Humboldt under Abraham Gottlob Werner at the mining school in Freiberg, Saxony. He afterwards completed his education at the universities of Halle and G√∂ttingen. German and Italian explorations He began writing on geological topics early in life. His Versuch einer mineralogischen Beschreibung von Landeck (Breslau, 1797) was translated into French (Paris, 1805), and into English as Attempt at a Mineralogical Description of Landeck (Edinburgh, 1810). In 1802 he published Entwurf einer geognostischen Beschreibung von Schlesien (\\"The Geognosy of Silesia\\"), which became the first volume of his Geognostische Beobachtungen auf Reisen durch Deutschland und Italien (\\"Geognistic Observations while Travelling through Germany and Italy\\", see below). He was at this time a zealous upholder of the Neptunian theory of Werner, with some modifications. In 1797, he met Humboldt at Salzburg, and with him explored the geological formations of Styria, and the adjoining Alps. In the spring of 1798, Buch extended his excursions into Italy, where his faith in the Neptunian theory was shaken. In his early works, he had advocated the aqueous origin of basaltic and other formations, but now he saw cause to abandon Werner's theory, and to recognize the volcanic origin of the basalts. He saw Vesuvius for the first time in 1799. Later, in 1805, he had the opportunity, along with Humboldt and Gay Lussac, of witnessing its actual eruption. It was a remarkable eruption, and supplied Buch with data for refuting many erroneous ideas then entertained regarding volcanoes. In 1802 he examined the extinct volcanoes of Auvergne in the south of France. The aspect of the Puy de D√¥me, with its cone of trachyte and its strata of basaltic lava, induced him to abandon as untenable the doctrines of Werner on the formation of these rocks. The results of all these geological travels were given to the world in the two volumes of his Geognostische Beobachtungen (Berlin, 1802 and 1809). Scandinavian explorations In 1806, Buch proceeded to Scandinavia and spent two years in examining its physical constitution. This furnished the materials for his work entitled Reise durch Norwegen und Lappland (\\"Travels in Norway and Lapland\\", Berlin, 1810). He made many important observations on the geography of plants, on climatology and on geology. He showed that many of the erratic blocks on the North German plains must have come from Scandinavia. He also established the fact that the whole of Sweden is slowly but continuously rising above the level of the sea from Frederikshald to √Öbo. Canary Islands and the Atlantic In 1815 Buch visited the Canary Islands in company with Christen Smith, a Norwegian botanist. These volcanic isles furnished the starting point from which Buch commenced a regular course of study on the production and activity of volcanoes. This is attested by his standard work on the subject entitled Physical Description of the Canary Isles (1825). His observations convinced him that these and other islands of the Atlantic owed their existence to volcanic action of the most intense kind, whereas the groups of islands in the South Sea were the remains of a pre-existing continent. During his time in the Canary Islands, he visited the Las Ca√±adas Caldera on Tenerife and the Caldera de Taburiente on La Palma. When he published his memoirs and observations about his excursion, he introduced the Spanish word \\"Caldera\\" (meaning \\"Bowl\\") into the geological and scientific vocabulary. After his return from the Canaries he visited the basaltic group of the Hebrides and the coasts of Scotland and Ireland. Buch's geological excursions, even in countries which he had repeatedly visited before, continued without interruption until a very advanced age: eight months before his death he visited the mountains of Auvergne, and on returning home he read a paper on the Jurassic formation before the Academy of Berlin. Humboldt, who had known him intimately for a period of more than sixty years, called him the greatest geologist of that period. Buch was unmarried and lived aloof from the world, entirely devoted to scientific pursuits. His excursions were always taken on foot, with a staff in his hand, and the large pockets of his overcoat filled with papers and geological instruments. He died in Berlin. Evolution In the third edition of his On the Origin of Species published in 1861, Charles Darwin added a Historical Sketch giving due credit to naturalists who had preceded him in publishing the opinion that species undergo modification, and that the existing forms of life have descended by true generation from pre-existing forms. According to Darwin: :The celebrated geologist and naturalist, Von Buch, in his excellent 'Description physique des Isles Canaries' (1836, p. 147), clearly expresses his belief that varieties slowly become changed into permanent species, which are no longer capable of intercrossing.\\"The Origin of Species\\".

Memberships and honors  In 1825, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. Buch was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1849. Recipient of the Pour le M√©rite for Sciences and Arts.

It was created in 1789 for John Creighton, 2nd Baron Erne, who had earlier represented Lifford (Parliament of Ireland constituency) in the Irish House of Commons. He had already been made Viscount Erne, of Crom Castle in the County of Fermanagh, in 1781, also in the Peerage of Ireland, and sat from 1800 to 1828 as an Irish Representative Peer in the British House of Lords. The title of Baron Erne, of Crom Castle in the County of Fermanagh, was created in the Peerage of Ireland in 1768 for his father Abraham Creighton. The Earl was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Earl. On his death the titles passed to his nephew, the third Earl. He was an Irish Representative Peer from 1845 to 1885 and also served as Lord Lieutenant of County Fermanagh during the same period. In 1876 he was created Baron Fermanagh, of Lisnaskea in the County of Fermanagh, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. This was to allow the Earls to sit in the House of Lords by right, rather than having to stand for election as Representative Peers. An earlier title of Baroness Fermanagh in the Peerage of Ireland was created for Mary Verney on 13 June 1792, but became extinct on her death on 15 November 1810. Lord Erne also changed the spelling of the family surname from Creighton to Crichton. He was succeeded by his son, the fourth Earl. He was a Conservative politician and served as a Lord of the Treasury in the second Conservative administration of Benjamin Disraeli. Like his father he was also Lord Lieutenant of County Fermanagh. His grandson, the fifth Earl, held minor office from 1936 to 1939 in the National Government led by Stanley Baldwin and later Neville Chamberlain. Lord Erne was killed in the Second World War. The 6th Earl (often known as Harry Erne), who succeeded in 1940, was the Lord Lieutenant of County Fermanagh from 1986 until 2012. On his death in 2015, he was succeeded by his only son, the 7th Earl. The 3rd Earl is also remembered as the employer of Captain Charles Boycott, whose mishandling of relations with agricultural workers on Lord Erne's estate in County Mayo caused a political and public order crisis and provoked the strategy that gave the English language the term to boycott. The invented title of Viscount Crichton is used as a courtesy title for the Earl's heir apparent. The family seat is Crom Castle, near Newtownbutler, County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland.

Craft was an activist in the civil rights movement and also served as a member of the Dallas City Council in Texas.Women In Texas History - Juanita Craft Biography Born in Round Rock, Texas, Craft was the only child of schoolteachers David Sylvestus (d. 1947) and Eliza Balfour Shanks (d. 1918). Craft was raised by her mother until she died in 1918. After her mother's death, Craft moved to Columbus, Texas to be with her father. After graduating high school in 1919, Craft attended Prairie View A&M; University where she studied sewing and millinery. After two years at Prairie View, Craft moved back to Austin, Texas and received her teaching certificate from Samuel Huston College. By 1925, Craft was working as a maid at the Adolphus Hotel and later as a seamstress. Craft joined the NAACP in 1935, eventually becoming the Dallas NAACP membership chairman in 1942 and the Texas NAACP field organizer in 1946. She helped to organize 182 branches of the NAACP over eleven years. In 1944, Craft became the first black woman in Dallas County to vote in a public election. In 1955, she organized a protest of the State Fair of Texas against its policy of admitting blacks only on \\"Negro Achievement Day.\\" Craft also assisted in the organization of protests and pickets in segregated lunch counters, restaurants, theaters and public transportation. Following the 1954 decision in Brown v. Board of Education, Craft worked to integrate the University of Texas Law School and the Dallas Independent School District. She attempted to help enroll the first black student at North Texas State College (Now the University of North Texas), a battle eventually won through litigation She later served two terms on the Dallas City Council from 1975 and 1979. Craft became a towering historic figure in the Civil Rights Movement in Texas, and was given many awards for her efforts, including the NAACP Golden Heritage Life Membership Award in 1978, the Eleanor Roosevelt Humanitarian Award in 1984, and she was recognized by the NAACP for her fifty years of service shortly before her death at the age of 83 on August 6, 1985. Legacy The Juanita Jewel Craft Recreation Center and a Dallas city park were named in her honor as was a U.S. Post Office in southeast Dallas. Craft home on Warren Avenue in South Dallas is now the Juanita J. Craft Civil Rights House and is part of Dallas's Wheatley Place Historic District.

Incident The attack took place on 31 January 1996, in the Sri Lankan city of Colombo. A lorry containing about 440 pounds of high explosives crashed through the main gate of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, a seaside high-rise which managed most of the financial business of the country. As gunmen traded fire with security guards, the suicide bomber in the lorry detonated the massive bomb, which tore through the bank and damaged eight other buildings nearby. The lorry was followed by a three-wheeler, carrying two LTTE cadres armed with automatic rifles and an RPG launcher. The blast killed at least 91 people and injured 1,400 others. At least 100 people lost their eyesight. Among the wounded were two US citizens, six Japanese, and one Dutch national. Most of these were bystanders or civilians manning small shops set up near the bank. While the bomber Raju died immediately, the back up team Subramanium Vigneswaram alias Kittu, and Sivasamy Dharmendra alias Raju, were apprehended by law enforcement with information provided by the public.Sri Lanka's Ethnic Crisis & National Security by Rohan Gunaratna, Police and the security forces launched a massive manhunt for others who were involved in this terrorist incident. It was eventually determined the bombers had come from Jaffna, in the north of the country and were LTTE members. This bombing, and one in July on a train that killed more than 70, caused tourism to plummet 40% in Sri Lanka. Until 2006, the Central Bank bombing was the deadliest LTTE bombing of the civil war. The BBC reported that the Tigers denied responsibility for the attack. But the Sri Lankan Foreign Ministry spokesman, Ravinatha Aryasinha, blamed the Tigers, saying the attack proves they \\"do not care for international opinion or the safety of civilians, including foreigners who have nothing to do with the present conflict.  Suicide bombers  Attack was mainly carried out by three LTTE cadres. While one of them died immediately the rest were taken into custody by the police. The suicide bombers were: *Raju (main bomber) *Subramanium Vigneswaram alias Kittu *Sivasamy Dharmendra alias Raju Immediately after the bombing several tourists and local and foreign travel agencies received calls from Ellalan Force, a front organisation of LTTE, to boycott Sri Lanka.  Criminal indictment  Eleven LTTE members were charged with the bombing of the Central Bank, ten of them were indicted on a total of 712 counts, including intention to cause death and committing murder, destruction of state property by attacking the central bank, and provoking violence. In 2002 Judge Sarath Ambepitiya issued an open warrant to arrest LTTE's exclusive leader, Velupillai Prabhakaran in connection with the 1996 Central Bank Bombing. The judge found him guilty on 51 counts and sentenced him to 200 years in prison.

For example, a Chinese wall may be erected to separate and isolate people who make investments from those who are privy to confidential information that could improperly influence the investment decisions. Firms are generally required by law to safeguard insider information and ensure that improper trading does not occur.  Etymology  The origin of the phrase is the Great Wall of China. The term was popularized in the United States following the stock market crash of 1929, when the U.S. government legislated information separation between investment bankers and brokerage firms, in order to limit the conflict of interest between objective company analysis and the desire for successful initial public offerings. Rather than prohibiting one company from engaging in both businesses, the government permitted the implementation of Chinese wall procedures. A leading note on the subject published in 1980 in the University of Pennsylvania Law Review titled \\"The Chinese Wall Defense to Law-Firm Disqualification\\" perpetuated the use of the term.\\"The Chinese Wall Defense to Law-Firm Disqualification\\" (1980) 128 University of Pennsylvania Law Review. 677 Objections to the term There have been disputes about the use of the term for some decades, particularly in the legal and banking sectors. The term can be seen both as culturally insensitive and an inappropriate reflection on Chinese culture and trade, which is now extensively integrated into the global market. In Peat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co. v. Superior Court (1988), Presiding Justice Harry W. Low, a Chinese American, wrote a concurring opinion specifically in order \\"to express my profound objection to the use of this phrase in this context\\". He called the term a \\"piece of legal flotsam which should be emphatically abandoned\\", and suggested \\"ethics wall\\" as a more suitable alternative. He maintained that the \\"continued use of the term would be insensitive to the ethnic identity of the many persons of Chinese descent\\".Peat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co. v. Superior Court , 200 Cal.App.3d 272, 293‚Äì294, 245 Cal.Rptr. 873, 887‚Äì888 (1988) Alternative phrases include \\"screen\\",See Martin v. MacDonald Estate (Gray) [1991] 1 WWR 705 at 715, as per Sopinka J. \\"firewall\\", \\"cone of silence\\", and \\"ethical wall\\". \\"Screen\\" or the verb \\"to screen\\" is the preferred term of the American Bar Association Model Rules of Professional Conduct.\\"Model Rules of Professional Conduct\\" . The ABA Model Rules define screening as \\"the isolation of a lawyer from any participation in a matter through the timely imposition of procedures within a firm that are reasonably adequate under the circumstances to protect information that the isolated lawyer is obligated to protect under these Rules or other law\\". Ibid. Usage in specific industries=Finance A Chinese wall is most commonly employed in investment banks, between the corporate- advisory area and the brokering department in order to separate those giving corporate advice on takeovers from those advising clients about buying shares; see #Research there. The \\"wall\\" is thrown up to prevent leaks of corporate inside information, which could influence the advice given to clients making investments, and allow staff to take advantage of facts that are not yet known to the general public.\\"Chinese Wall Definition\\" , Investopedia. see Australian case The phrase \\"already over the wall\\" is used by equity research personnel to refer to rank-and-file personnel who operate without an ethics wall at all times. Examples include members of the Chinese wall department, most compliance personnel, attorneys and certain NYSE-licensed analysts. The term \\"over the wall\\" is used when an employee who is not normally privy to wall- guarded information somehow obtains sensitive information. Breaches considered semi-accidental were typically not met with punitive action during the heyday of the \\"dot-com\\" era. These and other instances involving conflicts of interest were rampant during this era. A major scandal was exposed when it was discovered that research analysts were encouraged to blatantly publish dishonest positive analyses on companies in which they, or related parties, owned shares, or on companies that depended on the investment banking departments of the same research firms. The U.S. government has since passed laws strengthening the use Ethics walls such as Title V of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in order to prevent such conflicts of interest. Ethics walls are also used in the corporate finance departments of the \\"Big Four\\" and other large accountancy and financial services firms. They are designed to insulate sensitive documentation from the wider firm in order to prevent conflicts. Journalism The term is used in journalism to describe the separation between the editorial and advertising arms. The Chinese wall is regarded as breached for \\"advertorial\\" projects. Insurance The term is used in property and casualty insurance to describe the separation of claim handling where both parties to a claim (e.g. an airport and an airline) have insurance policies with the same insurer. The claim handling process needs to be segregated within the organisation to avoid a conflict of interest. This also occurs when there is an unidentified or uninsured motorist involved in an auto collision. In this case, two loss adjusters will take on the claim - one representing the insured party and another representing the uninsured or unidentified motorist. While they both represent the same policy, they both must investigate and negotiate to determine fault and what if anything is covered under the policy. In this case, a Chinese wall is erected between the two adjusters. Law Chinese walls may be used in law firms to address a conflict of interest, for example to separate one part of the firm representing a party on a deal or litigation from another part of the firm with contrary interests or with confidential information from an adverse party. Under UK law, a firm may represent competing parties in a suit, but only in strictly defined situations and when individual fee earners do not act for both sides. In United States law firms, the use of Chinese walls is no longer permitted except within very narrow exceptions. The American Bar Association Model Rules of Professional Conduct (2004) state: \\"While lawyers are associated in a firm, none of them shall knowingly represent a client when any one of them practicing alone would be prohibited from doing so by Rules 1.7 or 1.9, unless the prohibition is based on a personal interest of the prohibited lawyer and does not present a significant risk of materially limiting the representation of the client by the remaining lawyers in the firm.\\" Although ABA rules are only advisory, most U.S. states have adopted them or have even stricter regulations in place. Computer science In computer science, the concept of a Chinese wall is used by both the operating system for computer security and the US judicial system for protection against copyright infringement. In computer security it concerns the software stability of the operating system. The same concept is involved in an important business matter concerning the licensing of each of a computer's many software and hardware components. Any hardware component that requires direct software interaction will have a license for itself and a license for its software \\"driver\\" running in the operating system. Reverse engineering software is a part of computer science that can involve writing a driver for a piece of hardware in order to enable it to work in an operating system unsupported by the manufacturer of the hardware, or to add functionality or increase the performance of its operations (not provided by the manufacturer) in the supported operating system, or to restore the usage of a piece of computer hardware for which the driver has disappeared altogether. A reverse engineered driver offers access to development, by persons outside the company that manufactured it, of the general hardware usage. =Reverse engineering= There is a case-law mechanism called \\"clean room design\\" that is employed to avoid copyright infringement when reverse engineering a proprietary driver. It involves two separate engineering groups separated by a Chinese wall. One group works with the hardware to reverse engineer what must be the original algorithms and only documents their findings.

It is measure applied to common, preferred stock, convertible stocks and bonds, fixed income instruments, including bonds, including government bonds and corporate bonds, notes and annuities. There are various types of yield, and the method of calculation depends on the particular type of yield and the type of security. Dividend yield measures the past year's dividends on a stock (a share), expressed as a percentage of the share's market value. Yield to maturity is applied to a fixed income security. It is the holder's ex-ante total return, calculated assuming it is held until maturity, and assuming there is no default, using the internal rate of return (IRR) method. Because of these differences, the yields comparisons between different yields measured on different types of financial products should be treated with caution. This page is mainly a series of links to other pages with increased details. Bonds, notes, bills The coupon rate (also nominal rate) is the yearly total of coupons (or interest) paid divided by the Principal (Face) Value of the bond. The current yield is those same payments divided by the bond's spot market price. The yield to maturity is the IRR on the bond's cash flows: the purchase price, the coupons received and the principal at maturity. The yield to call is the IRR on the bond's cash flows, assuming it is called at the first opportunity, instead of being held till maturity. The yield of a bond is inversely related to its price today: if the price of a bond falls, its yield goes up. Conversely, if interest rates decline (the market yield declines), then the price of the bond should rise (all else being equal). There is also TIPS (Treasury Inflation Protected Securities), also known as Inflation Linked fixed income. TIPS are sold by the US Treasury and have a \\"real yield\\". The bond or note's face value is adjusted upwards with the CPI-U, and a real yield is applied to the adjusted principal to let the investor always outperform the inflation rate and protect purchasing power. However, many economists believe that the CPI under- represents actual inflation. In the event of deflation over the life of this type of fixed income, TIPS still mature at the price at which they were sold (initial face). Losing money on TIPS if bought at the initial auction and held to maturity is not possible even if deflation was long lasting. Preferred shares Like bonds, preferred shares compensate owners with scheduled payments which resemble interest. However, preferred \\"interest\\" is actually in the form of a dividend. This is a significant accounting difference as preferred dividends, unlike debt interest, are charged after taxes and below net income, therefore reducing net income and ultimately earnings per share. Preferred shares may also contain conversion privileges which allow for their exchange into common stock. The dividend yield is the total yearly payments divided by the principal value of the preferred share. The current yield is those same payments divided by the preferred share's market price. If the preferred share has a maturity (not always) there can also be a yield to maturity and yield to call calculated, the same way as for bonds. Preferred trust units Like preferred shares but units in a trust. Trusts have certain tax advantages to standard corporations and are typically deemed to be \\"flow- through\\" vehicles. Private mutual funds trusts are gaining in popularity in Canada following the changes to tax legislation which forced many publicly traded royalty trusts to convert back into corporations. Investors seeking the high yields typically associated with the energy royalty trusts are increasingly investing in private mutual energy fund trusts. Common shares Common shares will often pay out a portion of the earnings as dividends. The dividend yield is the total dollars (RMB, Yen, etc.) paid in a year divided by the spot price of the shares. Most web sites and reports are updated with the expected future year's payments, not the past year's. The price/earnings ratio quoted for common shares is the reciprocal of what is called the earnings yield. EarningsPerShare / SharePrice. Annuities The life annuities purchased to fund retirement pay out a higher yield than can be obtained with other instruments, because part of the payment comes from a return of capital. $YearlyDistribution / $CostOfContract. REITs, royalty trust, income trusts Like annuities, distribution yields from REITs, Royalty trusts, and Income trusts often include cash that exceeds the income earned: that is return of capital. $YearlyDistribution / $SharePrice. Real estate and property Several different yields are used as measures of a real estate investment, including initial, equivalent and reversionary yields. Initial yield is the annualised rents of a property expressed as a percentage of the property value. E.g. ¬£100,000 passing rent per annum ¬£1,850,000 valuation 100000/1850000 = 0.054 or 5.4% Reversionary yield is the anticipated yield to which the initial yield will rise (or fall) once the rent reaches the ERV. E.g. ¬£150,000 ERV per annum ¬£1,850,000 valuation 150000/1850000 = 0.081 or 8.1% Equivalent yield lies somewhere in between the initial yield and reversionary yield, it encapsulates the DCF of the property with rents rising (or falling) from the current annualised rent to the underlying estimated rental value (ERV) less costs that are incurred along the way. The discount rate used to calculate the net present value (NPV) of the DCF to equal zero is the equivalent yield, or the IRR. The calculation not only takes into account all costs, but other assumptions including rent reviews and void periods. A trial and error method can be used to identify the equivalent yield of a DCF, or if using Excel, the goal seek function can be used. How to evaluate the yield All financial instruments compete with each other in the market place. Yield is one part of the total return of holding a security. A higher yield allows the owner to recoup his investment sooner, and so lessens risk. But on the other hand, a high yield may have resulted from a falling market value for the security as a result of higher risk. Yield levels vary mainly with expectations of inflation. Fears of high inflation in the future mean that investors ask for high yield (a low price vs the coupon) today. The maturity of the instrument is one of the elements that determines risk. The relationship between yields and the maturity of instruments of similar credit worthiness, is described by the yield curve. Long dated instruments typically have a higher yield than short dated instruments. The yield of a debt instrument is generally linked to the credit worthiness and default probability of the issuer. The more the default risk, the higher the yield would be in most of the cases since issuers need to offer investors some compensation for the risk.

In 2006 Gerard Gilbert of The Independent described him as the UK's \\"pre-eminent TV dramatist\\" who had \\"inherited Dennis Potter's crown.\\" Early life Poliakoff was born in Holland Park, West London, to Ina (n√©e Montagu) and Alexander Poliakoff. His father was a Russian-Jewish immigrant and his mother was a British Jew. His maternal grandfather had bought 16th- century mansion Great Fosters, and his maternal great-grandfather was Samuel Montagu, 1st Baron Swaythling.https://www.thejc.com/culture/tv/stephen- poliakoff-new-bbc-drama-summer-of-rockets-1.484227 The second of four children, he was sent at a young age to Marlborough House School, which he hated. He then attended Westminster School, where he attracted sufficient attention for Granny, a play he wrote and directed, to be reviewed in The Times newspaper. After Westminster, he went to King's College, Cambridge to read history but left after two years, later recalling Cambridge as \\"a stuffy place\\" and the history course as \\"shockingly bad\\".  Professional life = Theatre  Poliakoff continued to write stage plays, becoming writer-in- residence for the National Theatre at the age of 24, but he became increasingly interested in the medium of television, with Stronger Than the Sun (1977 ‚Äì BBC1 Play for Today), Bloody Kids (1980 ‚Äì ATV) directed by Stephen Frears, Caught on a Train (1980 ‚Äì BBC2 Playhouse) starring Peggy Ashcroft, and Soft Targets (1982 ‚Äì Play for Today). There were also TV adaptations of his stage plays Hitting Town (1976 ‚Äì Thames Television/ITV Plays for Britain) and City Sugar (1978 ‚Äì Scottish Television / ITV The Sunday Drama). These two plays were among his earliest big successes. Poliakoff's theatre, although well received critically has never achieved a great level of attention from the critics, apart from their reviews. This has been attributed to the ambiguity of his politics. His approach towards political issues has been described as individual in nature rather than generalising. Some of the recurring themes in his works have been recognised as environmental pollution, due to human intervention, both rural and urban. Most of his plays portray contemporary Britain. He is scared of and fascinated by fascism. He said: \\"I'm writing about what's happening now, about people searching for beliefs in what is no longer a religious country, and about how individuals of charisma and power can polarise things.\\" A full length study of his work was published in 2011 Stephen Poliakoff: On Stage and Screen by Robin Nelson (published by Bloomsbury). Nearly all of Poliakoff's plays premiered in London, four at the National Theatre, four at the Royal Shakespeare Company and at the Almeida, Hampstead, Bush and Royal Court. Three of his plays have transferred to the West End. Many of the plays have been performed across Europe and also in the US, Australia and Japan. In 1976 Poliakoff won the Evening Standard Most Promising Playwright Award for Hitting Town and City Sugar and in 1997 he won the Critic's Circle Best Play Award for the National Theatre production of Blinded By The Sun.  Television and cinema  Poliakoff's first feature film was Runners, directed by Charles Sturridge, starring James Fox, Jane Asher and Kate Hardie. It received a limited theatrical release in 1983 before being shown in Channel 4's Film on Four slot. His directorial debut was the much-lauded and now rare Hidden City (1988), premiered at the Venice Film Festival and starring Charles Dance, Richard E. Grant and Cassie Stuart. His television career continued with She's Been Away (1989) starring Peggy Ashcroft and also winning awards at Venice, before a return to film with Close My Eyes (1991), starring Clive Owen, Saskia Reeves and Alan Rickman in an elaborate reworking of the incest theme that had been central to Hitting Town (1976), followed by Century (1994), with Owen, Dance and Miranda Richardson. Less successful were Food of Love (1997) with Grant, Nathalie Baye and Joe McGann and The Tribe (1998) starring Joely Richardson and Jeremy Northam, the latter eventually screened on BBC Two in the absence of a cinema distribution deal where it achieved extremely high viewing figures and was immediately repeated. He subsequently returned to his favoured form, television, this time choosing a flexible serial format resulting in the acclaimed and Prix Italia- winning Shooting the Past (1999), the fresh critical and audience success of Perfect Strangers (2001), a family drama starring Matthew Macfadyen, Michael Gambon and Lindsay Duncan and The Lost Prince (2003), a single drama recognised with an Emmy award rare for a non-American production. The film also featured Miranda Richardson in a Golden Globe-nominated performance as Queen Mary of Teck. Michael Gambon, Gina McKee, Tom Hollander and Bill Nighy appeared in major roles. Late 2005 saw the one-off drama Friends and Crocodiles (2006) starring Damian Lewis and Jodhi May, with its overlapping companion piece, Gideon's Daughter (2006), starring Bill Nighy, Miranda Richardson and Emily Blunt, appearing early the following year. The latter won a Peabody Award in April 2007, with Golden Globes for Nighy and Blunt. In 2005, he renewed recent criticisms of BBC scheduling and commissioning policy, arguing that the reintroduction of a regular evening slot for one-off plays on BBC1 would provide the re-invigoration of drama output that has become a priority for the corporation. Joe's Palace was screened on 4 November 2007 on BBC One and Capturing Mary was screened on BBC Two on 12 November 2007. The Culture Show also screened a Poliakoff special, including an interview between Poliakoff and Mark Kermode and a new TV play, A Real Summer, on 10 November. Glorious 39, starring Romola Garai, Bill Nighy and Julie Christie, premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in September 2009 and was released in the UK that November. In 2011, Poliakoff wrote a seven-minute short film, Astonish Me, to celebrate WWF's 50th anniversary. Starring Bill Nighy and Gemma Arterton, the film was shown in Odeon Cinemas in August 2011 and made available on the WWF website and YouTube. In February and March 2013, Dancing on the Edge, a five-part series which followed the fortunes of a black jazz band in 1930s London, was broadcast by the BBC, and also later won a Golden Globe. In November/December 2016, his seven-part series Close to the Enemy was transmitted on BBC Two. Close to the Enemy is set in a bombed-out London in the aftermath of the Second World War. Poliakoff wrote and directed Summer of Rockets, a semi-autobiographical six-part series broadcast by the BBC in June 2019. It is set in 1957, just as the UK is testing its first hydrogen bomb, and focuses on a Russian Jewish hearing aid inventor (Toby Stephens) who goes to work for MI5. It also stars Keeley Hawes, Linus Roache, and Timothy Spall. Personal life Stephen Poliakoff lives in London and is married to fellow scriptwriter Sandy Welch, with whom he has two children. He was awarded a CBE in the Queen's Birthday Honours list 2007. His brother, Sir Martyn Poliakoff, a research chemist and lecturer, is a Fellow of the Royal Society, being, until November 2016, its Foreign Secretary and vice-president. He is also the presenter of a YouTube educational series on chemistry, The Periodic Table of Videos. Poliakoff's paternal grandfather, Joseph, was a Russian Jew who experienced first-hand the effects of the communist revolution in Russia from the family's Moscow flat across from the Kremlin. Near starvation after the revolution, he was given a government job as a district telephone inspector from an admiring commissar and he helped build Moscow's first automatic telephone exchange. He then fled with his family from the Soviet Union to the UK in 1924. Joseph Poliakoff was an inventor of electrical devices whose many inventions included a selenium photograph telephony shutter in 1899 (US patent 700,100, 26 August 1901), which, along with electrical sound amplification, allowed for synchronised audio on film, the radio volume control, a magnetic induction loop that allowed hearing-impaired people to hear in auditoriums or theatres, and the paging beeper. He also founded the Multitone Electric Company of London in 1931 that produced hearing aid devices with their most prestigious customer being Winston Churchill. Joseph's experiences under the Bolsheviks inspired Poliakoff's 1984 play Breaking the Silence.Breaking the Silence, Stephen Poliakoff, Methuen Drama, 1984, Author's note, page v. Several of these attributes (such as the pager, and hearing aids, including Churchill's) were ascribed to the lead character in Summer of Rockets.

In the United Kingdom and Europe the term small press comic is equivalent with minicomic, reserved for those publications measuring A6 (105 mm √ó 148 mm) or less. Minicomics, sometimes called ashcan copies, and sometimes zine comics, are a common inexpensive way for those who want to make their own comics on a very small budget, with mostly informal means of distribution. A number of cartoonists ‚Äî such as Jessica Abel, Julie Doucet, and Adrian Tomine ‚Äî have started their careers this way and later gone on to more traditional types of publishing, while other established artists ‚Äî such as Matt Feazell and John Porcellino ‚Äî continue to publish minicomics as their main means of production. Overview The term \\"minicomic\\" was originally used in the United States and has a somewhat confusing history. Originally, it referred only to size: a digest comic measured 5.5 inches wide by 8.5 inches tall, while a minicomic was 5.5 inches by 4.25 inches. Currently, there is no standard format for a minicomic. Anything between something the size of a postage stamp to regular comic book size can be considered a minicomic. The term \\"minicomic\\" is used in a more general sense, emphasizing the publication's handmade, informal aspect rather than the format. By this loose definition, a single photocopied page folded in quarters would still be a minicomic, but so would a thicker digest-sized comic, or even a large, elaborate, and relatively expensive photocopied booklet with a silkscreened cover. Even some professionally printed and bound booklets are referred to as minicomics, as long as they are published by the artist and marketed in minicomic venues, but this usage is controversial. Many minicomics are non-standard comic book sizes for aesthetic reasons, or are often connected to graphic design and book print \\"tricks\\" to look good. Many of these typical sizes are convenient for artists using standard office supplies: a US letter page can be folded in half to make a digest, or in quarters for a minicomic. These comics are generally photocopied, although some are produced in larger quantities using offset printing. In North America, the United Kingdom, and Malaysia, minicomics are rarely found in traditional \\"direct market\\" comic-book stores; they are often sold directly by the artist at book fairs or through the mail, ordered from websites, or handled by small bookstores and distributors that carry zines. In terms of production and distribution issues and their audience, minicomics--of all of the sizes and types mentioned above--have much more in common with each other, and with zines, than with any traditionally published comics. In Europe many specialized comic books stores have a special little corner dedicated to the odd off-size little self-printed books. At comic book conventions, such as the one in Angoul√™me, there are large markets where the little books are available. Because most of the books are rather cheap and were printed in limited quantities, they have become a target of collecters. Minicomics typically have no editorial oversight, and both their content and quality vary widely. Many of the creators of minicomics do not expect to make a significant amount of money, or even cover their costs, with the price they charge for their comics. History The earliest and most popular comics in mini- and digest sizes--predating not only the term minicomic, but even the standard comic-book format--were the anonymous and pornographic Tijuana bibles of the 1920s. The underground publisher San Francisco Comic Book Company, run by Gary Arlington, published a number of minicomics in the period 1968‚Äì1976, including minicomics by Art Spiegelman and Bill Griffith. In c. 1968, Carl Gafford created Blue Plaque Publications, the first minicomic co-op, a cooperative of minicomic creators that traded and promoted small press comics and fanzines. Jack T. Chick's \\"Chick tracts\\", which began appearing widely in the early 1970s, also used a mini-size, although they are not typically considered mincomics. Matt Feazell's popular Cynicalman mincomics, which began in 1980, utilize the US letter page folded in quarters; the same format used by Alfred Huete's award-winning DADA mini. Many minicomics in the 1980s were produced by artists influenced by the underground comix scene who were unable to get work published in underground and alternative publications. Michael Dowers' Starhead Comix published many minicomics throughout the latter half of the 1980s, before the company moved to traditional comic book printing and distribution. John Porcellino's King-Cat Comics, first published in May 1989 and still being published, is among the best-known and longest-running minicomics titles. In the 1990s, before the widespread adoption of the World Wide Web, minicomics became a popular form of self-distribution for alternative cartoonists, aided by such publications as Factsheet Five. Comic book series like Jessica Abel's Artbabe, Julie Doucet's Dirty Plotte,Dirty Plotte mini-comics, Grand Comics Database. Accessed Oct. 6, 2016. and Adrian Tomine's Optic Nerve32 Stories: The Complete Optic Nerve Mini-Comics (Drawn and Quarterly, 1998) . all started out as self-published minicomics before being picked up by legitimate publishers. In 1993, Rick Bradford (who had been involved in the minicomics scene since 1985) began publishing Poopsheet, a zine that reviewed other small publications, including minicomics. Poopsheet eventually became a website and is now known as The Poopsheet Foundation, which is dedicated to archiving the history of minicomics. The Ignatz Award for Best Minicomic has been awarded at the Small Press Expo every year since 1997. In 2003, cartoonists Andy Hartzell and Jesse Reklaw co-founded Global Hobo Distro, a distributor dedicated to hand-made and hard-to-find comics that is partnered with Last Gasp. Alternate meaning The term minicomic also refers to the small comics booklets that come in the packages of some toys: * Masters of the Universe (1981‚Äì2014) ‚Äî The first Masters of the Universe toys did not have a TV series, and thus came with little story booklets (and later, comics) that showed the original background of the series (He-Man as a barbarian, Skeletor from another dimension, etc.). However, after the later sources (DC Comics and the TV series) started to change that background (He- Man as Prince Adam, for example) the comics began to reflect those changes. See List of He-Man Minicomics. * Atari Force (1982) ‚Äî a five-issue series included with certain Atari 2600 game cartridges. * Swordquest (1982‚Äì1983) ‚Äî three comics included with the Atari 2600 cartridges for the Swordquest series. * Super Powers (1984‚Äì1985) ‚Äî Kenner Products created a collection of action figures based on the DC Comics super-heroes and super-villains called Super Powers. The first two waves of the collection came with minicomics which featured the character with which it came, one of the villains from the collection (who, obviously, was the antagonist of the story inside the comic) and other heroes featured in the collection. See List of Super Powers Minicomics. * Transformers (2002‚Äì2005) ‚Äî the toys of Transformers: Armada and Transformers: Energon came with minicomics that featured the characters of the toy lines. * Marvel Mega Morphs (2005) ‚Äî this was a toy line created by Toy Biz in order to compete with Hasbro's Transformers. The Mega Morphs were transforming robots patterned on Marvel Comics super heroes. Each figure came with a minicomic featuring the Megamorph with which it came.

It was for several years the tallest building in the state. Today, the hotel is part of Marriott Hotel's Autograph Collection. History The Adolphus was opened on October 5, 1912, built by the founder of the Anheuser-Busch company, Adolphus Busch in a Beaux Arts style designed by Thomas P. Barnett of Barnett, Haynes & Barnett of St. Louis. Busch's intention in constructing the hotel was to establish the first grand and posh hotel in the city of Dallas. Under the management of Otto Schubert from 1922‚Äì1946, the hotel grew to national prominence. With 22 floors standing a total of 312 feet (95 m), the building was the tallest building in Texas until it was dwarfed by the Magnolia Petroleum Building (now the Magnolia Hotel) just down the street in August 1922.Dallassky.com ‚Äì Magnolia Building. Retrieved 24 August 2006. The building underwent a series of expansions, first in 1916, then 1926 and finally in 1950, at the time giving the hotel a total of 1,200 rooms. In the 1930s, it was run by hotel industry pioneer Ralph Hitz's National Hotel Management Company Cincinnati Enquirer Newspaper, 28 July 1934, pg. 9;https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/99487787/ Retrieved 08 March 2018. and played host to many big band musicians of the era, including Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey, Benny Goodman and Glenn Miller. In addition, the Adolphus Hotel was featured in Victor H. Green's Negro Motorist Green Book in 1936. Green published his Green Book, as it is commonly known, as a guide for blacks seeking recreation, and as a road map for black travelers to avoid fatal encounters with whites during the Jim Crow era. Effectively, the Green Book informed blacks not only where they should visit ‚Äï which hotels and restaurants and hair salons ‚Äï but quite literally where they should not go if they valued their lives. In the early 20th century, the Adolphus Hotel was a resting place for the Ku Klux Klan, which routinely terrorized blacks in the area. The hotel also enforced segregation through the 1950s. In 1936, the historian and political activist J. Evetts Haley organized at the Adolphus his third party, the \\"Jeffersonian Democrats of Texas\\", to oppose within Texas the reelection of U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, whom Haley considered a socialist. The Adolphus has been the host of many respected leaders of business, government and entertainment, including presidents, from Warren G. Harding to George H. W. Bush. Elizabeth II and Prince Philip also stayed at the hotel in 1991. Acclaimed British Milliner Nick Smith resided at the hotel for several months in 2007 to write his d√©but novel \\"Rock Royalty: Diary of a Supermodel\\". This hotel was a Dallas hub for entertainment and provided a platform that helped developing careers, such as Bob Hope, Jack Benny and others. North American Aviation (P-51 Mustangs, World War II) and others benefitted from its position as a Texas business hub. During the 1980s, the Adolphus underwent a US$80 million renovation, enlarging and modernizing the already-luxurious guestrooms. It also shrunk the total number of guestrooms to 428 to make the rooms more spacious. The Adolphus was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. The Hotel has been named one of the top ten in the United States by Cond√© Nast Traveler and also receives high ratings from Zagat, Fodor's and Frommer's. The structure is a Dallas Landmark and listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The hotel is reportedly haunted by the ghost of a jilted bride, who has been seen wandering the 19th floor of the hotel. She was due to be married one day during the 1930s, but her fianc√© didn't show, leaving the bride-to-be embarrassed and broken- hearted. Later that day her body was found, hanging a few feet from the spot where she was due to say her vows.http://www.hauntedrooms.com/the-adolphus- hotel-dallas-tx Gallery File:Adolphus Hotel Entrance.

Its offices are located on the UA campus in Tucson, Arizona (US). Established in 1916, the first telescope and building were formally dedicated on April 23, 1923. It now operates, or is a partner in telescopes at five mountain-top locations in Arizona, one in New Mexico, one in Hawaii, and one in Chile. It has provided instruments for three different space telescopes and numerous terrestrial ones. Steward also has one of the few facilities in the world that can cast and figure the very large primary mirrors used in telescopes built in the early 21st century. History Steward Observatory owes its existence to the efforts of American astronomer and dendrochronologist Andrew Ellicott Douglass. In 1906, Douglass accepted a position as Assistant Professor of Physics and Geography at the University of Arizona in Tucson, Arizona. Almost immediately upon his arrival in Tucson, Douglass established astronomical research programs using an 8-inch refracting telescope on loan from the Harvard College Observatory and actively began to pursue funding to construct a large research-class telescope in Tucson. Over the next 10 years, all of Douglass‚Äô efforts to secure funding from the University and the Arizona Territorial (and later State) Legislatures ended in failure. During this time period, Douglass served the University of Arizona as Head of the Dept. of Physics and Astronomy, Interim President, and finally Dean of the College of Letters, Arts, & Sciences. Then on October 18, 1916, University President Rufus B. von KleinSmid announced that an anonymous donor had given the University $60,000 ‚Äú‚Ä¶to be used to buy a telescope of huge size.‚Äù That donor was later revealed to be Mrs. Lavinia Steward of Oracle, Arizona. Mrs. Steward was a wealthy widow who had an interest in astronomy and a desire to memorialize her late husband, Mr. Henry Steward. Douglass made plans to use the Steward gift to construct a 36-inch diameter Newtonian reflecting telescope. The Warner & Swasey Company of Cleveland, Ohio was contracted to build the telescope, but the United States entry into World War I delayed the contract since Warner & Swasey had war contracts that took priority. The situation was further delayed by the fact that up until this time, the expertise in large telescope mirror making was in Europe. The war made it impossible to contract with a European company. So Douglass had to find an American glass company that was willing to develop this expertise. After a couple of failed castings, the Spencer Lens Co. of Buffalo, New York ultimately produced a 36-inch mirror for the Steward Telescope. The telescope was finally installed in the observatory building in July 1922, and the Steward Observatory was officially dedicated on April 23, 1923. In his dedication address, Douglass recounted the trials and tribulations of establishing the observatory, then gave the following eloquent justification for the scientific endeavor: > In concluding I wish to leave with you a more general view. This > installation is to be devoted to scientific research. Scientific research is > business foresight on a large scale. It is knowledge obtained before it is > needed. Knowledge is power, but we cannot tell which fact in the domain of > knowledge is the one which is going to give the power, and we therefore > develop the idea of knowledge for its own sake, confident that some one fact > or training will pay for all the effort. This I believe is the essence of > education wherever such education is not strictly vocational. The student > learns many facts and has much training. He can only dimly see which fact > and which training will be of eminent use to him, but some special part of > his education will take root in him and grow and pay for all of the effort > which he and his friends have put into it. So it is with the research > institutions. In this Observatory I sincerely hope and expect that the > boundaries of human knowledge will be advanced along astronomical lines. > Astronomy was the first science developed by our primitive ancestors > thousands of years ago because it measured time. Performing that same > function, it has played a vast part in human history, and today it is > telling us facts, forever wonderful, about the size of our universe; perhaps > tomorrow it will give us practical help in showing us how to predict > climatic conditions in the future. Observatories Steward Observatory manages three different observing locations in southern Arizona: Mount Graham International Observatory (MGIO), Mount Lemmon Observatory, and Catalina Station on Mount Bigelow. It also operates telescopes at two additional important observatories: Kitt Peak National Observatory (KPNO) and Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory on Mount Hopkins. Steward is a partner in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-III, which is located in New Mexico at Apache Point Observatory. Steward maintains a student observatory on Tumamoc Hill approximately west of the campus. The original observatory building in Tucson is used only for public outreach and undergraduate general education. The Arizona Radio Observatory, a subsidiary of Steward Observatory, operates one telescope each at KPNO and MGIO. Steward Observatory participates in three international projects. It is a full member in the twin Magellan Telescopes at Las Campanas Observatory in northern Chile. It is also a member in two projects planned for same region: the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope and the Giant Magellan Telescope, a next generation extremely large telescope. The Richard F. Caris Mirror Laboratory is fabricating and finishing the mirrors for both telescopes, and also made the two Magellan mirrors. Research groups The Richard F. Caris Mirror Laboratory, located under the east side of Arizona Stadium, has pioneered new techniques of large mirror production, including spin-casting lightweight honeycomb mirrors in a rotating furnace, and stressed-lap polishing. The Mirror Laboratory completed the second mirror for the Large Binocular Telescope in September, 2005. The Mirror Lab also cast the 8.4 meter diameter primary/tertiary mirror for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, and has started work on 2 of the 7 off-axis primary mirrors for the Giant Magellan Telescope. The Infrared Detector Laboratory built the Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS) instrument for the Hubble Space Telescope and the Multiband Imaging Photometer (MIPS) instrument for the Spitzer Space Telescope. For the James Webb Space Telescope, Steward built the Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) and helped build the Mid-IR Instrument (MIRI). Both instruments have been delivered to NASA; launch is currently scheduled for March 2021. Other groups include the Center for Astronomical Adaptive Optics (CAAO), the Imaging Technology Laboratory (ITL), the Steward Observatory Radio Astronomy Laboratory (SORAL), the Earths in Other Solar Systems (EOS) group, and the Astrochemistry/Spectroscopy Laboratory.

They are part of the Northern Athabascan group of peoples, and come from what is now Western Canada.  Terminology  The French-speaking missionaries to the northwest of the Red River Colony referred to the Chipewyan people as Montagnais in their documents written in French. Montagnais (in French) therefore has often been mistakenly translated to Montagnais (in English), which refers to the Neenolino Innu of northern Quebec, and not the Dene (Chipewyan people). Album with photos of Chipewyan woman and boy Demographics Chipewyan peoples live in the region spanning the western Canadian Shield to the Northwest Territories, including northern parts of the provinces of Manitoba, Alberta and Saskatchewan. There are also many burial and archaeological sites in Nunavut which are part of the D√´nes≈≥≈Çƒ±Ã®ne group. The following list of First Nations band governments had in August 2016 a total registered membership of 25,519, with 11,315 in Saskatchewan, 6,952 in Alberta, 3,038 in Manitoba and 4,214 in the Northwest Territories. All had Denesuline populations; however, several had a combination of Cree and Denesuline members (see the Barren Lands First Nation in Manitoba and the Fort McMurray First Nation in Alberta). There are also many Dene (D√´nes≈≥lƒ±Ã®ne)-speaking M√©tis communities located throughout the region. The Saskatchewan village of La Loche, for example, had 2,300 residents who in the 2011 census identified as speaking Dene (Denesuline) as their native language. About 1,800 of the residents were M√©tis and about 600 were members of the Clearwater River Dene Nation.  Commemorations  The relocation of the Sayisi Dene is commemorated in the Dene Memorial in Churchill Manitoba.

Population: 1,989  Historical Chipewyan regional groups  The Chipewyan moved in small groups or bands, consisting of several extended families, alternating between winter and summer camps. The groups participated in hunting, trapping, fishing and gathering in Canada's boreal forest and around the many lakes of their territory. Later, with the emerging North American fur trade, they organized into several major regional groups in the vicinity of the European trading posts to control, as middleman, the carrying trade in furs and the hunting of fur-bearing animals. The new social groupings also enabled the Chipewyan to dominate their Dene neighbors and to better defend themselves against their rifle-armed Cree enemies, who were advancing to the Peace River and Lake Athabasca. * Ka√≠-theli-ke-hot!√≠nne (K'aƒ±ÃÅt√´lƒ±ÃÅ h√≥t'ƒ±Ã®ne) ('willow flat-country up they-dwell') lived on the western shore of Lake Athabasca at Fort Chipewyan. Their tribal area extended northward to Fort Smith on the Slave River and south to Fort McMurray on the Athabasca River)The Chipewyan * K√©s-ye-hot!√≠nne (K'√´sy√´h√≥t'ƒ±Ã®ne) ('aspen house they-dwell' or 'poplar house they-dwell') lived on the upper reaches of the Churchill River, along the Lac √éle-√†-la-Crosse, Methye Portage, Cold Lake, Heart Lake and Onion Lake. The tribal name is probably a description of adjacent Chipewyan groups for this major regional group and takes literally reference to the Lac Ile √† la Crosse established European trading forts which were built with Poplar or Aspen wood. * Hoteladi H√≥tthƒôÃàn√°d√© d√´ne ('northern people') lived north of the K√©s-ye-hot!√≠nne between Cree Lake, west of Reindeer Lake on the south and on the east shore of Lake Athabasca in the north. * H√¢th√©l-hot!inne (H√°tth√´l√≥t'ƒ±Ã®ne) ('lowland they-dwell') lived in the Reindeer Lake (…Ç√´tth√´n tu√©) Region which drains south into the Churchill River. * Etthen eldili dene (Etth√©n held√©lƒØ Den√©, Ethen-eldeli - 'Caribou-Eaters') lived in the Taiga east of Lake Athabasca far east to Hudson Bay, at Reindeer Lake, Hatchet Lake, Wollaston Lake and Lac Brochet * Kkrest'ayle kke ottine ('dwellers among the quaking aspens' or 'trembling aspen people') lived in the boreal forests between Great Slave Lake in the south and Great Bear Lake in the north. * Sayisi Dene (Saƒ±ÃÅyƒ±sƒ±ÃÅ d√´ne) (or Saw-eessaw-dinneh - 'people of the east') traded at Fort Chipewyan. Their hunting and tribal areas extended between Lake Athabasca and Great Slave Lake, and along the Churchill River. * G√°ne-k√∫nan- hot!√≠nne (GƒÖnƒ±Ã® kuƒô h√≥t'ƒ±Ã®ne) ('jack-pine home they-dwell') lived in the taiga east of Lake Athabasca and were particularly centered along the eastern Fond- du-Lac area. * Des-n√®dh√®-kk√®-nad√® (D√´sn√´dh√© k'e n√°rad√© d√´ne) (Desnedekenade, Desnedh√© hoƒØÃÅ√© nad√© hot'ƒØnƒôÃÅ - 'people along the great river') were also known as Athabasca Chipewyan. They lived between Great Slave Lake and Lake Athabasca along the Slave River near Fort Resolution (Deninoo Kue - 'moose Island'). * Thilanottine (Tthƒ±ÃÅlƒÖÃÅne h√≥t'ƒ±Ã®ne) (Tu tth√≠l√° hot'ƒØnƒôÃÅ - 'those who dwell at the head of the lakes' or 'people of the end of the head') lived along the lakes of the Upper Churchill River area, along the Churchill River and Athabasca River, from Great Slave Lake and Lake Athabasca in the north to Cold Lake and Lac la Biche in the southwest.Dene * Tandz√°n-hot!√≠nne (T√°lzƒÖÃÅh√≥t'ƒ±Ã®ne) ('dwellers at the dirty lake', also known as Den√≠-nu-eke-t√≥we - 'moose island up lake-on') lived on the northern shore of Great Slave Lake and along the Yellowknife River, and before their expulsion by the T≈Çƒ±Ã®ch«´ along Coppermine River. They were often regarded as a Chipewyan group, but form as \\"Yellowknives\\" historically an independent First Nation and called themselves T'atsaot'ine (T'√°tsƒÖn√≥t'ƒ±Ã®ne). Ethnography Denesuline children by canoe in La Loche Historically, the Denesuline were allied to some degree with the southerly Cree, and warred against Inuit and other Dene peoples to the north of Chipewyan lands. An important historic Denesuline is Thanadelthur (\\"Marten Jumping\\"), a young woman who early in the 18th century helped her people to establish peace with the Cree, and to get involved with the fur trade (Steckley 1999). The Sayisi Dene of northern Manitoba is a Chipewyan band notable for hunting migratory caribou. They were historically located at Little Duck Lake and known as the \\"Duck Lake Dene\\". In 1956, the government relocated them to the port of Churchill on the shore of Hudson Bay and a small village north of Churchill called North Knife River, joining other Chipewyan Dene and becoming members of \\"Fort Churchill Dene Chipewyan Band\\". In the 1970s, the \\"Duck Lake Dene\\" opted for self-reliance, a return to caribou hunting, and relocated to Tadoule Lake, Manitoba, legally becoming \\"Sayisi Dene First Nation (Tadoule Lake, Manitoba)\\" in the 1990s.  Culture  The Chipewyan used to largely be nomadic. They used to be organized into small bands and temporarily lived in tepees. They wore one-piece pants and moccasin outfits. However, their nomadic lifestyle began to erode since 1717 when they encountered English entrepreneurs. The Chipewyan subsequently became important in the subarctic trade by exchanging furs and hides for metal tools, guns, and cloth. Modern Chipewyan are either fluidly sedentary or semi-nomadic in lifestyle. Many still practice their traditional lifestyle for subsistence like fishing or hunting caribou although this process is modernized with the use of modern nets, tools, transportation and more.  Language  Historical distribution of the Denesuline language Denesuline (Chipewyan) speak the Denesuline language, of the Athabaskan linguistic group. Denesuline is spoken by Aboriginal people in Canada whose name for themselves is a cognate of the word (\\"people\\"): (or ). Speakers of the language speak different dialects but understand each other. There is a 'k', t dialect that most people speak. For example, people in Fond du lac, speak the 'k' and say while others who use the 't' say . Sign in Denesuline at La Loche Airport The name Chipewyan is, like many people of the Canadian prairies, of Algonquian origin. It is derived from the Plains Cree name for them, (), \\"pointed skin\\", from (), \\"to be pointed\\"; and (), \\"skin\\" or \\"hide\\" - a reference to the cut and style of Chipewyan parkas.Campbell, Lyle (1997). American Indian Languages: The Historical Linguistics of Native America. Oxford: Oxford University Press, pg. 395 Most Chipewyan people now use Dene and Denesuline to describe themselves and their language. The Saskatchewan communities of Fond-du-Lac, Black Lake and Wollaston Lake are a few. Despite the superficial similarity of the names, the Chipewyan are not related to the Chippewa (Ojibwa) people. In 2015, Shene Catholique-Valpy, a Chipewyan woman in the Northwest Territories, challenged the territorial government over its refusal to permit her to use the  î character in her daughter's name, Sahai îa. The territory argued that territorial and federal identity documents were unable to accommodate the character. Sahai îa's mother finally registered her name with a hyphen in place of the  î, while continuing to challenge the policy. Shortly afterward, another woman named Andrea Heron also challenged the territory on the same grounds, for refusing to accept the  î character in her daughter's Slavey name, Sakae îah (actually a cognate of Sahai îa).

However, the UltraPort devices shipped with an adapter which allowed them to be attached to a regular USB port. Select ThinkPad models from 2000 to 2002 came with an UltraPort connector on the top edge of the laptop's screen, and IBM sold a variety of laptop-relevant UltraPort devices, including webcams, speakers, and microphone arrays. UltraPort was designed in 1999 in response to the proliferation of many laptop computers from Sony, Fujitsu, and others that had built-in cameras.

Until the introduction of the roundarm style in the first half of the 19th century, bowling was performed in the same way as in bowls, the ball being delivered with the hand below the waist. Bowls may well be an older game than cricket and it is possible (although unlikely) that cricket was derived from bowls by the intervention of a batsman trying to stop the ball reaching its target by hitting it away, though bowling per se continued as in bowls. History For centuries, bowling was performed exactly as in bowls because the ball was rolled or skimmed along the ground. The bowlers may have used variations in pace but the basic action was essentially the same. There are surviving illustrations from the first half of the eighteenth century which depict the bowler with one knee bent forward and his bowling hand close to the ground, while the ball trundles (if slow) or skims (if quick) towards a batsman armed with a bat shaped something like a large hockey stick and guarding a two-stump wicket. Cricket's first great bowling revolution occurred probably in the 1760s when bowlers started to pitch the ball instead of rolling it along the ground. The change was evolutionary and has been described as the event that took cricket out of its \\"pioneering phase\\" into what may be termed its \\"pre- modern phase\\" (i.e., which ended when overarm bowling ushered in the modern game in 1864) and effectively created a different code of cricket, just as there are now two different codes of rugby football. The pitched delivery was established by 1772 when detailed scorecards became commonplace and the straight bat had already replaced the curved one by that time. There is no doubt that the straight bat was invented to contest the pitched delivery. It has been said that the inventor was John Small of Hambledon but it is unlikely that he actually invented it; rather, he was the first great batsman to master its use. The 1760s are one of cricket's \\"Dark Ages\\"; a good deal more is known about the decades 1731‚Äì1750 than of 1751‚Äì1770. This has largely to do with the impact of the Seven Years' War of 1756‚Äì1763 which not only claimed the sport's manpower but also its patronage. Pitching may have begun during that period but little is known about it for it seems to have been introduced and widely accepted without the huge controversies that surrounded the later implementations of roundarm and overarm. The first known codification of the Laws of Cricket, created by the London Cricket Club in 1744, makes no mention of prescribed bowling action and does not say the ball must be delivered at ground level, which suggests a pitched delivery would not be illegal. The rules for bowlers in the 1744 Laws focus on the position of the hind foot during delivery (i.e., it had to be behind the bowling crease) and overstepping is the only specified cause for calling a no-ball. The umpires were granted \\"discretion\\" and so presumably would call no-ball if, say, a ball was thrown by the bowler. One of the first great bowlers to employ the pitched delivery to good effect was Edward \\"Lumpy\\" Stevens of Chertsey and Surrey. There is a surviving rhyme about him to the effect that \\"honest Lumpy did allow he ne'er would pitch but o'er a brow\\". In those days, the leading bowler on each side had choice of precisely where the wickets would be placed and Lumpy was adept at finding a spot where the turf was uneven on a good length so that he could use his repertoire of shooters, twisters and risers. Lumpy was a true professional who studied the arts and crafts of the game to seek continuous improvement as a bowler. He is known to have observed the flight of the ball and experimented for long hours with variations of line, length and speed of delivery until he had mastered the art of pitching. Other great bowlers of the late 18th century were Thomas Brett and David Harris, both of Hambledon. They were fast bowlers whereas Lumpy relied on variety of pace. A notable bowler of the time was Lamborn who spun the ball in an unorthodox fashion and may have been the \\"original unorthodox spinner\\". Underarm bowling was effective while pitch conditions were difficult for batsmen due to being uneven and uncovered. In time, especially after the opening of Lord's and the development of groundsmanship, pitches began to improve and batsmen were able to play longer innings than formerly. In the 1780s and 1790s, one of the best batsmen around was Tom Walker, who was also a very useful slow bowler. Walker was another improviser like Lumpy and he began to experiment by bowling with his hand away from his body. It is not clear how high he raised his hand but it could have been waist height. He was accused of \\"jerking\\" the ball and so delivering it in an unfair and improper manner. He was censured for his trouble and was forced to return to his normal underarm lobs, but he had sown the seeds of bowling's next revolution. This was roundarm, so-called because the hand is held out from the body (i.e., between waist and shoulder height) at the point of delivery. The roundarm style was promoted successively by John Willes, William Lillywhite and Jem Broadbridge until it was finally legalised, amid furious controversy, in 1835 with an amendment to the rule in 1845. Roundarm did not mean the end of underarm, which continued well into the overarm era that began in 1864. William Clarke, founder of the All England Eleven in 1845, remained a highly effective underarm bowler long after roundarm began. Others who sometimes bowled underarm into the overarm era were James Grundy and James Southerton. By the beginning of the twentieth century, underarm had more or less disappeared and was rarely seen thereafter, although exceptions did occur. There were cases where a bowler had been injured and so completed his over with underarms. In more controversial circumstances, there were instances of bowlers who had been no-balled for throwing who decided to bowl underarm to get through the over. George Simpson-Hayward was an England hero of the 1909‚Äì10 series in South Africa with his underarm bowling. Reference books often refer to him as the \\"last great lob bowler\\", but other descriptions suggest he was a ferocious under-arm spinner of the ball, getting immense turn off the pitch through a fairly low trajectory, rather than being a true \\"lobster\\".  Lob bowling  Spy in Vanity Fair, May 1902 In cricket, lob bowling is a largely disused style of bowling. It became illegal under Law 24.1 to use underarm bowling without prior agreement before the match following the incident in the 1980-81 World Series. The last regular bowler of lobs in international cricket was George Simpson-Hayward, in the period before the First World War. He bowled with a lower trajectory than most earlier lob bowlers, imparting great spin to the ball with constant variation of pace as well. Others famous \\"lobsters\\" include Digby Jephson. As an underarm bowler he had an action a little like setting a wood in crown green bowling. It was used in the game in the 19th century, where trajectory was the most important consideration. Lob bowlers, both right and left-handed, sometimes attempted 'donkey drops', pitching the ball on the stumps from as great a height as possible, preferably with the ball descending behind the batsman standing at the crease. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle wrote a story about a similar style of bowling called The Story of Spedegue's Dropper. Today the laws pertaining to the bowling of \\"beamers\\" would be likely to render that kind of bowling illegal, and it would probably be deemed a no-ball. In accordance with Law 41.7.1, a ball that passes the batsman's waist height on the full is a no- ball. Charles Palmer (1919‚Äì2005), who played for Worcestershire and Leicestershire, sometimes used donkey-drops to good effect. Lob bowling is still sometimes found in village cricket; these deliveries are known as donkey-drops. More usually these are over-arm deliveries ; but round-arm is also possible and would more closely approximate a traditional lob.  In modern cricket  Underarm bowling became virtually extinct after the First World War. Trevor Molony, who represented Surrey in three matches in 1921, is considered as the last lob-bowler to play first-class cricket primarily as a bowler. However, Gerald Brodribb in his book on this subject lists about twenty-five instances since that time when underarm bowling was employed in first-class matches. The list of bowlers who have tried this includes Hedley Verity, Jack Iverson, Mike Brearley, George Brown, Wilf Wooller, Maharaja of Patiala and Fred Root. Bowlers have employed underarm bowling for a variety of reasons. When the Trinidadian cricketer Syed Mubarak Ali was no-balled 30 times for throwing in a match against Barbados in 1942, he resorted to rolling the ball along to avoid more no-balls. In similar circumstances, South African bowler Geoff Griffin did the same in an exhibition match that followed the Test against England at Lord's in 1960, where he had already been no-balled. As rain threatened to end the match between Victoria and MCC in 1928‚Äì29, the MCC bowler Fred Barratt rolled the ball along to allow Bill Woodfull to score a four to complete his hundred and Victoria to win. But most of the modern underarm bowlers did it to register some form of protest. Graeme Fowler in his book Fox on the run records that Dilip Vengsarkar bowled an over of lobs in the match between West Zone and England in 1984‚Äì85 when the latter delayed their declaration. When Lancashire batted on for too long against Oxford University at Oxford in 1990, Phil Gerrans, an Australian playing for Oxford, bowled a ball underarm. Since he had not informed the umpire of the change of action, he was no-balled. These appear to be the last instances of underarm bowling in first-class cricket. Definition Technically speaking, an underarm delivery is one in which the bowler's hand does not rise above the level of the waist. The Laws of Cricket now (2000 Code) declare that an underarm delivery is illegal unless otherwise agreed before the match.Laws of Cricket #24 re no-ball A delivery is a no-ball if it bounces more than twice before passing the popping crease: an underarm delivery cannot be performed rolling along the ground. A pitched underarm delivery is a good ball, providing it only pitches once, and providing the opposing captain has agreed beforehand that the style may be used. It is unlikely that any bowler would reintroduce the style, given modern pitch conditions. 1981 incident A controversial incident occurred in the final of the Benson & Hedges World Series Cup at the MCG in 1981 when Australian bowler Trevor Chappell, under orders from his captain and brother Greg Chappell, rolled the final ball along the ground to batsman Brian McKechnie to avoid the possibility of it being hit for the six runs that New Zealand needed to tie the match. In informal cricket Underarm bowling still plays a role in informal garden cricket games, which are often played by less athletic people or young children. Novices at playing the game are often unable to bowl overarm or roundarm effectively or accurately, so can be allowed to bowl underarm by general consensus. Since underarm bowling is also slower than overarm or roundarm, it is easier for novice batsmen to hit the ball, making it ideal for informal and children's cricket.

Most of their molecules consist of a chromophore which makes them coloured. They are unique among the photosynthetic pigments in that they are bonded to certain water-soluble proteins, known as phycobiliproteins. Phycobiliproteins then pass the light energy to chlorophylls for photosynthesis. The phycobilins are especially efficient at absorbing red, orange, yellow, and green light, wavelengths that are not well absorbed by chlorophyll a. Organisms growing in shallow waters tend to contain phycobilins that can capture yellow/red light, while those at greater depth often contain more of the phycobilins that can capture green light, which is relatively more abundant there. The phycobilins fluoresce at a particular wavelength, and are, therefore, often used in research as chemical tags, e.g., by binding phycobiliproteins to antibodies in a technique known as immunofluorescence.  Types  There are four types of phycobilins: # Phycoerythrobilin, which is red # Phycourobilin, which is orange # Phycoviolobilin (also known as phycobiliviolin) found in phycoerythrocyanin # Phycocyanobilin (also known as phycobiliverdin), which is blue. They can be found in different combinations attached to phycobiliproteins to confer specific spectroscopic properties.  Structural relation to other molecules  In chemical terms, phycobilins consist of an open chain of four pyrrole rings (tetrapyrrole) and are structurally similar to the bile pigment bilirubin, which explains the name. (Bilirubin's conformation is also affected by light, a fact used for the phototherapy of jaundiced newborns.) Phycobilins are also closely related to the chromophores of the light-detecting plant pigment phytochrome, which also consist of an open chain of four pyrroles. Chlorophylls are composed of four pyrroles as well, but there the pyrroles are arranged in a ring and contain a metal atom in the center of it.

He played 3 tests and 20 One Day Internationals for Australia. He won the Sheffield Shield with New South Wales twice, and scored a century for Australia against India in the 1983 World Cup. His career was overshadowed, however, by an incident in 1981 in which he bowled an underarm delivery to New Zealand cricketer Brian McKechnie to stop the batsman from hitting a six. After retiring from first class cricket in 1986, Chappell went on to become fielding coach for the Sri Lanka cricket team in 1996, and in 2001 became coach of the Bangladesh cricket team. He used to be the national coach of the Singapore cricket team. Early life Chappell was the youngest of the Chappell cricketing brothers, his two elder brothers being Ian and Greg, and the grandson of former Australian captain Vic Richardson. Chappell grew up playing cricket in the backyard with his brothers, and like them was coached by Lynn Foster and attended Prince Alfred College.\\"'People probably wouldn't remember me if not for the underarm incident'.

It was a highly successful season for Chappell, who found his medium pace bowling effective on English wickets. He ended up making 1,268 runs at an average of 52.8 and taking 106 wickets at an average of 14 ‚Äì the first \\"double\\" of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets in the Central League since 1961. 1975‚Äì76: South Africa Over the 1975‚Äì76 Australian summer Chappell toured South Africa as part of DH Robins XI, a special invitational side managed by Richie Benaud. Chappell's teammates included David Steele and Geoff Howarth.https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/2/DH_Robins_XI_in_South_Africa_1975-76.html Chappell later said \\"I ... did all right\\" on the tour. Highlights for him included scoring 69 against Transvaal.https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/35/35864.html When he returned he continued to play club cricket in Adelaide. 1976: England He returned to England in 1976 and enjoyed another successful English summer in the Lancashire League, this time for East Lancashire. 1976‚Äì77: West Australia Chappell then received an offer to play for the Scarborough Cricket Club in Perth and moved to Western Australia. He had a run of strong games with scores of 48, 88, 43 and 76. This led to him playing four first class games for Western Australia in 1976‚Äì77, in which he scored two fifties at an average of 40. 1977: England In 1977, he played for East Lancashire again in the Lancashire League.Trevor Chappell Lancashire League matches at CricketArchive World Series Cricket=1977‚Äì78 In the same year, Chappell signed to play for World Series Cricket along with his brothers. He had failed to make the first team for WA for the 1977‚Äì78 season when Dennis Lillee approached him. Chappell later recalled, \\"Lillee said to me, \\"Bad luck about not making it in the WA team. Don't worry, something better might come along.\\" I had no idea what he meant. And a few days later [Austin] Robinson, Dennis' manager, rang and said, \\"Do you want to join World Series Cricket\\" and I said, \\"Yeah, where do I sign?\\"\\" Chappell played ten games for WSC Australia in the Country Cup in 1977‚Äì78, scoring 339 runs, more than any other Australian batsman, although his average was only 26.WSC Australia Batting Averages Cricket Country Cup 1977‚Äì78 at Cricket Australia A highlight was a 110 he scored against the West Indies in Albury.\\"WSC Australia v WSC West Indies World Series Cricket Country Cup 1977/78 Venue Lavington Sports Oval, Albury on 12th, 13th December 1977\\" at CricketArchive He also scored 56 off 300 minutes against a World XI in a Lismore game which resulted in him being booed by the crowd for slow scoring. \\"Trevor Chappell batted exceptionally well and he did not deserve the rubbishing the crowd gave him\\", said Australian captain Ross Edwards. 1978‚Äì79: World Series Cricket Over the 1978‚Äì79 season Chappell mostly played for the WSC Cavaliers, a team of players of various nationalities who were not selected for the top three WSC teams, competing in the Cavaliers Cup. \\"We had a whole mixture and nobody probably really wanted to be there\\", recalled Chappell. \\"They would rather be in the main games. We had some surprising results.

Australian XI selection and the West Indies This form helped earn Chappell selection in the Australian XI one-day team for the International Cup that summer (he played in three games with a top score of 14) and also on the Australian XI in the West Indies in 1979.WSC in West Indies 1978‚Äì79 at CricketArchive In the West Indies Chappell was picked in the first four of the Supertests, but was unable to reprise his Australian form in the Caribbean, his highest score in the Test matches and One Day Internationals being 28. During the first Test he was struck in the face by a delivery from Andy Roberts and required stitches. Post-WSC=1979‚Äì80: Move to New South Wales When World Series Cricket ended in 1979, Chappell moved to Sydney and started playing for the club Gordon. He started off the season with 55 for a Rick McCosker XI against a Ross Edwards XI in a trial game. This ensured his selection in the New South Wales side for the first Sheffield Shield match that summer, meaning Chappell had now played for three states. He was preferred to non-WSC-aligned batsman John Dyson, which caused some controversy at the time. Chappell was under pressure to justify his selection but responded with 150 against West Australia, helping New South Wales win.\\"New South Wales v Western Australia Sheffield Shield 1979/80 Venue Sydney Cricket Ground, Sydney on 27th, 28th, 29th, 30th October 1979\\" at CricketArchive He later scored 144 against Tasmania\\"Queensland v New South Wales Sheffield Shield 1979/80 Venue Brisbane Cricket Ground, Woolloongabba, Brisbane on 19th, 20th, 21st, 22nd January 1980 (4-day match)\\" at CricketArchive. 76 not out against Queensland and 80 against the touring English. Chappell started to bowl more, and his fielding by now was amongst the best in the country; he began to be discussed as an international prospect. 1980‚Äì81: One Day International Player At the beginning of the 1980‚Äì81 summer, Chappell's bowling spell of 3‚Äì22 helped NSW defeat Queensland. In November, Chappell was selected in the Australian one- day side against New Zealand. Australia lost the game. Chappell managed only 12 runs and took 0‚Äì21 with the ball. He did not bat or bowl in his second game. Chappell was kept in the team to play India, taking 1‚Äì14 and scoring 14. His figures for his next game were 0‚Äì27 and 6, then 1‚Äì40, 2‚Äì42, 1‚Äì21, 14 and 14. Chappell did not particularly impress with the bat that summer but his bowling and fielding were useful. Chappell's early season Sheffield Shield form was poor but he recovered to score 111 against Queensland. He was then selected to play in the Australian side for the third test against New Zealand, replacing Shaun Graf as 12th man. He had to make way for the next test when Graf returned from injury. He was dropped from the one-day side to make way for Jim Higgs, but soon returned. He managed to keep his place in the squad for the finals. In the second final Chappell took 2‚Äì21. He is most remembered for what happened in the third final. Underarm incident Chappell became infamous after bowling an underarm delivery when playing for Australia during a match against New Zealand in 1981. The teams were contesting the third final of the Benson and Hedges World Series Cup. New Zealand needed to score six runs to tie the match. Not wanting to risk this, Greg Chappell, Australia's captain and Chappell's brother, asked Trevor Chappell how his underarm bowling was. When Trevor Chappell replied that he didn't know because he had never bowled underarm, Greg Chappell said, \\"well there is only one way to find out\\"'Interview with Trevor Chappell:It wasn‚Äôt easy bowling that over' CricketSoccer.com, 26 August 2013 and then Trevor Chappell rolled the ball along the ground to batsman Brian McKechnie. Underarm bowling, allowed at the time by the rules of the series, but already outlawed at the time in England's domestic competition, is no longer permitted in games under the playing regulations directly controlled by the ICC. In terms of The Laws of Cricket (Law 24.1b), underarm bowling is permitted in other matches provided that the captains agree to it prior to the start of the match. Although it was not universally illegal to bowl underarm at the time, it was widely accepted to be contrary to the spirit of the game. A visibly agitated McKechnie could do little but block the ball to avoid being dismissed, then throwing his bat away in disgust, and so Australia won the game. It was described as \\"the most disgusting incident I can recall in the history of cricket\\" by the then Prime Minister of New Zealand, Robert Muldoon.The Underarm incident Chappell played in the fourth final, taking 1‚Äì41. In February 1981, Ian Chappell listed his possible squad for the Ashes, which included Greg Chappell and Doug Walters. Ian Chappell wrote \\"if another batsman is needed for any reason, then Trevor Chappell would be my selection because he can bat anywhere in the order and is the best cover field in Australia.\\" Trevor Chappell returned to Sheffield Shield making 71 against WA. Test Cricket=1981 Ashes This form helped Chappell be selected on the squad to tour England for the 1981 Ashes; he was chosen over Doug Walters, who had been in excellent form for Australia over the summer. (There were several other batsmen apart from Walters who scored more first class runs at a better average than Chappell who were overlooked, including Jon Moss, Peter Sleep, Richie Robinson and Rick McCosker.)Most runs in Australia 1980‚Äì81 season accessed 2 April 2015 \\"I'd never really expected to play Test cricket ‚Äì three family members had already played, what were the chances of a fourth?\\" said Trevor Chappell. \\"Then I was involved in World Series Cricket, throw in the underarm and the odds were getting longer. So when it did happen, it was a great thrill.\\" Greg Chappell chose not to tour England in 1981, and there was much speculation over who would take his spot at number three in the batting line-up. During the early stages of the tour it was thought Martin Kent would take his place at number three, and Chappell only play one-dayers and tour games. However, Kent displayed poor form while Chappell was more consistent ‚Äì 47 against Somerset and 91 against Gloucestershire. As the tour went on, Chappell's form was not particularly good but Kent's was worse, and it was felt the other batsman, Dirk Wellham, was too inexperienced. Hence, Chappell was selected in the first Test. Chappell's first innings saw him come in at number five with Graham Yallop at three. He made 17 runs over 122 minutes. In the second innings, he made 20 over 94 minutes, and hit the winning runs as Australia won by four wickets.1st test Australia v England 1981 accessed 2 April 2015 Chappell kept his place in the team for the second Test but failed twice, scoring 2 and 5.2nd test Australia v England 1981 accessed 2 April 2015 Despite this the selectors kept their faith, and Chappell was in the third Test side, promoted to number three. This match passed into legend. Chappell scored 27 over 161 minutes, helping Australia to a first innings total of 401, notably taking part in a 94-run partnership with John Dyson. England were dismissed for 174, Kim Hughes enforced the follow-on, and at one stage England were 7‚Äì135 in response. Then Ian Botham began one of the most famous counter- attacks in Test cricket, scoring 149 not out and helping England reach 356. Chappell was never called upon to bowl. Australia had to score 130 to win. Chappell came to the wicket when Australia were 1‚Äì13 ‚Äì he and Dyson took them to 56, with Chappell making 8 off 56 balls. He was then dismissed, which triggered a collapse; Australia lost the match by 18 runs.3rd test Australia v England 1981 accessed 2 April 2015 The fighting quality of Chappell's innings had been noted, and it was not a foregone conclusion that he would be dropped. However, by this stage Martin Kent had rediscovered his form, and he was selected in the Australian eleven for the fourth Test, with Chappell made twelfth man. Australia lost the fourth test and there was some media talk that Chappell might find his way back in the team for the fifth test in place of Graham Yallop, who had shown weakness against fast bowling. Chappell scored 46 in a tour game, but then it seemed the wicket for the fifth test would take spin, which Yallop excelled at playing, so he kept his spot and Chappell remained twelfth man. Chappell then won a man-of-the-match award for hitting 63 in a one-day game against Leicestershire. However, Dirk Wellham was preferred to him in the sixth Test. 1981‚Äì82 summer At the beginning of the 1981‚Äì82 summer, Chappell was still mentioned as a Test prospect. \\"Trevor Chappell cannot be left out of calculation\\", wrote one journalist. \\"He is resourceful, can bat early or late, bowls a penetrative medium pacer and fields brilliantly.\\" However, Chappell never played Test cricket again. \\"Being on a tour that is not very successful probably damns your chances to get another go\\", he later reflected. He did participate in a 219-run stand against Tasmania for NSW. He later took 4‚Äì35 against WA in a McDonald's Cup match, and in a crucial Sheffield Shield game against Victoria he took 4‚Äì12 and made 47 runs. 1982‚Äì83 Chappell began the following summer poorly when hit by a ball at training. He recovered, and went on to deliver a number of excellent performances for NSW, including 92 against South Australia, 61 against England, 89 against New Zealand in a one-day game and 132 against Queensland. The highlight of Chappell's summer came during the Sheffield Shield final where his second innings effort of 4‚Äì45 was crucial in helping bowl New South Wales to victory. It was the state's first Shield in a long time. He ended the season with 633 first class runs and 27 wickets. 1983 World Cup Chappell's efforts over the summer resulted in a surprise selection for Australian's 1983 World Cup squad. He said at the time: > I thought I was in with a chance but I didn't want to build up my hopes. The > way I worked it out, it was to be me or Ken MacLeay and I knew I had a few > years experience on him, having played Tests and more Sheffield Shield. This > is the biggest thrill apart from my 1981 Test selection in England and > helping bring back the Sheffield Shield to NSW last year. Ken Macleay ended up joining the squad anyway, when Jeff Thomson fell injured. Chappell was made 12th man for Australia's early games. He was selected for a game against India and promoted to opener ‚Äì he responded by scoring 110. However, he found less success in later games and never played for Australia again after the tournament. Chappell later recalled: > I preferred to open the batting or bat in the top order somewhere. But I > probably wasn't good enough to bat at No. 3 or No. 4, which is why I was > where I was ‚Äì down at the bottom. It just depended if we had couple of good > openers so I wasn't going to get a go there and at No. 3 or No. 4 or even at > 5, 6, so 7 is where I got a go in the international side. Later Career=1983‚Äì84 A series of indifferent performances led to Chappell being dropped by New South Wales during the 1983‚Äì84 season. He was kept on in the one day team and scored 54 against the Australian Capital Territory. 1984‚Äì85 During the opening game of the 1984‚Äì85 season Chappell was again dropped from the NSW Shield team down to 12th man. However he was kept in the side for the McDonald's Cup. Injuries to players and national selection duties meant Chappell found himself back in the team. New South Wales ended up winning both the Sheffield Shield and the McDonald's Cup that season. 1985‚Äì86 During the 1985‚Äì86 summer, Chappell was suspended for two premiership matches in Sydney's grade competition for disputing an umpire's decision. Later life Chappell retired from first-class cricket in 1986; however, he continued to play grade cricket with the North Sydney cricket club, leading them to a premiership. He went on to coach the Gordon Women's cricket club. In 1987, he and Brian McKechnie reunited to play a double wicket game together in New Zealand. He was a fielding coach for Sri Lanka from 1996‚Äì2000 and had a short stint as national coach for Bangladesh. \\"I‚Äôm lucky coaching came along because I couldn‚Äôt bear the thought of office work\\", he said later.Interview with Trevor Chappell 5 December 2013 accessed 1 April 2015 He says coaching Bangladesh was a very rough job because of the language barrier. In 2003, Chappell, along with his brothers, were honoured by the South Australian Cricket Association when a new stand in the Adelaide Oval was named the Chappell Stand after the cricketing brothers. Chappell then became coach of the 1st XI cricket team at The King's School, Parramatta over the Australian summer. He also began coaching the Singapore National Cricket Team. In 2006, he also participated in a game to celebrate former teammate Robert Holland's 60th birthday, as well as Greg Matthews, David Gilbert, Rick McCosker and Greg Dyer at Toronto NSW. From July to September 2009, he undertook a 50-day stint as coach of Singapore for its ICC World Cricket League Division 6 tournament, held in Singapore. In 2013, he said about coaching in Singapore that \\"I have never had my best 11 together during a training session. It is very disjointed and players offer excuses not to train, some of which are probably not legitimate. The players are amateur, so there isn‚Äôt always the motivation to come to training. The work schedule is long and players can‚Äôt leave work early for cricket here. So, as coach it means having to do things over and over again because we can‚Äôt get guys together.\\" \\"I wouldn‚Äôt mind being more involved with helping the New South Wales juniors\\", he said. \\"Unfortunately, the cricket associations seem to look at players from the 1970s and ‚Äò80s as from a bygone era. I have tried a few times to get a more prominent gig in Australia but it never progressed anywhere.\\" Personal life Chappell married Lorraine Gavin in Canberra in 1981; Graeme Watson was his best man. \\"There is not a lot non-cricketing that I have done really\\", he said in a later interview. \\"I'm not married and don't have any kids, so that is a very short story. I was married, shortly after the underarm actually, in March 1981 and then divorced before the 1980s had finished.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Category:1952 births Category:Living people Category:Australian cricketers Category:Australia One Day International cricketers Category:Australia Test cricketers Trevor Category:Cricketers at the 1983 Cricket World Cup Category:Cricketers from Adelaide Category:New South Wales cricketers Category:People educated at Prince Alfred College Category:South Australia cricketers Category:Western Australia cricketers Category:World Series Cricket players Category:D.

Generally, a snap election in a parliamentary system is called to capitalize on an unusual electoral opportunity or to decide a pressing issue, under circumstances when an election is not required by law or convention. A snap election differs from a recall election in that it is initiated by politicians (usually the head of government or ruling party) rather than voters, and from a by-election in that the winners will serve an entire term as opposed to the remainder of an already established term. Early elections can also be called in certain jurisdictions after a ruling coalition is dissolved if a replacement coalition cannot be formed within a constitutionally set time limit. Since the power to call snap elections (the dissolution of parliament) usually lies with the incumbent, they often result in increased majorities for the party already in power provided they have been called at an advantageous time. However, snap elections can also backfire on the incumbent resulting in a decreased majority or in some cases the opposition winning or gaining power. Generally speaking, the Prime Minister under such systems does not have the legal power to call an election, but rather must request the election be called by the head of state. In most countries, the head of state almost always grants such a request by convention. Americas=Belize According to Section 84 of the Constitution of Belize, the National Assembly must be dissolved \\"five years from the date when the two Houses of the former National Assembly first met\\" unless dissolved sooner by the Governor-General of Belize upon the advice of the prime minister.Belize / Belice: Constitution 1981, Political Database of the Americas. (accessed 9 October 2014) Since Belize gained independence from Great Britain in September 1981, snap elections have been called twice, in 1993 and 2012. In March 2015, Belizean Prime Minister Dean Barrow ruled out the possibility of a snap election later in the year.31798 \\"Hon. Barrow Pleased, Avoids Gloating\\", Tropical Vision Limited, 5 March 2015. (accessed 16 March 2015) In the November 2015 general election, Prime Minister Barrow's United Democratic Party increased its majority by 9 percent as it made Belizean history, forming its third consecutive government. Canada In Canada, snap elections at the federal level are not uncommon. During his 10 years as Prime Minister, Jean Chr√©tien recommended to the Governor General to call two snap elections, in 1997 and 2000, winning both times. Wilfrid Laurier and John Turner, meanwhile, both lost their premierships in snap elections they themselves had called (in 1911 and 1984, respectively). The most notable federal snap election is that of 1958, where Prime Minister John Diefenbaker called an election just nine months after the previous one and transformed his minority government into the largest majority in the history of Canada up to that date. A snap election was also called in the province of Ontario in 1990, three years into Premier David Peterson's term. Peterson was polling at 54%, lower than his peak popularity but still well above the opposition party leaders, and expected to be re-elected with comfortable majority. However, the snap election backfired since it was interpreted as a sign of arrogance, with some cynically viewing it as an attempt to win another mandate before an anticipated economic recession. In the biggest upset in Ontario history, the New Democratic Party led by Bob Rae won an unprecedented majority government while Peterson lost his own seat to a rookie NDP candidate. A similar result occurred in Alberta in 2015 when Premier Jim Prentice of the governing Progressive Conservative party called a snap election. A few months before, 11 MLAs including their leader from the official opposition Wildrose Party had crossed the floor to sit with the government. However, the province was entering an economic recession due to the abrupt fall in oil prices, and Prentice's budget was not well received by either the political left or right. The resulting NDP majority victory unseated 13 cabinet ministers and ended 44 years of Progressive Conservative government in Alberta. Peru The Constitution of Peru allows for the dissolution of Congress by the President if a vote of no-confidence is passed three times by the legislative body, and has four months to call for new parliamentary elections or faces impeachment. The 2020 Peruvian parliamentary election parliamentary election were declared after President Mart√≠n Vizcarra dissolved Congress. Venezuela * 2018 Venezuelan presidential election: The original electoral date was scheduled for December 2018, pulled ahead to 22 April 2018, but then delayed for additional weeks to May 2018. Asia and Oceania=Australia There are three procedures in which elections can be held early in Australia: * The maximum term of the Australian House of Representatives is 3 years. However, the chamber can wait several months after the election to make its first sitting, while a campaign period of at least 33 days is needed between the dates that the election is called and held. It is the norm for the chamber to be dissolved early by the Governor-General before its term expires, which is done on the advice of the Prime Minister. * Half of the Australian Senate (excluding the seats representing territories) changes over every three years in July. An election for the half about to change over must take place up to a year before this is due, on a date determined by the government. By convention, the elections of both chambers have usually been held on the same day. If the previous Senate election was held close to the changeover, the next Senate election can be held significantly earlier. * A Double dissolution may be called to resolve conflict between the two chambers, in which case the entire membership of both chambers comes up for election. This requires at least one bill that originated in the House of Representatives (often called a \\"trigger\\") to be rejected twice by the Senate under certain conditions. In this case, the next Senate changeover is due in the second month of July after the election, while the House of Representatives begins a new 3-year term. Examples of early elections in Australia: * 1963 election: Liberal Prime Minister Robert Menzies called an early election for the House of Representatives because the government were struggling to govern with their narrow 2-seat majority in the chamber. The government succeeded in gaining 10 seats. The election left the House and Senate elections out of synchronization until 1974. * 1974 election: The double dissolution election focused on Labor Prime Minister Gough Whitlam's first one-and-a-half years in office and whether the Australian public was willing to continue with his reform agenda, and also to break a deadlock in the Senate after Opposition Leader Billy Snedden announced that the opposition would block the Government's supply bills in the Senate following the Gair Affair. The Whitlam government was subsequently returned with a reduced majority in the House of Representatives but increased presence (but no majority) in the Senate, allowing the government to pass six reform bills in a joint sitting of the two houses of the Australian parliament. * 1975 election: The election followed the controversial dismissal of the Whitlam government by Governor-General Sir John Kerr in the 1975 constitutional crisis and the installation of Opposition Leader Malcolm Fraser as Prime Minister. Labor believed it had a chance of winning the elections, and that the dismissal would be an electoral asset for them but the Coalition attacked Labor for the economic conditions they presided over, resulting in the Coalition winning a record victory, with 91 seats in the House of Representatives to the ALP's 36 and a 35‚Äì27 majority in the expanded Senate. * 1983 election: While an election was not due for seven more months, Malcolm Fraser had been emboldened by the unexpected victory in a 1982 by election which his Liberal Party was expected to lose. Fraser also sought to exploit divisions in the opposition Labor Party, and was surprised to learn that the popular Bob Hawke had won the Labor Party leadership on the day he sought a dissolution. Ultimately, Labor won power and defeated the Fraser government on a 24-seat swing‚Äîthe largest defeat of a sitting government since 1949, and the worst defeat a sitting non-Labor government has ever suffered. * 1984 election: This election was held 18 months ahead of time in order to bring the elections for the House of Representatives and Senate back into line. They had been thrown out of balance by the double dissolution of 1983. It was widely expected that the incumbent Hawke Labor government would be easily re-elected, but an exceptionally long 10-week campaign, confusion over the ballot papers and a strong campaign performance by Liberal leader, Andrew Peacock, saw the government's majority reduced (although this was disguised by the increase in the size of the House from 125 to 148). * 1998 election: The election on 3 October 1998 was held six months earlier than required by the Constitution. Prime Minister John Howard made the announcement following the launch of the coalition's Goods and Services Tax (GST) policy launch and a five-week advertising campaign. The ensuing election was almost entirely dominated by the proposed 10% GST and proposed income tax cuts. * 2010 election: A federal election was held on Saturday, 21 August 2010, which was called relatively early in order to give Prime Minister Gillard - who had won the Prime Ministership outside of an election from Kevin Rudd - a greater mandate. The election ended in a hung parliament, and a resultant retaining of Labor's majority in the House of Representatives after negotiations with independents and the Australian Greens. Bangladesh After Khaleda Zia's Bangladesh Nationalist Party five-year term ended in January 1996, the country went to the polls on 15 February 1996, where elections were boycotted by all major opposition parties including BNP'S arch-rival Sheikh Hasina's Awami League. The opposition had demanded a neutral caretaker government to oversee the polls, but it was rejected by the incumbent government and the election went on as scheduled. The BNP won by default, grabbing all the 300 seats in the house of parliament and assumed power. The Awami League and its allies did not accept the results and called a month-long general strike and blockades to overthrow the BNP government. The general strike was marred by bloody violence including a grenade attack on Awami League's headquarters which killed scores of people. On the other hand, the Supreme Court annulled the election results which forced the BNP government to amend the constitution in a special parliamentary session by introducing the Caretaker government system as a part of the electoral reform. Eventually the BNP government was toppled and ousted when they resigned on 31 March 1996, and handed over power to the caretaker government. The caretaker government stayed in power for 90 days before new elections could be held. Finally a snap election was held on 12 June 1996, where Awami-League won a simple majority by beating its bitter rival BNP and stayed in power for the next five years. India * 1998 general election: General elections were held in India in 1998, after the government elected in 1996 collapsed and the 12th Lok Sabha was convened. New elections were called when Indian National Congress (INC) left the United Front government led by I.K. Gujral, after they refused to drop the regional Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) party from the government after the DMK was linked by an investigative panel to Sri Lankan separatists blamed for the killing of Rajiv Gandhi.HighBeam The outcome of the new elections was also indecisive, with no party or alliance able to create a strong majority. Although the BJP's Atal Bihari Vajpayee retained his position of Prime Minister getting support from 286 members out of 545, the government collapsed again in late 1998 when the AIADMK, with its 18 seats, withdrew their support, leading to new elections in 1999. * 1999 general election: General elections were held in India from 5 September to 3 October 1999, a few months after the Kargil War. The 13th Lok Sabha election is of historical importance as it was the first time a united front of parties managed to attain a majority and form a government that lasted a full term of five years, thus ending a period of political instability at the national level that had been characterised by three general elections held in as many years. On 17 April 1999, the Bharatiya Janata Party(BJP) coalition government led by prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee failed a to win a confidence vote in the Lok Sabha (India's lower house), falling short a single vote due to the withdrawal of one of the government's coalition partners ‚Äì the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK). The leader of the AIADMK, J. Jayalalitha, had consistently threatened to withdraw support from the ruling coalition if certain demands were not met, in particular the sacking of the Tamil Nadu government, control of which she had lost three years prior. The BJP accused Jayalalitha of making the demands in order to avoid standing trial for a series of corruption charges, and no agreement between the parties could be reached leading to the government's defeat. Sonia Gandhi, as leader of the opposition and largest opposition party (Indian National Congress) was unable to form a coalition of parties large enough to secure a working majority in the Lok Sabha. Thus shortly after the no confidence motion, President K. R. Narayanan dissolved the Parliament and called fresh elections. Atal Bihari Vajpayee remained caretaker prime minister till the elections were held later that year.  Israel  After the legislative election in April 2019 resulted in a political stalemate after Yisrael Beiteinu refused to join a Likud-led governing coalition, president Reuven Rivlin refused to give the mandate for coalition formation to the second-largest party Blue and White and instead called a snap legislative election which resulted in a similar stalemate. After both Likud and Blue and White failed to form a coalition, a third consecutive snap election resulted in yet another stalemate. Progress has been made due to the COVID-19 pandemic, although talks on a national unity government have stalled. Japan In Japan, a snap election is called when a Prime Minister dissolves the lower house of the Diet of Japan. The act is based on Article 7 of the Constitution of Japan, which can be interpreted as saying that the Prime Minister has the power to dissolve the lower house after so advising the Emperor. Almost all general elections of the lower house have been snap elections since 1947, when the current constitution was enacted. The only exception was 1976 election, when the Prime Minister Takeo Miki was isolated within his own Liberal Democratic Party. The majority of LDP politicians opposed Miki's decision not to dissolve the lower house until the end of its 4-year term. New Zealand New Zealand elections must be held every three years, and the date is determined by the Prime Minister. There have been three snap elections, in 1951, 1984 and 2002. * The 1951 snap election occurred immediately after the 1951 waterfront dispute, in which the National Party government sided with shipping companies against a militant union, while the Labour opposition equivocated and thus annoyed both sides. The government was returned with an increased majority. * The 1984 snap election occurred during a term in which the National Party government had a majority of only one seat. Prime Minister Robert Muldoon lost patience with his less obedient MPs and called an election, announcing it on television while visibly drunk. Muldoon's government subsequently lost and the Labour Party took power. * The 2002 election. On 12 June 2002 the Labour Party Prime Minister Helen Clark announced that the country would have a general election on 27 July 2002. Clark claimed that an early poll was necessary due to the collapse of her junior coalition partner, the Alliance, but denied it was a snap election. This early election caused considerable comment. Critics claimed that Clark could have continued to govern, and that the early election was called to take advantage of Labour's strong position in the polls. Some commentators believe that a mixture of these factors was responsible. The National Party was caught unprepared by the election and suffered its worst ever result (20.9% of the party vote), and the government was returned with an increased majority. Pakistan * 1990 general election: The Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) led by Benazir Bhutto won a plurality of seats in the 1988 election and Bhutto became Prime Minister. However, by 1990 there was discontent over rising lawlessness, allegations of corruption and the failure of the government to fulfill the promises it had made during the 1988 campaign. * 1993 general election: The Pakistan Muslim League (N) (PML-N) won the 1990 election and the party's leader, Nawaz Sharif, became Prime Minister. In early 1993 he attempted to strip the President of the power to dismiss the Prime Minister, National Assembly and regional assemblies. However, in April 1993 President Khan dismissed Sharif for corruption and called elections for 14 July after dissolving the National Assembly. Sharif immediately appealed to the Supreme Court, which in May ruled by 10 to 1 that Khan had exceeded his powers and therefore restored Sharif as Prime Minister. Khan and Sharif then began to battle for control of Pakistan for the next two months. They both attempted to secure control over the regional assemblies and in particular, Punjab. In Punjab this saw a staged kidnapping and the moving of 130 members of the Punjab Assembly to the capital to ensure they stayed loyal to Sharif. Meanwhile, the leader of the main opposition party Benazir Bhutto threatened to lead a march on Islamabad unless new elections were called. Finally on 18 July, under pressure from the army to resolve the power struggle, Sharif and Khan resigned as Prime Minister and President respectively. Elections for the National Assembly were called for 6 October with elections for the regional assemblies set to follow shortly afterwards. * 1997 general election: The PPP won the largest number of seats in the 1993 election and Benazir Bhutto became prime minister at the head of a coalition government. However, on 5 November 1996, President Leghari, a former ally of Bhutto, dismissed the government 2 years early for alleged corruption and abuse of power. The allegations included financial mismanagement, failing to stop police killings, destroying judicial independence and violating the constitution. A number of PPP party members were detained including Bhutto's husband Asif Ali Zardari who was accused of taking commissions for arranging official deals. A former speaker and member of the PPP Miraj Khalid was appointed interim prime minister. The National Assembly and provincial assemblies were dissolved and elections called for 3 February 1997. Bhutto denied all the charges against herself and petitioned the Supreme Court to reverse her dismissal. However, the court ruled in January that there was sufficient evidence for the dismissal to be justified legally. Philippines In the Philippines, the term \\"snap election\\" usually refers to the 1986 presidential election, which President Ferdinand Marcos called earlier than scheduled in response to growing social unrest. Marcos was declared the official winner of the election but was eventually ousted when allegations of fraud marred the election. The snap election was held early because of political and economic crises, political instability, and deteriorating peace and public order. As the Philippines uses the presidential system with fixed terms, Congress can't be dissolved. This means that \\"snap elections\\" as understood under the parliamentary system cannot be invoked. Thailand * 2006 general election: In 2005, Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra and his Thai Rak Thai Party were re-elected for a second consecutive term in office when they won a landslide general election victory by securing 375 out of 500 seats in parliament. This result gave his party the power to amend the constitution since they won a two-thirds majority. However one year later, in 2006, Thaksin was found to have been indulging in corrupt business practices in his telecommunication firm Shincorp. This led to violent street protests in Bangkok arranged by his rivals, the Democrat party, led by the main opposition leader Abhisit Vejjajiva in which they demanded his resignation. Thaksin took a gamble and called a snap election scheduled for 2 April 2006 where all the main opposition parties boycotted the polls and over 50% of voters chose to not cast their ballots. Thaksin won by default and captured all the 500 seats in the house of parliament. Months later, the supreme court annulled the election results and ordered a fresh election to be held within 100 days from the date of the court's ruling. However, Thaksin was ousted in a bloodless military coup, forcing him into exile in the Philippines and Dubai. The military stayed in power until 2007 when they stepped down and held a general election in December that year to restore democracy. * 2014 general election: Thaksin Shinawatra's sister Yingluck Shinawatra became Thailand's first female prime minister on 3 August 2011 when she won a landslide election victory on 3 July 2011. Peace prevailed in Thailand for the next two and a half years under Prime Minister Yingluck's rule. The country returned to another political crisis in November 2013 when her opponents wanted the prime minister and her Pheu Thai Party government to resign after she tried to pass a controversial amnesty bill in parliament which would permit the return of her brother Thaksin as a free man. However, the bill was not passed because the government succumbed to pressure from weeks of street protests and blockades that took place in Bangkok, which intensified before the King's birthday. On 9 December 2013, Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra decided to dissolve parliament and called a snap general election, which was held on 2 February 2014. This announcement came a day after the resignation of all MPs from the main opposition Democrat Party led by opposition leader Abhisit Vejjajiva, which boycotted the election afterwards. Europe=Armenia Snap parliamentary elections were held in Armenia on 9 December 2018, as none of the parties in the National Assembly were able to put forward and then elect a candidate for Prime Minister in the two-week period following the resignation of incumbent Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan. They were the first elections following the 2018 revolution and the country's first-ever snap elections. Czech Republic Snap general elections were held in the Czech Republic on 25 and 26 October 2013, seven months before the constitutional expiry of the elected parliament's four year legislative term. The government elected in May 2010 led by Prime Minister Petr Neƒças was forced to resign on 17 June 2013, after a corruption and bribery scandal. A caretaker government led by Prime Minister Ji≈ô√≠ Rusnok was then appointed by the President, but narrowly lost a vote of confidence on 7 August, leading to its resignation six days later. The Chamber of Deputies then passed a motion dissolving itself on 20 August, with a call for new elections within 60 days after presidential assent. The President gave his assent on 28 August, scheduling the elections for 25 and 26 October 2013. Denmark In Denmark, Parliamentary elections take place every fourth year (Danish Constitution art. 32, sec. 1); however, the Prime Minister can choose to call an early election at any time, provided that any elected parliament has already been called into session at least once.(Danish Constitution art. 32, sec. 2). If a government loses its majority in the Folketing, this is not automatically a vote of confidence, but such a vote may be called, and ‚Äì if lost ‚Äì the government calls a new election. Denmark has a history of coalition minority governments, and due to this system, a party normally providing parliamentary support for the sitting government while not being part of it, can choose to deprive the government of a parliamentary majority regarding a specific vote, but at the same time avoid calling new elections since any vote of no confidence takes place as a separate procedure. Notably, Denmark faced a number of very short parliaments in the 1970s and the 1980s. Prime Minister Poul Schl√ºter lead a series of coalition minority governments calling elections in both 1984, 1987, 1988 and 1990. Likewise, his predecessors called elections in 1971, 1973, 1975, 1977, 1979 and 1981. For more than 40 years, no Danish parliament has sat its full four-year term, in all cases, the Prime Minister has called elections at an earlier date. *2007 general election: Danish prime minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen announced an election date for 24 October 2007. The election was held ahead of time in the sense that by law, the election needed to be held before 8 February 2009, four years after the previous election. Anders Fogh Rasmussen explained that the elections were called early in order to allow the parliament to work on important upcoming topics without being distracted by a future election. Referring specifically to welfare reform, he said rival parties would then try to outdo each other with expensive reforms which would damage the Danish economy. Finland The President of Finland can call for an early election. As per the version of the 2000 constitution currently in use, the president can do this only upon proposal by the Prime Minister and after consultations with the parliamentary groups, while the Parliament is in session. In prior versions of the constitution, the President had the power to do this unilaterally. France In France, under the Fifth Republic, while the National Assembly is elected for a five-year term, the President has the authority to dissolve the National Assembly and call an early election, provided the Assembly hasn't been dissolved in the preceding twelve months. Since the synchronization of the presidential and parliamentary terms to five years in 2002, reducing the risk of a cohabitation, an early election has not been called. *1997 Parliamentary Election: The then-president Jacques Chirac called an election one year before it was scheduled to take place in an effort to catch the left- wing parties off guard. Partly due to the unpopularity of the prime minister, Alain Jupp√©, a coalition of left-wing parties were able to form a government, resulting in the longest cohabitation period in modern French history. This also marks the only time a French president has lost an election he called on his own initiative. *1988 Parliamentary Election: After the re-election of Fran√ßois Mitterrand in that year's presidential election, a snap parliamentary election was called to try and create a parliamentary majority for Mitterrand. While his allies obtained a plurality of seats, a coalition government needed to be formed. A similar dissolution occurred in 1981 after Mitterrand's first election. Germany In the Federal Republic of Germany, elections to the Bundestag must take place within 46‚Äì48 months after the first sitting of the previous chamber. The President of Germany may dissolve the chamber prematurely if the government loses a confidence motion (at the request of the Chancellor), or if no majority government can be formed. *1972 federal election: Chancellor Willy Brandt's coalition between the SPD and FDP had been elected in 1969 with a relatively narrow 20-seat majority. The government then lost their majority after several MPs defected to the CDU/CSU opposition due to the government's Ostpolitik foreign policy, especially the recognition of the Oder-Neisse line. Benefitting from Brandt's personal popularity, the government was re-elected with a strengthened majority. *1983 federal election: The government of Chancellor Helmut Schmidt had been ousted in October 1982 after the FDP had switched from being allied with the SPD to being allied with the CDU-CSU union. Although the majority of MPs now supported the government of the new Chancellor Helmut Kohl, he called an early election in order to gain an explicit mandate to govern. To do this, he deliberately lost a confidence motion by asking for his coalition MPs to abstain. There was some controversy over this move and the decision was challenged in the Constitutional Court, but given approval. Kohl's government won the election with a net loss of one seat. *2005 federal election: Chancellor Gerhard Schr√∂der deliberately lost a confidence motion to trigger new elections after a series of state election losses, culminating with North Rhine-Westphalia, caused the opposition to gain a wide majority in the Bundesrat. The government also feared that left-wing SPD MPs were threatening to block legislation. As with the 1983 dissolution, it was challenged and upheld in the Constitutional Court. The election produced a hung parliament due to the gains made by The Left party, resulting in a grand coalition being formed between the CDU-CSU and SPD. Schr√∂der lost his chancellorship due to his party narrowly coming second in the elections. Greece In 2012, Greece held snap elections in two consecutive months. The government of George Papandreou, elected in the 2009 legislative election, had resigned in November 2011. Instead of triggering an immediate snap election, the government was replaced by a national unity government which had a remit to ratify and implement decisions taken with other Eurozone countries and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) a month earlier. This government served for six months. The May 2012 legislative election produced a deadlocked parliament and attempts to form a government were unsuccessful. The constitution directs the president to dissolve a newly elected parliament that is unable to form a government. Ten days after the election, the president announced that a second election would be held. The June 2012 legislative election resulted in the formation of a coalition government. Italy In Italy, national snap elections have been quite frequent in modern history, both under the Monarchy and in the current republican phase. After the foundation of the Italian Republic in 1946, the first snap election occurred in 1972 and the latest one in 2008. After significant changes in the election system (in 1992‚Äì93), the frequency of snap elections has been slightly reduced since new regulations granted completion of two of four parliamentary terms. Nonetheless, snap elections still play a role in the political debate as tools considered by political parties and the Executive branch to promote their agenda or to seize political momentum. No recall election is codified in electoral regulations. The Italian President is not required to call for a snap election, even if the Prime Minister asks for it, provided that the Parliament is able to form a new working majority (President Scalfaro denied snap election to Prime Minister Berlusconi after the loss of confidence in 1994). Luxembourg Early general elections were held in Luxembourg on 20 October 2013.Luxembourg calls early elections after spy scandal France 24, 19 July 2013 The elections were called after Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker, at the time the longest serving head of government in the European Union, announced his resignation over a spy scandal involving the Service de Renseignement de l'Etat (SREL). The review found Juncker deficient in his control over the service. After a spy scandal involving the SREL illegally wiretapping politicians, the Grand Duke and his family, and allegations of paying for favours in exchange for access to government ministers and officials leaked through the press, Prime Minister Juncker submitted his resignation to the Grand Duke on 11 July 2013, upon knowledge of the withdrawal of the Luxembourg Socialist Workers' Party from the government and thereby losing its confidence and supply in the Chamber of Deputies. Juncker urged the Grand Duke for the immediate dissolution of parliament and the calling of a snap election. Romania In Romania, under the 1993 constitution, according the article 89, the President of Romania can dissolve the Parliament of Romania if a government has not been formed in 60 days and two proposals for prime-minister have been refused.Article 89, Constitution of Romania Russia In Russia, under the 1993 constitution, according the article 109, while the State Duma (lower house of the federal parliament) is elected for a five-year term, but the president has the authority to dissolve the State Duma and call a snap election. However, this possibility of the president is limited, and he can use it only in two cases: if the State Duma three times in a row refused to approve the prime minister, or twice in three months pass a motion of no confidence against the Government of Russia.Chapter 5. The Federal Assembly *2016 legislative election de facto were snap, as they were held three months ahead of schedule. However, the early holding of election was not due to the dissolution of the State Duma, but to the postponement of the day of voting on the day on which the regional elections were held. The early elections were approved by the Constitutional Court.–ö–° –†–§ —Ä–µ—à–∏—Ç, –º–æ–∂–Ω–æ –ª–∏ –≤ 2016 –≥–æ–¥—É –ø—Ä–æ–≤–æ–¥–∏—Ç—å –¥–æ—Å—Ä–æ—á–Ω—ã–µ –≤—ã–±–æ—Ä—ã –≤ –ì–æ—Å–¥—É–º—ÉConstitutional Court Decision Slovakia A snap general election took place in Slovakia on 10 March 2012 to elect 150 members of the N√°rodn√° rada. The election followed the fall of Prime Minister Iveta Radiƒçov√°'s Slovak Democratic and Christian Union ‚Äì Democratic Party-led coalition in October 2011 over a no confidence vote her government had lost because of its support for the European Financial Stability Fund. Amidst a major corruption scandal involving local center-right politicians, former Prime Minister Robert Fico's Direction ‚Äì Social Democracy won an absolute majority of seats. Slovenia A parliamentary election for the 90 deputies to the National Assembly of Slovenia was held on 4 December 2011. This was the first early election in Slovenia's history. 65.60% of voters cast their vote. The election was surprisingly won by the center-left Positive Slovenia party, led by Zoran Jankoviƒá. However, he failed to be elected as the new Prime Minister in the National Assembly, and the new government was formed by a right-leaning coalition of five parties, led by Janez Jan≈°a, the president of the second-placed Slovenian Democratic Party. the National Assembly consists of 90 members, elected for a four-year term, 88 members elected by the party-list proportional representation system with D'Hondt method and 2 members elected by ethnic minorities (Italians and Hungarians) using the Borda count. The election was previously scheduled to take place in 2012, four years after the 2008 election. However, on 20 September 2011, the government led by Borut Pahor fell after a vote of no confidence. As stated in the Constitution, the National Assembly has to elect a new Prime Minister within 30 days and a candidate has to be proposed by either members of the Assembly or the President of the country within seven days after the fall of a government. If this does not happen, the president dissolves the Assembly and calls for a snap election. The leaders of most parliamentary political parties expressed opinion that they preferred an early election instead of forming a new government. As no candidates were proposed by the deadline, the President Danilo T√ºrk announced that he would dissolve the Assembly on 21 October and that the election would take place on 4 December. The question arose as to whether the President could dissolve the Assembly after the seven days, in the event that no candidate was proposed. However, since this situation is not covered in the constitution, the decision of the President to wait the full 30 days was welcomed by the political parties. The dissolution of the Assembly, a first in independent Slovenia, took place on October 21, a minute after midnight. Spain *2011 general election: The Cortes were dissolved and the general election called by King Juan Carlos I on 26 September, at the request of Prime Minister Jos√© Luis Rodr√≠guez Zapatero, who had already announced his intention to call for a snap election on 28 July. *2016 general election: After no party secured a majority in the 2015 general election and with ensuing negotiations leading to political deadlock, a fresh election was called for 26 June‚Äîthe first time in Spanish recent history that an election was triggered as a result of failure in the government formation process. Sweden The Instrument of Government (Regeringsformen) in the Constitution of Sweden allows an \\"extra election\\" (\\"extra val\\" in Swedish). The wording is used to make clear it does not change the period to the next ordinary election, and the Members of Parliament elected merely serve out what remains of the four-year parliamentary term. Elections are called by the government. Elections are also to be held if the parliament fails four times to elect a prime minister. Elections may not otherwise be called during the first three months of the parliament's first session after a general election. Elections may not be called by a prime minister who has resigned or been discharged. * 2014 Swedish government crisis: On 3 December 2014, Prime Minister Stefan L√∂fven announced that the government was calling for a snap election on 22 March 2015, after the parliament elected on 14 September 2014 voted against the government's proposal for the 2015 state budget.Stefan L√∂fven utlyser extra val (in Swedish), Sydsvenskan, 3 December 2014. However, the final order of the snap election was never carried out as six out of the eight parliament parties reached an agreement on 27 December 2014 called December√∂verenskommelsen (The December Agreement). The agreement was dissolved in 2015. Ukraine In Ukraine a snap poll must have a voter turnout higher than 50%. United Kingdom The conditions for when a snap election can be called have been significantly restricted by the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 (FTPA) to occasions when the government loses a confidence motion or when a two-thirds supermajority of MPs vote in favour. Prior to this, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom had the de facto power to call an election at will by requesting a dissolution from the monarch ‚Äì the limited circumstances where this would not be granted were set out in the Lascelles Principles. During autumn 2019 there were three attempts to trigger an election through the FTPA's provision for a two-thirds majority: all failed. Then the FTPA was bypassed entirely by Parliament enacting the Early Parliamentary General Election Act 2019 stipulating a set date for the next election: the 2019 United Kingdom general election. This required only a simple majority, because of the doctrine of parliamentary supremacy: Parliament cannot pass a law that cannot be changed or reversed by a future Parliament. The following elections were called by a voluntary decision of the government less than four years after the previous election: *1923 general election: Although the Conservatives had won a working majority in the House of Commons after Bonar Law's victory in the 1922 general election, Stanley Baldwin called an election only a year later. Baldwin sought a mandate to raise tariffs, which Law had promised against in the previous election, as well as desiring to gain a personal mandate to govern and strengthen his position within the party. This backfired, as the election resulted in a hung parliament. After losing a confidence motion in January 1924, Baldwin resigned and was replaced by Ramsay MacDonald, who formed the country's first ever Labour minority government with tacit support from the Liberal Party. *1931 general election: After his government split over how to deal with the Great Depression, Ramsay MacDonald offered his resignation to the King in August 1931. He was instead persuaded to form a National Government with the Conservatives and Liberals, which resulted in his expulsion from the Labour Party. The Cabinet then decided to call the election to obtain a Doctor's Mandate to fix the economy. The result was that the National Government won the biggest landslide in British history. Labour, which was blamed for running away from responsibility as a Government in the nation's hour of need, was reduced to just 52 seats and its leader, Arthur Henderson, lost his seat. *1951 general election: Despite the fact the Conservatives were leading in the polls, Clement Attlee called the election to increase his government's majority, which had been reduced to just five seats in the previous general election. The Labour Party was defeated and Winston Churchill returned to power with a majority of 17. *1955 general election: After Winston Churchill retired in April 1955, Anthony Eden took over and immediately called the election in order to gain a mandate for his government. *1966 general election: Harold Wilson called the election seventeen months after Labour narrowly won the 1964 general election: The government had won a barely-workable majority of four seats, which had been reduced to two after the Leyton by-election in January 1965. Labour won a decisive victory, with a majority of 98 seats. *February 1974 general election: Prime Minister Edward Heath called the election in order to get a mandate to face down a miners' strike. The election unexpectedly produced a hung parliament in which Labour narrowly won more seats, despite winning fewer votes than the Conservatives. Unable to form a coalition with the Liberals, Heath resigned and was replaced by Wilson. *October 1974 general election: Six months after the February election, Wilson called another general election in an attempt to win a majority for his Labour minority government and resolve the deadlock. Wilson was successful, though Labour only held a narrow 3-seat majority. Gordon Brown came very close to calling a snap election in the autumn of 2007; after he failed to do this, his popularity and authority greatly declined and he lost power in 2010. The following election was called by a vote in the House of Commons resulting in a two-thirds majority of MPs, under the terms of the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011: *In April 2017, Prime Minister Theresa May requested a general election which was approved in Parliament by a near- unanimous vote. This was shortly after the official commencement of the process of withdrawing from the European Union (Brexit), with May saying that she needed a clear mandate to lead the country through the ensuing negotiations, and hoping to increase her Conservative Party's majority. The 2017 general election was a failure for May, with the Conservative Party losing seats, resulting in a hung parliament. The following elections were forced by a motion of no confidence against the will of the government: *1924 general election: Ramsay MacDonald was forced to call the election after a successful vote of no confidence as a result of the Campbell Case. It was the third general election in three years. The result was a landslide victory for Baldwin and the Conservatives. *1979 general election: This election was held six months before the latest possible date. It was called when the minority Labour government of James Callaghan lost a confidence motion, which had been proposed by the SNP in the aftermath of the Scottish devolution referendum and was taken forward by the Conservatives, by one vote. The Conservatives, led by Margaret Thatcher, won a majority of seats at the election. =Northern Ireland= The devolved UK administrations (the Northern Ireland Assembly, Scottish Parliament, and Welsh Assembly; established in 1998, 1999, and 1998 respectively) are also elected for fixed terms of government (four years prior to 2011, five years thereafter), but snap elections can still be called in the event of a motion of no confidence, or other special circumstances. *2017 Northern Ireland Assembly election: Held ten months after the previous Assembly election. Following the resignation of Sinn F√©in deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness over various issues and scandals with his party's DUP coalition partners, and the subsequent refusal of Sinn F√©in to nominate a new deputy First Minister, the Northern Ireland Executive collapsed and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland James Brokenshire was legally obliged to call a snap election to attempt to restore a functional devolved government. This election took place on 2 March 2017. The DUP and Sinn F√©in remained the two largest parties following the election, but did not reach an agreement to share power until January 2020.

Ooids on the surface of limestone; Carmel Formation (Middle Jurassic) of southern Utah, USA. A thin slice of calcitic ooids from the Carmel Formation, Middle Jurassic, of southern Utah, USA. Ooids are small (commonly ‚â§2 mm in diameter), spheroidal, \\"coated\\" (layered) sedimentary grains, usually composed of calcium carbonate, but sometimes made up of iron- or phosphate-based minerals. Ooids usually form on the sea floor, most commonly in shallow tropical seas (around the Bahamas, for example, or in the Persian Gulf). After being buried under additional sediment, these ooid grains can be cemented together to form a sedimentary rock called an oolite. Oolites usually consist of calcium carbonate; these belong to the limestone rock family. Pisoids are similar to ooids, but are larger than 2 mm in diameter, often considerably larger, as with the pisoids in the hot springs at Carlsbad (Karlovy Vary) in the Czech Republic. Formation An ooid forms as a series of concentric layers around a nucleus. The layers contain crystals arranged radially, tangentially or randomly. The nucleus can be a shell fragment, quartz grain or any other small fragment. Most modern ooids are aragonite, a polymorph of calcium carbonate; some are composed of high-magnesium calcite, and some are bimineralic (layers of calcite and aragonite). Ancient ooids can be calcitic, either originally precipitated as calcite (as in calcite seas), or formed by alteration (neomorphic replacement) of aragonitic ooids (or the aragonite layers in originally bimineralic ooids). Moldic ooids (or molds later filled in by calcite cement) occur in both young and ancient rocks, indicating the removal of a soluble polymorph (usually aragonite). Variation Whether ooids become calcitic or aragonitic can be linked to strontium/calcium substitution within the crystalline structure. This has been shown in some examples to be due to temperature fluctuations in marine environments, which affects salinity levels, which in turn facilitate the substitution. Marine calcitic ooids were typically formed during calcite sea intervals, especially during the Ordovician and the Jurassic Periods. The geochemistry of these seas was a function of seafloor spreading and fluctuating Mg/Ca ratios. Low Mg/Ca ratios favor the precipitation of low-magnesium calcite. Growth mode Ooids with radial crystals (such as the aragonitic ooids in the Great Salt Lake, Utah, US) grow by ions extending the lattices of the radial crystals. The mode of growth of ooids with tangential (usually minute needle-like) crystals is less clear. They may be accumulated in a \\"snowball\\" fashion from tiny crystals in the sediment or water, or they may crystallize in place on the ooid surface. A hypothesis of growth by accretion (like a snowball) from the polymineralic sediment of fine aragonite, high-magnesium calcite (HMC) and low-magnesium calcite (LMC), must explain how only aragonite needles are added to the ooid cortex. Both in tangential and in radial ooids, the cortex is composed of many very fine increments of growth. Some modern (and ancient) ooids partially or totally lack clear layering and have a micritic (very fine grained) texture. Examination of such micritic ooids by scanning electron microscopy often shows evidence of microbial borings later filled by fine cement. Growth factors There are several factors that affect ooid growth: supersaturation of the water with respect to calcium carbonate, the availability of nuclei, agitation of the ooids, water depth, and the role of microbes.

It involves how a person sees themself, compared to the standards that have been set by society. The concept of body image is used in a number of disciplines, including psychology, medicine, psychiatry, psychoanalysis, philosophy, cultural and feminist studies; the media also often uses the term. Across these disciplines there is no single consensus definition, but broadly speaking body image consists of the ways people view themselves; their memories, experiences, assumptions, and comparisons about their own appearances; and their overall attitudes towards their own respective heights, shapes, and weights \\\\-- all of which are shaped by prevalent social and cultural ideals. Body image can be negative (\\"body negativity\\") or positive (\\"body positivity\\"). A person with a negative body image may feel self-conscious or ashamed, and may feel that others are more attractive. Aside from having low self-esteem, sufferers typically fixate on altering their physical appearances. In the long term such behavior creates higher risks of eating disorders, isolation, and mental illnesses. A negative body image may also lead to body dysmorphic disorder, a mental disorder characterized by the obsessive idea that some aspect of one's own body or appearance is severely flawed and warrants exceptional measures to hide or fix. Often, people who have a low body image will try to alter their bodies in some way, such as by dieting or by undergoing cosmetic surgery. Positive body image, on the other hand, consists of perceiving one's figure clearly and correctly, celebrating and appreciating one's body, and understanding that one's appearance does not reflect one's character or worth. Many factors contribute to a person's body image, including family dynamics, mental illness, biological predispositions and environmental causes for obesity or malnutrition, and cultural expectations (e.g., media and politics). People who are either underweight or overweight can have poor body image. However, when people are constantly told and shown the cosmetic appeal of weight loss and are warned about the risks of obesity, those who are normal or overweight on the BMI scale have higher risks of poor body image. \\"We expected women would feel worse about their bodies after seeing ultra-thin models, compared to no models if they have internalized the thin ideal, thus replicating previous findings.\\" A 2007 report by the American Psychological Association found that a culture-wide sexualization of girls and women was contributing to increased female anxiety associated with body image. An Australian government Senate Standing Committee report on the sexualization of children in the media reported similar findings associated with body image. However, other scholars have expressed concern that these claims are not based on solid data.  History  Women of high social status in Ancient Egypt. Imperial consort Zhao Hede during the Chinese Han Dynasty. A noblewoman during the Italian Renaissance. In Ancient Egypt, the perfect woman was said to have a slender figure, with narrow shoulders, and a tall waist. Ancient Greece focused more on the male figure, but its female ideal was full-figured and plump with fair skin tones. Han Dynasty China emphasized pale skin, narrow waists, and petite female figures. During the Italian Renaissance, a wife's appearance was taken as an important reflection of her husband's status; size was linked to wealth, and so the ideal wife was held to have full hips and an ample bosom. The Victorian Era witnessed a similar movement, but the popularity of the waist- cinching corset led to the desirability of the hourglass figure. In the 1920s U.S. fashion and media industries celebrated the Gibson Girl: slim and tall, with a large bust and wide hips, but a narrow waist. These girls were also often shown in magazines such as Harper's Bazaar and LIFE, which resulted in a link between trendy fashions and styles, and the maintenance of active lifestyles and healthy well-beings An English duchess during the Victorian Era. After World War I, the Gibson Girl transformed into the Flapper, an ideal type which dominated the period of the \\"Roaring Twenties\\". Women transitioned towards androgynous looks, in which hair styles were kept short, and brassieres were worn to flatten the chest. Loose clothing was also a trend, as it downplayed the waist by lowering it below the navel, resulting in a straight boyish figure. Dress sense became more casual as well, perhaps reflecting a postwar relaxation of social and political tension, and a reaction against the matronly image of the women behind the alcohol Prohibition movement in the USA. With advertisements increasingly advocating the need to achieve a thinner frame, many women therefore pursued diets and exercise. Although slimmer body types were favoured, a sporty and healthy appearance was still prized above the frail and sickly look from the Victorian Era. Austrian neurologist and psychoanalyst Paul Schilder coined the phrase 'body-image' in his book The Image and Appearance of the Human Body (1935). This work translates and expands Schilder's 1923 work: The 1930s and 1940s witnessed the devastating effects of the second World War. While men were out on the battlefield, females began entering the workforce. This resulted in more formal and traditional military dress styles for women, which caused another shift in body image. While waists remained thin but prominent, the media embraced a more curvaceous look similar to the hourglass figure, through the addition of broad shoulders and large breasts as well. Since this era was part of the golden age of Hollywood, many celebrities continued to influence this trend by wearing tight-fitting clothing that emphasized their figures. Pin-up girls and sex symbols radiating glamour soon followed in the 1950s, and the proportions of the hourglass figure expanded. Notable names include Marilyn Monroe, Sophia Loren, and Jessica Rabbit. In order to achieve this ideal figure, women consumed weight-gain supplements. The release of Playboy magazine and the Barbie doll during this era reinforced this ideal. Depictions of the perfect woman slowly grew thinner from the 1960s onward. The \\"Swinging Sixties\\" saw a similar look to the Flapper with the emergence of high-fashion model Twiggy, who promoted the thin and petite frame, with long slender legs, and an adolescent but androgynous figure. Other characteristics include, small busts, narrow hips, and flat stomachs. Many women either underwent diets or switched to weight-loss supplements to achieve the new look. This eventually resulted in an increase in anorexia nervosa during the 1970s. Greater importance was soon placed on fitness. Actress Farrah Fawcett introduced a more toned and athletic body type. The exercise craze continued in the 1980s with Jane Fonda and the release of workout videos, motivating women to be thin but fit and svelte. This era also saw the rise of tall, long-legged supermodels, such as Naomi Campbell and Cindy Crawford, who set a new beauty standard for women around the world. In the 1990s, supermodel Kate Moss popularized the stick-thin figure instead. The fashion industry pushed her image further with the 'Heroin chic' look, which dominated the catwalks during that time.: waifish appearances, bony structures, thin limbs, and an androgynous figure. Although this extreme period was short-lived, the 2000s saw the rise of the Victoria's Secret models, who altered beauty norms to include slim but healthy figures, with large breasts and bottoms, flat and visible abs, and prominent thigh gaps. More women pursued cosmetic surgery practices, on top of diets and exercise regimes, to attain the perfect appearance. As of 2017, efforts to promote a better body image have included an emphasis on fitness and plus-size models in the fashion and media industries. However, the advancement of technologies and pressures from the media have led to even greater importance being placed on the way we look as an indication of our personal value. Plus-Size Models Advancements in communication technology have resulted in a \\"platform of delivery in which we intercept and interpret messages about ourselves, our self-worth, and our bodies.\\" Social media in particular has reshaped the \\"perfect body\\". Apps and filters retouch images to make people look beautiful, often with inconsistent ideals for hair, body type, and skin tone. According to a study by Dove, only 4% of women thought they were beautiful, while approximately 70% of women and girls in the UK believed the media's portrayal of impractical beauty standards fueled their appearance anxieties. As a result, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reported that, 91% of women were mostly unhappy with their bodies, while 40% will consider cosmetic surgery to fix their flaws. Demographics=Women \\"Social currency for girls and women continues to be rooted in physical appearance\\".Women \\"all over the world are evaluated and oppressed by their appearances\\", including their ages, skin tones, or sizes. Many advertisements promote insecurities in their audiences in order to sell them solutions, and so may present retouched images, sexual objectification, and explicit messages that promote \\"unrealistic images of beauty\\" (LiveLifeGetActive, 2016) and undermine body image, particularly in female audiences. Body dissatisfaction creates negative attitudes, a damaging mentality, and negative habits in young women. The emphasis on an ideal female body shape and size is especially psychologically detrimental to young women, who may resort to grooming, dieting, and surgery in order to be happy. A negative body image is very common among young adult women. ‚ÄúThe prevalence of eating disorder development among college females is especially high, with rates up to 24% among college students‚Äù Body dissatisfaction in girls is associated with increased rate of smoking and a decrease in comfort with sexuality when they're older, which may lead them to consider cosmetic surgery. Global eating disorder rates such as anorexia and bulimia are gradually rising in adolescent girls. The National Eating Disorders Association, reported that 95% of individuals who suffer from an eating disorder are aged 12 to 26, and anorexia is the third-most-common illness among teenagers. Teenage girls are most prone \\"to internalize negative messages and obsess about weight loss to obtain a thin appearance\\". The pressure on women and girls \\"to cope with the effects of culturally induced body insecurity\\" is severe, with many reporting that \\"their lives would be better if they were not judged by their looks and body shape, [as] this is leading to low self-esteem, eating disorders, mental health problems and depression.\\" \\"Cultural messages about beauty (i.e. what it is, how it should be cultivated, and how it will be rewarded) are often implicitly conveyed through media representations of women.\\" Women who compare themselves to images in the media believe they are more overweight than they actually are.Brodie, D., Slade, P., & Riley, V. (1991). Sex differences in body image perceptions.Perceptual and Motor Skills, 72(1), 73‚Äì74. \\"Idealised media images are routinely subjected to computer manipulation techniques, such as airbrushing (e.g. slimming thighs and increasing muscle tone). The resulting images present an unobtainable 'aesthetic perfection' that has no basis in biological reality\\" Paraskeva et al. (2015). However, other researchers have contested the claims of the media effects paradigm. An article by Christopher Ferguson, Benjamin Winegard, and Bo Winegard, for example, argues that peer effects are much more likely to cause body dissatisfaction than media effects, and that media effects have been overemphasized. It also argues that one must be careful about making the leap from arguing that certain environmental conditions might cause body dissatisfaction to the claim that those conditions can cause diagnosable eating disorders. When female undergraduates were exposed to depictions of thin women their body satisfaction decreased; when they were exposed to larger models, it rose. Many women engage in \\"fat talk\\" (speaking negatively about the weight-related size/shape of one's body), a behavior that has been associated with weight dissatisfaction, body surveillance, and body shame. Women who overhear others using fat talk may also experience an increase in body dissatisfaction and guilt. Monteath and McCabe found that 44% of women express negative feelings about both individrual body parts and their bodies as a whole. 37.7% of young American males and 51% of young American females express dissatisfaction with their bodies. In America, the dieting industry earns roughly 40 billion dollars per year. A Harvard study (Fat Talk, Harvard University Press) published in 2000 revealed that 86% of teenage girls are on a diet or believe they should be on one. Dieting has become common even among very young children: 51% of 9- and 10-year-old girls feel better about themselves when they are on diets.  Men  Similarly, media depictions idealizing a muscular physique have led to body dissatisfaction among young men. As many as 45% of teenage boys may suffer from Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD), a mental illness whereby an individual compulsively focuses on self-perceived bodily flaws. Men may also suffer from muscle dysmorphia and may incessantly pursue muscularity without ever becoming fully satisfied with their physiques. 18% of adolescent males were most worried about their weights and physiques (Malcore, 2016); 29% frequently thought about their appearances.; 50% had recently complained about the way they looked. 25% of males report having being teased about their weights, while 33% specify social media as the source for self-consciousness. Following celebrities on social media sites makes it possible to interact personally with celebrities, which has been shown to influence male body image. A number of respondents also admitted to being affected by negative body talk from others. The ideal male body is perceived to feature a narrow waist and hips, broad shoulders, a well-developed upper body, [and] toned \\"six-pack\\" abs. The figure may be traced back to an idealized male doll, G.I. Joe. The \\"bulked-up action heroes, along with the brawny characters in many video games, present an anatomically impossible ideal for boys, much as Barbie promotes proportions that are physically impossible for girls.\\" Boys who are exposed to depictions of muscular warriors who solve problems with their fists may internalize the lesson that aggression and muscles are essential to masculinity. 53% of boys cited advertisements as a \\"major source of pressure to look good; [though] social media (57%) and friends (68%) exerted more influence, while celebrities (49%) were slightly less persuasive\\". In spite of this, 22% of adolescent boys thought that the ideals depicted by the media were aspirational, while 33% called them healthy. Many teenage boys participate in extreme workouts and weight training, and may abuse supplements and steroids to further increase muscle mass. In 2016, 10.5% acknowledged the use of muscle-enhancing substances, while 5 to 6% of respondents admitted to the use of steroids. Although dieting is often overlooked, a significant increase in eating disorders is present among men. Currently, 1 out of 4 men suffer from eating disorders, while 31% have admitted to purging or binge eating in the past. Men often desire up to 26 pounds of additional muscle mass. Men who endorse traditional masculine ideas are more likely to desire additional muscle. The connection between masculinity and muscle is can be traced to Classical antiquity. Men with lower, more feminine waist‚Äìhip ratios (WHR) feel less comfortable and self-report lower body esteem and self- efficacy than men with higher, more masculine, WHRs.  Gender differences  Although body dissatisfaction is more common in women, men are becoming more negatively affected than women. In a longitudinal study that assessed body image across time and age between men and women, men placed greater significance on their physical appearances than women, even though women reported body image dissatisfaction more often. The difference was strongest among adolescents. One theory to explain the discrepancy is that women have already become accustomed and desensitized to media scrutiny. As women age, they experience less stress around body image; as men age, they experience more. However, even into old age, women still think more about their body shapes and endorse thinner figures than do men. \\"Relative to men, women are considerably more psychologically invested in their appearances. Moreover, women's poor evaluations of and stronger investments in their looks potentiate greater body-image dysphoria in women's daily lives.\\" As men and women reach older age, body image takes on a different meaning. Research studies show that the importance attached to physical appearance decreases with age.  Weight  The desire to lose weight is highly correlated with poor body image, with more women than men wanting to lose weight. Kashubeck-West et al. reported that when considering only men and women who desire to lose weight, sex differences in body image disappear. In her book The Beauty Myth, Naomi Wolf reported that \\"thirty-three thousand women told American researchers they would rather lose ten to fifteen pounds than achieve any other goal.\\" Through repeated images of excessively thin women in media, advertisement, and modeling, thinness has become associated with not only beauty, but happiness and success. As Charisse Goodman put it in her article, \\"One Picture is Worth a Thousand Diets\\", advertisements have changed society's ideas of beauty and ugliness: \\"Indeed to judge by the phrasing of the ads, 'slender' and 'attractive' are one word, not two in the same fashion as 'fat' and 'ugly.'\\" Research by Martin and Xavier (2010) shows that people feel more pressure from society to be thin after viewing ads featuring a slim model. Ads featuring a larger sized model resulted in less pressure to be thin. People also felt their actual body sizes were larger after viewing a slim model as compared to a larger model. Many, like journalist Marisa Meltzer, have argued this contemporary standard of beauty to be described as anorexic thinness, an unhealthy idea that is not representative of a natural human body: \\"Never before has the 'perfect' body been at such odds with our true size.\\"Meltzer, Marisa. \\"Absolutely Flabulous\\". Blogs & Stories. The Daily Beast, September 2, 2009. Retrieved January 25, 2010. However, these figures do not distinguish between people at a low or healthy weight who are in fact overweight, between those whose self-perception as being overweight is incorrect and those whose perception of being overweight is correct. Post-1997 studies indicate that around 64% of American adults are overweight, such that if the 56%/40% female/male dissatisfaction rates in the Psychology Today study have held steady since its release, those dissatisfaction rates are if anything disproportionately low: although some individuals continue to believe themselves to be overweight when they are not, those persons are now outnumbered by persons who might be expected to be dissatisfied with their bodies but are not. In turn, although social pressure to lose weight has adverse effects on some individuals who do not need to lose weight, those adverse effects are arguably outweighed by that social pressure's positive effect on the overall population, without which the recent increases in obesity and associated health and social problems (described in both popular and academic parlance as an \\"obesity epidemic\\") would be even more severe than they already are. Overweight children experience not only discrimination but overall body dissatisfaction, low self-esteem, social isolation and depression.  Race  The association of light skin with moral virtue dates back at least to the medieval era, and was reinforced during the Atlantic slave trade. The medieval theory that all races had originated from the white race was an early source of the longstanding association of white bodies and beauty ideals with \\"normality,\\" and other racial phenotypes as aberrant. The 1960s Black is Beautiful movement explicitly attempted to end that mindset. A lack of racial diversity in the fashion industry contributes to body image issues among non-white minorities. A 2003 experiment presented 3 photographs of attractive white, black and Asian women to white, black and Asian students. The study concluded that Asian women found the photograph of the white woman most attractive, and reported high levels of body dissatisfaction. Mexican American women who have been attuned to mainstream US culture reported greater body dissatisfaction and have described their ideal body types to be similar to the white norm. Although ethnicities naturally have different body types, this ideal has led to disordered eating amongst Latinas. Plastic surgery is popular in Asia as a means of Westernizing facial features; rhinoplasty and blepharoplasty may be employed to make noses and eyelids look more Caucasian. Skin lightening products are also prevalent even in countries where non-white ethnicities are the majority, and the industry makes billions of dollars every year. In India alone, whitening products make up 45% of the skin care market. Some whitening cosmetics have dangerous side effects; hydroquinone causes irritation and leukemia while mercury causes rashes. In spite of these effects, industries like the fashion industry have not significantly featured women of color (and when they have, the women may have either been significantly \\"whitewashed\\" ‚Äì with digitally lightened skin and hair ‚Äì or may already have features that are considered \\"white\\"). Western men desire as much as 30 pounds more muscle mass than do Asian men.  Sexuality  A 2013 study found that lesbian-identifying women reported less body dissatisfaction than did heterosexual women. By contrast, a 2014 study found that gay or bisexual-identifying men were 3 times more likely than straight men to have body image dissatisfaction. Causes= The fashion industry  Fashion industry insiders argue that clothes hang better on tall, thin catwalk models, but critics respond that an overemphasis on that body type communicates an unhealthy and unrealistic body image to the public. Fashion magazines directed at females subtly promote thinness and diet practices, and teenagers heavily rely on them for beauty and fashion advice. Seventeen magazine in particular recorded one of the highest number of articles devoted to appearances; 69% of girls reported that it had influenced their ideal body shapes. 50% of advertisements featured also used beauty appeal to sell products. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reported that 90% of teenage girls felt a need to change their appearances, and that 81% of 10-year-olds were already afraid of being fat. According to a survey by the Manchester Metropolitan University, \\"self-esteem and views of body image suffered after the participants were shown magazine pictures of models, [suggests] that media portrayal of images can prolong anorexia and bulimia in women and may even be a cause of it\\". A 2014 survey of 13- to 17-year-old Americans found that 90% \\"felt pressured by fashion and media industries to be skinny\\", and that 65% believed that the bodies portrayed were too thin. More than 60% habitually compared themselves to models, and 46% strove to resemble models' bodies. According to Dove's Global Beauty And Confidence report, \\"a total of 71% of women and 67% of girls want to call on the media to do a better job portraying women of diverse physical appearance, age, race, shape and size.\\" In addition, 67% of men now strongly believe that it is unacceptable for brands to use photo manipulation techniques to alter the body image of a model. In response, the fashion magazine industry has made efforts to include 'real' women, and to reduce or ban the use of airbrushing tools. Likewise, fashion brands and retailers adopt vanity sizing in their assortments to intentionally raise a customer's self-esteem while shopping in stores. This involves labeling clothes with smaller sizes than the actual cut of the items, to trick and attract the consumer. Fashion models themselves have experienced negative body image due to industry pressures: 69% were told to tone up, while 62% reported that their agencies had required them to lose weight or change their body shapes. 54% of models revealed that they would be dropped by their agencies if they failed to comply. Models frequently have underweight body mass index (BMI): a study published in the International Journal of Eating Disorders discovered that a majority of models had a BMI of 17.41, which qualifies as anorexia. In the past twenty years, runway models have also transformed from a typical size 6‚Äì8 to 0‚Äì2. The average weight of an American model was recorded to be twenty-three percent less than an average American woman. In 2006, the fashion industry came under fire due to the untimely deaths of two models, Luisel Ramos and Ana Carolina Reston, both of whom had suffered from eating disorders and been severely underweight. Other models endure intensive exercise regimes, diets, fasts, and detoxes; in order to maintain or lose weight. In addition, 17% have admitted to stimulant abuse, while another 8% frequently engaged in self-induced vomiting. = Attempts to improve = Various jurisdictions have taken steps to protect models and promulgate healthier body image. The UK and US have pursued social education campaigns. Spain, Italy, Brazil, and Israel prohibit models from working with a BMI below 18.5. France similarly forbids the employment of extremely skinny models, and requires medical certificates to verify their health. France is also working on ensuring retailers specify when an image is airbrushed in magazines, websites, and advertisements, although it is unclear whether consumers are already aware of digital retouching techniques.Kim Willsher (December 18, 2015), Models in France must provide doctor's note to work, The Guardian. Some brands voluntarily promote better body images. Fashion conglomerates Kering and LVMH recently \\"announced that they will no longer hire models smaller than a U.S. size 2\\". in hopes of improving the working conditions of models and inspiring others to follow suit. Critics have objected that to ban size-zero models from working constitutes discrimination or thin-shaming. Moreover, the announcement of a small minimum dress size, which does not fit the average body type of most countries, continues to \\"send the message that super slim body types is the 'ideal'\\". Plus-size models are slowly emerging in mainstream media, which may improve body image. Prominent plus-size models include Ashley Graham, the face of popular plus-size retailer Lane Bryant, and Iskra Lawrence, a classified role model for lingerie and swimwear retailer Aerie. Christian Siriano cast five plus-size models for his New York Fashion Week shows. Siriano also made global headlines after he designed a gown for plus- sized actress Leslie Jones when other designers would not. Models have notably used Instagram as a tool to \\"encourage self-acceptance, fight back against body-shamers, and post plenty of selfies celebrating their figure\\". In the U.S., a group of plus-size models launched the #DearNYFW campaign, which targeted the fashion industry's harmful approach towards their bodies. This movement was broadcast across different social media platforms, with other models using the hashtag to share their experiences, in hopes of persuading the American fashion industry to start \\"prioritizing health and celebrate diversity on the runway\\". Fashion photographer Tarik Carroll released a photo series titled the EveryMAN Project to showcase large-framed queer and transgender men of color, with the purpose of \\"challenging hyper-masculinity and gender norms, while bringing body-positivity to the forefront\\". The lack of fashion-forward plus-size clothing in the fashion industry has given rise to the #PlusIsEqual movement. High-street brands such as Forever 21 and ASOS have increased plus-size product offerings. Other brands include Victoria Beckham, who plans to release a range of high-street clothing with sizes up to XXXL, and Nike, which expanded its plus-size collection sizes 1X to 3X. In response to the criticism that the term plus-size caused unnecessary labeling, Kmart replaced its numerical sizing with positive tags such as, \\"lovely\\" and \\"fabulous\\" instead. Another tactic to promote body positivity has been to protest against photo retouching. In 2014, Aerie's ArieReal campaign promised to display \\"campaign spreads and brand imagery with stomach rolls, gapless thighs and other perceived flaws that would normally have been edited out of the ads\\". Neon Moon, a feminist lingerie brand from London, advocates the beauty of flaws, instead of the need to retouch its models for aesthetic purposes. Campaigns often feature a range of \\"diverse models and lack of airbrushing as a marketing tool\\". U.S. e-tailer ModCloth explored other methods, such as employing its own staff as models for its swimwear collection.  Social media  Social media may \\"force [narrower] standards of beauty than ever before\\". Users are constantly bombarded by notifications, posts, and photos about the lives of others, \\"sending messages about what we could, should, or would be if we only purchased certain products, made certain choices, or engaged in certain behaviors\\". Despite the ability to create and control content on social media, \\"the same unattainable body ideals we see in traditional media are also reflected in the online environment.\\" Over- engagement with social networking platforms and images will therefore \\"encourage a psychological adoption of unrealistic beauty ideals ..., [which] can lead to poor body image and low self-esteem\\". A 2016 survey found a relationship between social media usage, body image anxieties, and dieting: 56% of women acknowledged the effect of \\"social media culture in driving the pressure for perfection and negative body image\\", and 42% of women stated social media caused them to feel worse about their bodies,. Another study by the University of South Australia discovered that individuals who frequently uploaded or viewed appearance-related items were more likely to internalise the thin ideal. Applications such as Instagram have become a \\"body-image battleground\\", while the \\"selfie\\" is now the universal lens which individuals use to criticize their bodies and others. Facebook and Snapchat also allow users to receive appearance approvals and community acceptance through the ratio of views, comments, and likes. Since individuals who use social media platforms often only display the high points of their lives, a survey by Common Sense reported that 22% felt bad if their posts were ignored, or if they did not receive the amount of attention they had hoped for. The increased use of body and facial reshaping applications such as Snapchat and Facetune has been identified as a potential cause of body dysmorphia. Recently, a phenomenon referred to as 'Snapchat dysmorphia' has been used to describe people who request surgery to look like the edited versions of themselves as they appear through Snapchat Filters. Many users digitally manipulate the self-portraits they post to social media. According to research by the Renfrew Center Foundation, 50% of men and 70% of 18 to 35-year-old women edited their images before uploading. 35% of respondents were also actively concerned about being tagged in unattractive photos, while 27% fretted about their appearances online. Reports have also shown that the messages delivered by \\"fitspiration\\" websites are sometimes identical to the \\"thinspiration\\" or pro-anorexia types. This is evident through \\"language inducing guilt about weight or the body, and promoted dieting\\". The marketing of restrictive diets to young women as a form of self care can cause \\"increasingly disordered eating\\", and orthorexia, an obsession with the right and wrong types of food. = Attempts to improve = In an attempt to tackle such issues, the UK launched a national campaign called Be Real, after findings showed 76% of secondary school students who learnt about body confidence in class felt more positive about themselves. The goal of this movement was thus to improve body confidence through educational resources provided to schools, and persuading the media, businesses, and the diet industry to endorse different body shapes and sizes instead. Social media platforms such as Instagram have banned the use of thinspiration and thinspo related hashtags. Other solutions include the promotion of hashtags such as #SelfLove and #BodyPositivity, and the promotion of \\"transformation photos\\", side-by-side images displaying an individual's fitness or weight-loss progress, which users have utilized to showcase the deceptiveness of social media. In an effort to alleviate eating disorders, Eating Disorder Hope launched the Pro-Recovery Movement, a live Twitter chat encouraging sufferers to celebrate self-love and a positive body image, through recovery subject matters. ProjectHEAL introduced a campaign called #WhatMakesMeBeautiful, with the aim of celebrating admirable attributes other than appearance.  Measurement  Body image can be measured by asking a subject to rate his or her current and ideal body shape using a series of depictions. The difference between these two values is the measure of body dissatisfaction. There are currently more than 40 \\"instruments\\" used to measure body image. All of these instruments can be put into three categories: figure preferences, video projection techniques, and questionnaires. Because there are so many ways to measure body image, it is difficult to draw meaningful research generalizations. Many factors have to be taken into account when measuring body image, including gender, ethnicity, culture, and age.  Figure rating scales  One of the most prominent measures of body image is Figure Rating Scales, which present a series of body images graded from thin to muscular or from thin to obese. The subject is asked to indicate which figure best represents his or her current perceived body, and which represents his or her ideal or desired body. Bodies depicted in figure rating scales are either hand-drawn silhouettes, computer rendered images, or photographic images.  Video projection techniques  One study showed each participant a series of images of himself or herself with either increased weight or decreased weight. Each participant was asked to respond to the pictures, and his or her startle and eyeblink response were measured. \\"Objective, psychophysiological measures, like the affect modulated startle eyeblink response, are less subject to reporting bias.\\"  Questionnaires  BASS is a 9-item subscale of the Multidimensional Body-Self Relations Questionnaire. It uses a rating scale from ‚àí2 to +2 and assesses eight body areas and attributes and overall appearance (face, hair, lower torso, mid-torso, upper torso, muscle tone, height, and weight). Questionnaires can have confounding variable responses. For instance, \\"Acquiescent response style (ARS), or the tendency to agree with items on a survey, is more common among individuals from Asian and African cultures.\\"  Body size and shape misperception  As well as being dissatisfied with their body sizes, exposure to idealized images of thin bodies is associated with overestimation of one's own body size. Recent research suggests that this exposure to images of thin bodies may cause a recalibration of the visual perceptual mechanisms that represent body size in the brain, such that the observer sees subsequently-viewed bodies, including their own bodies, as heavier than they really are, a process known as \\"visual adaptation\\". There is evidence that individuals who are less satisfied with their bodies may spend a disproportionate amount of time directing their visual attention towards unusually thin bodies, resulting in an even greater overestimation of the size of subsequently-viewed bodies. Further evidence suggests that a similar mechanism may be at play in people (particularly young men) who underestimate their muscularity, such as those suffering from muscle dysmorphia. The nature of the interaction between body size and shape misperception and body dissatisfaction is not yet fully understood, however.

In 1942, Earl Tupper developed his first bell-shaped container; the brand products were introduced in the year 1948 to the public. The term \\"Tupperware\\" is often used generically to refer to plastic or glass food storage containers (tubs) with snap close lids. Tupperware develops, manufactures, and internationally distributes its products as a wholly owned subsidiary of its parent company Tupperware Brands. As of 2007, it was marketed by means of approximately 1.9 million direct salespeople on contract. In 2013, the top marketplace of Tupperware was Indonesia, which topped Germany as the second. Indonesia's sales in 2013 were more than $200 million with 250,000 sales persons. Company history Tupperware containers from 2011 Tupperware was developed in 1946 by Earl Silas Tupper (1907‚Äì83) in Leominster, Massachusetts. He developed plastic containers used in households to contain food and keep it airtight, which featured a then-patented \\"burping seal\\". Tupper had already invented the plastic for Tupperware in 1938, but the product succeeded with the emergence of the \\"sale through presentation\\" idea, held in a party setting. Tupperware developed a direct marketing strategy to sell products known as the Tupperware party. The Tupperware party allowed women of the 1950s to work and enjoy the benefits of earning an income without completely taking away the independence granted to women during the Second World War, when women first began entering the labor market, all the while keeping their focus in the domestic domain. The \\"party plan\\" model builds on characteristics generally developed by being a housewife (e.g., party planning, hosting a party, sociable relations with friends and neighbors) and created an alternative choice for women who either needed or wanted to work. Brownie Wise (1913‚Äì92) realized Tupperware's potential as a commodity. She realized, however, that she had to be creative and therefore started to throw these Tupperware parties. Wise, a former sales representative of Stanley Home Products, developed the strategy. As a result, Brownie Wise was made vice president of marketing in 1951. Wise soon created Tupperware Parties Inc. During the early 1950s, Tupperware's sales and popularity exploded, thanks in large part to Wise's influence among women who sold Tupperware, and some of the famous \\"jubilees\\" celebrating the success of Tupperware ladies at lavish and outlandishly themed parties. Tupperware was known‚Äîat a time when women came back from working during World War II only to be told to \\"go back to the kitchen\\"‚Äîas a method of empowering women, and giving them a toehold in the postwar business world. The tradition of Tupperware's \\"Jubilee\\" style events continues to this day, with rallies being held in major cities to recognize and reward top-selling and top-recruiting individuals, teams, and organizations. In 1958, Earl Tupper fired Wise over general differences of opinion in the Tupperware business operation. Officially, Tupper objected to the expenses incurred by the jubilee and other similar celebrations of Tupperware. However, the real reason was that Tupper had been approached by several companies interested in buying him out; he felt that he would not be able to sell with a woman in an executive position. Rexall bought Tupperware in 1958. Tupperware spread to Europe in 1960 when Mila Pond hosted a Tupperware party in Weybridge, England and subsequently around the world. At the time, a strict dress code was required for Tupperware ladies, with skirts and stockings (tights) worn at all times, and white gloves often accompanying the outfit. A technique called \\"carrot calling\\" helped promote the parties: representatives would travel door to door in a neighborhood and ask housewives to \\"run an experiment\\" in which carrots would be placed in a Tupperware container and compared with \\"anything that you would ordinarily leave them in\\"; it would often result in the scheduling of a Tupperware party. Rexall sold its namesake drugstores in 1977, and renamed itself Dart Industries. Dart merged with Kraftco to form Dart & Kraft. The company demerged, with the former Dart assets renamed Premark International. Tupperware Brands was spun off from Premark in 1996; Premark was acquired by Illinois Tool Works three years later. In 2003, Tupperware closed down operations in the UK and Ireland, citing customer dissatisfaction with their direct sales model. There has been limited importer-distribution since then. The company announced a formal relaunch in the UK in mid-2011, and recruited UK staff, but in December the relaunch was cancelled. In May 2018, the Israeli daily TheMarker, reported that Tupperware will withdraw from Israel leaving 2,000 agents without a job. The article attributed this decision to the regional headquarters which manage other Middle Eastern countries. Tupperware is now sold in almost 100 countries, after peaking at more than a hundred after 1996. Tupperware parties A Tupperware party in the 1950s, as shown in a company advertisement Tupperware is still sold mostly through a party plan, with rewards for hosts and hostesses. A Tupperware party is run by a Tupperware \\"consultant\\" for a host or hostess who invites friends and neighbors into their home to see the product line. Tupperware hosts and hostesses are rewarded with free products based on the level of sales made at their party. Parties also take place in workplaces, schools, and other community groups. To stay in touch with its sales force, Tupperware published the monthly magazine Tupperware Sparks. The magazine had snapshots of sales women posing with awards and recognitions for high sales. To avoid spending money on advertising, Tupperware created events that attracted free publicity. In most countries, Tupperware's sales force is organized in a tiered structure with consultants at the bottom, managers and star managers over them, and next various levels of directors, with Legacy Executive Directors at the top level. In recent years, Tupperware has eliminated distributorships in the US. The multi-level marketing strategy adopted by Tupperware has been criticized as manipulative. Statistics released by Tupperware in 2018 showed that 94% of its active distributors remained on the lowest level of the pyramid, with average gross earnings of $653. In recent years, Tupperware in North America has moved to a new business model which includes more emphasis on direct marketing channels and eliminated its dependency on authorized distributorships. This transition included selling through Target stores in the US and Superstores in Canada with disappointing results. Tupperware states this hurt direct sales. In countries with a strong focus on marketing through parties (such as Germany, Australia, and New Zealand), Tupperware's market share and profitability continue to decline. In many countries, Tupperware products have a lifetime guarantee. The company is best known for its plastic bowls and storage containers. In recent years it has expanded into stainless steel cookware, cutlery, chef's knives and other kitchen gadgets. After experiencing a slump in sales and public image in the mid-1990s, the company created several new product lines to attract a younger market. In some countries including Belgium, Australia, Ireland and the US Tupperware markets their parties and career opportunities through mall kiosks. In China, Tupperware products are sold through franchised \\"entrepreneurial shopfronts\\", of which there were 1,900 in 2005, due to pyramid selling laws enacted in 1998. The Chinese characters ÁâπÁôæÊÉ† are used as the brand name, and translate as \\"hundred benefit\\". Gender aspects and cultural impact Typical Tupperware The reciprocity that emerges at the ‚Äúparties,‚Äù which are traditionally composed of friends and family members of the hostess, creates a nurturing atmosphere without a direct sales feeling. The Larkin Company was the forerunner of this type of \\"party\\" during the 1890s, that was later popularized by such organizations as Tupperware. Feminist views vary regarding the Tupperware format of sales through parties, and the social and economic role of women portrayed by the Tupperware model. Opposing views state that the intended gendered product and selling campaign further domesticates women, and keeps their predominant focus on homemaking. The positive feminist views consider that Tupperware provided work for women who were pregnant or otherwise not guaranteed their position at work due to unequal gender laws in the workplace. The company promoted the betterment of women and the opportunities Tupperware offered women. The negative view includes the restriction of women to the domestic sphere and limiting the real separation between running the household and a career.Clarke, Allison J. (1999) Tupperware, Washington: Smithsonian Institution Press. pp. 192‚Äì193. . The emergence of Tupperware in the American market created a new kind of opportunity to an underrepresented labor demographic: women, and especially suburban housewives. Product lines One of the Tupperware's Ultraplus line of products Tupperware's product ranges are often marketed under different names in different markets, and the product ranges and colors themselves differ between markets. Tupperware's products include: * Eleganzia (UK, DE), Illusions (AU): a \\"glasslike\\" range of serving dishes * Wonderlier (US, Canada, UK), Bowl Maravilloso (URU): round storage bowl sets in bright colours * FlatOut! (US), MiniMax (UK), Go Flex (AU), Compactware (URU): bowls that flatten for storage * FridgeSmart (US, UK, AU), PrimaKlima (DE), Marine (URU): with air control vents, FridgeSmart containers are modular containers intended for refrigerated fruits and vegetables. FridgeSmarts have air control vents intended to allow different levels of airflow around different types of fruits and vegetables, as well as a corrugated bottom to allow them to store securely on a refrigerator shelf. * Stuffables (US, AU), Bungee: refrigerator storage with flexible lids for overfilling. * UltraPro (US, DE, AU, UK), UltraPlus : plastic ovenware advertised as being safe when used in a microwave or a conventional oven, with heat-resistant properties.

French copy of a map made in the Indian style The Chickasaw Campaign of 1736 consisted of two pitched battles by the French and allies against Chickasaw fortified villages in present-day Northeast Mississippi. Under the overall direction of the governor of Louisiana, Jean- Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville, a force from Upper Louisiana attacked Ogoula Tchetoka on March 25, 1736. A second force from Lower Louisiana attacked Ackia on May 26, 1736. Both attacks were bloodily repulsed (see Atkinson, 2004). Strategic situation The French empire of New France extended from New Orleans in the south to Canada in the north. Its unity was disrupted only by the presence of hostile Natchez and Chickasaw tribes in the lower Mississippi River valley. The French effort to reduce these hostile tribes and gain free passage along the Mississippi culminated in the Chickasaw Wars. Since 1716, the French and Choctaw had united against the Natchez in an overt campaign of destruction. By 1736 the Natchez were killed or scattered, with many of them taking refuge among the Chickasaw. Bienville wanted to destroy these Natchez remnants, and reduce the Chickasaw: 'It is absolutely necessary that some bold and remarkable blow be struck, to impress the Indians with a proper sense of respect and duty toward us.' He planned coordinated operations by two forces: one under Pierre d'Artaguette, commander of the Illinois District of Louisiana, from the North; and a larger army under himself from the South. These forces were to meet 'at the Chickasaw villages' on March 31, 1736. Battle of Ogoula Tchetoka D'Artaguette at Fort de Chartres collected detachments throughout the Illinois Country and proceeded with great expedition to Chickasaw Bluff at present-day Memphis. Despite failing to meet promised detachments under de Monchervaux and de Grandpr√©, he resumed his march with Chicagou and de Vincennes to the Chickasaw lands, only to be advised by courier that the southern army was late and that he should act according to his own judgement. Unable or unwilling to wait any longer, d'Artaguette arrived before a seemingly isolated village at Ogoula Tchetoka (part of Chuckalissa, or Old Town in present-day northwest Tupelo, Mississippi) with 130 French regulars and militia and 366 Iroquois, Arkansas, Miami, and Illinois warriors. The day was 'Palm Sunday', March 25. Leaving 30 French behind to guard supplies, d'Artaguette's northern force attacked with 'great vigor' but was pinned down, routed, and furiously pursued, and its baggage train of valuable shot and powder was captured. Surviving remnants scattered back to meet the belated de Monchervaux on the return trail; Bienville wrote that, without the firm resistance given by the Iroquois and Arkansas, not a single Frenchman would have survived. According to French reports, twenty-one of the French were captured of whom nineteen, including d'Artaguette thrice wounded in battle, were executed by burning, some of whom were already dead when thrown into large fires. Two Frenchmen were held in hope of exchange for an imprisoned Chickasaw chief, but were eventually sent to the British in South Carolina. A contemporary memoir by Dumont de Montigny mistakenly reported this battle as taking place on May 20, 1736, leading to confusion in many later accounts. Battle of Ackia Ackia (in present-day south Tupelo, Mississippi) was attacked by the Southern force. The French contingent, including grenadiers, regulars, Swiss, and various companies of militia, assembled at Mobile throughout March, 1736. Starting the first of April, the French proceeded by boat with little loss 270 river miles up the Tombigbee River. On April 23, the army reached its forward depot at Fort Tombecb√© (which had been prepared at present-day Jones Bluff, Sumter County, Alabama, in anticipation of this campaign), and there mustered 544 European and 45 African men, excluding officers, before being met up-river by a 600 man Choctaw contingent. Departing Fort Tombecb√© on May 4 by boat and on foot, the combined army continued upriver and reached the vicinity of present-day Amory, Mississippi, on May 22. Quickly fortifying a base camp to protect the supplies and boats, essential for its return, the army departed on May 24 for the nearest Chickasaw village, located about 20 miles across the prairie to the northwest. On May 26, the army approached three fortified hilltop villages, named Ackia, Tchoukafalaya, and Apeony, collectively called Long Town. As the villages came into view it became apparent that a British flag flew over one of them. As they got closer the French saw a number of Englishmen among the Chickasaws. After this discovery, the Chevalier de Noyan, Bienville's nephew, urged an immediate attack. After some debate the army advanced to attack, with the French contingent in typically European order, and the Choctaw noisily but reluctantly covering the flanks. Avoiding Apeony, where a trader's cabin flew a British flag, the force stormed Ackia under cover of large shields or mats called mantelets. The French immediately received 'a shower of balls' from the Chickasaw fortifications, and the mantelets proved to be ineffective. The attack became pinned down on the side of the hill with steadily mounting casualties. Several outlying cabins were taken, but after several hours' combat the French fell back 'without having been able to make the slightest breach' in the fortress at the point of attack. During the night the Chickasaws further improved their position by razing surrounding cabins and vegetation. The French, short of ammunition and provisions, and worried that they could not carry any more wounded, and with no information from d'Artaguette, retreated the way they came having lost roughly two hundred men (roughly 100 killed and 100 wounded) in an ultimately futile campaign....A History of Alabama, for Use in Schools: Based as to Its Earlier Parts ... By William Garrott Brown, Albert James Pickett page 60 Battle of Ackia, 26 May 1736 Assessment B. F. French stated 'The war was rashly brought and rashly conducted. Bienville entered the enemy's country without any means of siege, made one attack on a fort, and then, without attempting by scouts to open a communication with D'Artaguette, whom he had ordered to meet him in the Chickasaw country on the 10th of May [sic], or making any attempt to give him proper orders, without even taking one Chickasaw prisoner to get any information of D'Artaguette's proceedings, he retreated, and ended the campaign disastrously.' Atkinson described as 'stupid' the frontal assaults against positions that were practically invincible. A Frenchman's relation of the observations of a Choctaw chief named Red Shoes is quoted by Atkinson: 'The French did not know at all the way to carry on war; we had been able to take only a little village of thirty of forty men; that on the contrary we had lost many men without being able to say that we had killed a single one; that our troops heavily clad marched with too slow a step and so close together that it was impossible for the Chickasaws to fire without killing some of them and wounding several.' The Chickasaw were amply equipped with English arms via a trade route from the English and small Chickasaw settlements in South Carolina and Georgia. Their rectangular palisade forts with loopholed walls were complemented by round fortified houses, also with loopholes. With this technology the Chickasaw invincibly maintained their homeland against relentless pressure from the French and Choctaw, including a repeat campaign in 1739 and numerous small attacks by Choctaws for the next 20 years. A village once thought to possess archaeological remains of Ackia battleground was made a U.S. National Monument in 1938. The National Park Service realized only a few years after establishment of the National Monument that Ackia and the battle were not located there, and it was absorbed into the Natchez Trace Parkway in 1961. It is now called 'Chickasaw Village.' Research 25 years later, however, determined that the actual site of Ackia and its neighboring villages are in a developed area of south Tupelo. A subdivision called 'Lee Acres' covers the site of the 1736 Battle of Ackia, cited by historians as a pivotal rebuff to French territorial ambitions in the Southeast.

Todd Wagner and Mark Cuban later led the organization and eventually sold to Yahoo! on April 1, 1999 for $5.7 billion, making it the most expensive acquisition Yahoo! has made.Forbes: Broadcast.com The service has since been discontinued. History The company was founded in 1989 as Cameron Audio Networks, named after its founder Cameron Christopher Jaeb, who received an initial investment from his father. Jaeb wanted a method for people to be able to listen to out of town sports games. The original idea, a shortwave radio that would receive broadcasts inside a sports venue, morphed into a hand-held device that would receive customized satellite broadcasts. With the support of his father Tom Jaeb, he incorporated. Jaeb then began soliciting the rights to broadcast radio and professional sports games live on the Internet, making 80-100 calls per day. In 1994, through a class that his girlfriend was taking, Jaeb was introduced to Todd Wagner, an attorney at Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld. Wagner introduced Jaeb to Mark Cuban, who invested $10,000 in exchange for 2% of the company. Cuban wanted to listen to the basketball games of his alma mater, Indiana University. Cuban and Wagner worked out a deal whereby Jaeb would keep 10% of the company and would get a monthly salary of $2,500 but Cuban would take control of the company. The company was renamed AudioNet.com in September 1995 in conjunction with the reorganization. At first Cuban picked up signals from KLIF (AM) in his bedroom and then streamed them on the internet. The company grew from mainly broadcasting sporting events to broadcasting U.S. presidential nominating conventions and many other events. In 1998, AudioNet was renamed to Broadcast.com and in July 1998, the company became a public company via an initial public offering. The stock price soared 250% on its first day of trading, a record for a newly issued public stock. After the IPO, the company was worth $1 billion, Mark Cuban was worth $300 million, and Todd Wagner was worth $170 million. On April 1, 1999, less than 9 months after the IPO, Yahoo! announced the acquisition of broadcast.com for $5.7 billion in stock. At the time, broadcast.com had 570,000 users, and the purchase price was $10,000 per user. Cuban sold most of his Yahoo stock that same year, netting over $1 billion. Founder Chris Jaeb, whose stake was diluted to less than 1% of the company, received approximately $50 million from the sale. The service became a part of Yahoo! Broadcast Services. Yahoo shut down much of its broadcast services in 2002 and broadcast.com has since been discontinued. Yahoo's high- profile purchase of broadcast.com has since been called one of the worst internet acquisitions.http://fortune.com/2013/05/21/5-worst-internet- acquisitions-of-all- time/https://money.cnn.com/gallery/technology/2015/03/03/yahoo-20-years-hits- flops/8.html See also * List of Internet radio stations * List of online music databases * The Dan & Scott Show  References  External links  * Category:Internet properties established in 1995 Category:Internet properties disestablished in 1999 Category:American music websites Category:Defunct websites Category:Discontinued Yahoo! services Category:Internet radio in the United States Category:Defunct digital music services or companies Category:Yahoo! acquisitions Category:Dot-com bubble Category:Webby Award winners Category:Defunct online companies of the United States Category:1998 initial public offerings Category:1999 mergers and acquisitions ","title":"Broadcast.com"},{"id":"462949","text":"Schnorrer of Poland in Leipzig, Germany From: Die Gartenlaube (1875) Schnorrer (◊©◊†◊ê÷∏◊®◊¢◊®; also spelled shnorrer) is a Yiddish term meaning \\"beggar\\" or \\"sponger\\".jewishencyclopedia.com ‚Äì The word Schnorrer originally occurred in the German language to describe a freeloader who frequently asks for little things, like cigarettes or little sums of money, without offering a return. English language usage The English language usage of the word denotes a sly chiseler who will get money out of his acquaintances any way he can, often through an air of entitlement. A schnorrer is distinguished from an ordinary beggar by dint of his boundless chutzpah. Like \\"moocher\\", \\"schnorrer\\" does not apply to direct begging or destitution, but rather a habit of getting things (food, tools) by politely or insistently borrowing them with no intention of return. As backhanded compliment While generally used in a pejorative or ironic sense, the term can also be used as a backhanded compliment to someone's perseverance, cleverness, or thrift. For instance, Azriel Hildesheimer, known for his travels around Europe to spread his rabbinical wisdom to the poor, and for his refusal to accept payment for his services, was sometimes referred to as the \\"international schnorrer\\" for his reliance on the local community to house and feed him wherever he went. Alternatively, Theodor Herzl described his early Eastern European immigrant supporters among the Ostjuden, as his \\"army of schnorrers\\".Paul Johnson, A History of the Jews, pp. 398‚Äì99: \\"Herzl found himself visited by shabby, excitable Jews from distant parts, to the dismay of his fashionable wife, who grew to detest the very word Zionism. Yet these were the men who became the foot soldiers, indeed the NCOs and officers, in the Zionist legion; Herzl called them his 'army of schnorrers'. The 'army' met publicly for the first time on 29 August 1897...\\" Israel Zangwill later described a schnorrer as a beggar who would chide a donor for not giving enough. The Schnorrer Club of Morrisania was a German- American social club in the Bronx, New York.

Its inhabitants are called Carnacois in French. Carnac is renowned for the Carnac stones ‚Äì one of the most extensive Neolithic menhir collections in the world ‚Äì as well as its beaches, which are popular with tourists. Located on a narrow peninsula halfway between the medieval town Vannes and the seaside resort Quiberon, Carnac is split into two centres: Carnac-Ville and Carnac-Plage (the beachfront). In total there are five beaches, including la Grande Plage, and further to the east, Plage Men D√ª and Beaumer. Standing stones Stones in the Menec alignment Carnac is famous as the site of more than 10,000 Neolithic standing stones, also known as menhirs. The stones were hewn from local rock and erected by the pre-Celtic people of Brittany. Local tradition claims that the reason they stand in such perfectly straight lines is that they are a Roman legion turned to stone by Pope Cornelius. The Carnac stones were erected during the Neolithic period which lasted from around 4500 BC until 2000 BC. The precise date of the stones is difficult to ascertain as little dateable material has been found beneath them, but the site's main phase of activity is commonly attributed to c. 3300 BC. One interpretation of the site is that successive generations visited the site to erect a stone in honour of their ancestors. A recent suggestion, proposed by Santiago Sevilla, posits that the megaliths were set as protecting shields for an army of defenders of Carnac as a pre-erected burg against attacking enemies. History Tumulus of Saint- MichelIn 1864, La Trinit√©-sur-Mer and its port were separated from the commune to create their own commune and parish. The fishermen found the church in Saint-Corn√©ly to be too far from the port, and had one built in a more convenient location. La Trinit√©-sur-Mer thus became both a parish and a separate commune. In 1903, a seaside resort was created on the old salt flats, developing extensively through the 1950s to create the split Carnac of today: Carnac-ville and Carnac-plage. In 1974, a renowned hydrotherapy centre was sponsored by champion cyclist Louison Bobet, retiring after having won the Tour de France three times from 1953 to 1955. Tourism View of the Quiberon Bay from one of the Carnac beaches. Since the end of World War II, Carnac has become a popular site for tourists seeking a break from the traditional destinations on the C√¥te d'Azur. During the months of July and August, the number of people in the town increases significantly from the influx of tourists and summer residents. The beaches of Brittany are rarely able to offer warm waters on par with those of their southern cousins; however local factors have ensured that Carnac continues to attract large numbers of visitors. Wind and waves in the region attract day and cruise sailors. The Standing Stones and other monuments in the vicinity provide some cultural attraction and Carnac-Plage's variety of bars and clubs ensures that a younger set can amuse themselves at night. There are a number of camping grounds in the woods around Carnac, some clustered around various lakes such as the √âtang du moulin du lac which is immediately to the west of the river Crac'h. There are also other campsites near to Carnac including Camping le Moulin de Kermaux, Des Menhirs and La Grande Metairie.Campsites in Carnac Carnac is home to \\"√âcole de Voile de Carnac\\" which provides sailing and windsurfing lessons and rentals to sailors of all levels of experience. The geography of the Bay of Quiberon provides ideal conditions for sailing. The Peninsula of Quiberon provides protection from Atlantic waves and turbulence while allowing the Gulf Winds to enter the bay. For windsurfers, the Saint-Colomban beach is located in Carnac-Plage. The beach is very popular with windsurfers, as its position allows for the best exploitation of strong winds from the West. Other beaches in the area provide equal access to the winds of the bay but windsurfers may find themselves frustrated the areas of dead air close to their shores. Other beaches in Carnac include Bihan Plage, L√©gen√®se Plage, Grande Plage, Beaumer Plage and Men-Du Plage.Beaches of Carnac A local myth holds that a unicorn lives in the waters off the city and in a cave near St. Malo. Neighboring communes Carnac is connected to La Trinit√©-sur-Mer to the east by road and by a shared pedestrian/bike path along the beach. The other neighbouring communes are Crac'h, Erdeven, Ploemel and Plouharnel. Demographics At the census of 2011, the town had a population of .http://www.insee.fr/fr/themes/comparateur.asp?codgeo=com-56034 Inhabitants of Carnac are called Carnacois.

History  The scheme involved an extensive network of bribes involving distillers, government officials, rectifiers, gaugers, storekeepers, and internal revenue agents. Essentially, distillers bribed government officials, and those officials helped the distillers evade federal taxes on the whiskey they produced and sold. Due to the increase of liquor taxes after the Civil War, whiskey was supposed to be taxed at 70 cents per gallon, however distillers would instead pay the officials 35 cents per gallon and the illicit whiskey was stamped as having the tax paid. Before they were caught, a group of politicians were able to siphon off millions of dollars in federal taxes. Due to its ties within the government, the Whiskey Ring was thought to be impregnable. That was until U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Benjamin Bristow, working without the knowledge of the President or the Attorney General, broke the tightly connected and politically powerful ring in May, 1875, using secret agents from outside the Treasury department to conduct a series of raids across the country on May 10, 1875. The trials began at Jefferson City, Missouri in October 1875. Ultimately, 110 convictions were made and over $3 million in taxes were recovered, although 238 people were indicted. President Ulysses S. Grant appointed General John Brooks Henderson (a former U.S. Senator from Missouri) to serve as special prosecutor in charge of the indictments and trials, but Grant eventually fired Gen. Henderson for challenging Grant's interference in the prosecutions. Grant replaced Henderson with attorney James Broadhead. The Whiskey Ring was seen by many as a sign of corruption under the Republican governments that took power across the nation following the American Civil War. General Orville E. Babcock, the private secretary to the President, was indicted as a member of the ring. He was acquitted through the personal intervention and testimony of President Grant. Also, newspapers at the time were known to slant toward a Republican agenda, making light of the trial. This led many people to think the Whiskey Ring was a ploy for the Republican party to increase their funds. For this reason, President Ulysses S. Grant, although not directly involved in the ring, came to be seen as emblematic of Republican corruption, and later scandals involving his Secretary of War William W. Belknap only confirmed that perception. The Whiskey Ring, along with other alleged abuses of power by the Republican party, contributed to a national weariness of Reconstruction, which ended Grant's presidency with the Compromise of 1877.

Edward Whelan (1824 ‚Äì December 10, 1867) was one of Prince Edward Island's delegates to the Qu√©bec Conference and one of the Fathers of the Canadian Confederation. Whelan was also a journalist, orator and advocate for responsible government. Early years Edward Whelan was born in 1824 in Ballina, County Mayo, in Ireland. At 7 years old, his family and him all moved to Halifax, Nova Scotia in 1831. Growing up in Halifax, he was greatly influenced by Joseph Howe, where he worked as a printing apprentice, as well as Father Richard Baptist O‚ÄôBrien, a dynamic Irish priest who was a gifted orator as well as Whelan's teacher at St. Mary's School in Halifax. These two influences led Whelan to abandon his studies at the age of 18 to take up a position as editor of The Register, an Irish-Catholic, Liberal newspaper. Journalism career Edward Whelan was a Canadian journalist. Political career In August 1846, Whelan was elected as an assemblyman for St. Peters in Kings County. He remained an assemblyman until the last year of his life but had sporadic attendance. Critics of Whelan point out that his political voice lacked the passion and genius that was apparent in his printed work. In the fall of 1846, Whelan sought to embark on yet another newspaper venture, namely the Examiner. This publication nearly failed, but he managed to keep it going. Whelan then devoted much of 1850 to speak at meetings regarding the concept of responsible government. This led to Whelan's rise in stature and in April 1851, Whelan was named to the Executive Council and also appointed the Queen's Printer. Within this new government role, Whelan spent much of his time defending the major Liberal reforms regarding the Free Education Act, extension of the franchise, and the Land Purchase Act. These Liberal reforms were not without controversy, and Whelan took the brunt of the criticism. Confederation In 1864, the union of the British North American colonies was the topic of the day. Though the Liberals were against confederation, Whelan supported confederation as he saw it as an opportunity for PEI to gain more control of its own affairs. Whelan was chosen to be one of the delegates to the Quebec Conference. Attending this conference made Whelan an even stronger proponent. Despite his advocacy, few politicians and residents were persuaded and Whelan became disillusioned. End of political career Whelan's stance on Confederation as well as other issues, led him to become isolated within the Liberal party. In the election of 1867, Whelan was defeated for the first time in 21 years. There is no single cause for his defeat. He had lost support from his traditional supporters by denouncing the Tenant League and Fenianism. Moreover, his support of Confederation was unpopular with the people of PEI. On all three of these issues, his opponent, Edward Reilly, had the edge. However, Whelan believed that the defeat came from the disapproval of the newly appointed cleric of St. Peters, Father William Phelan, a supporter of Reilly. Whelan felt that the clergy had unduly influenced the election. Whelan felt very bitter about this defeat and by the autumn of 1867 his health slowly deteriorated. Whelan died on December 10, 1867.

The 1262 monetary reform established the livre tournois as 20 sous tournois, or 80.88 grams of fine silver. The franc √† cheval was a silver coin of one livre tournois minted in large numbers from 1360. In 1549, the livre tournois was decreed a unit of account, and in 1667 it officially replaced the livre parisis. In 1720, the livre tournois was redefined as 0.31 grams of pure gold, and in 1726, in a devaluation under Louis XIII, as 4.50516 grams of fine silver. It was the basis of the revolutionary French franc of 1795, defined as 4.5 grams of fine silver exactly. Circulating currency La Banque Royale-100 livres Tournois (1720) The livre tournois was never minted, because it corresponded originally to one pound of silver, but its subdivision the denier tournois coin was. In France, the livre was worth 240 deniers. The latter were initially minted by the abbey of Saint Martin in the Touraine region of France. Soon after Philip II of France seized the counties of Anjou and Touraine in 1203 and standardized the use of the livre tournois there, the livre tournois began to supersede the livre parisis (Paris pound) which had been up to that point the official currency of the Capetian dynasty. The livre tournois was, in common with the original livre of Charlemagne, divided into 20 sols (sous after 1715), each of which was divided into 12 deniers. Between 1360 and 1641, coins worth one livre tournois were minted, known as francs (the name coming from the inscription \\"Johannes Dei Gratia Francorum Rex\\", \\"Jean, by the grace of God, King of the French\\"). Other francs were minted under Charles V of France, Henri III of France and Henri IV of France. The use of the name \\"franc\\" became a synonym for livre tournois in accounting. The first French paper money, issued between 1701 and 1720, was denominated in livres tournois (see \\"Standard Catalog of World Paper Money\\", Albert Pick). This was the last time the name was used officially, as later notes and coins were denominated simply in livres, the livre parisis having finally been abolished in 1667. Accounting currency With many forms of domestic and international money (with different weights, purities and quality) circulating throughout Europe in the late Middle Ages and the early modern period, the use of an accounting currency became a financial necessity. In the world of international banking of the 13th century, it was the florin and ducat that were often used. In France, the livre tournois and the currency system based on it became a standard monetary unit of accounting and continued to be used even when the \\"livre tournois\\" ceased to exist as an actual coin. For example, the Louisiana Purchase treaty of 1803 specified the relative ratios of the franc, dollar and livre tournois. The official use of the livre tournois accounting unit in all contracts in France was legislated in 1549, but it had been one of the standard units of accounting in France since the 13th century. In 1577 the livre tournois accounting unit was officially abolished and accountants switched to the √©cu, which was at that time the major French gold coin in actual circulation, but in 1602 the livre tournois accounting unit was brought back. (A monetary unit of accounting based on the livre parisis continued to be used for minor uses in and around Paris and was not officially abolished until 1667 by Louis XIV). Since coins in Europe in the Middle Ages and the Early modern period (the French √©cu, Louis, teston d'argent, denier, double, franc; the Spanish doubloon, pistole, real; the Italian florin, ducat or sequin; the German and Austrian thaler; the Dutch gulden, etc.) did not have any indication of their value, their official value was determined by royal edicts. In cases of financial need, French kings could use the official value for currency devaluation. This could be done in two ways: (1) the amount of precious metal in a newly minted French coin could be reduced while nevertheless maintaining the old value in livres tournois or (2) the official value of a domestic or foreign coin in circulation could be increased. By reversing these techniques, currencies could be reinforced. For example: * the worth of an √©cu d'or, a French gold coin, was changed from 60 to 57 sols in 1573. * to curb increasing use of the Spanish real, its official worth was decreased to 4 sols 2 deniers in the 1570s. Royal finance officers faced many difficulties. In addition to currency speculation, forgery and the intentional shaving of precious metal from coins (which was harshly punished), they had the difficult problem of setting values for gold, silver, copper and billon coins, responding to the often large influx of foreign coin and the appearance of inferior foreign coins of intentionally similar design.

It defines Judaism as the cultural and historical experience of the Jewish people. It encourages humanistic and secular Jews to celebrate their Jewish identity by participating in Jewish holidays and lifecycle events (such as weddings and bar and bat mitzvahs) with inspirational ceremonies that draw upon but go beyond traditional literature. Its philosophical foundation includes the following ideas: * A Jew is someone who identifies with the history, culture, and future of the Jewish people; * Judaism is the historic culture of the Jewish people, and religion is only one part of that culture; * Jewish identity is best preserved in a free, pluralistic environment; * People possess the power and responsibility to shape their own lives independent of supernatural authority; * Ethics and morality should serve human needs, and choices should be based upon consideration of the consequences of actions rather than pre-ordained rules or commandments; * Jewish history, like all history, is a human saga, a testament to the significance of human power and human responsibility. Biblical and other traditional texts are the products of human activity and are best understood through archaeology and other scientific analysis. * The freedom and dignity of the Jewish people must go hand in hand with the freedom and dignity of every human being.\\"What is Humanistic Judaism?\\" The Society for Humanistic Judaism. Origins In its current form, Humanistic Judaism was founded in 1963 by Rabbi Sherwin Wine. As a rabbi trained in Reform Judaism, with a small secular, non-theistic congregation in Michigan, Wine developed a Jewish liturgy that reflected his and his congregation's philosophical viewpoint by emphasizing Jewish culture, history, and identity along with Humanistic ethics, while excluding all prayers and references to God. This congregation developed into the Birmingham Temple, now in Farmington Hills, Michigan. It was soon joined by a previously Reform congregation in Illinois, as well as a group in Westport, Connecticut. In 1969, these congregations and others were united organizationally under the umbrella of the Society for Humanistic Judaism (SHJ). The Society for Humanistic Judaism has 10,000 members in 30 congregations spread throughout the United States and Canada. The International Institute for Secular Humanistic Judaism was founded in 1986. It is the academic and intellectual center of Humanistic Judaism. It was established in Jerusalem in 1985 and currently has two centers of activity: one in Jerusalem and the other in Lincolnshire, IL. Rabbi Adam Chalom is the North American dean. The Institute offers professional training programs for Spokespersons, Educators, Leaders (also referred to in Hebrew as madrikhim/ot or in Yiddish as vegvayzer), and Rabbis, in addition to its publications, public seminars and colloquia for lay audiences. Principles of belief and practice The humanorah, which is the primary symbol of the Society for Humanistic Judaism. Humanistic Judaism presents a far more radical departure from traditional Jewish religion than Mordecai Kaplan (co-founder of Reconstructionist Judaism) ever envisioned. Kaplan redefined God and other traditional religious terms so as to make them consistent with the naturalist outlook, and continued to use traditional prayer language. Wine rejected this approach as confusing, since participants could ascribe to these words whatever definitions they favored. Wine strove to achieve philosophical consistency and stability by creating rituals and ceremonies that were purely non-theistic. Services were created for Shabbat, Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur, and other Jewish holidays and festivals, often with reinterpretation of the meaning of the holiday to bring it into conformity with secular humanistic philosophy. Humanistic Judaism was developed as a possible solution to the problem of retaining Jewish identity and continuity among non-religious. Recognizing that congregational religious life was thriving, Wine believed that secular Jews who had rejected theism would be attracted to an organization that provided all the same forms and activities as, for example, Reform temples, but which expressed a purely Secular Humanistic viewpoint. The International Institute for Secular Humanistic Judaism, which is sponsored by the Society for Humanistic Judaism and the Congress of Secular Jewish Organizations, trains rabbis and other leaders in the United States and in Israel. The Society for Humanistic Judaism was organized with the mission to mobilize people to celebrate Jewish identity and culture consistent with a humanistic philosophy of life. Jewish identity and intermarriage Within Humanistic Judaism, Jewish identity is largely a matter of self-identification.http://www.humanisticrabbis.org/conversion/ \\"We believe: 1. That Jewish identity is primarily a cultural and ethnic identity. 2. That belief systems are too diverse among Jews to serve as criteria for membership. 3\\\\. That joining the Jewish community is a process of cultural identification. 4\\\\. That a person who seeks to embrace Jewish identity should be encouraged to do so and should be assisted in this endeavor. Rabbis and other trained leaders officiate at intermarriages between Jews and non-Jews, and the Humanistic Judaism movement, unlike the Conservative and Orthodox Jewish denominations, does not take any position or action in opposition to intermarriage, rather it affirms that \\"Intermarriage is an American Jewish reality‚Äîa natural consequence of a liberal society in which individuals have the freedom to marry whomever they wish...that intermarriage is neither good nor bad, just as we believe that the marriage of two Jews, in itself, is neither good nor bad. The moral worth of a marriage always depends on the quality of the human relationship‚Äîon the degree of mutual love and respect that prevails.\\"\\"Statement on Intermarriage\\". Association of Humanistic Rabbis, 1974. Secular Humanistic rabbis and leaders will also co-officiate at intercultural marriages between Jews and non-Jews. These views concerning Jewish identity and intermarriage are criticized by those who believe that they will hasten the assimilation of Jews into the general society and thus adversely affect Jewish continuity. Egalitarianism Humanistic Judaism is egalitarian with respect to gender and gender identification, Jewish status, and sexual orientation. Brit shalom (baby-naming ceremonies), similar for boys and girls, are performed rather than the brit milah. Those who identify as Jews and those who do not, as well as LGBTI members, may participate in all ways in all Humanistic Jewish rituals and leadership roles. Humanistic Judaism ordains both men and women as rabbis, and its first rabbi was a woman, Tamara Kolton, who was ordained in 1999. Its first cantor was also a woman, Deborah Davis, ordained in 2001; however, Humanistic Judaism has since stopped ordaining cantors. The Society for Humanistic Judaism issued a statement in 1996 stating in part, \\"we affirm that a woman has the moral right and should have the continuing legal right to decide whether or not to terminate a pregnancy in accordance with her own ethical standards. Because a decision to terminate a pregnancy carries serious, irreversible consequences, it is one to be made with great care and with keen awareness of the complex psychological, emotional, and ethical implications.\\" They also issued a statement in 2011 condemning the passage of the ‚ÄúNo Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act‚Äù by the U.S. House of Representatives, which they called \\"a direct attack on a woman‚Äôs right to choose\\". In 2012 they issued a resolution opposing conscience clauses that allow religious-affiliated institutions to be exempt from generally applicable requirements mandating reproductive healthcare services to individuals or employees. In 2013 they issued a resolution stating in part, \\"Therefore, be it resolved that: The Society for Humanistic Judaism wholeheartedly supports the observance of Women's Equality Day on August 26 to commemorate the anniversary of the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution allowing women to vote; The Society condemns gender discrimination in all its forms, including restriction of rights, limited access to education, violence, and subjugation; and The Society commits itself to maintain vigilance and speak out in the fight to bring gender equality to our generation and to the generations that follow.\\" In 2004, the Society for Humanistic Judaism issued a resolution supporting \\"the legal recognition of marriage and divorce between adults of the same sex\\", and affirming \\"the value of marriage between any two committed adults with the sense of obligations, responsibilities, and consequences thereof.\\" In 2010 they pledged to speak out against homophobic bullying.

OCA. Japan On 2 July 1861, Nicholas landed at Hakodate, Hokkaid≈ç, Japan, as a priest attached to the chapel of the Russian consulate in Hakodate. He had volunteered for the appointment to this duty, attracted since the day he noticed a poster calling for a priest for this chapel when he was a seminary student. After he arrived at the consulate, he studied Japanese and quickly gained mastery of the language. He studied Buddhism during the first eight years of his time in Japan, when, in his words, he ‚Äústrove with all diligence to study Japanese history, religion, and the spirit of the Japanese people‚Äù. While at the consulate chapel, he converted three Japanese, one of whom, a former samurai and Shinto priest named Sawabe Takuma, had originally come to his home to kill him. After conversion, Sawabe became one of the first Japanese Orthodox priests. In 1870, Nicholas was made an archimandrite and moved to Tokyo, and began an extensive missionary effort. He bought property on a height in Kanda Surugadai for his headquarters which later became the site of the see of the Orthodox Archbishop of Japan. Under his leadership, by 1870 the Orthodox community numbered more than 4,000 people, and by 1912 about 33,000 people and 266 Orthodox communities. Nicholas was consecrated bishop on 30 March 1880, as Bishop of Revel, auxiliary to the Archdiocese of Riga. While Nicholas never visited the city, the parish of Revel supported his Japanese mission financially. In the Eastern Orthodox Church tradition, bishops sign with their see, but Nicholas made his habit to sign as \\"Episcop (Bishop) Nicholai\\", without mentioning Revel.Â∞èÈáéË≤ûÊ≤ª„ÄåËÅñ„Ç¢„É≥„Éâ„É≠„Éã„ÇØ‰∏ªÊïôÊù•Êó•ÁôæÂë®Âπ¥„Äç„ÄÅ„ÄéË•øÊó•Êú¨Ê≠£Êïô„Äè„ÄÅ2007Âπ¥ He presided over the consecration of the Tokyo Resurrection Cathedral in 1891, and was elevated to the dignity of Archbishop of All Japan by the Russian Orthodox Holy Synod on April 6, 1907. Russo-Japanese War During the Russo-Japanese War, Nicholas stayed in Japan. Those days were very difficult for him. His love for the land of his birth conflicted with his duty as the bishop of Japan to support his faithful and to pray for the Japanese Emperor and the Imperial Japanese Army and Navy: in the orthodox liturgy at that time, priests had to explicitly pray not only benediction on the sovereign and his army, but also for the defeat of his enemies in the intercession. Nicholas therefore did not participate in any public services during the war; instead, he encouraged his Japanese faithful to both pray for and to contribute to the Army and Navy. Some encouraged him to go back to Russia, but he refused and worked eagerly for Japanese faithful and Russian prisoners of war. In a letter on the conditions of a camp in Hamadera, Osaka, Nicholas wrote of his astonishment at the Russians soldiers' illiteracy: nine of ten captives could not read. Nicholas sent priests and teachers to camps to educate and care for the captives. His attitude and manners impressed not only the Orthodox faithful but also non-Christians. Character Even Emperor Meiji was impressed with his character, especially his diplomatic efforts between the Russian Imperial Household and the Japanese government. When the Russian Tsar Nicholas II was the Tsarevich under Alexander III, the young Nicholas II visited Japan and was injured during the ≈åtsu Incident by a Japanese policeman. Bishop Nicholas made a great effort to resolve this incident. Nicholas's study of Japanese was fruitful, allowing him to translate all liturgy books and many parts of the Bible including the whole of the New Testament and Psalms, most of the Book of Genesis and the Book of Isaiah with help from a Japanese Christian and scholar Nakai Tsugumaro who ran a kanbun private school Kaitokudo in Osaka.Orthodox translation of Gospel into Japanese, Pravostok Orthodox Portal, October 2006 His translations are still used in the liturgy of Japanese Orthodox Church.

His poetry combined influences from the Bosnian Christian culture, Islamic mysticism and cultural remains of medieval Bosnia, and especially the steƒáci. His works Kameni spavaƒç (Stone Sleeper) and Modra rijeka (Blue River) are probably the most important Bosnian poetic achievements of the 20th century. Biography=Early life Mehmedalija Dizdar was born during World War I, to a Muslim Bosniak family in Stolac, Bosnia and Herzegovina. He was the son of Muharem (died 1923) and Nezira (n√©e Baboviƒá; 1881‚Äì1945). Mehmedalija was the second of three children. His older brother Hamid was a writer. Mehmedalija's sister Refika (1921‚Äì1945) and mother were killed in the Jasenovac concentration camp. Career In 1936, Dizdar relocated to Sarajevo where he attended and graduated from the Gymnasium. He started working for the magazine Gajret, which his brother Hamid regulated and which was founded by Safvet beg Ba≈°agiƒá. Dizdar spent his World War II years as a supporter of the Communist Partisans. He moved frequently from place to place in order to avoid the Independent State of Croatia authorities' attention. After the war, Dizdar was a prominent figure in the cultural life of Bosnia and Herzegovina, working as the editor-in-chief of the daily Osloboƒëenje (Liberation). He served as head of a few state-sponsored publishing houses and eventually became a professional writer and the President of the Writers' Union of Bosnia and Herzegovina, a post he held until his death. Personal life Dizdar's son Enver (8 June 1944 ‚Äì 21 December 2012) was a journalist and publicist. Mak Dizdar died aged 53 in 1971, having outlived his parents and both siblings. Work A poem by Mak Dizdar on the memorial of the Tuzla massacre: \\"Here one does not live to live. Here one does not live to die. Here one dies to live.\\" Bust in Sarajevo Dizdar's two poetry collections and series of longer poems, Kameni spavaƒç (Stone Sleeper) (1966‚Äì71)Award-winning translated by Francis R. Jones. and Modra rijeka (Blue River, 1971), fused seemingly disparate elements. He drew inspiration from pre-Ottoman Bosnian Christian culture, from the sayings of heterodox Islamic visionary mystics, and from the 15th century Bosnian vernacular linguistic idiom. His poetry referenced medieval Bosnian tombstones (\\"steƒáci\\" or \\"mramorovi\\" - marbles) and their gnomic inscriptions on the ephemerality of life. It articulated a distinctive vision of life and death, drawing on Christian and Muslim Gnostic sensibilities of life as a passage between \\"tomb and stars\\", expressing both the Gnostic horror of corporeality and a sense of the blessedness of the universe. Dizdar and Steƒáci In Bosnia and Herzegovina, there are about 60,000 steƒáci and a total of 70,000 in the greater region. The steƒáci are inscribed with various symbols and illustrations. Many of the symbols on the steƒáci bore significant religious symbolism in Dizdar‚Äôs works. The most common religious motifs visible on the steƒáci were a crescent moon, stars and circles (representing the sun). The second most common motif were the cross, which never appears alone. It regularly is seen in unison with a crescent moon and a star, and also sometimes with other symbols like a shield, sword, spear or flags. Other symbols used on steƒáci were men with large right hands, spirals, images of a kolo and deer.Aliƒá, Fahira, ‚ÄúReligijski Motivi U Kamenu Spavaƒçu Maka Dizdara, The New Teacher (Novi Muallim), issue: 54 / 2013, pages: 94-97, on www.ceeol.com. In addition to carved symbols on the steƒáci, short inscpritoins or epigraphs were also carved into many steƒáci.The inscriptions on the steƒáci characterized the whole life of the deceased, their habits, the manner of their death, the love of their country in which they lie, and their awe at death. Dizdar used the symbols and the inscriptions on the steƒáci as the backbone for his most famous work, Kameni Spavaƒç. Dizdar‚Äôs Bosnia was \\"defined by the steƒáci and Bosnia‚Äôs stigma regarding the question of it being the poetic subject response: its defiance from dreams.\\" Dizdar used the symbols and inscriptions on the steƒáci to give Kameni Spavaƒç a historical point of view, by envisioning the world through the eyes of the medieval peoples buried under the steƒáci. By envisioning the world through the eyes of the stone sleeps buried under the steƒáci, Dizdar was able to discuss many themes. Through the steƒáci, he discussed themes of \\"the intimate life journey of origin, of homeland or landscapes, of sources of knowledge, of experiences of the world, of a new and coordinated deciphering of signs, which reach pass their singularity.\\"Aliƒá, Fahira, ‚ÄúReligijski Motivi U Kamenu Spavaƒçu Maka Dizdara, The New Teacher (Novi Muallim), issue: 54 / 2013, pages: 94-97, on www.ceeol.com. Dizdar said that the themes expressed in the inscriptions were the ‚Äúsecrets of Bosnia.‚Äù Dizdar himself described the importance and mystery of the steƒáci by saying ‚Äústeƒáak is for me what it is not for others, things that are on them or in them, others did not inscribe or knew to see. It is stone, but also a word, it is earth, but also heaven, it is matter, but also a spirit, it is a cry, but also a song, it is death, but also life, it is the past, but also the future.‚Äù Mak Dizdar also fought against the forced influence of the Serbian language on the Bosnian language, in his 1970 article \\"Marginalije o jeziku i oko njega\\". After the collapse of Communism and following the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Dizdar's poetic magnum opus has remained the cornerstone of modern Bosnia and Herzegovina literature.

With the demise of ConFurence, Mark Merlino and Robert Johnson Jr. teamed up to establish Califur in 2004 to continue the tradition of a furry convention in Southern California. Legacy ConFurence created the mold by which other furry conventions were to follow, with the successful art show, a masquerade and an emphasis on fan-created content and Guests of Honor. As of 2018 there are dozens furry conventions and many more meets and gatherings all around the world, due in part to ConFurence's lead. The name ConFurence is a registered trademark of the ConFurence Group.

The river, in turn, was named for English colonial religious leader Anne Hutchinson.https://www.womenofthehall.org/inductee/anne- hutchinson/ Construction of the parkway began in 1924 and was completed in 1941. The section of the parkway between Eastern Boulevard (now Bruckner Boulevard) in the Bronx and U.S. Route 1 (US 1) in Pelham Manor was designated as New York State Route 1X (NY 1X) from 1941 to 1946. NY 1A was subsequently realigned to follow the Hutch between Eastern Boulevard and US 1\\\\. The NY 1A designation was removed around 1962.  Route description  The road is designated as NY 908A within the Bronx and is maintained by the New York City Department of Transportation (NYCDOT). In Westchester County, the road is designated as NY 907W and is maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT). Both designations are unsigned reference routes. Like the Bronx River Parkway, the reference route designation of the parkway in Westchester County violates the numbering scheme used by the NYSDOT. The second digit of a reference route designation typically indicates its region. While other reference routes in the county carry a second digit of \\"8\\", as Westchester County is located in region 8, the \\"0\\" in 907W is indicative of regions 10 and 11, containing Long Island and New York City, respectively.  Throggs Neck to Pelham  Northbound on the Hutchinson River Parkway in Pelham. Signage present off the shoulder denotes the parkway's namesake, Anne Hutchinson. The Hutchinson River Parkway begins at the large Bruckner Interchange in the Throggs Neck section of the Bronx. This interchange consists of junctions with the Cross Bronx Expressway (I-95 and I-295), the Whitestone Expressway (I-678), and the Bruckner Expressway (I-95 and I-278). The Hutchinson River Parkway proceeds north as a continuation of I-678, entering exit 1, a small 1-lane ramp to Bruckner Boulevard near Saint Raymond's Cemetery. Just to the north of exit 1 gas stations appear on each side of the road, which turns northeast and into exit 2, a connection to East Tremont Avenue. After exit 2, the parkway crosses under the IRT Pelham Line just west of Middletown Road subway station, crossing into the Pelham Bay section of the Bronx. Just after crossing into Pelham Bay, the parkway enters exit 3E‚ÄìW, an interchange with the Pelham Parkway in a small section of Pelham Bay Park. After crossing over Amtrak's Northeast Corridor, the parkway crosses out of Pelham Bay Park and into exit 4S‚ÄìN, a junction with I-95 and the New England Thruway. Crossing over Bartow Avenue and the Hutchinson River, the parkway crosses into the main section of Pelham Bay Park, where exit 5 forks off towards the center of the park. The now six-lane parkway crosses north through Pelham Bay Park, entering exit 6, another junction with the New England Thruway. When the Hutchinson River Parkway leaves Pelham Bay Park, the right-of-way leaves the Bronx and enters Westchester County. Now in the village of Pelham Manor, the parkway enters exit 7, an interchange with US 1 (Boston Post Road). Southbound, an exit 8 is present, a ramp to Sandford Boulevard in Pelham Manor. Proceeding northbound, exit 9 connects to Colonial Avenue, the continuation of Sandford Boulevard after the Hutchinson River Parkway in the adjacent village of Pelham. The parkway winds north through Pelham, entering exit 10 on the southbound lanes, a connection to East 3rd Street. Winding northeast, the parkway crosses under the Metro-North Railroad New Haven Line just west of Pelham station. Just after the line, the Hutchinson River Parkway crosses into exit 12, a bi-directional junction with Lincoln Avenue in Pelham.  Mount Vernon to Connecticut  Soon the parkway leaves Pelham for Mount Vernon, entering the Chester Heights section. In Mount Vernon, the Hutchinson River Parkway enters exit 13, a connection to the Cross County Parkway. The parkway winds northeast into exit 14, a junction with New Rochelle Road, bending northwest through Nature Study Woods Park. The parkway then bends north into New Rochelle. Just after crossing into New Rochelle, the Cross County Parkway merges into the northbound lanes. Crossing through Twin Lakes Park, the parkway enters exit 16, a junction with the northern end of Webster Avenue. Passing around Reservoir 3, the Hutchinson River Parkway crosses into Eastchester and soon back into New Rochelle near exit 18, which connects to North Avenue. The Hutchinson River Parkway northbound approaching exit 26W, the Cross Westchester Expressway in Harrison. Signage for the upcoming junction of I-684 is present To the north, exit 18E and exit 18W going southbound junctions with Mill Road in Eastchester, the continuation of North Avenue. After exits 18E and 18W, the parkway passes east of Reservoir 1 and south of exit 19, Wilmot Road. The Hutchinson River Parkway proceeds northeast as a four-lane arterial through New Rochelle. The parkway crosses under NY 125 (Weaver Street), which is accessible southbound via exit 20\\\\. Proceeding northbound, exit 21 services Hutchinson Avenue, which connects to NY 125 and Quaker Ridge Country Club. Now in the Quaker Ridge section of Scarsdale, the Hutchinson River Parkway crosses into exit 22, Mamaroneck Avenue near Saxon Woods County Park. The parkway runs along the southern end of the park, entering exit 23S‚ÄìN in the center of the park. Exit 23S‚ÄìN services another Mamaroneck Avenue as it crosses over the West Branch of the Mamaroneck River. Leaving the park, the Hutchinson River Parkway enters White Plains, crossing past a median rest area. The parkway continues northeast, entering exit 25, a diamond interchange with NY 127 (North Street) in Harrison. Passing Maple Moor Golf Course, the Hutchinson River Parkway enters exit 26E‚ÄìW, a cloverleaf interchange with I-287 (the Cross Westchester Expressway). Just to the north of the interchange, I-684 forks to the northwest in Harrison. Just northeast of I-684, exit 27 forks to NY 120 (Purchase Street). After exit 27 the parkway makes a bend to the southeast entering exit 28, a junction with Lincoln Avenue in Harrison. The four-lane parkway winds northeast once again, entering exit 29, a junction with North Ridge Street in Rye Brook. The Hutchinson River Parkway enters exit 30S, a connection with NY 120A (King Street). Southbound, this interchange is designated exit 27S, a continuation of the numbering from the Merritt Parkway. At this interchange, the Hutchinson River Parkway crosses into the state of Connecticut and continues northeast as the Merritt Parkway (Route 15).  History  Construction of the parkway began in 1924 and the first two-mile (3 km) section was completed in December 1927. By October 1928, of the parkway were open, connecting US 1 in Pelham Manor, New York with Westchester Avenue in White Plains, New York. The original roadway was an undivided, limited- access parkway, designed with gently sloping curves, stone arch bridges, and wooden lightposts. The original section included bridle paths along the right- of-way. There was also a riding academy where the public could rent horses. In 1930, Robert Moses, an American public official who worked on New York metropolitan area infrastructure, announced plans to build more parkways in the Bronx. A southward extension from Pelham Manor to Pelham Bay Park opened on December 11, 1937. The new southerly extension became part of a rerouted New York State Route 1A. The final segment of the parkway‚Äîa southward extension to the Bronx‚ÄìWhitestone Bridge‚Äîwas completed on October 11, 1941 and was initially designated NY 1X. The NY 1X designation was removed in 1946 and replaced with a realigned NY 1A, which had previously followed Bruckner Boulevard and Shore Road between what is now the Bruckner Interchange and exit 5 on the Hutch. The NY 1A designation was completely removed . Originally, the parkway was built and designated all the way to the Bronx‚ÄìWhitestone Bridge, but the original parkway designs did not allow for commercial traffic. When the bridge was designated I-678, the section between the Bruckner Interchange and the Bronx‚ÄìWhitestone Bridge had to be converted to Interstate Highway standards. Once that was completed in 1972, that section was assigned the I-678 designation and renamed the Hutchinson River Expressway. Modifications in 1984 included the straightening of some curves, increased sight distances, removal of the rustic lightposts, and lengthening of acceleration and deceleration lanes. Originally, there was a 10 cent toll in Pelham between exits 7 and 8\\\\. The toll was increased to 25 cents in 1958 and removed on October 31, 1994, with the last toll collected just before midnight. The tolls were demolished on the Saw Mill River and Hutchinson River parkways in November 1994.

The Napa River forms its eastern side as it enters the Carquinez Strait juncture with the east side of San Pablo Bay. Mare Island is considered a peninsula because no full body of water separates this or several other named \\"islands\\" from the mainland. Instead, a series of small sloughs cause seasonal water-flows among the so-called islands. Mare Island is the largest of these at about long and a mile wide. History Goats graze on Mare Island in 2011. In 1775, Spanish explorer Perez Ayala was the first European to land on what would become Mare Island ‚Äì he named it Isla de la Plana. This area was part of Rancho Suscol, deeded to General Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo in 1844. It became a waypoint for early settlers. In 1835, whilst traversing the Carquinez Strait, a crude ferry transporting men and livestock capsized in a squall. Among the livestock feared lost in the wreckage was the prized white mare of General Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo, the Mexican Commandante for Northern California. Several days later, General Vallejo's mare was found on the island, having swum ashore. Grateful for the fortunate turn of events, he renamed the island to Isla de la Yegua, Spanish for Mare Island, in her honor. In 1892, development of the Mare Island Golf Club began, making it the oldest golf course west of the Mississippi. Shipyard On November 6, 1850, two months after California was admitted to statehood, President Fillmore reserved Mare Island for government use. On January 15, 1852, Secretary of the Navy William Alexander Graham ordered a Naval Commission to select a site for a Naval Yard on the Pacific Coast. Commodore D. Sloat along with Commodore C. Ringgold, Simon F. Blunt and William P.S. Sanger (former overseer of construction of Drydock Number One, Norfolk Naval Shipyard) were appointed to the commission. On July 13, 1852, Sloat recommended the island across the Napa River from the settlement of Vallejo, as it was \\"free from ocean gales and from floods and freshets.\\" The Navy Department acted favorably on Commodore Sloat's recommendations and Mare Island was purchased for use as a naval shipyard in July 1853 at a cost of $83,410. On September 16, 1854, Mare Island became the first permanent U.S. naval installation on the west coast, with Commodore David Farragut, as Mare Island's first commander. For over a century, Mare Island hosted the Navy's Mare Island Naval Shipyard. The growing size and number of the country's naval fleet was making older facilities obsolete and led to increased building and refitting of shipyards nationally. In 1872, the U.S. Public Works Department commenced construction of a drydock on the island, setting it on a foundation of cut granite blocks. The work was completed in 1891. A second drydock was begun in 1899, a concrete structure long set on wooden piles; it was completed in 1910. By 1941 a third drydock had been completed and drydock number four was under construction. The ammunition depot and submarine repair base were modern, fireproof buildings. A million dollar, three-way vehicle causeway to Vallejo replaced a ferry service.Lott, A Long Line of Ships, pp. 117‚Äì206 Before World War II, Mare Island had been in a continual state of up-building. By 1941, new projects included improvements to the central power plant, a new pattern storage building, a large foundry, machine shop, magazine building, paint shop, new administration building, and a huge storehouse. The yard was expected to be able to repair and paint six to eight large naval vessels at a time. Several finger piers had recently been built, as well as a new shipbuilding wharf, adding one and a berth. It employed 5593 workers at the beginning of 1939, and rapidly increased to 18,500 by May 1941, with a monthly payroll of $3.5 million. In 1941, the drafting department had expanded to three buildings accommodating over 400 naval architects, engineers and draftsmen. The hospital had 584 beds.Lott, A Long Line of Ships, pp. 209‚Äì37 During World War II, the shipyard employed up to 50,000 workers.Kern, James & Vallejo and Naval Historical Museum Images of America: Vallejo. Arcadia Publishing, 2004. In 1969, the Navy transferred its (Vietnam War) Brown Water Navy Riverine Training Forces from Coronado, California, to Mare Island. Swift Boats (Patrol Craft Fast-PCF), and PBRs (Patrol Boat River) conducted boat operations throughout the currently named Napa-Sonoma Marshes State Wildlife Area, on the north and west portions of Mare Island. Mare Island Naval Base was deactivated during the 1995 cycle of US base closures, but the U.S. Navy Reserves still have access to the water portions of the State Wildlife Area for any riverine warfare training being conducted from their new base in Sacramento, California. The , a Sturgeon-class submarine, SSN-665, was constructed at Mare Island between December 9, 1964, and July 27, 1968. On May 15, 1969, while still under construction and tied to the pier, the Guitarro was flooded and sank when construction crews mismanaged testing procedures. It took three days to raise her and many months to salvage her. During the latter years of Mare Island's military use, U.S. Marines were trained for Security Management and Security Force Operations, including; F.A.S.T. (Fleet Anti-Terrorism Team), Security Guards, and Security Force Reaction Forces. In the 1970s Navy technical training schools included those for Data Systems Technicians (DSs), Firecontrol Technicians (FTs), Communications Technicians (CTs) and nuclear power ratings of many types. Restoration and reuse Politician George Miller on Mare Island in 2011. In 1993 Congress approved the findings of the Base Realignment and Closure report, leading to the closure of Mare Island Naval Shipyard. The shipyard had long been the economic engine of the city of Vallejo, employing 10,000 workers after reductions in 1988. When Congress ordered the base closure, the shipyard employed 5,800 workers. The vision of rebuilding Mare Island as a vital place where people lived and worked was a key goal in the base conversion planning process undertaken by the city of Vallejo in the early 1990s. After the base was recommended for closure in 1993, the City undertook an extensive community-based reuse planning process, which resulted in a Final Reuse Plan that was approved by the Vallejo City Council in 1994. The Final Reuse Plan laid out the general vision for the Island's redevelopment. The Reuse Plan was the basis for the Mare Island Specific Plan, which was approved in 1999 and amended in 2005 and 2007. The Mare Island Specific Plan designated land uses and established development standards for identified reuse areas and provided an implementation program to guide all subsequent planning activities. Preservation of many of Mare Island's 661 structures and other cultural resources was an additional factor in the planning process. As the oldest shipyard and naval facility on the West Coast, the shipyard earned a National Historic Landmark designation by the federal government in 1975. In 1979 California listed the entire naval base as a State Historical Landmark. In 1999 the city of Vallejo added Mare Island to the National Register of Historic Districts with 42 individual city landmarks. Finally, as with any restoration of an industrial, brownfield landscape, both city and government agencies required environmental reviews, toxic substance removal, and soil remediation. In 1998, Vallejo contracted with Lennar Mare Island LLC (LMI) to develop of the eastern portion of Mare Island into a multi-use community. LMI contracted the Sausalito-based SWA Group to provide a Master Development Plan for Vallejo, additional historical research and landscape architectural services. The Specific Plan included a variety of land uses, including a university district, an industrial zone, historic core, and residential neighborhoods. In addition, 78% of the island was set aside for wildlife habitat and wetlands, parkland and open space, and dredge ponds. In 2007, LMI finished construction on the residential neighborhoods. Farragut Village, with 277 homes, was the first completed neighborhood. Additional neighborhoods include Coral Sea and Kirkland Isle II. Mare Island's Specific Plan calls for a total of 1,400 homes and condos, plus of commercial, retail, entertainment, and industrial space. Mare Island's residents petitioned LMI and the City of Vallejo to eliminate the dredge ponds, whose role had been to collect silt, drainage, and storm water from the Napa River and the Bay, and instead restore that acreage to wetlands. The city and the developer agreed, and in January 2006, the land use plan was amended to add the Mare Island Shoreline Heritage Preserve. An advisory board was appointed by the city to restore the site into publicly accessible parkland. In 2009, Alstom moved its train maintenance facility from Oakland to Mare Island.

Transportation Mare Island is accessed by State Route 37 on its north side, as well as by Interstate 80 via the Wichels Causeway (popularly the Mare Island Causeway) and Tennessee Street. The causeway also has rails embedded in the roadway to allow access for trains. The San Francisco Bay Ferry provides year-round weekday and weekend service, and service on select holidays, between Mare Island, Vallejo, and the San Francisco Ferry Building or Pier 41 terminals. Mare Island is the location of Touro University California, the US Forest Service Pacific Southwest Regional Office, and the administrative offices of the Vallejo City Unified School District.

Born in Three Rivers, Prince Edward Island, Andrew Archibald Macdonald was descended from the Clanranald branch of the Macdonalds of the Isles, the son of Hugh and Catherine Macdonald of Panmure and grandson of Andrew Macdonald who had purchased a large tract of land in the province and, with his family and retainers, emigrated in 1806 from Inverness-shire, Scotland to settle at Three Rivers, where he and his sons carried on an extensive mercantile business for many years. He was educated at a county grammar school and by private tutor and also became a merchant and shipowner. In 1863, he married Elizabeth, the third daughter of Hon. Thomas Owen (formerly Provincial Postmaster General) and they had four sons. He was elected a member of the Legislative Assembly of Prince Edward Island from 1853 to 1858. He sat as representative for Georgetown in the House of Assembly from 1854 until 1870. When the Legislative Council became elective in 1863, he was returned as a representative of 2nd Kings District in the Legislative Council and again reelected in 1867. Andrew Macdonald was a member of the Executive Council from 1867 to 1872 and again from 18 April 1872 until Prince Edward Island joined Confederation in 1873. He was leader of the Government Party in Legislative Council for some years. He first returned as a representative of the Liberal Party in carrying out Responsible Government and extending the Electoral Franchise. When the Conservative section of the party joined the Liberal section of the Conservative Party, he united with them to pass the Free Education Act, the Land Purchase Act, the Railway Act, the Confederation Act and other progressive measures. In June 1873 he was appointed Postmaster General of the Province. He was Postmaster at Charlottetown until 1 August 1884 as well as Post Office Inspector for the Province from 1880 until that date when he was appointed as the seventeenth Lieutenant Governor of Prince Edward Island since the creation of the Colony in 1763. In 1891 MacDonald was appointed to the Senate of Canada where he remained until his death. He had been the youngest of the delegates to the Charlottetown Conference on the Union of the Lower Provinces in 1864 and in September of the same year, a delegate to the Quebec Conference which succeeded it and arranged the basis of union for all the British North American Colonies. He was the U.S. Consular Agent at Three Rivers from 1849 to 1870. He was a delegate to the International Convention at Portland, U.S., in 1868 and a member of the Board of Education from 1867 to 1870, a public trustee under the Land Purchase Act (1875) and Chief of the Caledonia Club. He died at Ottawa, on 21 March 1912.

It is mainly found in California, but also in the westernmost part of Nevada, southwestern Oregon, and northern Baja California.Safford, H.D. 2013. Natural Range of Variation (NRV) for yellow pine and mixed conifer forests in the bioregional assessment area, including the Sierra Nevada, southern Cascades, and Modoc and Inyo National Forests. Unpublished report. USDA Forest Service, Pacific Southwest Region, Vallejo, CA, It is named in honor of its botanist documenter John Jeffrey. Description Pinus jeffreyi is a large coniferous evergreen tree, reaching tall, rarely up to tall, though smaller when growing at or near tree line. The leaves are needle-like, in bundles of three, stout, glaucous gray-green, long. The cones are long, dark purple when immature, ripening pale brown, with thinly woody scales bearing a short, sharp inward-pointing barb. The seeds are long, with a large () wing. Pinus jeffreyi is closely related to Pinus ponderosa (ponderosa pine) and is similar in appearance. One way to distinguish between them is by their cones. Each has barbs at the end of the scales. The sharp Pinus jeffreyi cone scale barbs point inward, so the cone feels smooth to the palm of one's hand when rubbed down the cone. Pinus ponderosa cone scale barbs point outward, so feel sharp and prickly to the palm of one's hands. This gives rise to the memory device for distinguishing between them - \\"gentle Jeffrey and prickly ponderosa\\". Another distinguishing characteristic is that the needles of Pinus jeffreyi are glaucous, less bright green than those of Pinus ponderosa, and by the stouter, heavier cones with larger seeds and inward-pointing barbs. Pinus jeffreyi can be somewhat distinguished from Pinus ponderosa by the relatively smaller scales of bark as compared to the larger plates of more reddish-colored ponderosa bark. The scent of Pinus jeffreyi is variously described as reminiscent of vanilla, lemon, pineapple, violets, apple, and, quite commonly, butterscotch; This scent may be sampled by breaking off a shoot or some needles, or by simply smelling the resin's scent in between the plates of the bark. This scent is related to the very unusual composition of the resin, with the volatile component made up almost entirely of pure n-heptane. The largest Pinus jeffreyi, by trunk volume, is the Eureka Valley Giant, in the Stanislaus National Forest. Its trunk contains of wood, is tall, with a diameter of Distribution and habitat Pinus jeffreyi occurs from southwest Oregon south through much of California (mainly on the eastern side of the Sierra Nevada), to northern Baja California in Mexico. It is a high-altitude species; in the north of its range, it grows widely at altitude, and at in the south of its range. Pinus jeffreyi is more stress tolerant than Pinus ponderosa. At higher elevations, on poorer soils, in colder climates, and in dryer climates, Pinus jeffreyi replaces Pinus ponderosa as the dominant tree. Pinus jeffreyi is also tolerant of serpentine soils and is often dominant in these conditions, even on dry sites at fairly low altitudes. Pinus jeffreyi in the Siskiyou Mountains of northwest California, growing on serpentine Uses Pinus jeffreyi wood is similar to ponderosa pine wood, and is used for the same purposes. The exceptional purity of n-heptane distilled from Pinus jeffreyi resin led to n-heptane being selected as the zero point on the octane rating scale of petrol. As it mainly consists of n-heptane, Pinus jeffreyi resin is a poor source of turpentine. Before Pinus jeffreyi was distinguished from ponderosa pine as a distinct species in 1853, resin distillers operating in its range suffered a number of 'inexplicable' explosions during distillation , now known to have been caused by the unwitting use of Jeffrey pine resin.

Completed in 1933, it was designed in the Art Deco style by Raymond Hood, Rockefeller Center's lead architect. 30 Rockefeller Center was formerly called the RCA Building from its opening to 1988, and later the GE Building from 1988 to 2015. It was renamed the Comcast Building in 2015, following the transfer of ownership to new corporate owner Comcast, though its name is often shortened to 30 Rock. The building houses the headquarters and New York studios of television network NBC; the Rainbow Room restaurant; and an observation deck called Top of the Rock. 30 Rockefeller Plaza also contains numerous artworks commissioned as part of the building's construction. At high, the 66-story building is the 28th tallest in New York City and the 60th tallest in the United States. 30 Rockefeller Plaza was built as part of the construction of Rockefeller Center. Work on the steel structure of the RCA Building started in March 1932. It opened in mid-1933 after a delay caused by a controversy over Man at the Crossroads, a painting by Diego Rivera that was removed from the RCA Building. Shortly after the RCA Building's opening, there were plans to use the building above the 64th floor as a public \\"amusement center\\", which became the Rainbow Room and Top of the Rock. 30 Rockefeller Plaza underwent a $170 million floor-by-floor interior renovation in 2014. History=Construction Lunch atop a Skyscraper, 1932, Charles Clyde Ebbets The construction of Rockefeller Center occurred between 1932 and 1940 on land that John D. Rockefeller Jr. leased from Columbia University. The Rockefeller Center site was originally supposed to be occupied by a new opera house for the Metropolitan Opera. By 1928, Benjamin Wistar Morris and designer Joseph Urban were hired to come up with blueprints for the house. However, the new building was too expensive for the opera to fund by itself, and it needed an endowment, and the project ultimately gained the support of John D. Rockefeller Jr. The planned opera house was canceled in December 1929 due to various issues, with the new opera house eventually being built at Lincoln Center, opening in 1966. Raymond Hood, Rockefeller Center's lead architect, came up with the idea to negotiate with the Radio Corporation of America (RCA) and its subsidiaries, National Broadcasting Company (NBC) and Radio-Keith-Orpheum (RKO), to build a mass media entertainment complex on the site. By May 1930, RCA and its affiliates had made an agreement with Rockefeller Center managers. RCA would lease of studio space; get naming rights to the western part of the development; and develop four theaters, at a cost of $4.25 million per year. A skyscraper at 30 Rockefeller Plaza's current site was first proposed in the March 1930 version of the complex's blueprint, and the current dimensions of the tower were finalized in March 1931. The skyscraper would be named for RCA as part of the agreement. Designs for the Radio City Music Hall and the RCA Building were submitted to the New York City Department of Buildings in August 1931, by which time both buildings were to open in 1932. Work on the steel structure of the RCA Building started in March 1932, and the building's structural steel was up to the 64th floor by September of that year. The photograph Lunch atop a Skyscraper was taken on September 20, 1932, during the construction of the 69th floor. The structure of the RCA Building was slated to open on May 1, 1933. Its opening was delayed until mid-May because of a controversy over Man at the Crossroads, a painting by Diego Rivera that was removed from the RCA Building.  Early tenants  Rockefeller Center, featuring the RCA Building in December 1933 NBC was one of the first tenants in the new RCA Building, and with 35 studios packed into the lower base of the building, it was also one of the largest tenants. RCA's chief engineer O. B. Hanson was faced with designing an area of the building that was large enough to host 35 studios with as few structural columns as possible. This was achieved by placing all the studios in the 16-story, the windowless center part of the building, which would have otherwise been used as an unprofitable office space. Over of utility wires stretched through this part of the building, which was powered by direct current because the use of alternating current would cause transmissions to become spotty. Two floors were reserved for future TV studios, and five more stories were reserved for audience members and guests. During the building's early years, NBC housed both the Red Network and the Blue Network within 30 Rockefeller Plaza. The building also hosted daily tours of the NBC Studios. Studio 8H was the largest of the studios in the RCA Building, with the capacity to seat 1,400 guests. The Rockefeller family's Standard Oil Company moved into the RCA Building in 1934. The New York Museum of Science and Industry leased some of the unpopular space on the RCA Building's lower floors after Nelson Rockefeller became a trustee of the museum in fall 1935. Westinghouse moved into the 14th through 17th floors of the RCA Building. The Rockefeller family moved into various floors and suites throughout the same building to give potential tenants the impression of occupancy. In particular, the family's office took up \\"Room 5600\\" on the entire 56th floor, while the family's Rockefeller Foundation took up the entire floor below, and two other organizations supported by the Rockefellers also moved into the building. By 1937, there were 392 employees of Room 5600, and by the time World War II was over, Room 5600 comprised the entire 54th through 56th floors. The family offices became a hub for the family's political activity, with ties to both the Democratic and Republican parties at the city, state, and national levels. Frank Sinatra, Shirley MacLaine, Nelson Mandela, Richard Gere, and Bono all came to the offices at one time or another. The family moved out in 2014, and this space is now occupied by Rockefeller Family and Associates, whose offices span the 54th to 56th floors. John D. Rockefeller had a private vault in the basement of the building, accessible via a private elevator from his office. Shortly after the RCA Building's opening, there were plans to use the building above the 64th floor as a public \\"amusement center\\". That section of the building had several terraces, which could be used as a dance floor, observatory and landscaped terrace gardens. On the 65th floor, there was also a two-story space for a dining room with a high ceiling. Frank W. Darling quit his job as head of Rye's Playland in order to direct the programming for the proposed amusement space. In July 1933, the managers opened an observation deck atop the RCA Building, which consisted of terraces on the 67th, 69th, and 70th floors. It was a great success: the 40-cents-per-head observation deck saw 1,300 daily visitors by late 1935. Meanwhile, the floors below the observatory were planned as a restaurant, solarium, game room, and ballroom, which would later become the Rainbow Room. The Rainbow Room opened on October 3, 1934. To transport visitors to the top floors, Westinghouse installed eight express elevators in the RCA Building. They moved at an average speed of and made up 13% of the building's entire construction cost. One elevator reached a top speed of and was dubbed \\"the fastest passenger elevator ride on record\\". These elevators cost about $17,000 a year to maintain by 1942. 20th century By the mid-1950s, the Museum of Science and Industry had moved out of the RCA Building's lower floors. The former museum space became office and retail space that was twice as profitable. Much of the street-level space was also transformed into a studio for the Today Show. In 1985, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission declared that the entire original Rockefeller Center would officially become a city landmark.. A year afterward, the observatory was closed to make way for an expansion of the Rainbow Room, which in turn isolated the observation deck from its elevators. The elevators from the ground level only reached the 65th floor, and observatory visitors were required to transfer to another \\"shuttle\\" elevator that went between the 65th and 69th floors. The RCA Building was renamed the GE Building in 1988, two years after General Electric re-acquired the RCA Corporation. In 1996, NBC bought the space it had leased in the center for over sixty years. The building's address became the title of the NBC sitcom 30 Rock (2006‚Äì2013), which followed the cast and crew of a fictional television show filmed inside the building. Aside from two live episodes, which were produced at NBC's facilities inside the building, the series used the building mostly for exterior and occasional lobby shots, while interior scenes were filmed at Silvercup Studios in Long Island City, Queens. From the end of 1960 through October 1993, the building's mezzanine level housed the New York City weather forecast office of the National Weather Service; it was relocated to eastern Long Island, on the grounds of Brookhaven National Laboratory at Upton, New York. KWO35, the NOAA Weather Radio station serving the majority of the Tri- State area, originally transmitted from atop the building and remained there until 2014. Due to interference with a U.S. Coast Guard radio channel, the transmitter was eventually relocated atop the MetLife Building. A weather radar station was also located atop the building (it was previously used as Doppler 4000 during WNBC-TV's local newscasts).  21st century  Plans for the reopening of the observation deck were announced in November 2003. The existing elevator shafts were lengthened so that the observatory could be accessed without going through the Rainbow Room to get to the \\"shuttle\\" elevators. The deck reopened in November 2005 after a renovation by Gabellini Sheppard Associates. In June 2014, Comcast was granted permission from the Landmarks Preservation Commission to make modifications to the building to reflect its ownership of NBCUniversal. The GE Building would be officially known as the Comcast Building. Comcast planned to replace the neon GE lettering from the top of the building with a tall, LED-lit Comcast wordmark and NBC logo, and add a NBC logo on the building western's facade. Additionally, a new marquee was added to the Avenue of the Americas entrance, advertising it as the home of The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. On July 1, 2015, the name change and new signage were made official. In November 2018, the toy store FAO Schwarz opened a location at 30 Rockefeller Plaza.  Description  30 Rockefeller Plaza is tall and anchors the entire Rockefeller Center complex. 30 Rockefeller Plaza was built as a single structure occupying the entire block between Sixth Avenue and Rockefeller Plaza, and its design was influenced by John Todd's desire for the building to use its air rights to their maximum potential. Form and facade 30 Rockefeller Plaza consists of three main segments: the 66-story-tall tower rising from the eastern part of the base; a windowless segment in the middle of the base; and a shorter 20-story tower on the western part of the base. Some sources give 30 Rockefeller Plaza's height as 70 stories, but this arises from a hyperbolic press release by Merle Crowell, the complex's publicist during construction. Granite covers the building base to a height of , while the tower has a refined facade of Indiana Limestone with aluminum spandrel panels. As an icon of the complex, 30 Rockefeller Plaza's architecture, with its limestone facade and Gothic-inspired four-leafed spandrels, influenced the design of the rest of the complex. The design of 30 Rockefeller Center was affected greatly by the 1916 Zoning Resolution, which restricted the height that the street-side exterior walls of New York City buildings could rise before they needed to incorporate setbacks that recessed the buildings' exterior walls away from the streets. Hood also created a guideline that all of the office space in the complex would be no more than from a window, which was the maximum distance that sunlight could permeate the windows of a building at New York City's latitude. Although the RCA Building was recessed so far into the block that it could have simply risen as a slab without any setbacks, Hood decided to include setbacks anyway because they represented \\"a sense of future, a sense of energy, a sense of purpose,\\" according to the architecture expert Alan Balfour. The setbacks on the northern and southern sides of 30 Rockefeller Plaza allow the building to comply with Hood's 27-foot guideline, but the eastern elevation's setbacks are merely for show, according to Balfour. 1250 Avenue of the Americas, formerly also known as the RCA Building West, serves as the western annex of 30 Rockefeller Plaza. The building is accessed mainly from Sixth Avenue. It is made of the same material as the original RCA Building, with a similar design. The facade of the annex rises straight from the sidewalk, set back from the corners because there were private properties at these corners at the time of the building's construction in 1935. Features Seen in February 2007 The eastern tower contains the Rainbow Room restaurant on the 65th floor, while the Rockefeller family office occupied the tower's 54th through 56th floors until 2014. The tower also serves as the headquarters of NBC, and houses NBC Studios, NBC News, MSNBC, and network flagship station WNBC; and until 1988, the NBC Radio Network. Although NBC has continuously occupied the building since 1933, it did not own the space it occupied until 1996, when it gained ownership within a condominium arrangement. From 1937 onward, the top of the tower also contained neon letters spelling \\"RCA\\", though these were later replaced by \\"GE\\" letters, and in 2014, replaced again with the new united Comcast/NBC logo, now rendered with longer-lasting LED lighting. Part of NBC's space also extends into the central part of the tower. Since the middle of a block was seen as typically not a well-desired location for Manhattan office space, this segment was planned without windows, which was suitable for NBC's studios. This section of the building contains a \\"Garden of the Nations\\" atop its roof. In 1936, the central section's roof temporarily housed a prototype of an apartment, which was used to advertise the Rockefeller Apartments between 54th and 55th Streets. Afterward, the roof was proposed as the site of a solar heat-powered \\"management and conference center\\". =Lobby, concourse, and mezzanine= The lobby's main entrance is from Rockefeller Plaza to the east, with revolving and double-leaf bronze-and-glass doors underneath a paneled bronze screen. Opposite the main entrance doors is an information deck made of Champlain gray marble, while four large ivory-marble piers with embedded light fixtures support the lobby ceiling. The lobby's western end connects to two west‚Äìeast corridors, which flank five north‚Äìsouth elevator banks. The elevator doors are made of bronze, and there are bronze and glass storefronts on the outer walls of these corridors. The walls of these corridors are made of Champlain marble below the height of the storefronts and elevator doors; a bronze molding at that height; and plaster above that height. The ceilings of the corridors are carried by rows of piers. Toward the western end of the lobby, two north‚Äìsouth corridors extend to side entrances on 49th and 50th Streets, which each contain two bronze sets of revolving doors. Below the lobby is the complex's shopping concourse, connected to the lobby via escalators. The building has a direct entrance to the New York City Subway's 47th‚Äì50th Streets‚ÄìRockefeller Center station via the concourse. There is also a mezzanine that contains balconies overlooking the lobby. The floors of the mezzanine are black terrazzo, while the walls are made of marble and plaster separated by a bronze molding. Offices from the outer walls open onto the mezzanine balconies. There are staircases from the lobby to both the concourse and mezzanine, located west of the lobby's elevator banks. =Art= Lee Lawrie's carved rendering of Wisdom is located above the east entrance of the main building and is flanked by his renderings of Sound on the left and Light on the right. The Wisdom frieze above the entrance is accompanied by an inscription that reads: \\"Wisdom and Knowledge shall be the stability of thy times,\\" from Isaiah 33:6 (KJV). Lawrie's three renderings are complemented by two limestone bas-reliefs by Leo Friedlander: one of Production on the north elevation, and one of Radio on the south elevation. The lobby wall of 30 Rockefeller Plaza originally contained the controversial Man at the Crossroads mural by Diego Rivera. This was destroyed in 1934 and replaced with a mural by Josep Maria Sert titled American Progress. American Progress depicts a vast allegorical scene of men constructing modern America and contains figures of Abraham Lincoln, Mahatma Gandhi, and Ralph Waldo Emerson. Sert's other murals, all located in the northern ground-floor corridor, include Time; Spirit of Dance; Man's Triumph in Communication; Conquest of Disease; Abolition of Bondage; Fraternity of Men; and Contest-1940, depicting different aspects of the world and mankind. Frank Brangwyn complemented Sert's works with four murals on the southern corridor, all of which symbolize humans' relationship with spirituality. 1230 Avenue of the Americas, the annex building to 30 Rockefeller Plaza, contains two works of art on its exterior. The recessed entrance portal is filled with a mosaic mural of \\"Intelligence Awakening Mankind\\" by Barry Faulkner. The portal itself is located underneath four limestone panels by Gaston Lachaise, each of which signifies an aspect of civilization as it related to the original Radio City complex. =Rainbow Room= The 65th floor of the building is an event room and restaurant named the Rainbow Room, previously run by the Cipriani family. Opened in 1934, it was the first restaurant to be located in a high-rise building and remained the highest elevated restaurant in the United States for decades. Suffering from a decline in business following the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì08, the restaurant closed in 2009. In 2012, it was declared a New York City landmark by the Landmarks Preservation Commission. On September 17, 2013, it was announced that the Rainbow Room would reopen in fall 2014 after undergoing a full restoration, along with a new executive chef and management team. After a years-long restoration process by Gabellini Sheppard Associates, it reopened to the public on October 5, 2014, with new owner-operator Tishman Speyer and chef Jonathan Wright at the helm. The renovation includes the landmarked dance floor and a new cocktail lounge called SixtyFive. =Observation deck= The observation deck atop the skyscraper, dubbed \\"Top of the Rock\\", is built to resemble the deck of an ocean liner. It offers sightseers a bird's eye view of the city, competing with the 86th-floor observatory of the Empire State Building 200 feet (61 m) higher. It is often considered the best panoramic city view, mainly because it offers a far-away view of the Empire State Building. The timed entry system and larger observation deck also results in shorter waiting times compared to the Empire State. The frameless safety glass around the perimeter of the deck dates to 2005, when the facility reopened to the public. In the renovation by Gabellini Sheppard Associates, the original limestone and cast aluminum architectural details were conserved and new interiors were added. The \\"Top of the Rock\\" had also been co-opted for NBC's Sunday Night Football during the 2006‚Äì07 season, with the top player/MVP in that night's game according to John Madden and Al Michaels receiving the honor of being that night's \\"Rock Star\\" in the form of a glass trophy display on the observation deck; this was a replacement for the Horse Trailer Award formerly awarded on ABC's Monday Night Football. The Horse Trailer honor was restored for the 2007‚Äì08 season.  NBC Studios  NBC Studios entrance. Rainbow Room Marquee The Comcast Building is well known for housing the headquarters of NBC, the New York facilities of NBC Studios, and NBCUniversal Cable. In 1996, NBC bought the of space it had leased since 1933. The purchase allowed the company to introduce new technologies and renovate the space; it also gave them options to renew the lease on the Today Show studios, broadcast from a nearby building, 10 Rockefeller Plaza. NBC occupies floors 2‚Äì19, 21, 27, 46‚Äì47, and 51 (leasing the floors it occupies above the 16th). The building's studios include Studio 8H, the home of Saturday Night Live. Studio 8H was once the largest radio studio in the world, originally home to the NBC Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Arturo Toscanini. It was converted into a television studio in 1950. The Tonight Show was also taped at the building in Studio 6B from the early Jack Paar years until 1972, when the show moved to Burbank, California. In 2014, The Tonight Show returned to Studio 6B with its latest incarnation, The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. Tonights companion program, Late Night, as of 2020 branded Late Night with Seth Meyers, shot in studio 8G, has been produced from the building since it began in 1982; the relocation of Tonight back to New York in 2014 brought the two shows under one roof for the first time. During its run, Rosie O'Donnell broadcast her syndicated talk show from the building.

Easily Abbey's most famous work of fiction, the novel concerns the use of sabotage to protest environmentally damaging activities in the Southwestern United States, and was so influential that the term \\"monkeywrench\\" has come to mean, besides sabotage and damage to machines, any sabotage, activism, law-making, or law-breaking to preserve wilderness, wild spaces and ecosystems. In 1985, Dream Garden Press released a special 10th Anniversary edition of the book featuring illustrations by R. Crumb, plus a chapter titled \\"Seldom Seen at Home\\" that had been deleted from the original edition.AbbeyWeb: The Monkey Wrench Gang Crumb's illustrations were used for a limited-edition calendar based on the book.AbbeyWeb: The 1987 Monkey Wrench Gang Calendar The most recent edition was released in 2006 by Harper Perennial Modern Classics. Plot summary The book's four main characters are ecologically minded misfits‚Äî\\"Seldom Seen\\" Smith, a Jack Mormon river guide; Doc Sarvis, an odd but wealthy and wise surgeon; Bonnie Abbzug, his young Jewish feminist assistant; and a rather eccentric Green Beret Vietnam veteran, George Hayduke. Together, although not always working as a tightly knit team, they form the titular group dedicated to the destruction of what they see as the system that pollutes and destroys their environment, the American West. As the gang's attacks on deserted bulldozers and trains continue, the law closes in. 10th Anniversary edition (1985) from Dream Garden Press, with illustrations by Robert Crumb For the gang, the enemy is those who would develop the American Southwest‚Äîdespoiling the land, befouling the air, and destroying nature and the sacred purity of Abbey's desert world. Their greatest hatred is focused on the Glen Canyon Dam, a monolithic edifice of concrete that the monkey-wrenchers seek to destroy because it dams a beautiful wild river. Reception *From the National Observer, \\"A sad, hilarious, exuberant, vulgar fairy tale... It'll make you want to go out and blow up a dam.\\" *From The New York Times, \\"Since the publication of The Monkey Wrench Gang, Mr. Abbey has become an underground cult hero.\\" *From The Washington Post, \\"One of the best writers to deal with the American West.\\" *From the Houston Chronicle, \\"What a thing of beauty is Edward Abbey's The Monkey Wrench Gang.\\" Legacy A monkey wrench and a stone hammer on the logo of Earth First! In his book Screw Unto Others, George Hayduke states that Edward Abbey was his mentor, and mentions The Monkey Wrench Gang as the origin of the term monkey-wrenching. Hayduke says The Monkey Wrench Gang inspired environmentalist David Foreman to help create Earth First!Screw Unto Others, p. 77 a direct action environmental organization that often advocates much of the minor vandalism depicted in the book. Many scenes of vandalism and ecologically motivated mayhem, including a billboard burning at the beginning of the book and the use of caltrops to elude a group of vigilantes, are presented in sufficient detail as to form a skeletal how-to for would-be saboteurs. The actions are presented in a larger-than-life format, because much of what Hayduke, and the rest of the characters in the story face are larger-than-life obstacles that require larger-than-life approaches. The symbol of the Earth Liberation Front is a monkey wrench and stone hammer. In his book Sewer, Gas & Electric: The Public Works Trilogy, author Matt Ruff notes: :\\"One of my other literary inspirations for the [...] subplot was Edward Abbey‚Äôs The Monkey Wrench Gang.* That book‚Äôs protagonist, George Hayduke, is a Vietnam vet and former POW who launches a campaign of sabotage against the polluters who are ruining his beloved southwestern desert. Hayduke is a pretty angry guy, but he also loves life, and in his own fatalistic way he remains an optimist (my favorite line in the novel, uttered at a moment when Hayduke‚Äôs luck appears to have run out, is 'When the situation is hopeless, there‚Äôs nothing to worry about').\\" http://www.bymattruff.com/my- novels/sewer-gas-electric/faq/  Sequel  *Hayduke Lives! continues the story from where The Monkey Wrench Gang left off. Film, TV or theatrical adaptations As of 2012, a film adaptation of the book, to be directed by Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman, was being planned.

The stable originated in World Championship Wrestling (WCW) with the gimmick of a group of unsanctioned wrestlers aiming to \\"take over\\" and control WCW in the manner of a street gang. The group later appeared in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) after the purchase of WCW by the WWF. The nWo angle became one of the most influential forces in the mid-to-late 1990s success of WCW and was instrumental in turning mainstream North American professional wrestling back into a more mature, adult-oriented product and became the main driving forces behind WCW competing with WWF in the Monday Night Wars. Fueled initially by the unexpected villainous turn of Hulk Hogan, the nWo storyline is generally considered one of the most successful angles in the history of modern-day professional wrestling, spawning several imitations and parodies, including groups such as the bWo, lWo, jWo and the nWo Wolfpac. The group dominated WCW programming throughout the late-1990s and continued its domination until the dissolution of WCW in 2001, during which time there were several, sometimes rival, incarnations of the group. In December 2019, it was announced that the nWo would be inducted into the 2020 WWE Hall of Fame, with Hogan, Hall, Nash, and Sean Waltman as the inducted members.  Concept  The nWo storyline was an idea created by WCW Executive Vice President Eric Bischoff, whose inspiration for the angle came after attending New Japan Pro- Wrestling's Battle Formation show at the Tokyo Dome on April 29, 1996. The show was headlined by a NJPW vs. UWFi match for the IWGP Heavyweight Championship, as New Japan's Shinya Hashimoto defeated UWFi's Nobuhiko Takada. Bischoff wanted to do an invasion-type angle where WCW was being sabotaged by another wrestling group, initially insinuated as being the WWF, since the nWo's founding members had previously wrestled for the company. The nWo was originally portrayed as a separate entity from WCW. Often, propaganda-style vignettes and product commercials concerning the nWo were presented in the style of a broadcast signal intrusion, with a voice proclaiming, \\"The following announcement has been paid for by the New World Order\\". Others, such as Kevin Nash, television director Craig Leathers, chief WCW booker Terry Taylor, and Taylor's assistants Kevin Sullivan and Paul Orndorff, all contributed their own ideas to the nWo concept.  History = World Championship Wrestling  Formation = Scott Hall as Razor Ramon, whose antics led the WWF to claim that WCW had infringed on their intellectual property On May 19, 1996, Kevin Nash and Scott Hall wrestled their final matches for the WWF as Diesel and Razor Ramon respectively, as they both had opted to sign with rival WCW instead of staying with the promotion. Eight days later on May 27, 1996, Hall appeared on Nitro, which emanated from the Macon Coliseum in Macon, Georgia. As The Mauler and Steve Doll wrestled, Hall emerged from the crowd and entered the ring, bringing the match to a halt, and called for the ring announcer's microphone. \\"You all know who I am\\", Hall said to the stunned crowd, \\"but you don't know why I'm here\\". He went on to deliver what became known as the \\"You Want a War?\\" speech, stating that he and unnamed allies had a challenge for WCW Executive Vice President Eric Bischoff and any WCW wrestlers. As the episode neared its end, Hall accosted Bischoff, who was also the lead broadcaster for Nitro at the time, in the broadcast booth and demanded that he tell WCW owner Ted Turner (who he referred to as Billionaire Ted) to pick three of his best wrestlers for \\"a war\\". The next week, Hall claimed to have a \\"big surprise\\" for fellow professional wrestler Sting. On the following Nitro, the big surprise was revealed to be Kevin Nash. They were dubbed The Outsiders, randomly appearing at WCW events to cause trouble and inevitably be led out of the building by WCW security. Hall and Nash were both fully employed by WCW, but the storyline implied that they were WWF wrestlers \\"invading\\" WCW. This was enough of a concern to the WWF that it considered legal action over Hall and Nash's antics. Hall was the bigger concern to the WWF, as he had not fully distanced himself from his Razor Ramon character, continuing to act like Razor and speaking with Razor's pseudo-Cuban American accent. WCW attempted to address these concerns at The Great American Bash in June 1996. Bischoff promised them a match at the next pay-per-view event, and then directly asked both Hall and Nash if they were employed by the WWF, to which they both said no. The WWF, still unsatisfied, filed a lawsuit, claiming that Bischoff had proposed inter-promotional matches that would air on TBS, associating the two promotions with each other. Also at The Great American Bash, both Hall and Nash pressed Bischoff to name his company's three representatives for their impending match. Bischoff said that he had found three men who would answer their challenge, but would not name them. Bischoff held a draft on Nitro to determine WCW's representatives, and Sting, Lex Luger and Randy Savage were chosen. = Hostile takeover = The match Bischoff promised, a six-man tag team match billed as the \\"Hostile Takeover match\\", was scheduled as the main event of Bash at the Beach at the Ocean Center in Daytona Beach, Florida on July 7, 1996. Hall and Nash came to the ring by themselves, leaving speculation open as to who the third man was. Team WCW then entered with all three members wearing face paint as a sign of solidarity. Luger was hurt and badly injured, (kayfabe) right when the match started and had to be removed on a stretcher. The match reached its climax at approximately the sixteen-minute mark, shortly after a late tag from Sting to Savage. Savage went on the attack, nailing both Outsiders with repeated axe- handle smashes from the top rope. However, while referee Randy Anderson checked on a downed Hall, Hall grabbed his shirt while Nash nailed Savage with a low blow which knocked both men to the mat. With all four men down, Anderson had no choice but to begin counting them out as he did not see the low blow. As he began his count, the fans' attention turned to the entrance area as Hulk Hogan entered and began walking to the ring to a loud roar from the crowd. Hall spotted him and immediately fled the ring. Hogan, who had not been seen on WCW television for some time, climbed into the ring to chase away Nash and tore off his T-shirt, as he had done many times before. With the fans still cheering wildly, Hogan stood in the corner nearest and hit his long-time friend Savage with his Atomic Leg Drop, stunning the crowd into silence and turning heel for the first time since his AWA days in 1981. The Outsiders came back into the ring to celebrate with their now-revealed partner as Hogan dropped the leg on the fallen Savage a second time, and after the three men all shook hands Hogan threw the referee from the ring and hit Savage one last time. The official match result was a no contest and Savage had to be carried from the ring by an exhausted Sting. After the match, \\"Mean\\" Gene Okerlund came to the ring and interviewed Hogan. During the interview, Hogan exclaimed that he, Hall and Nash were \\"the new world order of wrestling\\", giving the group its name ‚Äì the New World Order. Hogan continued, reminding everybody of the \\"big organization up north\\" where Hall and Nash had come from and that he too had been there and how he had made that company a household name. Hogan followed by bringing up his signing with WCW in 1994. He then declared that Hall and Nash were the kind of people he really wanted as his friends and that together, the three of them were going to take over WCW and destroy everything in their path. At this point, Okerlund directed Hogan to look at the debris strewn around the ring and told him that he could expect more of this if he chose to associate with Hall and Nash (subtly suggesting that Hogan should reconsider one more time). Hogan disregarded Okerlund and went into a tirade against the fans while taking another shot at Bischoff and some of the newer talent the fans were cheering. Hogan then grabbed Okerlund by the collar moments later but quickly let him go after Okerlund threatened to sue him if he didn't. The show closed with the three wrestlers continuing to taunt the fans, who booed and pelted them with garbage. Wrapping up the event on pay- per-view, a still-stunned Tony Schiavone said: \\"Hulk Hogan, you can go to hell... Straight to hell\\". The night after Bash at the Beach, Hall and Nash appeared on Nitro without Hogan, attempting to attack Sting, Arn Anderson and Randy Savage, but were held back by WCW security. Hogan returned the next week on Nitro and assisted Hall and Nash in beating up Lex Luger and Big Bubba Rogers during Nitro's main event. He then made a challenge to then reigning WCW World Heavyweight Champion The Giant for Hog Wild in August. = Hogan becomes champion and Bischoff's secret is revealed = During his time with the nWo, Hulk Hogan became known as Hollywood Hulk Hogan, often shortened to Hollywood Hogan At Hog Wild, the newly rechristened Hollywood Hulk Hogan (often shortened to Hollywood Hogan) won the match after knocking The Giant out with his title belt. After the match, Hogan rechristened the Big Gold Belt as the nWo World Heavyweight Championship by spray-painting the group acronym in capital letters across the faceplate. Nearly two weeks after Hog Wild, Ted DiBiase made his WCW debut and declared himself the financier and spokesperson of the nWo (thus becoming the fourth man), and was given the nickname \\"Trillionaire Ted\\".Ted DiBiase: The Million Dollar Man, p.200, Ted DiBiase with Tom Caiazzo, Pocket Books, New York, NY, 2008, On the September 2 episode of Nitro, the nWo got its first defection and fifth member from WCW as The Giant, who just weeks earlier lost his title to Hogan, turned on his Dungeon of Doom teammates and attacked The Four Horsemen and Randy Savage. As WCW's annual pay-per-view Fall Brawl was drawing closer, WCW was preparing for another battle against the nWo. On the September 9 episode of Nitro, the nWo tricked fans and wrestlers into thinking that Sting had joined the nWo by putting wrestler Jeff Farmer into the group as a Sting clone, complete with Sting attire and face paint. This point was furthered when Farmer, as the fake Sting, attacked Luger, who had been lured into an attack by referee Nick Patrick. This led Luger, his longtime ally and tag team partner, to publicly question Sting. At Fall Brawl, as Team WCW was being interviewed, Sting told his teammates that he had nothing to do with the attack, but Luger did not believe him. Going into the match, only three wrestlers on each side had been officially named: Hogan and The Outsiders for the nWo, with Luger, Arn Anderson, and Ric Flair for Team WCW. Sting had originally been named the fourth man for WCW, but his participation was in doubt. The fourth man for the nWo was indeed the fake Sting, who convinced everyone (including the broadcast team) that the real Sting was nWo. The real Sting showed up moments later as the last man for Team WCW and took apart the nWo by himself. After assaulting Hogan, Hall, Nash and the fake Sting, Sting left the ring and Team WCW, yelling at an apologetic looking Luger \\"Now do you believe me?\\" as he did so. Team WCW, now fighting a 4-on-3 handicap match, lost when the nWo Sting locked Luger in the Scorpion Death Lock. The next night on Nitro, an angry Sting laid into his fellow wrestlers as well as the fans for doubting his true colors. He came out unexpectedly, with no music or pyrotechnics, and kept his back to the camera purposely as he spoke: Syxx was the sixth person to join the nWo With that, Sting began a retreat from the ring that would last for nearly fifteen months, and in the process, left his loyalties on the table for either side to try and move him to theirs. The nWo stepped up its efforts to try and recruit Sting, yet never removed the fake Sting from the group. As Sting's character and look evolved, so too did Farmer's nWo Sting character. On the same night Sting made his speech, the nWo inducted its sixth official member into the group, Sean Waltman, who was friends with Hall and Nash in real-life and wrestled as \\"The 1-2-3 Kid\\" in the WWF, now known as Syxx. In October, the nWo debuted Vincent, who had previously been DiBiase's manservant in the WWF as \\"Virgil\\", as its \\"head of security\\". Referee Nick Patrick became the group's official referee after he began showing partiality to nWo members during their matches. Miss Elizabeth turned against The Four Horsemen and joined the group as Hogan's valet. In the storyline, WCW only recognized Hogan, Nash, and Hall as WCW employees due to their holding WCW championships, and the other nWo members went unrecognized as WCW employees; because of this, they were unable to wrestle other WCW wrestlers. This led to the nWo starting a segment on Saturday Night, called nWo Saturday Night, where nWo stable members wrestled local jobbers inside an empty arena. The nWo also used their \\"financing\\" to purchase ad time during WCW programming, which amounted to low budget anti-WCW propaganda, or \\"hijack\\" the broadcast signal. The nWo continued to dominate WCW, with Hogan successfully retaining the nWo World Heavyweight Championship against \\"Macho Man\\" Randy Savage and Hall and Nash winning the WCW World Tag Team Championship from Harlem Heat (Booker T and Stevie Ray) at Halloween Havoc. In the meantime, The Giant stole Flair's United States Heavyweight Championship and claimed it for himself. At Halloween Havoc, Hogan's old rival Roddy Piper, whom WCW had just signed to a contract, came to the ring to confront Hogan. Piper began seeking a match with Hogan the next night. Then WCW Vice President Eric Bischoff, who in November 1996 revealed that he had secretly been a member of the nWo all along On November 18, 1996, Nitro was live at the Florence Civic Center in Florence, South Carolina and opened with Hall and Nash physically attacking The Nasty Boys (Brian Knobbs and Jerry Sags), High Voltage (Robbie Rage and Kenny Kaos), Ciclope, and Galaxy and forcing Tony Schiavone to walk off the show after they threatened him. As the show moved into its second hour, Hogan and his entourage accosted Bischoff at the announce table and forced him to say that Hogan was better than Piper, who was still seeking a match with Hogan, but whom Bischoff had not agreed on a contract with yet. At the end of the show, Piper and Bischoff began arguing in the ring. As Piper continued to badger Bischoff, The Giant entered the scene and grabbed Piper from behind. He was followed by Syxx, Vincent, and The Outsiders, who all stepped in to stop Piper from attacking Bischoff. Finally, Hogan and DiBiase came out and revealed to the entire world that Bischoff, despite appearances, had secretly been a member of the nWo all along. Piper and Hogan were booked for a non-title match at Starrcade in December. The next night on Nitro, Bischoff permanently left the broadcast booth, and his character became an egomaniacal tyrant as WCW executive vice president, as well as a manager-type figure and replaced DiBiase as the spokesperson of the nWo (DiBiase remained as the financier until he quit the NWO in April 1997). At the top of the program, Bischoff issued an ultimatum to the WCW locker room: all wrestlers were given thirty days to join the group. Marcus Bagwell (redubbed \\"Buff Bagwell\\"), Mr. Wallstreet, Big Bubba Rogers, and Scott Norton became members in the following weeks. Japanese wrestler Masahiro Chono also joined the group on December 16 and established himself as the leader of nWo Japan, a sister stable in NJPW. At Starrcade, Piper defeated Hogan. At the same event, after multiple attempts to convince Diamond Dallas Page to join, Hall and Nash attacked Page in his United States Heavyweight Championship tournament final match against Eddie Guerrero, costing him the match. The nWo left with physical possession of the title belt. It was then given to Syxx, and Guerrero began feuding with him. The next night on Nitro, The Giant was kicked out of the nWo when he refused to perform a chokeslam on Piper in an nWo assault. = Expansion, success and feud with Sting = On the January 13 edition of Nitro, Diamond Dallas Page seemingly accepted nWo membership, putting on a T-shirt but suddenly gave Scott Hall a Diamond Cutter. At nWo Souled Out, Hogan and The Giant fought to a no contest in the main event due to the nWo referee, Nick Patrick, being biased toward Hogan. The United States Heavyweight Champion Eddie Guerrero retained his title against Syxx in a ladder match, while The Outsiders lost the tag team titles to The Steiner Brothers. Bischoff re-awarded them the titles the next night on Nitro after claiming that Randy Anderson, who ran in to officiate after Patrick was knocked down, was not the official referee. Bischoff then fired Anderson for his actions. On the same Nitro, Randy Savage returned for the first time since Halloween Havoc. Claiming to have been \\"blackballed\\", he hijacked the ring until Sting showed up and they both left through the crowd. At SuperBrawl VII, the Outsiders lost their titles to Lex Luger and The Giant, while Syxx defeated Dean Malenko for the Cruiserweight Championship. Later that night, Hogan successfully defended his title against Roddy Piper. Savage, after weeks of roving with Sting as a \\"free agent\\", helped Hogan win. Savage participated in a post-match beatdown of Piper, cementing his place in the nWo. The next night on Nitro, Savage helped the Outsiders get revenge on DDP by attacking him from behind while they distracted him, and reunited with Miss Elizabeth. Later, Bischoff returned the tag team titles to The Outsiders, as Luger had been injured and was not cleared to wrestle in the SuperBrawl match. Luger, however, issued a challenge for a \\"winner-take-all\\" tag team match at Uncensored. Two weeks later on the March 3 episode of Nitro, Turner Sports vice president Dr. Harvey Schiller \\"suspended\\" Bischoff for abuse of his office. At Uncensored, Team nWo won the 3-team tag team match. In addition to winning, per a pre-match stipulation, the nWo gained the right to challenge for any WCW championship whenever and wherever they pleased. At the event, Sting descended from the rafters and attacked the top members of the nWo: Hall, Savage, Nash and Hogan, indicating his allegiance to WCW. Tensions began to surface within the nWo by April. At Spring Stampede, the show ended with Savage and Bischoff at each other's throats after the former's loss to Page, and both were forced to be held back by other group members. J.J. Dillon, who was appointed as WCW commissioner during Bischoff's suspension, later had Big Bubba Rogers and Mr. Wallstreet removed from the nWo due to a contractual technicality. Additionally, Ted DiBiase quit the group after feeling remorse for some of the WCW wrestlers who were victims of nWo assaults (he later said in shoot interviews that he was unhappy with Bischoff for replacing him as the spokesperson in the nWo). In the interim, the nWo recruited The Great Muta on May 26, and Hiroyoshi Tenzan and Hiro Saito several weeks after Spring Stampede; they made occasional appearances on television due to their full- time employment in NJPW. The nWo also added Konnan, whom they dubbed \\"K-Dogg\\", on July 14 after he attacked Rey Mysterio, Jr. while Kevin Nash watched. At Bash at the Beach in July, Dennis Rodman made his wrestling debut as he teamed with Hogan to take on Luger and The Giant in a tag team match. Luger won the match for his team by forcing Hogan to submit and earned a title shot at Road Wild, set for August. Luger, however, elected to take his shot on the August 4 episode of Nitro, five days before the pay-per-view, and defeated Hogan to win the championship. Hogan regained the title at Road Wild after Rodman, dressed up as Sting, hit Luger with a baseball bat. Following Road Wild, the nWo began a rivalry with The Four Horsemen, marked by a skit where they mocked members of the group. The Horsemen responded by challenging the nWo to a WarGames match at Fall Brawl in September. The match pitted Ric Flair, Curt Hennig, Steve McMichael and Chris Benoit against Nash, Konnan, Syxx, and Bagwell. During the match, Hennig turned on his team to align with the nWo. The nWo was victorious after McMichael surrendered in the match. Bret Hart made his WCW debut on the December 15 episode of Nitro and declared he would not join the nWo, but did say he would be the special guest referee for a match between Bischoff and Larry Zbyszko at Starrcade. If Bischoff won the match, the nWo would be given permanent control over Nitro, but if Zbyszko won, it would remain with WCW. On the Nitro before Starrcade, the nWo completely took over the show by tearing down the set and chasing off the WCW announcing crew. They destroyed anything WCW-related and rebranded it nWo Monday Nitro. This event was done as a test run for a permanent changeover of Nitro to an nWo-centric show, with the soon-debuting Thunder becoming the WCW-centric show.Reynolds, R.D., Bryan Alvarez. \\"The Death of WCW\\", ECW Press, 2004 However, due to abysmal ratings following the twenty-plus minutes of the conversion of the set on live television, the plan was quietly dropped. Zbyszko later defeated Bischoff at Starrcade. Also at Starrcade, Hogan lost the title to Sting. Hogan originally pinned Sting, but confusion arose when Hart appeared at ringside and accused referee and former nWo member Nick Patrick of making a fast count. In reality, Nick Patrick was supposed to make it a fast count, revealing himself to be a crooked official. By Hart's account in his biography, Patrick simply forgot to speed up the count, which left the fans extremely confused. Hart laid out Patrick and ordered the match to continue with himself as the referee. Hogan then submitted to Sting's Scorpion Death Lock, and the entire WCW locker room came out to celebrate the defeat of Hogan. = Dissension: nWo Hollywood and Wolfpac = Shortly after Hogan lost the title at Starrcade, the nWo started showing signs of division within the group. Because of the controversy surrounding Sting's title win, J.J. Dillon vacated the title on January 8, 1998 on the inaugural episode of Thunder. In addition to the title being vacated, Scott Hall was still slated to face the world champion at SuperBrawl VIII as per the stipulation surrounding his World War 3 win, and this also would have to be resolved with the vacant championship. New WCW commissioner Roddy Piper resolved that at Souled Out on January 24 by declaring that since there was no champion for him to face at SuperBrawl, he would face the winner of a second Hogan vs. Sting match at Uncensored in March. Later that evening, the feud between Hall and Larry Zbyszko came to an end when he defeated Hall by disqualification when Louie Spicolli, who had just signed with WCW a month earlier, interfered. After the match Dusty Rhodes, who had been in the broadcast booth that night and who Zbyszko had asked to come to the ring with him, joined Hall and Spicolli in attacking Zbyszko and joined the nWo, where he served as a mentor to Hall. The nWo continued to expand their ranks into the new year as former WWF star Brian Adams jumped ship to WCW and joined the nWo. Hogan gained a second bodyguard when Ed Leslie, who had previously tried to join the nWo at Road Wild in 1996, debuted as a barely recognizable bearded biker dubbed \\"The Disciple\\". At SuperBrawl VIII, the nWo had a mixed array of success. Hall and Nash regained the WCW's world tag team championship from The Steiner Brothers after Scott Steiner unexpectedly turned on his brother Rick and manager Ted DiBiase. Scott handed the championship belts to Hall and Nash after the match and celebrated with The Outsiders and Dusty Rhodes, marking his induction into the nWo. However, Hogan lost to Sting in a match for the vacated WCW World Heavyweight Championship and was attacked by Savage late in the match. After SuperBrawl, Savage then made his intentions clear and declared that he no longer needed the nWo's help to win matches, that Hogan had dropped the ball, and that he was going after Sting to try to bring the world championship back to the nWo. Hogan and Savage tried to one-up each other on episodes of Nitro and Thunder over the next few weeks, which led to a steel cage match at Uncensored in March which ended in a no contest. Earlier that night, Hall lost his World War 3-earned title match against Sting. The rift between the different factions of the nWo grew wider after Syxx, who had been out injured since October, was released from his contract and sent to rehab for his ongoing alcoholism. Shortly thereafter, Hall was removed from television; this led to a confrontation between Kevin Nash, Eric Bischoff, and Hogan on the March 26 episode of Thunder. Sean Waltman (Syxx) returned to the WWF four days later as X-Pac and returned the favor, saying that if Hall and Nash were contractually able to do so, they would jump ship and follow him back to the WWF, which led Bischoff to respond with a simple \\"bite me\\" on the April 6 episode of Nitro.WCW Monday Nitro. TNT. 1998-04-06. 120 minutes in. Kevin Nash and Sting, here standing opposite each other in the ring, would later join forces after the formation of the nWo Wolfpac to fight off the nWo Hollywood led by Hogan The differences within the nWo were becoming more apparent as Savage and Nash were suddenly realizing that Hogan was only looking out for himself, and the nWo was secondary. Nash sided with Savage after Hogan had interfered in a number of Sting/Nash matches, not wanting to have to face Nash to take back his title. Nash supported Savage in his quest to defeat Sting, but also agreed to team with Hogan against the returning Roddy Piper and The Giant in a Baseball Bat on a Pole match. At Spring Stampede, Hogan and Nash defeated Piper and The Giant, but after the match Hogan assaulted Nash. Nash later helped Savage defeat Sting by hitting a powerbomb on the champion, earning Savage the win, the title, and the ire of Hogan who came out following the match arguing that Savage had \\"his title\\". Hogan and The Disciple then attacked Nash and Savage to close out the show. The next night on Nitro, Hogan issued a challenge to the new champion for his title, and WCW commissioner Roddy Piper made the match a no disqualification match and said no run-ins would be permitted. Savage and Nash made their own speech later, where Nash said to Hogan \\"have a nice life\\" and implied that the nWo was not going to be together, at least in its current form, when the night was over. Late in the match, while Hogan and Savage were fighting in a corner, The Disciple entered the ring and gave referee Nick Patrick a neckbreaker. While this was allowed, due to the match being no disqualification, it also meant that no one was able to stop Hogan and Disciple from doing whatever they wanted to Savage. The Disciple hit his finisher, The Apocalypse, on Savage while the belt was draped over his shoulder. Just after this, a furious Nash charged to the ring to aid the fallen Savage. After Nash entered the ring, Eric Bischoff came running from the back and slid into the ring to intercept him. After tossing Bischoff aside, Nash nailed the Jackknife Powerbomb on Hogan. As the match was still going on, Nash pulled Savage on top of Hogan and went to revive Patrick as Bret Hart entered the ring. Hart picked up the title belt, struck Nash with it, rolled Hogan back over Savage, and revived the referee so he could count the pinfall for Hogan. Although Hogan was WCW World Heavyweight Champion for a fourth time and appeared to have taken the reins of the nWo again, the members of the group itself were now going to have to choose whose side they would be on: his or Nash's. Konnan was a member of the nWo Wolfpac led by Nash On the May 4 episode of Nitro, Nash, Savage, and Konnan appeared wearing black shirts with a red nWo logo, as opposed to the familiar white logo. They called themselves nWo Wolfpac (a name which Nash had previously been using alongside Hall and Syxx to refer to themselves as a trio), and were joined in the following weeks by Curt Hennig, Miss Elizabeth, Rick Rude and Dusty Rhodes. The Wolfpac became the first nWo incarnation to wrestle as faces. Hogan's side retained the black and white colors of the original nWo and took on the moniker nWo Hollywood, with Vincent, Bischoff, Scott Steiner, Scott Norton, Brian Adams, and The Disciple on his side. Bret Hart never officially joined either side, but supported nWo Hollywood as a member recruiter. At May's Slamboree, Nash and Hall were to defend the WCW World Tag Team Championship against two of WCW's stalwarts, Sting and The Giant. However, The Giant joined nWo Hollywood shortly before Slamboree as retribution for Nash injuring him at Souled Out in January. Despite this, The Giant maintained his alliance with Sting, but strongly suggested that Sting had a decision to make in terms of his allegiance. At Slamboree, Hall made his return to WCW in the colors of the Wolfpac for The Outsiders' title defense. During the match, however, he (along with Rhodes) turned on Nash by hitting him with the title belt, which gave the win to the team of Sting and The Giant. The next night on Nitro, Hall was introduced as the newest member of nWo Hollywood. On the May 25 episode of Nitro the Wolfpac added Lex Luger, who urged his friend Sting to join him. However, nWo Hollywood made their own effort to woo Sting. Sting revealed his decision on the following week's Nitro, fooling Hogan into believing that he was going to join his side, then turning on him and tearing off the black and white T-shirt he was wearing to reveal a red and black one underneath. As part of his joining the Wolfpac, Sting began painting his face red and black instead of the black and white \\"Crow\\" style face-paint he had been wearing since 1996. At The Great American Bash, the Wolfpac lost two members as Hennig and Rude turned on Konnan following a loss and joined nWo Hollywood. It was not a total loss for the red and black, however, as Sting defeated The Giant in a singles match for control of the vacated WCW World Tag Team Championship. The next night on Nitro, Sting chose Nash as his tag team partner and the two began defending the titles. In yet another shocking move, Miss Elizabeth defected from Savage (and the Wolfpac) and joined nWo Hollywood during a shocking promo (which included an on-screen kiss with Bischoff) on the June 8 episode of Nitro. On the June 15 episode of Nitro, Savage had a steel cage match versus Diamond Dallas Page (which featured Piper as special guest referee, and saw all three men on the receiving end of an attack by nWo Hollywood at the end of match). This attack, which resulted in a \\"knee injury\\" caused by a chair to his knee, would be the storyline angle for writing Savage off of TV, and he would then take a hiatus from the company to recover from at least two major knee surgeries (this was his final appearance with the Wolfpac, and he was not seen on TV again until the December 28th episode of Nitro). In the meantime, a new contender for Hogan's championship emerged in undefeated rookie and United States Heavyweight Champion Goldberg, who had run off an impressive string of victories. On the July 2, 1998 episode of Thunder, Goldberg was granted a title match against Hogan for the July 6 episode of Nitro. However, Hogan changed his mind and forced Goldberg to wrestle Scott Hall in order to earn his title match. Goldberg defeated Hall and then topped Hogan in the main event to win his first WCW World Heavyweight Championship. After his loss to Goldberg, Hogan turned his attention to celebrity matches for the next two months, wrestling in two tag team matches at Bash at the Beach and Road Wild. Hogan won the first match with Dennis Rodman over Diamond Dallas Page and Karl Malone. The second match was a culmination of a storyline involving several Tonight Show skits involving Jay Leno making fun of Hogan, which resulted in Hogan and Eric Bischoff taking over the show and Diamond Dallas Page coming to save the day. Hogan and Bischoff lost to Page and Leno thanks to interference from Kevin Eubanks. Fans make Wolfpac hand gestures towards Nash Meanwhile, the feud between Scott Hall and Kevin Nash continued while Nash continued to defend his half of the tag team championship with Sting. On the July 20 episode of Nitro, Hall and The Giant challenged the champions to a match for the tag team titles. Late in the match Bret Hart, who had been feuding with Sting over the previous few weeks, came out in an attempt to attack Sting. Sting knocked Hart to the floor and climbed the turnbuckle to taunt him, but the momentary lapse in concentration enabled Hall to pin Sting to win the WCW World Tag Team Championship back to the black and white. nWo Hollywood added a new member to its ranks on the August 24 episode of Nitro when Stevie Ray joined their stable. A few weeks later they lost a key member when The Disciple officially joined The Warrior's O.W.N. on the September 21 episode of Nitro after being \\"kidnapped\\" by The Warrior in the weeks prior. The feud between Hall and Nash culminated in a singles match at Halloween Havoc in October, where Hall earned a countout win after Nash left the ring. Nash later stated that he didn't care about winning the match, he just wanted his friend back. On the same night, Hogan defeated The Warrior when Hogan's nephew, Horace, interfered and joined nWo Hollywood. Bret Hart defeated Wolfpac member Sting, putting him out of action for about 6 months. (this was Sting's final appearance with nWo Wolfpac, and he was not seen on TV again until the March 29, 1999 episode of Nitro) At World War 3, nWo Hollywood attacked Scott Hall and kicked him out of the group for disrespecting Hogan and Bischoff a few weeks earlier. Kevin Nash won the 60-man battle royal and earned a WCW World Heavyweight Championship shot against the still-undefeated Goldberg. On the Thanksgiving episode of The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, nWo Hollywood leader Hollywood Hogan announced his retirement from professional wrestling and Scott Steiner went on to assume the leadership role in the nWo Hollywood faction. On the November 30 episode of Nitro, Dusty Rhodes was appointed, by Bischoff, to be \\"special guest referee\\" during the Barry Windham vs Dean Malenko match later that night, but during the match Rhodes turned on Windham & Bischoff and quit the nWo for good (which resulted in him getting kayfabe fired by Bischoff). At Starrcade, Nash handed Goldberg his first loss and won the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. Hall interfered in the match and shocked Goldberg with a taser, incapacitating him long enough for an oblivious Nash to hit the Jackknife Powerbomb and score the win. On the first Nitro after Starrcade (December 28 episode), the main event would be between WCW/nWo president Eric Bischoff and WCW's franchise player Ric Flair. This was after months of feuding and weeks of demanding a match against Bischoff for the presidency of the company. Flair declared he would give up all his possessions if he lost. The match was made by Bischoff who believed that Flair would not be able to compete after he had a kayfabe heart attack during a promo. Flair, despite interference by The Giant (which led to the shocking return of Savage, who shockingly assisted Flair and quit the nWo for good) defeated Bischoff in the match to become WCW president for 90 days, and Bischoff was relegated back to his old position as an on-air commentator. The ending of the match symbolized a new beginning for WCW heading into 1999 and appeared to be the possible conclusion to the nWo storyline. = nWo Elite and B-Team = As 1999 began, the divided nWo factions were headed by world champion and de facto leader Nash, who was unhappy with Hall's actions at Starrcade, and Scott Steiner, who had taken over nWo Hollywood following Hogan's retirement in November. On the first Nitro of the new year (January 4 episode), which took place at Atlanta's Georgia Dome, Nash and Goldberg were scheduled to face off in a Starrcade rematch as Nash had promised on the December 28 episode of Nitro. However, nWo Hollywood accused the former champion of stalking Miss Elizabeth and Goldberg was arrested and taken from the arena in handcuffs. Later that night, Hogan made his return to WCW for the first time since November 1998 and was challenged by the reigning champion. Hogan accepted Nash's request and took Goldberg's place in the main event. In the match, after the bell rang to begin the bout, Hogan poked Nash in the chest, after which Nash fell to the mat. Hogan covered Nash for the win and became champion again. After the win, Hogan celebrated in the ring with Nash, Hall, and Scott Steiner, revealing that it was all a conspiracy and the nWo had reunited under what would be known as the \\"nWo Elite\\" label. However, while Hogan, Hall, Nash, Steiner, Lex Luger, Konnan, Buff Bagwell, Eric Bischoff and Miss Elizabeth were part of the new \\"nWo Wolfpac Elite\\" [note: Sting and Rick Rude, who were members of the Wolfpac and nWo Hollywood, respectively, prior to this nWo reunion, were both on hiatus during the nWo factions reuniting and were never included in the new now-heel stable], the undercard wrestlers in the nWo (The Giant, Curt Hennig, Horace Hogan, Stevie Ray, Brian Adams, Scott Norton, and Vincent) were still in the black and white colors of nWo Hollywood and never were officially assimilated back into the group. The nWo Wolfpac Elite quickly began to \\"trim the fat\\" by eliminating a few guys from the newly reunited nWo entirely (first, Konnan and The Giant were both [separately] kicked out on the January 11 episode of Nitro; and then Hennig was kicked out on the January 25 episode of Nitro). The subtractions of The Giant and Hennig from the nWo \\"black and white\\" left a short-lived group sardonically labeled the nWo B-Team by fans and commentators. This \\"B-Team\\" was a staple of WCW programming throughout 1999, and it officially consisted of Stevie Ray, Brian Adams, Vincent, Horace, and Scott Norton. Stevie Ray eventually became their leader after winning a 4-man Battle Royal match on the April 5 episode of Nitro (Norton was not present for this match). = End of the nWo era = The reunited nWo did not last long for either faction. nWo Elite/Wolfpac enjoyed initial success with Hogan as WCW World Heavyweight Champion, Steiner as World Television Champion and Hall as United States Heavyweight Champion. However, they were wrecked by injuries when Hall's foot was accidentally backed over by a car and he was put on the shelf (and subsequently was stripped of the title), while Luger suffered a torn biceps and as a result he and Miss Elizabeth went on hiatus. Luger appeared sporadically in May and June 1999 on Nitro. Hogan dropped the WCW World Heavyweight Championship in a First Blood barbed wire steel cage match at Uncensored to Ric Flair and Steiner lost the World Television Championship to Booker T after Buff Bagwell accidentally nailed him with a chair. Shortly after, Steiner beat him down and threw him out of the group. Scott later reunited with his brother Rick, who interfered on Scott's behalf during his match with Bagwell at Slamboree in May 1999. A month earlier, Hogan suffered a severe injury during a fatal four-way match (with Page, Flair and a returned, white-painted Sting with a returned Randy Savage as the special guest referee) at Spring Stampede for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship, which Diamond Dallas Page won, and was put out of action for three months. It has been debated whether this injury was legitimate or not. Nash then began a rivalry with Page, who he blamed for causing Hogan's injury, and defeated him for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship at Slamboree. Scott Steiner was forced to go on hiatus due to a back injury and stripped of the United States Heavyweight Championship. Other minor members included Disco Inferno, David Flair, and Samantha. Inferno engaged in a feud with Konnan that ended with a loss to him at Spring Stampede (which was the quiet end of his membership), while Flair and Samantha were quietly removed from television following Hogan's title loss at Uncensored. However, by that time, the nWo Elite had collapsed and no longer had any importance in WCW. As the year went on, the nWo Black and White (B-Team) members slowly began distancing themselves from each other. Stevie Ray left the group in July to reform Harlem Heat with his brother Booker T. Brian Adams was kicked out of the group on the August 16 episode of Nitro and vanished from WCW programming for some time, eventually forming a tag team with Bryan Clark called KroniK. Scott Norton left WCW completely after the September 30 episode of Thunder and returned to Japan. Vincent left the group and joined The West Texas Rednecks alongside former nWo stablemates Curt Hennig and Barry Windham, changing his name to \\"Curly Bill\\" and later to \\"Shane\\" (as another slap at Vince McMahon). Horace Hogan would quietly go on his own after all of this. Hogan and Nash also entered a feud before the end of the summer. Nash lost the WCW World Heavyweight Championship in a tag team match at Bash at the Beach in July pitting him and Sting against Sid Vicious and Randy Savage as Savage pinned him. The next night, Hogan returned to Nitro and accepted a challenge from Savage for the championship; Nash interfered by hitting a Jacknife Powerbomb on Savage and gave Hogan the victory, but the next week Nash attacked Hogan during a match with Vicious and aligned himself with Vicious and Rick Steiner. Over the next few weeks, Hogan and Nash, along with Vicious and Steiner (on Nash's side) and Sting and a returning Goldberg (on Hogan's side) feuded with each other, culminating in a match at Road Wild where Hogan put his title and career on the line against Nash's career. Hogan returned to his red and yellow attire on Nitro shortly before the event and won the match, thus forcing Nash to retire. Nash did continue to make appearances afterward, usually stirring up trouble backstage with Hall as his cohort. = nWo 2000 = In late December 1999, Nash, Hall, Jeff Jarrett, and Bret Hart reformed the nWo, this time with the colors black and silver. Jeff Jarrett was often accompanied by the nWo girls including Midajah and Tylene Buck. Hall, Nash and Jarrett interfered on Hart's behalf in his match with Goldberg, causing Hart to win the vacant WCW World Heavyweight Championship. After Goldberg accidentally injured himself breaking the nWo's limousine windshield, Sid Vicious, Chris Benoit and Terry Funk were left to feud with the nWo. Scott Steiner returned and rejoined the group after attacking Vicious. He later would be accompanied by Midajah to the ring. The Harris Brothers acted as the nWo's bodyguards before joining the group themselves. As nWo members, The Harris brothers would become WCW Tag Team Champions twice. Hart was forced to vacate the WCW World Heavyweight Championship and went on hiatus from WCW in mid January due to an injury suffered in a match with Goldberg at WCW Starrcade 1999. At the following pay- per view Souled Out, Nash defeated Funk to become WCW commissioner, but his reign was cut short after he suffered a broken ankle and had to withdraw from WCW for a while. Jarrett won a title shot facing new WCW World Heavyweight Champion Sid Vicious at SuperBrawl 2000. However, Jarrett also feuded with fellow nWo member Scott Hall after Hall attempted to defeat Vicious and win the title himself. The match at Superbrawl was changed to a triple threat match between Hall, Jarrett and Vicious. Vicious won the match and Hall left WCW for good. Jarrett faced Vicious for the title again at Uncensored but lost. With the return of Eric Bischoff and Vince Russo in April, the nWo completely dismantled and Jarrett, Steiner and the Harris brothers joined The New Blood while the returning Nash joined The Millionaire's Club.  World Wrestling Federation/World Wrestling Entertainment/WWE  Hogan making his entrance at WrestleMania X8 in March 2002, his first WrestleMania after nine years = Feud with Stone Cold Steve Austin and The Rock = After the WWF bought the WCW video library and trademarks in 2001, Vince McMahon brought in Hogan, Hall and Nash, the original nWo, at No Way Out as hired thugs in an attempt to \\"kill\\" the WWF so that McMahon would not have to share power with new WWF kayfabe co-owner Ric Flair. They began by targeting the company's two biggest stars, Stone Cold Steve Austin and The Rock. This rivalry led up to Scott Hall going against Stone Cold and Hogan going against The Rock at WrestleMania X8 (in matches which the nWo both lost). As a result of Hogan shaking hands with The Rock and getting a positive response from the crowd after his match at WrestleMania, he turned face and began feuding with Hall and Nash, with The Rock and Kane at his side on occasion. Hall and Nash then brought in former nWo member X-Pac on the March 21, 2002 episode of SmackDown! in Ottawa, Ontario. On March 25, the nWo (now consisting of Kevin Nash, Scott Hall and X-Pac) was drafted by Ric Flair to the Raw brand despite rivaling against them. For the next two weeks, the nWo feuded with Kane until he was lured backstage by X-Pac and was put out of action by having his head smashed with a chair. Following this, Kevin Nash was suspended for attacking Kane in story-line to recover on his injured biceps. X-Pac would begin wearing Kane's mask, taunting him on the fact that he put him out of action. Bradshaw, who had come to Kane's aid, fought Scott Hall at Backlash, which Hall won with help from X-Pac. Big Show rejoined the nWo on the April 22 episode of Raw when Flair teamed him up with Austin, whom Big Show chokeslammed. The nWo was shortly joined by Ric Flair when he attacked Stone Cold Steve Austin with a chair and Hall was ejected out of the group and fired from Raw for \\"repeatedly dropping the ball\\" on Austin. In actuality, Hall had asked for his release for personal reasons. Lacking members, Ric Flair would recruit Booker T and continued his feud with Austin. Austin defeated Big Show and Flair in a Handicap match at Judgment Day. Booker T now in the group, his sidekick Goldust attempted and failed many times to get in, with the rest of the members (X-Pac and Big Show) becoming frustrated at Booker. With Nash returning and attempting to rebuild the nWo, he brought Shawn Michaels into the faction on the June 3 episode of Raw. Michaels then literally \\"kicked\\" Booker out of the nWo a week later. Michaels, then in the midst of a four-year retirement from professional wrestling, became the first nWo member who had never wrestled in WCW. Michaels and Nash then would set their sights on recruiting Triple H (by using threats and demands) into the nWo, implying that they would re-create on-screen their old backstage group The Kliq. This storyline was never finished. On July 8, Nash returned to action on Raw, teaming up with Eddie Guerrero, X-Pac, Big Show, and Chris Benoit to take on Booker T, Goldust, Bubba Ray Dudley, Spike Dudley, and Rob Van Dam. Seconds after tagging in for the first time, Nash tore his quadriceps after delivering a big boot onto Booker T, immediately putting him back on the injured list. On the following Raw on July 15, Vince McMahon came out to the ring to the entrance of the nWo and made the announcement that the group was officially disbanded as Eric Bischoff became Raw General Manager. Afterwards, the nWo storyline was stopped and the remaining members drifted apart. Michaels returned to active competition within weeks, Big Show was eventually traded to the SmackDown! brand and X-Pac was released from his contract. = Sporadic appearances = The nWo making their way to the ring at WrestleMania 31 On the August 11, 2014 episode of Raw, which aired on Hulk Hogan's 61st birthday, featured Scott Hall and Kevin Nash as guests. The two shared a moment with Hogan, revealing an nWo shirt hidden under his \\"Hulk Rules\\" shirt. They were interrupted by Brock Lesnar, who told Hogan, \\"Party's over, grandpa\\". Lesnar backed out of the ring when confronted by John Cena, his opponent at SummerSlam. On the January 19, 2015 episode of Raw, X-Pac (who had joined as Syxx in WCW), Scott Hall, and Kevin Nash came out for a survey segment. They were interrupted by The Ascension, who were beaten down by the nWo, The APA, and The New Age Outlaws. On March 29 at WrestleMania 31, Hogan, Nash, and Hall returned to assist their long-time rival Sting in his WrestleMania debut match against Triple H. The nWo helped to fight off D-Generation X (X-Pac, Billy Gunn and Road Dogg), who had interfered on behalf of Triple H. Shawn Michaels later joined Triple H's side, turning the match in his favor, and Triple H would go on to win the match. On April 7 at WrestleMania 35, Nash and Hall appeared as doctors during a backstage segment with Alexa Bliss, Michael Che, and Colin Jost.  Outside WWE  nWo Japan made a one-night reunion on January 5, 2017, when Scott Norton, Hiroyoshi Tenzan, Satoshi Kojima, and Hiro Saito teamed up with Cheeseburger to defeat Bullet Club (Bad Luck Fale, Kenny Omega, Tama Tonga, Tanga Loa, and Bone Soldier) in a ten-man tag team match. The nWo appeared in a Heavy on Wrestling (HOW) show on August 18, 2018 during a match between X-Pac and Arik Cannon vs. Darin Corbin and Ryan Cruz. Near the end of the match, Scott Hall and Kevin Nash inducted Cannon as a first new member of the nWo in nearly a decade with Eric Bischoff appearing at the event. On October 19, 2018, the nWo (Buff Bagwell, Scott Norton and X-Pac) competed against the No New Friends at the Glory Pro Wrestling #Unsanctioned event. The original nWo (Hall, Hogan and Nash) reunited in the 2Sweet nWo Reunion Tour in Orlando on October 27, 2018. In Uncasville, Connecticut, the NWO held its reunion show at the Mohegan Sun Arena on March 2, 2019.https://wwfoldschool.com/two-more-nwo-members-announced-for-nwo-reunion- show/  Legacy  In 1997, the nWo had their own pay-per-view called Souled Out. It was practice for WCW events to have co-brand naming (see WCW/nWo Starrcade) from January 24, 1998 to March 14, 1999. The WCW World Heavyweight Championship occasionally received this co-branding as well, particularly in ring introductions performed by Michael Buffer. The nWo has inspired many parody factions like Stevie Richards' bWo, Eddie Guerrero's lWo and the dMp (for Demon Making Plant) in the Japanese manga Kinnikuman. During his time in Juggalo Championship Wrestling (JCW), Hall, along with Corporal Robinson and the Insane Clown Posse formed the Juggalo World Order at JCW's Evansville Invasion on October 6, 2007. To date, fellow nWo alumni Sean Waltman and Kevin Nash have joined this faction for occasional matches. The nWo had major crossover appeal in its heyday. Football teams such as the New York Jets and the Jacksonville Jaguars were selling jWo (Jets World Order and Jaguar World Order respectively) shirts at NFL games in 1998. In that same year, Sin City Productions released a pornographic film called Nude World Order. When Hulk Hogan joined Total Nonstop Action Wrestling in January 2010, Hall, Nash and Waltman (all of whom had been with the company previously) began to appear as The Band, a group whose name was a reference to the 2000 incarnation of the nWo's \\"the band is back together\\" slogan. The group used a version of the Wolfpac theme as its entrance music. It disbanded within the year. Current New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) and Ring of Honor (ROH) stable Bullet Club takes some of its gestures from the nWo like the \\"too sweet\\" hand gesture and have been considered the stable that most closely resembles the nWo since its inception. The nWo logo has even made an appearance in college football. When Jacob Peeler was hired as receivers coach at the University of Mississippi (also known as Ole Miss) before the 2017 season, he sought an identity for his group and came up with \\"Nasty Wide Outs\\", creating a wrestling-style championship belt with the original nWo logo affixed to it. Ever since, the Ole Miss nWo belt has been displayed on the sidelines by every receiver who has caught a touchdown pass and awarded after each game to a receiver seen by Peeler as deserving of the title belt. On December 9, 2019, WWE announced that the nWo, consisting of Hogan, Hall, Nash, and Waltman, would be inductees into the WWE Hall of Fame Class of 2020. On the January 29, 2020 edition of Chris Jericho's podcast Talk Is Jericho, Scott Hall stated that he felt Eric Bischoff should also be inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame as a member of the NWO.https://omny.fm/shows/talk-is-jericho/rise-fall-of-the-nwo-the-most- successful-faction-o Jericho agreed, noting Bischoff's vital on-and-off screen role with the group, and suggested that he was not being inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame as an NWO member was due to ongoing \\"residual heat\\".

The phrase theme song or signature tune may also be used to refer to a list of signature songs that has become especially associated with a particular performer or dignitary, often used as they make an entrance. The purpose of a theme song is often similar to that of a leitmotif. Such songs can also be used in other ways. One author has made extensive use of them in an effort to explore the feelings behind worldview. Purpose The purpose of the music is to establish a mood for the show and to provide an audible cue that a particular show is beginning, which was especially useful in the early days of radio (See also interval signal). In some cases, including The Brady Bunch, Gilligan's Island, The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, both versions of Land of the Lost (1974 and 1991), The Nanny and The Beverly Hillbillies the lyrics of the theme song provide some necessary exposition for people unfamiliar with the show. In addition, some theme music uses orchestral scores or original music to set the mood for the show, such as the Batman: The Animated Series theme song, which was drawn from the theme for the 1989 Batman film created by Danny Elfman and sets the mood for the cartoon. Another example is Ron Grainer's Doctor Who theme music. Other shows use remixes or cover version of older songs, such as the theme song of Spider- Man (1994 TV series) (1994‚Äì1998), which featured a reworked cover of the theme song from the classic Spider-Man cartoon from the 1960s. The song was performed by Aerosmith lead guitarist Joe Perry. Celebrities In the early years of radio and television, celebrities often had a signature song associated with them that became their theme music. Such music would be played when a celebrity was about to appear, often played by a band if the celebrity were appearing on the talk show. For example, Bob Hope's theme song, which almost always preceded his appearance, was \\"Thanks for the Memory\\". In another example, Lucille Ball's theme music was \\"Hey, Look Me Over\\". Other celebrities will have the theme music played for their most notable role; for example, playing the theme from Indiana Jones when Harrison Ford is the guest. The practice of playing specific theme music for a celebrity extends to modern-day television talk shows. If a talk show guest doesn't have theme music, the band will sometimes provide them one, which can often involve surreptitious messages from the band about the celebrity. For example, when politician Michele Bachmann appeared on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon during her campaign for president, the all-black house band The Roots played the song Lyin' Ass Bitch, as the band supported opposing candidate Barack Obama. This controversy led to Fallon allegedly placing the band on \\"probation\\" for such rudeness, although no punishment or upbraiding of the band was demonstrated to the public. Television Theme music has been a feature of the majority of television programs since the medium's inception, as it was for the ancestral radio shows that provided their inspiration. Programs have used theme music in a large variety of styles, sometimes adapted from existing tunes, and with some composed specifically for the purpose. A few have been released commercially and become popular hits; examples include the title theme from Rawhide, performed and recorded by popular singer Frankie Laine; the theme to Happy Days (from 1974‚Äì84), performed by Pratt & McClain (in Top 5, 1976); the theme to Laverne & Shirley, performed by Cyndi Grecco (#25, 1976); the theme to Friends, \\"I'll Be There For You\\", which was a hit for The Rembrandts; the theme from S.W.A.T., which was a hit for Rhythm Heritage, the theme song from Pok√©mon (known as \\"Pok√©mon Theme\\" in the Pok√©mon 2.B.A. Master soundtrack), which is a long time hit for Jason Paige, and the theme song from Drake & Josh, \\"Found a Way\\", which was a hit for Drake Bell. The theme song from iCarly, \\"Leave It All To Me\\", was a hit for Miranda Cosgrove and features her Drake & Josh co-star Drake Bell, hitting number 100 on the Billboard Hot 100. Jan Hammer had a major hit with the theme from Miami Vice in the 1980s. \\"Theme From Dr. Kildare (Three Stars Will Shine Tonight)\\", recorded by Richard Chamberlain, the star of the television series, was in 1962 a top 10 hit in the U.S. and a top 20 in the UK and \\"Theme from The Greatest American Hero (Believe It or Not)\\", from The Greatest American Hero, a #2 hit for Joey Scarbury in 1981. The theme to the anime Baka and Test, \\"Perfect-area Complete!\\" was a hit for Natsuko Aso, peaking at number 18 on the Oricon Singles Chart. Other themes, like the music for The Young and the Restless, Days of Our Lives, and Coronation Street have become iconic mostly due to the shows' respective longevities. Unlike others, these serials have not strayed from the original theme mix much, if at all, allowing them to be known by multiple generations of television viewers. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, iconic sports shows have such strong associations with their theme music that the sports themselves are synonymous with the theme tunes, such as association football (the Match of the Day, Grandstand and The Big Match theme tunes), cricket (\\"Soul Limbo\\" by Booker T. & the M.G.'s, \\"Soul Limbo\\"), motorsport (Roger Barsotti's Motor Sport and the bassline from Fleetwood Mac's \\"The Chain\\"), tennis (Keith Mansfield's \\"Light and Tuneful\\"), snooker (\\"Drag Racer\\" by the Doug Wood Band), skiing (\\"Pop Goes Bach\\", the theme to Ski Sunday) and gaelic games (\\"J√§gerlatein\\" by James Last). Themes in the United States that have become associated with a sport include Johnny Pearson's \\"Heavy Action\\" (used for many years as an intro to Monday Night Football), \\"Roundball Rock\\" (composed by John Tesh as the theme for the NBA on NBC during the 1990s and early 2000s, and for college basketball on Fox (from 2018‚Äì19 to present) and Jr. NBA Championships (2019‚Äìpresent), \\"Bugler's Dream\\" (used in ABC and NBC's coverage of the Olympic Games) and the theme to ESPN's sports highlight show, SportsCenter. A notable theme that was once associated with a sport, but because of its popularity, spread network-wide was the NFL on Fox theme, which is now used for MLB on Fox (2010‚Äìpresent) and NASCAR on Fox (2011‚Äì2015) and Fox UFC (2012‚Äì2018) and PBC on Fox (December 2018 to July/August 2019) and Jr. NBA Championships (unknown-2018) broadcasts, and is regarded as the network's single theme by October 2010. CBS's longtime March Madness theme is considered one of the masterpieces of Americans sports theme music, said to deliver a euphoric feeling to many sports fans. In Canada, the soaring backbeats of the Hockey Night in Canada theme, \\"The Hockey Theme\\", became so iconic that the piece was sometimes called Canada's second national anthem. It became something of a national scandal when broadcaster CBC Television lost the rights to use the theme in 2008. Most television shows have specific, melodic theme music, even if just a few notes (such as the clip of music that fades in and out in the title sequence for Lost, or the pulsing sound of helicopter blades in the theme music for Airwolf). One exception is 60 Minutes, which features only the ticking hand of a TAG Heuer stopwatch. Another recent exception is Body of Proof which has no theme song, and barely even has a title sequence. In most television series, the theme song is played during the opening sequence. One exception to this rule is Regular Show, the theme music of which is played only during its ending credits in most episodes. In lieu of its theme music, its opening sequence instead features a tone played on a synthesizer overlaid with a ticking sound effect. Remixes Notable is the Law & Order series, which started out with one theme song for Law & Order, and remixed it for its four spinoffs (Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, Law & Order: Criminal Intent, Law & Order: Trial by Jury and Law & Order: LA). The related shows Crime & Punishment, New York Undercover. Arrest & Trial and Stars Earn Stripes also aired with a remix of the theme. CSI: NY uses the first strophe of \\"Baba O'Riley\\" for its opening sequence, but with a remixed version of the instrumental track. Radio Radio programs with notable theme music include Just a Minute, which uses a high-speed rendition of the Minute Waltz by Fr√©d√©ric Chopin; The Archers, which has Barwick Green; Desert Island Discs which has By the Sleepy Lagoon, and The Rush Limbaugh Show, which uses the instrumental from \\"My City Was Gone.\\" In talk radio, a different theme song is often used to introduce each segment, and the music (usually popular music of some sort) will often relate to the topic being discussed. John Batchelor is noted for his use of highly dramatic orchestral scores leading in and out of each segment of his weekly show. Video games Many video games feature a theme song that is distinctive to the series. A popular one to date is the \\"Prelude Theme\\" from the Final Fantasy series, which is played on most, if not all, of the title screens of the original games, most notably Final Fantasy I to Final Fantasy IV. The newer ones also feature the theme, albeit usually modernized, and played during the ending credits.

Design and development Fieseler F2 Tiger photo L'Aerophile November 1933 Gerhard Fieseler started his own company in 1930 in the former Segelflugzeugbau company at Kassel, Germany. Fieseler was a World War I German fighter ace with almost 20 kills to his credit, and became a world class competition aerobatic pilot. To compete in International competitions Fieseler designed and built the Fieseler F2 Tiger single-seat biplane, powered by a 450 hp Walter Pollux II air-cooled 9-cylinder radial. The 1934 World Aerobatics Competition, held in Paris, was the first of its kind, and, despite the deaths of two pilots and a few crashes, the competition continued and Fieseler won, although he went over the time limit due to a loose harness, beating his nearest competitor, Michel Detroyat of France (who flew an M.S.225), by 23 points (645.2 to 622.9). Fieseler retired from the sport with his victory. The F2 Tiger itself would form the basis for later aircraft, including the Fieseler F5.

Innings also means the period in which an individual player bats (acts as either striker or nonstriker). Innings, in cricket, and rounders, is both singular and plural; this contrasts with baseball and softball in which the singular is \\"inning\\". Origin The earliest known record of the term concerns a match on Wednesday, 5 August 1730 at Blackheath, Kent between Kent and London. The London-based newspaper St. James Evening Post reported on Saturday, 8 August: \\"'Twas thought that the Kentish champions would have lost their honours by being beat at one innings if time had permitted\\". This is the first time that the word \\"innings\\" is found in contemporary records. Incidentally, it is also the first time that the word \\"champions\\" is found in a team sense, which is significant because it confirms that the idea of a champion county was already well established among cricket's followers. Furthermore, the match was apparently drawn and is the earliest known instance of this result.Buckley, p. 4.Maun, p. 130. Usage in cricket An innings is one of the divisions of a match during which one team takes its turn to bat, and is said to be \\"in to bathttp://www.reading.ac.uk/web/files/economics/emdp202010.pdf\\". Innings is the subject of Law 13 in the Laws of Cricket. * In a first-class match, there are up to four innings with each team due to bat twice (in practice, this is not always the case). In a limited overs match, there are only two innings with each team batting once. * End of an innings describes how an innings can be completed. The term is also used with the meaning of \\"score\\" for both the team and each individual batsman. For example, it may be said that \\"he played an innings of 101\\", meaning that the player scored 101 runs in his innings (while batting during the team's innings). Similarly, it may be said that the team had a first innings (score) of 501. Metaphor The term can generally be taken as a reference to the time during which someone possesses something and, colloquially, the phrase \\"a good innings\\" means a long life.Chambers, p. 768.Oxford, p. 733.

In base 10, 666 is a repdigit (and therefore a palindromic number) and a Smith number. A prime reciprocal magic square based on 1/149 in base 10 has a magic total of 666. The prime factorization of 666 is 2 ‚Ä¢ 32 ‚Ä¢ 37.

In religion = Number of the Beast  666 is often associated with the devil. In the Textus Receptus manuscripts of the New Testament, the Book of Revelation () cryptically asserts 666 to be \\"man's number\\" or \\"the number of a man\\" (depending on how the text is translated) associated with the Beast, an antagonistic creature that appears briefly about two-thirds into the apocalyptic vision. Some manuscripts of the original Greek use the symbols œáŒæœõ chi xi stigma (or œáŒæœù with a digamma), while other manuscripts spell out the number in words. In modern popular culture, 666 has become one of the most widely recognized symbols for the Antichrist or, alternatively, the devil. The number 666 is purportedly used to invoke Satan. Earnest references to the number occur both among apocalypticist Christian groups and in explicitly anti-Christian subcultures. References in contemporary Western art or literature are, more likely than not, intentional references to the Beast symbolism. Such popular references are therefore too numerous to list. It is common to see the symbolic role of the integer 666 transferred to the digit sequence 6-6-6. Some people take the Satanic associations of 666 so seriously that they actively avoid things related to 666 or the digits 6-6-6. This is known as hexakosioihexekontahexaphobia. The Number of the Beast is cited as 616 in some early biblical manuscripts, the earliest known instance being in Papyrus 115.Novum Testamentum Graece, Nestle and Aland, 1991, footnote to verse 13:18 of Revelation, page 659: \\"\\" as found in C [C=Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus]; for English see Metzger's Textual Commentary on the Greek New Testament, note on verse 13:18 of Revelation, page 750: \\"the numeral 616 was also read ...\\"The Other Number of the Beast  Other occurrences  * In the Bible, 666 is the number of talents of gold Solomon collected each year (see and ). * In the Bible, 666 is the number of Adonikam's descendants who return to Jerusalem and Judah from the Babylonian exile (see ). * Using gematria, Neron Caesar transliterated from Greek into Hebrew produces the number 666.

Addition polymerization differs from condensation polymerization, which does co-generate a product, usually water.Introduction to Polymers 1987 R.J. Young Chapman & Hall Addition polymers can be formed by chain polymerization, when the polymer is formed by the sequential addition of monomer units to an active site in a chain reaction, or by polyaddition, when the polymer is formed by addition reactions between species of all degrees of polymerization. Addition polymers are formed by the addition of some simple monomer units repeatedly. Generally polymers are unsaturated compounds like alkenes, alkalines etc. The addition polymerization mainly takes place in free radical mechanism. The free radical mechanism of addition polymerization completed by three steps i.e. Initiation of free radical, Chain propagation, Termination of chain.  Polyolefins  Many common addition polymers are formed from unsaturated monomers (usually having a C=C double bond). The most prevalent addition polymers are polyolefins, i.e. polymers derived by the conversion of olefins (alkenes) to long-chain alkanes. The stoichiometry is simple: :n RCH=CH2 ‚Üí [RCH-CH2]n This conversion can be induced by a variety of catalysts including free radicals, acids, carbanions and metal complexes. Examples of such polyolefins are polyethenes, polypropylene, PVC, Teflon, Buna rubbers, polyacrylates, polystyrene, and PCTFE. Copolymers When two or more types of monomers undergo addition polymerization, the resulting polymer is an addition copolymer. Saran wrap, formed from polymerization of vinyl chloride and vinylidene chloride, is an addition copolymer. Ring-opening polymerization Ring-opening polymerization is an additive process but tends to give condensation-like polymers but follows the stoichiometry of addition polymerization. For example, polyethylene glycol is formed by opening ethylene oxide rings: :HOCH2CH2OH + n C2H4O ‚Üí HO(CH2CH2O)n+1H Nylon 6 (developed to thwart the patent on nylon 6,6) is produced by addition polymerization, but chemically resembles typical polyamides. Further contrasts with condensation polymers One universal distinction between polymerization types is development of molecular weight by the different modes of propagation. Addition polymers form high molecular weight chains rapidly, with much monomer remaining. Since addition polymerization has rapidly growing chains and free monomer as its reactants, and condensation polymerization occurs in step-wise fashion between monomers, dimers, and other smaller growing chains, the effect of a polymer molecule's current size on a continuing reaction is profoundly different in these two cases. This has important effects on the distribution of molecular weights, or polydispersity, in the finished polymer.  Biodegradation  Addition polymers are generally chemically inert, involving strong C-C bonds. For this reason they are non-biodegradable and difficult to recycle. In contrast, condensation polymers tend to be more readily bio- degradable because their backbones contain weaker bonds.  History  The first useful addition polymer was made by accident in 1933 by ICI chemists Reginald Gibson and Eric Fawcett. They were carrying out a series of experiments that involved reacting organic compounds under high temperatures and high pressures. They set up an experiment to react ethene with benzaldehyde in the hope of producing a ketone. They left the reaction vessel overnight, and the next morning they found a small amount of a white waxy solid. It was shown later that this solid was polyethylene. The term \\"addition polymerization\\" is deprecated by IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry) which recommends the alternative term chain polymerization.

Hull No. 234; launched 4 April 1942; sponsored by Mrs. G. H. Hasselman, Tongue Point, Oregon; acquired by the Navy 1 May, towed to the Puget Sound Navy Yard, Bremerton, Washington, and converted to an escort carrier; and commissioned 20 August, Captain Austin K. Doyle in command. Nassau was one of thirty-seven Tacoma-built C3 CVEs, of which twenty-six went to the Royal Navy. It was one of the ten s that served in the U.S. Navy. Service history On 10 October, Nassau arrived at the Naval Air Station, Alameda, California, loaded aircraft, and four days later steamed for Pearl Harbor, thence to Palmyra Island, arriving 30 October. For the next four months, she operated between Palmyra and Noum√©a, New Caledonia and Espiritu Santo, New Hebrides. Nassau returned to Pearl Harbor 14 February 1943, embarked personnel and aircraft, and sailed 21 February on a ferry mission to Espiritu Santo. She returned to Pearl Harbor in mid-March and then continued on to Alameda, California. In April, she moved to San Diego and conducted flight training operations, after which she rendezvoused with Task Group 51.1 and steamed for Cold Bay, Alaska with Composite Squadron 21 (VC-21) embarked. Nassau got underway on a search mission 4 May and conducted flight operations with Task Force 51, providing air cover for the occupation of Attu Island from 11 May through 20 May. She returned to San Diego in late May, arrived at Alameda 8 June and onloaded 45 aircraft destined for Brisbane, Australia. She delivered the aircraft 2 July and returned to San Diego via Noum√©a, New Caledonia. In August, she trained off San Diego before ferrying planes to Samoa. Returning to San Diego from Samoa, 19 October, Nassau embarked Marine Fighter Squadron 225 (VMF-225) for passage to Pearl Harbor. Arriving 30 October, she conducted air operations off Pearl Harbor during the early days of November and on 7 November, she embarked Fighter Squadron 7 (VF-1) and steamed for the Gilbert Islands for operations with Task Force 52. Nassaus mission was to transport VF-1 to Tarawa and to send it ashore as soon as facilities were available. The invasion of Tarawa commenced 20 November but encountered bitter resistance. As a result, VF-1 was assigned combat air patrol and flew bombing and strafing runs from the carrier in support of the assault troops. The squadron flew a total of 106 missions and spent 237 hours of flying time in four days of operations without losing a single plane or pilot. Nassau returned to Pearl Harbor on 5 December following flight operations. She then sailed to the Marshall Islands with Task Group 51.2 and launched strikes 29 January 1944 against Taroa Field on Maloelap Atoll. The next day, the Task Group centered its operations around Kwajalein, Wotje, and Maloelap Atolls, with Nassau conducting both anti-submarine and combat air patrols. Nassau returned to Pearl Harbor 3 March, disembarked VC-66, and took on aircraft, cargo, and passengers for ferry to the Marshall Islands. Throughout March, ferry missions were performed between Kwajalein, Majuro, and Pearl Harbor. After repairs and alterations at Mare Island Navy Yard, the carrier sailed with 51 aircraft for Finschhafen, New Guinea 5 May. The next four months she performed ferry missions from San Diego to Pearl Harbor, the Admiralties and the New Hebrides Islands. Upon arrival at Seeadler Harbor 1 September, Nassau reported to Commander Task Group 30.8. Thus began her tour of duty with Admiral Halsey's 3rd Fleet, which made unprecedented naval history in the following months. Nassau's mission was to operate out of the Admiralties with other escort carriers to provide replacement aircraft and pilots for the attack carriers of Task Force 38. Steaming in company with the oiler groups, which refueled the ships of the Task Force at sea, Nassau made three cruises into the western Pacific. She returned to the Admiralties with disabled aircraft which were destined for shipment to Pearl Harbor or the United States for reconditioning. The first of these replacement trips was in support of the strikes against Palau; the second in support of operations against the southern and central Philippines. Then Task Force 38 shifted to more northerly targets in the Philippines and Formosa. Nassau reached Manus on 20 October. After offloading old aircraft and taking on new ones, she departed on her last replacement trip. Steaming to Ulithi Atoll in the Caroline Islands, she joined up with Task Groups 38.1 and 38.3 on 28 October and transferred 70 aircraft and 43 pilots to the attack carriers. Task Unit 12.6.1, composed of Nassau, and four other ships steamed for Pearl Harbor 5 November, arriving 16 November. Two days later, Nassau was dispatched to San Diego. Among her passengers were 382 survivors of , which was sunk in the Battle of Leyte Gulf, 24 October 1944. Another ferry mission to Pearl Harbor followed in mid-November, with three more runs to Guam in December, January 1945, and February. Nassau returned to Alameda, California, 23 March and through the remainder of the war, performed transport and ferry missions between Alameda, Pearl Harbor, Guam, Manus, Samar and Saipan. Nassau departed Alameda 13 May 1946 for Tacoma, Washington. On 28 October, she decommissioned and entered the Pacific Reserve Fleet. Designated for modification for aircraft transportation purposes, her classification was changed to CVHE-16, 12 June 1955. Shortly thereafter she transferred to the Bremerton Reserve Group, and was struck from the Navy Register, 1 March 1959. In June 1961, she was towed to Japan for scrapping. Awards Nassau received five battle stars for World War II service.

Hayes strolls off with the prize of the \\"Solid South\\" personified as a woman. The caption quotes Goethe's Faust: \\"Unto that Power he doth belong Which only doeth Right while ever willing Wrong.\\" The Compromise of 1877 was an unwritten deal, informally arranged among U.S. Congressmen, that settled the intensely disputed 1876 presidential election. It resulted in the United States federal government pulling the last troops out of the South, and formally ending the Reconstruction Era. Through the Compromise, Republican Rutherford B. Hayes was awarded the White House over Democrat Samuel J. Tilden on the understanding that Hayes would remove the federal troops whose support was essential for the survival of Republican state governments in South Carolina, Florida and Louisiana. The compromise involved Democrats who controlled the House of Representatives allowing the decision of the Electoral Commission to take effect. The outgoing president, Republican Ulysses S. Grant, removed the soldiers from Florida. As president, Hayes removed the remaining troops from South Carolina and Louisiana. As soon as the troops left, many white Republican carpetbaggers also left, and the \\"Redeemer\\" Democrats took control. They already dominated other state governments in the South. The exact terms of the agreement are somewhat contested as the documentation is insufficient.Michael Les Benedict, \\"Southern Democrats in the Crisis of 1876-1877: A Reconsideration of Reunion and Reaction.\\" Journal of Southern History (1980): 489-524. in JSTOR Black Republicans felt betrayed as they lost power and were subject to discrimination and harassment to suppress their voting. By 1905, nearly all black men were effectively disenfranchised by state legislatures in every Southern state. Terms of compromise The compromise essentially stated that Southern Democrats would acknowledge Hayes as president, but only on the understanding that Republicans would meet certain demands. The following elements are generally said to be the points of the compromise: # The removal of all remaining U.S. military forces from the former Confederate states. At the time, U.S. troops remained only in Louisiana, South Carolina, and Florida, but the Compromise completed their withdrawal from the region. # The appointment of at least one Southern Democrat to Hayes' cabinet. (David M. Key of Tennessee was appointed as Postmaster General.) # The construction of another transcontinental railroad using the Texas and Pacific in the South (this had been part of the \\"Scott Plan\\", proposed by Thomas A. Scott of the Pennsylvania Railroad; he had initiated negotiations resulting in the final compromise). # Legislation to help industrialize the South and restore its economy following Reconstruction and the Civil War. #The right to deal with blacks without northern interference. In exchange, Democrats would accept Republican Hayes as president by not employing the filibuster during the joint session of Congress needed to confirm the election. Results After the Compromise, a few Democrats complained loudly that Tilden had been cheated. There was talk of forming armed units that would march on Washington, but President Grant was ready for that. He tightened military security, and nobody marched on Washington.Downs, 2012 Hayes was peacefully inaugurated. Points 1 and 2 of the compromise took effect. Hayes had already announced his support for the restoration of \\"home rule\\", which would involve federal troop removal, before the election. It was not unusual, nor unexpected, for a president, especially one so narrowly elected, to select a cabinet member favored by the other party. Points 3 and 4 were never enacted; it is possible there was no firm agreement about them. Whether by informal deal or simply reassurances already in line with Hayes's announced plans, talks with Southern Democrats satisfied the worries of many. This prevented a Congressional filibuster that had threatened to extend resolution of the election dispute beyond Inauguration Day 1877. Interpretations Historian C. Vann Woodward wrote in 1951 that emerging business and industry interests of the New South found common ground with Republican businessmen, particularly with the railroads. They met secretly at Wormley's Hotel in Washington to forge a compromise with aid to internal improvements: bridges, canals and railroads wanted by the South. However, Peskin notes that no serious federal effort was made after Hayes took office to fund a railroad or provide other federal aid for improvements. An opposing interest group representing the Southern Pacific actually thwarted Scott's proposed Texas and Pacific scheme, and ultimately ran its own line to New Orleans. Some historians, such as Allan Peskin, argue that the assurances offered to some Southern Democrats to prevent a filibuster were not a compromise but a foregone conclusion, as Tilden did not command sufficient support.Allan Peskin, \\"Was There a Compromise of 1877?\\", The Journal of American History Vol. 60, No. 1 (June 1973), pp. 63‚Äì75, via JSTOR Peskin admits that Woodward's interpretation had become almost universally accepted in the nearly quarter century since he had published it. As not all terms of the agreement were met, Peskin believes there was really no deal between the North and South in 1877. He also suggests that Northern Democrats were more significant in quashing the filibuster than those from the South. For instance, Samuel J. Randall (D-Pennsylvania) was Speaker of the House and prevented the filibuster. He was more interested in ensuring that the Radical state government in Louisiana was abandoned than in any southern railroad. Vincent DeSantis argues that the Republican Party abandoned Southern blacks to the rule of the racist whig Party in order to gain the support of Democrats for Hayes' presidency.Vincent P. DeSantis, \\"Rutherford B. Hayes and the Removal of the Troops and the End of Reconstruction\\", in J. Morgan Kousser and James M. McPherson, eds., Region, Race, and Reconstruction: Essays in Honor of C. Van Woodward (New York, 1982), 417‚Äì450 In any case, Reconstruction ended. The dominance of the Democratic Party in the South was cemented with the ascent of the \\"Redeemer\\" governments that displaced the Republican governments. After 1877, support for white supremacy generally caused whites to vote for Democrats and the region became known as the \\"Solid South\\". Until the end of the 19th century, black Republicans continued to elect numerous candidates to local office, although Democrats controlled most state representative and statewide seats, except for a brief period of fusion governments supported by Republicans and Populists. The majority of white voters supported national Democratic candidates well into the 20th century before shifting to the Republican Party. This later shift to the Republican party followed the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which was introduced by Democratic President Lyndon B. Johnson and supported by most Republicans and northern Democrats. In The Mexicanization of American Politics: The United States' Transnational Path from Civil War to Stabilization (2012), Gregory P. Downs rejects the idea that this was an era of easy reconciliation and political stability. Instead he shows many Americans feared \\"Mexicanization\\" of politics, whereby force would be used to settle a presidential election, as force had been used to settle certain state elections in the South. Downs explores how Mexicanization was roundly rejected and stability was achieved. Whatever deals may or may not have taken place on the side, in formal legal terms, the election of 1876 was not decided by such acts, but by the official vote of Congress to accept the recommendations of the Electoral Commission they themselves had set up as a way out of the election impasse. The expectation in setting up the committee had been that its decisions would be accepted by Congress. It was only when certain Democrats disagreed with the commission's decisions in favor of Hayes that this arrangement was jeopardized. This Democratic group threatened a filibuster (opposed by Republicans and Congressional Democratic leadership as well) that would prevent the agreed-upon vote from taking place. Discussions of the points in the alleged compromise were related to persuading key Democrats against accepting a filibuster. The very threat of a filibuster‚Äîa measure used by a minority to prevent a vote‚Äîindicates that there were already sufficient votes for accepting the commission's recommendations.Michael Les Benedict, \\"Southern Democrats in the Crisis of 1876‚Äì1877: A Reconsideration of Reunion and Reaction\\".

Grayscale images, a kind of black-and-white or gray monochrome, are composed exclusively of shades of gray. The contrast ranges from black at the weakest intensity to white at the strongest. Grayscale images are distinct from one-bit bi-tonal black-and-white images, which, in the context of computer imaging, are images with only two colors: black and white (also called bilevel or binary images). Grayscale images have many shades of gray in between. Grayscale images can be the result of measuring the intensity of light at each pixel according to a particular weighted combination of frequencies (or wavelengths), and in such cases they are monochromatic proper when only a single frequency (in practice, a narrow band of frequencies) is captured. The frequencies can in principle be from anywhere in the electromagnetic spectrum (e.g. infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, etc.). A colorimetric (or more specifically photometric) grayscale image is an image that has a defined grayscale colorspace, which maps the stored numeric sample values to the achromatic channel of a standard colorspace, which itself is based on measured properties of human vision. If the original color image has no defined colorspace, or if the grayscale image is not intended to have the same human-perceived achromatic intensity as the color image, then there is no unique mapping from such a color image to a grayscale image.  Numerical representations  A sample grayscale image The intensity of a pixel is expressed within a given range between a minimum and a maximum, inclusive. This range is represented in an abstract way as a range from 0 (or 0%) (total absence, black) and 1 (or 100%) (total presence, white), with any fractional values in between. This notation is used in academic papers, but this does not define what \\"black\\" or \\"white\\" is in terms of colorimetry. Sometimes the scale is reversed, as in printing where the numeric intensity denotes how much ink is employed in halftoning, with 0% representing the paper white (no ink) and 100% being a solid black (full ink). In computing, although the grayscale can be computed through rational numbers, image pixels are usually quantized to store them as unsigned integers, to reduce the required storage and computation. Some early grayscale monitors can only display up to sixteen different shades, which would be stored in binary form using 4 bits. But today grayscale images (such as photographs) intended for visual display (both on screen and printed) are commonly stored with 8 bits per sampled pixel. This pixel depth allows 256 different intensities (i.e., shades of gray) to be recorded, and also simplifies computation as each pixel sample can be accessed individually as one full byte. However, if these intensities were spaced equally in proportion to the amount of physical light they represent at that pixel (called a linear encoding or scale), the differences between adjacent dark shades could be quite noticeable as banding artifacts, while many of the lighter shades would be \\"wasted\\" by encoding a lot of perceptually- indistinguishable increments. Therefore, the shades are instead typically spread out evenly on a gamma-compressed nonlinear scale, which better approximates uniform perceptual increments for both dark and light shades, usually making these 256 shades enough (just barely) to avoid noticeable increments. Technical uses (e.g. in medical imaging or remote sensing applications) often require more levels, to make full use of the sensor accuracy (typically 10 or 12 bits per sample) and to reduce rounding errors in computations. Sixteen bits per sample (65,536 levels) is often a convenient choice for such uses, as computers manage 16-bit words efficiently. The TIFF and PNG (among other) image file formats support 16-bit grayscale natively, although browsers and many imaging programs tend to ignore the low order 8 bits of each pixel. Internally for computation and working storage, image processing software typically uses integer or floating-point numbers of size 16 or 32 bits.  Converting color to grayscale  A color photo converted to grayscale Conversion of an arbitrary color image to grayscale is not unique in general; different weighting of the color channels effectively represent the effect of shooting black-and-white film with different-colored photographic filters on the cameras.  Colorimetric (perceptual luminance-preserving) conversion to grayscale  A common strategy is to use the principles of photometry or, more broadly, colorimetry to calculate the grayscale values (in the target grayscale colorspace) so as to have the same luminance (technically relative luminance) as the original color image (according to its colorspace).Poynton, Charles A. \\"Rehabilitation of gamma.\\" Photonics West'98 Electronic Imaging. International Society for Optics and Photonics, 1998. onlineCharles Poynton, Constant Luminance In addition to the same (relative) luminance, this method also ensures that both images will have the same absolute luminance when displayed, as can be measured by instruments in its SI units of candelas per square meter, in any given area of the image, given equal whitepoints. Luminance itself is defined using a standard model of human vision, so preserving the luminance in the grayscale image also preserves other perceptual lightness measures, such as (as in the 1976 CIE Lab color space) which is determined by the linear luminance itself (as in the CIE 1931 XYZ color space) which we will refer to here as to avoid any ambiguity. To convert a color from a colorspace based on a typical gamma-compressed (nonlinear) RGB color model to a grayscale representation of its luminance, the gamma compression function must first be removed via gamma expansion (linearization) to transform the image to a linear RGB colorspace, so that the appropriate weighted sum can be applied to the linear color components (R_\\\\mathrm{linear},G_\\\\mathrm{linear},B_\\\\mathrm{linear}) to calculate the linear luminance , which can then be gamma-compressed back again if the grayscale result is also to be encoded and stored in a typical nonlinear colorspace.Bruce Lindbloom, RGB Working Space Information (retrieved 2013-10-02) For the common sRGB color space, gamma expansion is defined as :C_\\\\mathrm{linear}= \\\\begin{cases}\\\\frac{C_\\\\mathrm{srgb}}{12.92}, & \\\\text{if } C_\\\\mathrm{srgb}\\\\le0.04045\\\\ \\\\left(\\\\frac{C_\\\\mathrm{srgb}+0.055}{1.055}\\\\right)^{2.4}, & \\\\text{otherwise} \\\\end{cases} where represents any of the three gamma-compressed sRGB primaries (, , and , each in range [0,1]) and is the corresponding linear-intensity value (, , and , also in range [0,1]). Then, linear luminance is calculated as a weighted sum of the three linear-intensity values. The sRGB color space is defined in terms of the CIE 1931 linear luminance , which is given by :Y_\\\\mathrm{linear} = 0.2126 R_\\\\mathrm{linear} + 0.7152 G_\\\\mathrm{linear} + 0.0722 B_\\\\mathrm{linear}.Michael Stokes, Matthew Anderson, Srinivasan Chandrasekar, and Ricardo Motta, \\"A Standard Default Color Space for the Internet ‚Äì sRGB\\", online see matrix at end of Part 2. These three particular coefficients represent the intensity (luminance) perception of typical trichromat humans to light of the precise Rec. 709 additive primary colors (chromaticities) that are used in the definition of sRGB. Human vision is most sensitive to green, so this has the greatest coefficient value (0.7152), and least sensitive to blue, so this has the smallest coefficient (0.0722). To encode grayscale intensity in linear RGB, each of the three color components can be set to equal the calculated linear luminance Y_\\\\mathrm{linear} (replacing R_\\\\mathrm{linear},G_\\\\mathrm{linear},B_\\\\mathrm{linear} by the values Y_\\\\mathrm{linear},Y_\\\\mathrm{linear},Y_\\\\mathrm{linear} to get this linear grayscale), which then typically needs to be gamma compressed to get back to a conventional non-linear representation. For sRGB, each of its three primaries is then set to the same gamma-compressed given by the inverse of the gamma expansion above as :Y_\\\\mathrm{srgb}=\\\\begin{cases} 12.92\\\\ Y_\\\\mathrm{linear}, & \\\\text{if } Y_\\\\mathrm{linear} \\\\le 0.0031308\\\\ 1.055\\\\ Y_\\\\mathrm{linear}^{1/2.4}-0.055, & \\\\text{otherwise} \\\\end{cases} Because the three sRGB components are then equal, indicating that it is actually a gray image (not color), it is only necessary to store these values once, and we call this the resulting grayscale image. This is how it will normally be stored in sRGB-compatible image formats that support a single-channel grayscale representation, such as JPEG or PNG. Web browsers and other software that recognizes sRGB images should produce the same rendering for such a grayscale image as it would for a \\"color\\" sRGB image having the same values in all three color channels.  Luma coding in video systems  For images in color spaces such as Y'UV and its relatives, which are used in standard color TV and video systems such as PAL, SECAM, and NTSC, a nonlinear luma component is calculated directly from gamma-compressed primary intensities as a weighted sum, which, although not a perfect representation of the colorimetric luminance, can be calculated more quickly without the gamma expansion and compression used in photometric/colorimetric calculations. In the Y'UV and Y'IQ models used by PAL and NTSC, the rec601 luma component is computed as :Y' = 0.299 R' + 0.587 G' + 0.114 B' where we use the prime to distinguish these nonlinear values from the sRGB nonlinear values (discussed above) which use a somewhat different gamma compression formula, and from the linear RGB components. The ITU-R BT.709 standard used for HDTV developed by the ATSC uses different color coefficients, computing the luma component as :Y' = 0.2126 R' + 0.7152 G' + 0.0722 B'. Although these are numerically the same coefficients used in sRGB above, the effect is different because here they are being applied directly to gamma-compressed values rather than to the linearized values. The ITU-R BT.2100 standard for HDR television uses yet different coefficients, computing the luma component as :Y' = 0.2627 R' + 0.6780 G' + 0.0593 B'. Normally these colorspaces are transformed back to nonlinear R'G'B' before rendering for viewing. To the extent that enough precision remains, they can then be rendered accurately. But if the luma component Y' itself is instead used directly as a grayscale representation of the color image, luminance is not preserved: two colors can have the same luma but different CIE linear luminance (and thus different nonlinear as defined above) and therefore appear darker or lighter to a typical human than the original color. Similarly, two colors having the same luminance (and thus the same ) will in general have different luma by either of the luma definitions above.Charles Poynton, The magnitude of nonconstant luminance errors in Charles Poynton, A Technical Introduction to Digital Video. New York: John WIley & Sons, 1996.  Grayscale as single channels of multichannel color images  Color images are often built of several stacked color channels, each of them representing value levels of the given channel. For example, RGB images are composed of three independent channels for red, green and blue primary color components; CMYK images have four channels for cyan, magenta, yellow and black ink plates, etc. Here is an example of color channel splitting of a full RGB color image. The column at left shows the isolated color channels in natural colors, while at right there are their grayscale equivalences: Composition of RGB from 3 Grayscale images The reverse is also possible: to build a full color image from their separate grayscale channels. By mangling channels, using offsets, rotating and other manipulations, artistic effects can be achieved instead of accurately reproducing the original image.  Grayscale modes  Some operating systems offer a grayscale mode. It may be bound to a hotkey or this could be programmable. It is also possible to install a grayscale mode extension in some browsers.

It flows south-southeast through the swamp. From Morrisville, it flows south past Eaton and is paralleled by the remnants of the old Chenango Canal from Randallsville, just south of Hamilton, to just north of Earlville where the old canal joined the river. Continuing south the Chenango is joined by the Sangerfield River, also known as the East Branch of the Chenango,1902 U.S.G.S. topographic map Morrisville 15' Quadrangle just south of Earlville. Then it flows south past Sherburne to Norwich, where it turns southwest. At Oxford it turns south, and at Warn Lake it again turns southwest.

West Okoboji Lake (sometimes known as West Lake Okoboji) is a natural body of water, approximately in area, in Dickinson County in northwest Iowa in the United States. It is part of the chain of lakes known as the Iowa Great Lakes. The area was long inhabited by the Santee or Dakota Sioux. The Dakota-language name for the lake was Minnetonka, meaning \\"great waters\\". The cities of Arnolds Park, Okoboji, West Okoboji, and Wahpeton sit on its shore. Okoboji was derived from the Dakota name for the lake, and Wahpeton was the name of one of the major historic Sioux bands in the nineteenth century. Today the Sisseton-Wahpeton Sioux are a federally recognized tribe.  Geography  The lake's maximum depth is , making it the deepest lake in Iowa and second in size only to Spirit Lake. The mean depth is . The drainage area of the lake is approximately .Site: 06604200, WY: 2007 Recreation The depth of the lake makes it a popular regional destination for motor boating, water skiing, sailing, and swimming. The lake is also a popular fishing destination in the region. The main catches in the lake are yellow perch, bluegill, and walleye. It also contains significant populations of smallmouth bass, northern pike, muskie, crappie and white bass, black bass. Blue Water: Myth or Fact? For nearly a century a myth has circulated that West Okoboji is one of only three blue water lakes in the world, the others being Lake Geneva in Wisconsin (sometimes referenced as located in Switzerland) and Lake Louise in Canada. Articles stating various versions of this erroneous information as fact have appeared in the Spencer Daily Reporter (May 20, 1976) and in the Des Moines Register as recently as 2009, and appear regularly in numerous tourist publications and websites. Unfortunately, there is no scientific basis to this assertion and it likely originated with some early ‚Äúboosters‚Äù of Dickinson County. Still, it raises the question as to where the idea originated from, and why Lake Geneva and Lake Louise are often mentioned as the other two lakes. Dr. John Schalles has taught limnology at Iowa Lakeside Laboratory, a biological field station located on the shores of Lake West Okoboji, for several decades and has become very familiar with the myth having heard it from his students and local community members. ‚ÄúFolks try to persuade me this information was first published in a National Geographic article, but I have found no record of it.‚Äù Dr. Roger Bachman, another nationally recognized limnologist, agrees and says the Society denies it ever made such a ranking. ‚ÄúWhile the term ‚Äòblue water lake‚Äô is not a scientific term, it is a fact that lakes and oceans with exceptionally pure waters like Lake Tahoe, Crater Lake, Lake Superior and the Sargasso Sea appear blue to the eye. When sunlight penetrates these waters the wavelengths (colors) of light are absorbed more strongly than blue, so that more of the blue remains to be scattered back out of the water surface.‚Äù Schalles has a theory, however, as to how the myth originated, in particular the association of West Okoboji and Lake Geneva as similarly unique lakes. In the early twentieth century E. A. Birge and Chancy Juday, two scientists today known as founders of the study of North American limnology, conducted studies on numerous lakes in the Midwest, including East and West Okoboji. In one publication, the authors make frequent comparisons between measurements taken at Lake West Okoboji and Lake Geneva in Wisconsin. Schalles wonders if these studies could have been the basis for the claim of the similarity between the two lakes, possibly struck by the fact that their local lake was being compared to one of the most famous lakes in the world, or perhaps thinking that this comparison (even if they had the information wrong) was a great way to impress folks and bring in more visitors. Regardless of the fact, there is no scientific basis that West Okoboji is a blue lake, scientists and non-scientists alike concur the lake has exceptional water quality and color for a lake in its region. In fact, the Iowa Department of Natural Resources has given West Okoboji and its watershed a special designation as an Outstanding Iowa Water. *1. Birge, E.A., and C. Juday. 1920.

She was renamed St. George (AVG-17) by the United States Navy on 7 January 1942; and assigned to the United Kingdom under Lend-Lease as HMS Pursuer on 24 February 1942. Launched on 18 July 1942; she was sponsored by Mrs. Mary Ann S. Bartman, reclassified ACV-17 on 20 August 1942, acquired by the US Navy and simultaneously transferred to Britain on 14 June 1943. She was reclassified CVE-17 on 15 July 1943. Operational history Pursuer served in the Home Fleet during World War II, primarily on convoy escort duty. However, on 3 April 1944, she provided fighter support for an air strike on the German battleship Tirpitz in Altenfjord, Norway. On 26 April 1944 Grumman Wildcats of 882 Naval Air Squadron took part in the successful attack on a German convoy off Bodo, northern Norway. It consisted of four medium-sized supply ships and five escort craft. All four supply vessels and one of the escorts were hit with bombs and three of the supply ships were left on fire, the largest having run aground. While this attack was in progress other naval aircraft penetrated Bodo Harbour, where one large supply ship was hit by bombs and set on fire amidships. Pursuer suffered storm damage during this operation and repairs took a month to complete. She served as an anti-submarine warfare vessel at the Battle of Normandy and in August and September 1944 she was part of a British carrier group providing air cover for the landings in southern France. The carrier was returned to United States custody on 12 February 1946, struck from the Navy Register on 28 March 1946, and sold for scrapping on 14 May that year to the Patapsco Steel Scrap Co., Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. Design and description There were eight Attacker class escort carriers in service with the Royal Navy during the Second World War. They were built between 1941 and 1942 by the Ingalls Shipbuilding and Western Pipe & Steel shipyards in the United States, both building four ships each.Cocker (2008), p.79. The vessels had a complement of 646 men and crew accommodation was different from the normal Royal Navy's arrangements. The separate messes no longer had to prepare their own food, as everything was cooked in the galley and served cafeteria style in a central dining area. They were also equipped with a modern laundry and a barber shop. The traditional hammocks were replaced by three tier bunk beds, eighteen to a cabin which were hinged and could be tied up to provide extra space when not in use.Poolman (1972), pp.74‚Äì75. The ships dimensions were; an overall length of , a beam of and a height of . They had a displacement of at deep load.Cocker (2008), p.80. Propulsion was provided by four diesel engines connected to one shaft giving 8,500 brake horsepower (BHP), which could propel the ship at .Cocker (2008), pp.80‚Äì81. Aircraft facilities were a small combined bridge‚Äìflight control on the starboard side above the x flight deck,Poolman (1972), p.57. two aircraft lifts by , and nine arrestor wires.

Incumbents *President: ** until 18 February: Raymond Poincar√© ** 18 February ‚Äì 21 September: Paul Deschanel ** starting 21 September: Alexandre Millerand *President of the Council of Ministers: ** until 20 January: Georges Clemenceau ** 20 January ‚Äì 24 September: Alexandre Millerand ** starting 24 September: Georges Leygues Events In the opening of the year 1920, France was in a stronger position than she had been in for several generations. The Allied victory over Germany and the restoration of Alsace-Lorraine to France had placed France in the position which she occupied during the 17th and 18th century - that of the strongest power on the European continent. At the beginning of the year Raymond Poincar√© was still president and Georges Clemenceau was still prime minister, but as both senatorial and presidential elections were due in January, important political changes occurred early in the year. At the general election for the Chamber of Deputies which took place in November 1919, there had been a strong tendency towards Conservatism, the Socialist Party being badly defeated. The elections for the Senate were held on 11 January, and these exhibited the same trend of opinion as had been shown in the previous autumn. Owing to the postponement of elections during the war, two-thirds of the nine-year senatorial seats had to be contested, and altogether 240 senators had to be elected. The elections proved to be an overwhelming victory for the various Liberal and Republican groups, who secured 218 seats. The parties of the Right won 20 seats, and the Socialists won 2. While these important events were taking place in the internal politics of France, the final stages in the ratifying of the peace treaty with Germany were being passed through. The Treaty of Versailles was to come into force so soon as it had been ratified by Germany and by three of the principal Allied and Associated Powers; and since it had now been ratified by Germany and by France, the United Kingdom, Italy, and Japan (though not by the United States), it was only necessary that the protocols certifying these facts should be signed by the parties to the treaty, and formal peace would then exist between the Allied Powers and Germany. The Supreme Council of the Allies decided that this final ceremony should take place in Paris on 10 January. Two delegates were sent by the German government to carry out the signing of the protocol, Baron Kurt von Lersner and Herr von Simson. The ceremony took place at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the Quai d'Orsay shortly after four o'clock on the afternoon of 10 January. The protocol was signed by Clemenceau for France, by David Lloyd George for Britain, by Francesco Saverio Nitti for Italy, and by Keishiro Matsui for Japan; and, of course, by the two German delegates. The protocol was also signed by the representatives of various minor Allied and Associated countries, which had already ratified the treaty, these being Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Czechoslovakia, Guatemala, Panama, Peru, Poland, Siam, and Uruguay. The formal end of the war was timed at 6:15 p.m. on 10 January, but the actual signing of the protocol took place, as already stated, somewhat earlier on that same afternoon. On 14 January, L√©on Bourgeois was elected president of the Senate. And the election of the new president of France, by a joint session of the two houses of the legislature, was fixed for 17 January. The two most important candidates were Paul Deschanel and Clemenceau. Among the other candidates was Field Marshal Ferdinand Foch, who, however, secured very little support. The rivalry between Deschanel and Clemenceau revealed certain very interesting tendencies in French politics. The contest turned mainly on the terms of peace which had been imposed upon Germany. Clemenceau's supporters contended that the terms of the Treaty of Versailles were satisfactory from the French point of view; his opponents declared that he had given way too much to the American and British standpoints, and that the peace was unsatisfactory, particularly in respect of the guarantees for the reparations due to France and in the matter of the French eastern frontier. A large body of French opinion had desired that France should secure the line of the Rhine as her eastern frontier. Deschanel represented these critics of the Treaty of Versailles. A preliminary ballot of the Republican groups gave 408 votes to Deschanel, and 389 votes to Clemenceau; and when this result was announced Clemenceau withdrew his candidature, but his name figured, nevertheless, in the formal voting of the National Assembly on 17 January. Altogether 888 legislators cast their votes, and Deschanel secured no fewer than 734 votes. The success of Deschanel was regarded in France as in some sense a victory for the opponents of the Treaty of Versailles. Deschanel was born in 1856, and had held the office of president of the Chamber of Deputies. Poincar√© was to remain in office as president until 18 February. On 18 January, Clemenceau resigned from office as premier; and Poincar√© entrusted Alexandre Millerand with the task of forming a cabinet. Millerand found no difficulty in obtaining the necessary support, and the full list of the members of his cabinet was published two days later. F. Marsal was minister of finance, A. Lefevre was minister of war, and A. Sarraut was minister for the colonies. Millerand, who himself took the portfolio of foreign affairs, was sixty years of age, and had greatly distinguished himself as minister for war during the critical days of 1914. His first reception by the Chamber of Deputies was somewhat stormy, and a vote of confidence on 22 January was only passed by 281 votes to 240. But a second vote of confidence on 30 January was passed by 510 votes to 70. On 5 February and 6 February, there was an important debate on foreign policy in the Chamber of Deputies; and a long speech was delivered by the prime minister. He said that the new cabinet had every intention of continuing the same foreign policy which had enabled France to surround herself with such faithful allies during the war. In reference to the Adriatic problem, Millerand said that the only desire of France was to reach a satisfactory solution of the difficulties existing in this part of the world - a solution in perfect agreement with the sister nation of Italy and with the Serbian people. In regard to the Bulgarian question the premier said that on the previous day he had received news that the Bulgarian parliament had ratified the treaty. Passing on to a consideration of the proposed peace terms for Turkey, Millerand answered certain criticisms which had been made earlier in the debate by Marcel Cachin. France, he declared, had important and historic interests in the East, and these she had no intention of abandoning. \\"M. Cachin declared yesterday that we appeared to be threatening the independence of the Syrian populations. No French government has ever entertained such a design, and it is a libel on France to reproach her with a policy of conquest which has never entered her mind. The only wish of France is to give these populations justice and a good administration. When yesterday I heard the government credited with intentions which it has not, I seemed to hear an echo of the slanders levelled by the German government at the work of France in Morocco.\\" Turning to the question of relations with Russia, Millerand said that contrary to the allegations of Cachin, Britain had been true to her agreements, and none of the Allies had entered into any agreement with the Soviet government. In regard to Poland, the French government intended to maintain the closest friendship with that country, and if she were attacked by the Bolsheviks she would receive every support. Finally, the prime minister dealt with the carrying out of the Treaty of Versailles. He said that the cabinet intended to maintain complete accord with France's allies; and although it was regrettable that the United States had not so far ratified the treaty, yet the Reparations Commission had begun its work smoothly, and he felt no anxiety as to the ultimate adhesion of America to the treaty. He said that Germany had been dilatory in the matter of fulfilling the stipulations of the treaty, particularly in regard to the essential deliveries of coal. \\"I mean to avail myself at the right moment of all the means placed at my disposal by the treaty, and I declare, without making any kind of threat, but merely in order that the position may be quite clear and well understood, that we do not intend to claim anything from Germany to which she is not strictly bound under the terms of the treaty, but we shall exact everything she owes us, and to obtain it we shall have recourse to the measures of all kinds provided for in the treaty.\\" After the conclusion of the debate the house passed a vote of confidence in the government by 513 votes to 68. After his assumption of office on 18 February, Deschanel sent the usual presidential message to parliament. Deschanel said that there was no higher destiny than that of serving France, and he thanked the legislators for having permitted him to continue to serve her in union with themselves. He hoped to maintain the national unity which had been so conspicuous during the war. \\"Our first duty is to define clearly our diplomatic, military, economic, and financial policy to the country. We can only build up our policy for the future on sound bases. I appeal to all the experience and talent of the members of this assembly on behalf of this act of sincerity and moral probity. To strengthen the unity between all peoples who fought for the right, and who, by reason of that fact, are great, to strengthen the bonds with those peoples whose affinities or interests bind them to us - this is the first guarantee of peace and the basis of that League of Nations to which the Treaty of Versailles entrusted the execution of certain capital clauses, and which we should support by means of effective action in order to spare the world fresh horrors. France wishes that the treaty to which Germany appended her signature shall be obeyed, and that the aggressor shall not take from her the fruits of her heroic sacrifices. She means to live in security. Today, as yesterday, our policy is an affair of will-power, energy, and faith. The Russian people fought by our side during three years for the cause of Liberty; may it, master of itself, soon resume in the plenitude of its genius the course of its civilizing mission. The Eastern question causes periodical wars. The fate of the Ottoman Empire has not yet been settled. Our secular interests, rights, and traditions ought to be safeguarded there too.\\" Turning to questions of internal politics, Deschanel said that the work of restoring France to prosperity would be arduous, and he declared that the person who evaded the payment of taxes was acting like a soldier who deserts his post on the field of battle. It was essential that conflicts between capital and labour should be avoided. In his peroration Deschanel exhorted the legislators to follow in the footsteps of the heroic Frenchmen who had won the war: \\"We shall accomplish our formidable task if we keep in our souls that sacred flame which rendered France the Republic Invincible, and saved the world.\\" In the middle of February the trial of Joseph Caillaux, the ex-prime minister of France, who had been under arrest for treason since January 1918, commenced. The case was regarded as the most important of the treason trials, of which there had been a long series since the middle of the war. Caillaux was tried before the Senate, sitting as a High Court of Justice, with L√©on Bourgeois as president of the court. The prolonged delay in bringing Caillaux to trial was because investigations had to be made in many different parts of the world, including South America. Caillaux was charged with \\"having sought to weaken the security of the state abroad by intrigues, machination, and intelligence with the enemy of a nature likely to favour enemy action in regard to France, or her Allies, fighting against common enemies, and thus to advance the progress of the enemy armies.\\" M. Lescouv√© (the public prosecutor), M. Moinet, and others appeared for the prosecution. M. Giafferi, M. Moutet, and others appeared for the defense. The trial was extremely long and also in many respects extremely dramatic. The trial began, on 17 February, with a series of interrogations by the president of the court, and this part of the scene alone lasted for several days. Next there came a cross-examination of the prisoner by the public prosecutor. All kinds of activity on the part of Caillaux was investigated in great detail and at great length. He was questioned regarding his relations with an enemy agent named Minotto, in South America, regarding his relations with another enemy agent, a certain Count Lipscher, and also in regard to his associations with the traitors Lenoir, Bolo, and Duval, who had already been executed for treason. The prisoner had also to account for his close association with various schemers in Italy, including the notorious Cavallini. During these interrogations, Caillaux frequently made long speeches on all manner of political questions. In the matter of Count Lipscher little to his discredit appears to have transpired; but apart from the details of the investigation it was obvious that if the prisoner had been entirely innocent of the charges brought against him, he had had a surprising amount of association with undesirable persons. And it was also established that the German government regarded Caillaux as the right man to approach under circumstances favourable to Germany. Moutet, speaking for the defense, attributed political motives to the accusers, and said that notwithstanding the fact that the world had been ransacked for evidence for many months, the evidence produced was of a ridiculous and trumpery character. After many weeks of investigation the capital charge of treason was dismissed, and the prosecution did not ask for the death sentence; but Caillaux was found guilty on the minor count of correspondence with the enemy, and was sentenced to three years' imprisonment, ten years' interdiction of rights of voting and eligibility for any public function, and five years' prohibition from appearing in certain places indicated by the government. It was found that his relations with Bolo and Almereyda did not fall within the penal code, but he was condemned for his friendship with Minotto, Cavallini, and to some extent for his association with Count Lipscher. Having already served more than two years' imprisonment, Caillaux was set at liberty at the end of the trial. The verdict was given on 23 April. During the spring there were serious labour troubles in France. At the end of February a serious dispute arose on the Paris, Lyon, and Mediterranean Railway system, owing to disciplinary measures which had been taken against one man. A strike was declared on that line on 25 February, and subsequently spread to the state lines also. The government immediately called to the colours those employees who were in the Army Reserve. A general strike of railwaymen was declared on 29 February; but the response was only partial, and an agreement was reached within twenty-four hours. At the beginning of May another railway strike broke out, and on this occasion the labour agitators hoped to make the strike universal, and it was supported by the General Confederation of Labour (CGT), who called out the seamen, dockers, and miners in support of the railwaymen. The aims of the General Confederation were not only economic, but also partly political; and they announced that they aimed at the international allotment of war burdens, an economic entente of all peoples on a basis of cooperation, at the cessation of all colonial expeditions, and at general disarmament. The response to the call on the part of the workers was, however, half-hearted and partial, though in certain localities, including Marseille, the strike was almost universal. The strike was extremely unpopular in the country at large, and the government took legal proceedings against the revolutionary ring-leaders. Within a week it was clear that the strike would fail, owing to the apathy or actual hostility of a large part of the working classes, but it was not until 21 May that the leaders of the General Confederation declared the strike at an end. In February the government issued a new 5% state loan, which became known as the \\"Recovery Loan\\". The subscription lists remained open for several weeks, and it was announced in April that the total amount subscribed was 15,700,000,000 francs. During the spring and summer certain differences of opinion, important but not fundamental, arose between the French and British governments. In a debate in the Chamber of Deputies on 25 March, Louis Barthou, who had once been prime minister and was now chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the lower house, delivered a speech on foreign policy generally in which he took occasion to attack the policy of the British government. He complained that Britain had profited more than any other country by the terms of the Treaty of Versailles; and that the course of events had recently been such that the hatred of Germany was now directed almost exclusively against France. This was, he said, particularly the case in the matter of permitting Germany to deal with her own war criminals, for which concession Britain had gained all the credit in German eyes. The speaker made various other complaints against the British government in general and Lloyd George in particular; but it was clear before the end of his speech that he did not carry the Chamber with him. On the following day, Millerand made a reply in which he endeavoured to remove the bad impression created by Barthou's speech. The prime minister said that there was no \\"crisis in the alliance\\"; and he pointed out that the reason the concession to Germany in the matter of the war criminals was signed by the British prime minister was that at the time the note was sent the peace conference was sitting in London. The premier said, however, that France was determined to see the terms of the Treaty of Versailles fulfilled, and although the British government were in favour of allowing the German government to send troops into the Ruhr District, to suppress the Spartacist insurrection there, France viewed these movements of troops with grave concern. The differences between the French and British governments were also apparent at the beginning of April, when the German government was suppressing the Spartacist revolt. To the east of the Allied armies in the occupied portion of Germany there was a neutral zone, into which, by the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, the German government were not allowed to send troops. During the Spartacist insurrection which followed the coup d'√©tat in Berlin (see 1920 in Germany), the revolutionaries in the valley of the Ruhr, a highly industrialized district which was included in the neutral zone, took advantage of the unavoidable absence of the government forces to seize control of the entire administration of this important part of Germany. The German government applied for permission to send forces into this part of the neutral zone in the exceptional circumstances which had arisen, as without doing so it was impossible for them to overcome the revolt in the neutral zone itself, or to prevent the successful insurrection in that zone lending important support to the Spartacists farther east. The British, Italian, and American governments were all in favour of allowing the German government, which in the circumstances existing was a bulwark against the spread of Bolshevism, to send a limited number of troops into the neutral zone until law and order had been reestablished there. The French government, however, interposed obstacles to the granting of any such license to the German government. The revolt continued to spread, and at the beginning of April German troops marched into the Ruhr Valley to restore order, although no permission for them to do so had been granted by the Allies as a whole. Thereupon the French government, without the consent of the British and Italian governments, ordered their own troops to march forward into the neutral zone - though not into the same part of the neutral zone - and to occupy various German towns as a penalty for the German advance. Frankfurt, Darmstadt, and Hanau were occupied on 6 April, and Homburg was entered on the following day. Black troops took part in the advance, a point which gave special umbrage to the Germans. This independent action on the part of the French government led to an interchange of somewhat sharp notes between London and Paris, the British government taking exception both to the French advance in itself and still more so to the fact that the advance had been made without due consultation with the other Allied governments. Within a few days, however, an agreement between the French and British governments was reached. The black troops were immediately withdrawn, and the French government made it clear that in the future they would not act without securing the consent of the other Allies. The British government on their side made it clear that they intended to see the terms of the Treaty of Versailles respected by the German government. After the suppression of the Ruhr revolt, both the German and French troops were withdrawn. During the spring and summer there were various conferences between the French, British, and other Allied governments, at San Remo, Hythe, Spa, and elsewhere, these conferences relating largely to the reparations due from Germany under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles. At these discussions similar differences of opinion appear to have existed between the British and French representatives, the British being more disposed than the French to recognize the difficulties with which the German government were confronted. But these differences of opinion only related to questions of method, and were in no way fundamental. In the middle of May Poincar√©, the ex-president of France, resigned his position as president of the Reparations Commission, on account of what he regarded as the undue leniency which had been shown towards Germany. Millerand stated publicly, however, that he thought Poincar√©'s fears were groundless. On 23 May a serious accident occurred to Deschanel. The president, who was travelling by night, fell from his train near Montargis. Considering the nature of the accident, the injuries sustained were not grave, and no bones were broken. But it subsequently transpired that the president was suffering from a serious nervous breakdown, owing to overwork, and he was unable to return to his official duties. His illness continued for weeks, and as he made no progress towards recovery, it was announced in the middle of September that in accordance with the recommendation of his medical advisers, the president had resigned his office. It was soon evident that the great majority of public men desired that Millerand should himself become president. The premier at first declined to accede to these demands, but after some delay he consented to do so. The election took place on 23 September, and out of 892 votes cast, no fewer than 695 were given Millerand. A Socialist candidate, Gustave Delory, obtained 69 votes. Millerand announced that he hoped somewhat to increase the powers of the presidential office, particularly in regard to foreign policy. Georges Leygues became prime minister and minister for foreign affairs; but otherwise the composition of the cabinet remained unchanged. On 25 September the Chamber of Deputies passed a vote of confidence in the new government by 515 votes to 71. It was notable that in the statements issued both by the new president and by the new government, it was proclaimed that France would do her utmost to make the League of Nations a success. At the end of November Leygues visited London to confer with British and Italian statesmen on the Greek crisis and other matters. In the middle of November it was announced that the government proposed to reduce the period of military service from two years to eighteen months. In November Lord Derby, the British ambassador in Paris, retired from that office, and was succeeded by Lord Hardinge. It was also announced that Paul Cambon, the veteran French ambassador in London, would retire in January 1921. Throughout the year there was considerable, though intermittent, discussion on the proposal that France should resume diplomatic relations with the Vatican; and at the end of November the government proposal to renew relations was approved by the Chamber of Deputies by 387 votes to 210. The defeat of the Socialists at the general election of 1919 appeared to have caused that party to become more extreme in its views. And after much discussion throughout the year 1920, a great Socialist conference held at Tours in December voted by a large majority in favour of adhesion to the so-called Third International, the international organization of Socialists which was under the control of the Bolsheviks of Moscow. The financial situation in France gave occasion for most serious anxiety. Among other unfavourable features, the exchange value of the franc had fallen greatly since the end of the war, and, with fluctuations, stood at about 60 francs to the pound sterling during most of the year; and the value of the franc in terms of the American dollar was even lower. The ordinary budget for 1920 provided for a revenue of 15,885,000,000 francs and for an expenditure of 17,860,000,000 francs. It was anticipated that the extraordinary expenditure would amount to over 7,000,000,000 francs. *2 February - France occupies Memel. *26 March - German government asks France for permission to use its own troops against rebellious Ruhr Red Army in the French-occupied area. *16 May - Joan of Arc is canonised.

Its most notable features include side-by-side seating and dual controls, making the plane ideal for use as a trainer. It boasted average performance, compared to other gliders of the day, and was advertised as making the process of learning to fly sailplanes easier. Design and development The Goevier (or G√∂vier; G√∂ 4 read aloud in German) was designed as a modern trainer with side-by-side seating for easy communication between student and tutor, with performance comparable to that of the intermediate single seat trainers of the day such as the Grunau Baby and G√∂ppingen G√∂ 1 Wolf. Its glide angle of 19:1 was rather better than that of both these aircraft (17:1). It is a cantilever mid-wing monoplane. The wing has a single spar and a plywood covered D-box nose; aft of the spar the wing is fabric covered. The centre section is of constant chord and the outer panels tapered, with sweep on both edges. Here the trailing edge carries long span, broad chord ailerons with curved edges which extend aft of the centre section trailing edge, giving a roughly elliptical plan. The side-by-side seat arrangement inevitably makes the front fuselage wider (945 mm; 37.4 in externally) than that of a single or tandem seat aircraft, though as the seats are just ahead of the main spar and the mid-wing placed at shoulder height, the interior opening into the wing roots provides extra working space. These roots were early examples of the use of plastics in gliders, formed from hessian soaked in phenolic resins and shaped in a mould. The cockpit is enclosed with glazing and its roof line runs smoothly into that of the upper fuselage above the wing. The fuselage, plywood covered all over, tapers to the tail where the cross-section is shield shaped. The ply covered tailplane is mounted on a small step above the fuselage; together with the fabric covered elevators the horizontal tail is trapezoidal in plan with rounded tips. The fin and rudder were altered several times during the development of the Goevier, initially with both broad and with the fin extending forward to the leading edge of the tailplane, but on all production models it is narrow and upright, carrying several slightly different rudder designs. From 1941 the rudder was aerodynamically balanced. The Goevier lands on a monowheel undercarriage, with a skid reaching forward from it to the nose and with a small tail skid. The Goevier V-1 made its first flight on 30 November 1937, piloted by Heinz Kensche. Production began at G√∂ppingen the following October. Operational history In a flight covering 1‚Äì3 June 1939, Josef F√ºringer and Hofmann flew a Goevier to a new world duration record of 49 h 45 min. A Goevier was used to develop the now ubiquitous Schempp-Hirth airbrake with its parallel ruler action. During World War II the Goevier was the standard advanced trainer with both the National Socialist Flyers Corps and the Werrmacht Luft gliding units. Goeviers have been regular attendees at Veteran Glider meetings in the later part of the last century. In 2010 one Goevier II and four Goevier IIIs remained on the civil registers of European countries, three in Germany and two in the Netherlands.

This excerpt from the Lewis and Clark map of 1814 shows western Iowa. Spirit Lake is near the upper center of the map. Big Spirit Lake is a natural body of water, approximately in area, in Dickinson County in northwest Iowa in the United States. It is part of the chain of lakes known as the Iowa Great Lakes, the northern shore of the lake straddles the border with Minnesota. It is the largest natural lake in Iowa. The Dakotah Indian name for the lake was Minnewaukon. Early French traders named it Lac D' Esprit after the Indian legends of an evil spirit who dwelled in the lake. Its maximum depth is 24 feet (7.3 m), and the mean depth is 17 feet (5 m). The drainage area of the lake is approximately 22 square miles (57 km¬≤). It has a drainage area of approximately 75 mi¬≤ (194 km¬≤), most of which is in Minnesota. Geology Geologically, the lake, like its neighbors, is a glacial pothole, a remnant of the most recent ice age approximately 13,000 years ago. Recreation The lake is a popular fishing destination in the region. It contains over 40 species of fish, 13 of which are typically caught. Fishing for walleye and yellow perch is typically done by boat or through the ice. Fishing for bullhead is common from the shore during the spring. A state- operated fish hatchery also provides significant populations of largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, northern pike, muskie, crappie, and bluegill. The Iowa all-time big fish records for freshwater drum and muskellunge were set from catches in the lake. Kiteboarding is also a popular activity on Big Spirit Lake.

She was named for the Altamaha River in Georgia. Altamaha was laid down under a Maritime Commission contract (MC hull 235) on 19 December 1941 at Tacoma, Washington, by the Seattle-Tacoma Shipbuilding Corporation; launched on 25 May 1942; sponsored by Mrs. Thomas S. Combs, the wife of Commander Combs, who was the commanding officer of , and commissioned on 15 September 1942 Captain J. R. Tate in command. Service history Following brief sea trials, Altamaha got underway for San Diego, California, on 27 October in company with . While they were en route, Kendrick spotted a submarine and claimed that members of her crew had seen three torpedoes which had been fired at the escort carrier. However, no one on Altamaha observed any of the torpedoes. The voyage continued uneventfully, and the ships reached San Diego on 31 October. The carrier then took on aircraft and passengers and sailed in convoy on 3 November for the southwest Pacific. Upon reaching Espiritu Santo on 24 November, she delivered part of her cargo and continued on to New Caledonia. She reached Noum√©a on 28 November and commenced a period of flight operations and training exercises. The vessel returned to Espiritu Santo on 30 December, but continued on to the Fiji Islands and touched at Nadi on 13 January 1943 before beginning another period of operational training. In early February, Altamaha paused off Funafuti, Ellice Islands; loaded cargo and personnel on to barges and sent them ashore. The carrier then proceeded to Hawaii and arrived at Pearl Harbor on 10 February. There, the planes and personnel of Air Group 11 came on board, and the ship set a course for the Fiji Islands on 19 February. She reached Nadi on 28 February, discharged her cargo, and reversed her course back toward the Hawaiian Islands. After a short stay in port at Pearl Harbor, the escort carrier got underway on 9 March with replacement aircraft for the flattops of the Pacific Fleet. She paused at Palmyra Island on 15 March, continued on to Johnston Island debarked marine aviation personnel on 17 March, and touched at Midway Atoll three days later before reversing course and returning to Hawaii. She remained at Pearl Harbor for one day, 23 March, and then continued on to the West Coast. Altamaha reached San Diego on 1 April and commenced three and one-half months of flight operations off the California coast alternated with upkeep in San Diego. On 13 July, she arrived at Alameda, California, to take on planes from the naval air station there. The escort carrier got underway for Australia three days later and made Brisbane on 3 August. Following a 10-day visit to Fremantle, Western Australia, she got underway on 16 August for India and arrived at Karachi on 28 August and delivered 29 Army Air Force airplanes. On 2 September, the escort carrier reversed her course and steamed back to Australia. She reached Melbourne on 18 September and, at the end of three days there in a leave and upkeep status got underway for the West Coast of the United States. On 8 October, the vessel entered the Mare Island Navy Yard, Vallejo, California, for overhaul. The escort carrier got underway for sea trials on 8 November paused briefly at Alameda to take on replacement aircraft, and sailed on 13 November for Brisbane. Altamaha reached her destination on 30 November and began discharging her cargo. The ship left there on 4 December to return home. Upon her arrival at San Diego on 21 December, she began a period of local operations carrier qualifications, and repairs. During refueling operations off San Diego, blimp K-29 of USN Airship Patrol Squadron 31 (ZP-31) made the first carrier landing by a non-rigid airship on the deck of CVE Altamaha on 4 February 1944.Grossnick, Roy A., United States Naval Aviation 1910 ‚Äì1995, p. 136, Part 5, World War II, 1940‚Äì1945, Naval Historical Center Department of the Navy, Washington, D.C., 1997. http://www.history.navy.mil/avh-1910/PART05.PDF The ship got underway for Pearl Harbor on 22 March 1944 arrived there on 28 March, and began taking on Composite Squadron 6 for transportation to an operating area 300 miles east of the Marshall Islands. The carrier had been selected to be the nucleus of Task Group 11.1 (TG 11.1), and left Hawaii in company with four destroyer escorts on 30 March. The warships reached their assigned area on 3 April and began their first patrol. The group reported contacting two submarines but did not receive credit for damaging or destroying either. The task group put into Majuro Atoll on 8 April to allow the destroyer escorts to refuel. The ships sailed on 11 April to carry out a second anti-submarine warfare mission. Altamaha was the target of a torpedo attack on 15 April but successfully evaded all four shots. The remainder of the patrol passed uneventfully before TG 11.1 was relieved on 18 April and shaped a course for Pearl Harbor. Following a short upkeep period in Hawaiian waters, the carrier returned to Majuro in early May and operated in an antisubmarine screen off the Marshall Islands for several days before returning to Pearl Harbor on 11 May. After a two-day layover in Hawaii, Altamaha pushed on toward the West Coast. Reaching Alameda on 18 May, she entered the shipyard of the United Engineering Company for repairs and alterations. She resumed operations on the last day in May and headed for Hawaii, laden with aircraft and spare parts. Having delivered her cargo at Pearl Harbor, Altamaha returned to Alameda. From there, she proceeded to San Diego which she reached on 19 June and spent two days loading men and equipment before departing California on 21 June, bound for the New Hebrides. She reached Espiritu Santo on 7 July, discharged cargo and, on 12 July, headed for Morobe, New Guinea, where she arrived on 16 July. Having made additional calls at Langemak, New Guinea, and Seeadler Harbor, Manus Island, Altamaha arrived back at Espiritu Santo on the 25th. She made one more cruise from this island, during which she visited Seeadler Harbor and Guadalcanal. The carrier departed the New Hebrides on 10 August bound for Hawaii. Altamaha paused at Pearl Harbor for two days and then sailed on to San Diego. She spent four days there before getting underway and setting course for Pearl Harbor. She departed Hawaiian waters on 8 September, made port calls at Emirau Island and Seeadler Harbor, and returned to San Diego, where she arrived on 6 October. The vessel next spent three weeks in local operations before getting underway on 26 October for another voyage west. The escort carrier paused at Pearl Harbor for three days, then sailed for Eniwetok with replacement aircraft and pilots. On 15 November, she reached Ulithi and then carried out flight operations off Ulithi through 14 December, when she got underway for the 3rd Fleet replenishment area. On 16 December, the ship joined TG 30.8 in the Philippine Sea and, the next day, began transferring pilots to . However, heavy seas compelled her to break off that task. By early morning on 18 December, the disturbance had grown into a raging typhoon. By 0900, the escort carrier was laboring heavily and rolling as much as 25-30 degrees to either side. An hour later, visibility dropped to zero, and the vessel abandoned all effort to keep station. Almost one-half of the aircraft on board Altamaha broke loose and plunged overboard. The ship also experienced problems with flooding in the forward elevator pit. By 1600, the weather was improving and the ship rode better. Soon she made a rendezvous with other members of TG 30.8. While the carrier sustained considerable material damage, she suffered no personnel casualties and was able to resume her resupply operations on 19 December. Altamaha continued her operations with the replenishment group through early February 1945. During this time, she serviced 3rd Fleet units in Philippine waters and made port calls at Guam, Manus and Ulithi. On 15 February, the ship touched at Pearl Harbor. Altamaha continued on to the West Coast, arriving at Alameda on 26 February. The ship began an availability at the Hunters Point Navy Yard on 3 March during which she was dry-docked for routine work below the waterline and repairs to a propeller damaged in the typhoon. The carrier emerged from the yard on 14 March and began loading planes, ammunition, and supplies for transportation to Pearl Harbor. During the remaining months of World War II, Altamaha provided general transportation service from Alameda, San Diego, and Pearl Harbor to various points in the Pacific. Among her stops were Guam, Saipan, Eniwetok, Kossol Roads and Samar. Following the Japanese capitulation in mid-August Altamaha returned to the West Coast for repairs and an overhaul at the Hunters Point Navy Yard. She began sea trials in mid-October and got underway for Pearl Harbor on the 22nd. The vessel was then assigned to the \\"Magic-Carpet\\" fleet and transported armed forces personnel and equipment throughout the Pacific back to the United States. On 15 January 1946, Altamaha headed to Tacoma, Washington. Deactivation preparations were begun there, and the carrier was placed out of commission, in reserve, on 27 September 1946. The ship was redesignated CVHE-18 on 12 June 1955. Her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 March 1959, and the vessel was sold on 25 April 1961 to Eisenberg & Co., New York City, N.Y., and, later that year, was scrapped in Japan.

It was first published on October 2, 1841. While originally it published all acts of the Parliament of Canada, it later also published treaties, hearing and tribunals, proclamations and regulations, and various other official notices as required. At one time it contained information on bankruptcies. It has been administered by Public Works and Government Services Canada and the Queen's Printer since 1841. The Gazette is most often read to find new acts, regulations and proclamations. Legal status While not always widely read by the public, publication in the Gazette is considered official notice to all Canadians. After a regulation has been approved by the Privy Council Office and then the Cabinet of Canada, the regulation is published in the Gazette. If a regulation has not been published in the Gazette, a person cannot be convicted of the offence. Canada's provinces all have their own equivalents of the Gazette. Publishing From inception in 1841 until 1998, the Gazette was published in print. From 1998 until 1 April 2014, it was published in print and online, with the online version having the same official status as the printed version starting in 2003. Since 1 April 2014, it has only be published online to satisfy a Government of Canada requirement to make \\"electronic publishing its new standard for all documents\\". Structurally, the Gazette is published in three parts: Part I Part I is published each Saturday. It contains public notices, official appointments and proposed regulations, as well as miscellaneous notices from the private sector that are required to be published by federal statute or by regulations. The proposed regulations are published in Part I as a way for the public to comment on them. Once the regulations are pre-published, the department that sponsored the legislation collects public comments to allow for any changes to be made to the regulation. Recently, Notices of Vacancies for senior positions in Government are published here too. Part II Part II is published every second Wednesday and it contains all regulations that have been enacted as well as statutory instruments and other documents, such as orders in council, orders and proclamations. It has a consolidated index of regulations dating since January 1, 1955. Part III Part III is published with the text of any new laws immediately after they have received Royal Assent and was first published in 1974. Starting from January 1998 all publications other than Part III are available in HTML and are not official. From April 1, 2003, the PDF version is an official version, as it is marked up from the same file as the printed version. It also contains a list of the proclamations of Canada and orders in council relating to the coming into force of federal acts. Exemptions Certain types of regulations do not need to be published in the Gazette. These include regulations that affect only a limited number of people, their publication would be contrary to national defence or international relations, or if their publication would violate personal privacy, such as notices of paroles and pardons.

Established in 1987, the label is best known for having released Operation Ivy‚Äôs only album, Energy, and Green Day's first two albums, 39/Smooth and Kerplunk. Following the departure of co-founder Larry Livermore in 1997, the label departed from its \\"East Bay sound\\" and proved unable to match early success. In 2005 the label ran into financial difficulties after several high- profile artists rescinded the rights to their Lookout Records material. After a period of rapid contraction the label slowly expired, terminating operations and removing its music from online distribution channels early in 2012. History=Background Cover of the Summer 1988 issue of Lookout! magazine, published in Laytonville, California by Lawrence Livermore. During the fall of 1984 Larry Livermore (n√©e Larry Hayes), a resident of the small town of Laytonville, California of countercultural proclivities, felt the urge to opine about the problems of his community and the world in a small- circulation periodical.Larry Livermore, How I Became a Capitalist: The Lookout Records Story, Part One. [1994] Corvallis, OR: 1000 Flowers Publishing, 2014; pp. 2-3. Thus in October of that year was launched a circulation magazine called Lookout, the first issue of which was typed and photocopied with a \\"press run\\" of just 50 copies.Livermore, How I Became a Capitalist: The Lookout Records Story, Part One, pg. 3. Opposition emerged to the controversial local topics upon which Livermore opined and so he turned to the theme punk rock, a form of music he had followed in the late 1970s.Livermore, How I Became a Capitalist: The Lookout Records Story, Part One, pg. 4. Livermore began to reacquaint himself with the ongoing punk music scene by listening to the Maximum Rocknroll (MRR) radio show, broadcast weekly from Berkeley and featuring prominent scenester and future fanzine publisher Tim Yohannan and his cohorts.Livermore, How I Became a Capitalist: The Lookout Records Story, Part One, pg. 5. Livermore also decided to start a band, drafting a 12-year-old neighbor to play drums ‚Äî given the punk rock name \\"Tr√© Cool\\" by Livermore. Cool would later gain fame as the drummer of Green Day. After a few ill-attended shows in 1985 Livermore took his band, The Lookouts, into a local recording studio to record their songs, with a 26-song demo tape resulting.Livermore, How I Became a Capitalist: The Lookout Records Story, Part One, pp. 5-6. He also began living part-time in the San Francisco Bay Area, splitting his time between the city and his home in the mountains of Mendocino County.Livermore, How I Became a Capitalist: The Lookout Records Story, Part One, pp. 6-7. The Lookouts began playing out more in San Francisco and Berkeley and began to develop a fan following and to make the acquaintance of other local bands, including a melodically friendly group called The Mr. T Experience.Livermore, How I Became a Capitalist: The Lookout Records Story, Part One, pg. 7. A vibrant local scene began to congeal, based around the Gilman Street Project, an all-ages venue inspired, bankrolled, and coordinated by the popular Maximum Rocknroll, launched the night of December 31, 1986.Livermore, How I Became a Capitalist: The Lookout Records Story, Part One, pp. 7-8. Early in 1987 Livermore decided that it was time for The Lookouts to release a record.Livermore, How I Became a Capitalist: The Lookout Records Story, Part One, pg. 8. Livermore chose to take the Do It Yourself route to create such an album, self-releasing the one-off LP as \\"Lookout Records.\\" At the same time, the new bands emerging around the vibrant 924 Gilman Street venue, including Operation Ivy, Crimpshrine, Sewer Trout, Isocracy, and others were documented for the first time by local scenester David Hayes on a 17-song double 7\\" compilation entitled Turn It Around, released through Mordam Distribution on the Maximum Rocknroll Records label.Kevin Prested, Punk USA: The Rise and Fall of Lookout Records. Portland, OR: Microcosm Publishing, 2014; pg. 9. The duo would soon join forces as co- founders of a permanent label. Establishment Both Lawrence Livermore (n√©e Larry Hayes) and David Hayes (not related) were deeply inspired by the energetic East Bay punk rock scene and sought to further document its leading bands. David Hayes initially wanted to start a new label of his own for the purpose, to be known as Sprocket Records, with a view to a first release for the band Corrupted Morals.Prested, Punk USA, pg. 10. Livermore, a columnist for Maximum Rocknroll (MRR) who knew Hayes as a so-called \\"shitworker\\" for the publication, convinced the latter that a partnership was in order to advance their common goal. As Livermore's release had an independently controlled label name, Lookout Records, while Hayes' debut release borrowed the well- known MRR moniker, the former name was decided upon as the label name for the releases of the duo moving forward. According to Livermore, the name \\"Lookout\\" was chosen for his magazine and band and thus the label from whence it sprung was selected in reference to the United States Forest Service fire watch tower on Iron Peak, the highest point in Livermore's rural Mendocino County neighborhood.Livermore, How I Became a Capitalist: The Lookout Records Story, Part One, pg. 10. The company's iconic \\"beady eyes\\" logo was the early creation of David Hayes, who also handled much of the artwork for the label's early sleeves and LP jackets.Livermore, How I Became a Capitalist: The Lookout Records Story, Part One, pg. 11. With Hayes' Corrupted Morals project moving forward as LK-02, a 7-inch EP entitled Chet, Livermore and Hayes jointly worked to bring about a third release later in 1987.Prested, Punk USA, pp. 10-11. This would be yet another 7\\" EP, a record by raw-edged ska-punkers Operation Ivy called Hectic.Prested, Punk USA, pg. 11. This third release proved to be an aural document of the right band at the right moment, with the release by the high energy local favorites selling through its first pressing of 1,000 copies within a month.Prested, Punk USA, pg. 12. In an effort to make a splash, four 7-inch vinyl records were released simultaneously, including also releases by popular 924 Gilman bands Crimpshrine (LK-04) and Isocracy (LK-05). This initial barrage of new releases went far in cementing Lookout's place as a cutting edge local label for the Berkeley punk scene. The \\"Gilman bands\\" began to form friendships amongst themselves and to play out together at other venues on the road. One important contact was made in the person of 14-year-old Christopher \\"Chris\\" Appelgren, a resident of the small town of Garberville, California who worked as a volunteer at community radio station KMUD and who had learned of The Lookouts and the burgeoning East Bay punk rock scene through the pages of Lookout magazine, which was distributed in the area.Prested, Punk USA, pg. 15. Appelgren attended a show held at Humboldt State University in Arcata, California played by Lookout Records bands Operation Ivy, Crimpshrine, Isocracy, and The Lookouts and was wowed by what he saw, meeting Livermore for the first time and making the acquaintance of Tim \\"Lint\\" Armstrong of Op Ivy ‚Äî later a leading member of Rancid. Before long Appelgren would be traveling to Livermore's Laytonville home to help with the stuffing of 7\\" vinyl into sleeves and packaging records for mailorder, becoming the label's first paid employee.Prested, Punk USA, pp. 15-16. Departure of David Hayes But all was not well with the fledgling record label. Livermore and Hayes began to become estranged from one another, and the label's projects began to be bifurcated between the two principals ‚Äî \\"Larry's bands\\" and \\"David's bands,\\" with the eclectic Hayes next turning to releases by post punk band Plaid Retina and country punks Sewer Trout.Prested, Punk USA, pp. 18-20. In addition to differences in musical taste which became more apparent over time, the pair were temperamentally ill-suited, with Hayes understated and reserved and Livermore boisterous and gregarious.Prested, Punk USA, pg. 20. In addition, Hayes and Livermore differed greatly with respect to commercial motivation. In a 2015 memoir, Livermore recalled that Although the winds of change had begun to blow even in 1988, David Hayes would remain very active with Lookout through the summer of 1989, albeit with dissatisfaction regarding the label's direction growing, and his expressed desires of departure becoming more frequent.Livermore, How to Ru(i)n a Record Label, pg. 81. Hayes had gradually come to find working with Livermore to be insufferable and sought peace and artistic freedom through formation of his own record label. Believing that Hayes' participation in the Lookout project as bookkeeper and skilled mitigator of the demands of demanding bands was essential, the 16-year old Appelgren clearly not being ready for the role, Livermore tried a last-ditch effort to retain Hayes with the label, offering to take over all mundane operational tasks while leaving Hayes with \\"half the profits\\" as financial coordinator and public face of the organization.Livermore, How to Ru(i)n a Record Label, pp. 81-82. The anti- commercial Hayes flatly rejected this proposal with the declaration that \\"there's too much golden light around Lookout right now,\\" adding that work on his label of love had come to feel \\"too much like a job.\\"Livermore, How to Ru(i)n a Record Label, pg. 82. With a quiet determination, Hayes declared that his departure would take effect on January 1, 1990, adding \\"I don't want anything more to do with Lookout, and I don't want anything more from Lookout.\\"Livermore, How to Ru(i)n a Record Label, pp. 82-83. The speechless Livermore was left with full ownership and control of the label on the very eve of its commercial success. David Hayes would go on to start his own label, Very Small Records, releasing dozens of records over the coming decade that ran the gamut of punk styles, maintaining fidelity to his artistic and ethical vision ‚Äî while the label that he exited would go on to become a multimillion- dollar commercial enterprise. Punk rock rising (1989-1993) Many different punk rock bands, such as Green Day, were signed to Lookout in this time. Green Day released their debut EP, 1,000 Hours, in 1989. Green Day also released 39/Smooth (1990), Slappy (1990), Sweet Children (1990), and, with their new drummer, Kerplunk! (1992). After the breakup of Operation Ivy, some of the members formed Rancid. They released their debut EP, Rancid, in 1992 with Lookout Records. Screeching Weasel released their third and fifth to seventh albums, My Brain Hurts (1991), Wiggle (1993), Anthem for a New Tomorrow (1993), and How to Make Enemies and Irritate People (1994). Many other Bay area punk bands were getting signed by Lookout Records, giving them a start to a career. \\"Golden years\\" (1993‚Äì1997) Lookout became famous for releasing albums that featured a very distinctive \\"Ramonescore\\" pop punk sound including bands such as Screeching Weasel, The Mr T Experience, The Queers, Crimpshrine, Green Day, Sweet Baby, Squirtgun, The Wanna-Bes and others. In the spring of 1994 Lookout principal Larry Livermore made a very public break with Tim Yohannan and his Maximum Rocknroll, for which Livermore had written since 1987. With punk exploding in popularity and various tangential musical forms attaching themselves to the movement and swamping MRR with promotional material, a tightening of musical focus was demanded by Yohannan ‚Äî a move which led to the launch of the more eclectic rival publication Punk Planet. Livermore rebelled at the new line, charging that MRR had increasingly become \\"a lifestyle journal for retro-punks\\" who \\"think if they dress up in the same clothes they wore 15 years ago, if they drink the same beer and play the same guitar riffs, that somehow it'll be the glory days of punk all over again.\\" Despite Yohannan's radical politics, Maximum had been revealed to be \\"simply another business,\\" Livermore provocatively declared. In 1995, with the help of Green Day's \\"1,039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours\\" and \\"Kerplunk\\", Lookout Records made $10 million in sales. Co-founder Larry Livermore left the label in 1997. Under new management (1998‚Äì2004) After Livermore's departure, Chris Appelgren took over as the label's President while his wife Molly Neuman became Vice President and label employee Cathy Bauer took over as general manager. Screeching Weasel resigned with the label in 1998 for their album Emo. As part of an agreement, Lookout also purchased Ben Weasel's label Panic Button Records and would release albums from Panic Button acts including The Eyeliners, Enemy You and The Lillingtons. The move would be a major financial loss that would effect the label's royalty payouts in the following years. https://www.eastbayexpress.com/oakland/kerplunk/Content?oid=1079016&storyPage;=2 The label also switched its long time distribution affiliation with Mordam to RED Distribution. https://www.eastbayexpress.com/oakland/kerplunk/Content?oid=1079016&storyPage;=5 In 1998, the label signed Palo Alto-based band The Donnas and would release 3 albums from the band between 1998 and 2001 as well as reissue their debut album. https://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/A-punk-success-story- Lookout-Records-marks-15-2601635.php Despite decent sales and heavy coverage of the band from mainstream media outlets, The Donnas would depart for Atlantic Records in 2002. https://news.stanford.edu/2019/02/07/the-rockstar- on-campus/ Other veteran acts such as The Queers, Pansy Division and Avail would depart in the early 2000s citing poor promotion and the label's increasing attention and spending on new acts. By 2002, Lookout began to shift focus from its East Bay pop punk roots to a more diverse sound by releasing albums from bands such as Pretty Girls Make Graves, Teo Leo And The Pharmacists, The Oranges Band and Neuman's own band Bratmobile. The shift in direction and new releases from veteran acts like The Smugglers and The Mr. T Experience could not offset declining album sales and financial mismanagement including unprofitable showcases at the Warped Tour and CMJ. By 2004, the label had closed its retail store on University Avenue in Berkeley. Demise (2005‚Äì2012) On August 1, 2005, Green Day followed Avail, Blatz, Filth, Operation Ivy, Screeching Weasel, Riverdales, Lillingtons and Enemy You in announcing they had rescinded the master rights for their Lookout Records material. They cited continuing breach of contract regarding unpaid royalties. This led to the label laying off six of nine staff members. Appelgren told Punknews.org that the label would carry on in a scaled back form. Lookout Records turned 20 years old in 2008. In December 2009, the company entered a major financial reconstruction period. The label officially closed in January 2012. The label returned any remaining inventory, masters and artwork to the bands. Appelgren said he hoped bands would \\"... revisit their Lookout releases, with interesting and cool results.\\" Artists List of bands Lookout Records released at least one EP or full-length for: * American Steel * Ann Beretta * Auntie Christ * Avail * The Avengers * The Basicks * Big Rig * Bis * Black Cat Music * Black Fork * Blatz * The Bomb Bassets * Boris the Sprinkler * Born Against * Bratmobile * Brent's T.V. * Citizen Fish * Cleveland Bound Death Sentence * Common Rider * Communiqu√© * Corrupted Morals * The Cost * Couch of Eureka * The Criminals * Crimpshrine * Cringer * The Crumbs * Cub * The Cuts * The Donnas * The Dollyrots * Downfall * Dr. Frank * The Enemies * Enemy You * Engine Down * Even in Blackouts * Evening * Eyeball * The Eyeliners * Fifteen * Filth * The Frumpies * Fuel * Fun Bug * Furious George * The Gaza Strippers * Gene Defcon * The Go-Nuts * Go Sailor * Green Day * The Groovie Ghoulies * The Hi-Fives * Hockey Night * The Invalids * Isocracy * Jack Acid * The Jackie Papers * The Jimmies * Judy and the Loadies * Juke * Kamala and the Karnivores * The Lashes * The Lillingtons * The Lookouts * Mary Timony * Monsula * The Mopes * Moral Crux * The Mr. T Experience * The Ne'er Do Wells * Neurosis * Nuisance * One Time Angels * Operation Ivy * The Oranges Band * The Outrights * Pansy Division * Parasites * The Pattern * The PeeChees * The Phantom Surfers * Pinhead Gunpowder * Pitch Black * Plaid Retina * The Potatomen * Pot Valiant * Pretty Girls Make Graves * The Queers * Rancid * Raooul * The Reputation * Rice * Riverdales * Samiam * Scherzo * Screeching Weasel * Servotron * Sewer Trout * The Shangri-Lows * The Shotdowns * The Skinflutes * Skinned Teen * Sludgeworth * Small Brown Bike * The Smugglers * Spitboy * The Splash Four * Squirtgun * Stikky * Surrogate Brains * Sweet Baby * Swollen Boss Toad * Ted Leo and the Pharmacists * Tilt * Toilet B√∂ys * The Tourettes * Towards an End * Troubled Hubble * Twenty- Nineteen * Uranium 9-Volt * The Vagrants * The Wanna-Bes * Washdown * Wat Tyler * Worst Case Scenario * The Wynona Riders * Yeastie Girlz * Yesterday's Kids * (Young) Pioneers * The Zero Boys See also * List of record labels * Mordam Records FootnotesFurther reading=Articles * Chris Appelgren, \\"Hard to Say Goodbye,\\" Lookout Records official website, June 2010. * Matthew Artz, \\"Green Day Bolts from Berkeley's Lookout Records,\\" Berkeley Daily Planet, Aug. 5, 2005. * Rob Harvilla, \\"Kerplunk: The Rise and Fall of the Lookout Records Empire,\\", East Bay Express, Sept. 14, 2005. * Larry Livermore, \\"How I Became a Capitalist: The Lookout Records Story, Part One,\\" Lookout magazine no. 39 (Summer 1994). ‚ÄîOnly part published. * Matthew Perpetua, \\"Lookout Records Shuts Down Completely,\\" Rolling Stone, Jan. 17, 2012. * Maria Sherman, \\"Lookout Records Co-Founder Larry Livermore on Label's Shuttering,\\" Billboard, Jan. 19, 2012. * Aidin Vaziri, \\"Green Day Pulls the Plug on Iconic Berkeley Indie Label Lookout Over Unpaid Royalties,\\" San Francisco Chronicle, Aug. 6, 2005.

Since its foundation in 1868 it has been housed in the Venetian Gothic palace of Ca' Foscari, from which it takes its name. The palace stands on the Grand Canal, between the Rialto and San Marco, in the sestiere of Dorsoduro. The institute became a university in 1968. It currently has eight departments and almost 21,000 students. It is one of the highest ranked universities in Italy, ranking 5th in 2017 out of 89 universities. History The institution was founded as the Regia Scuola Superiore di Commercio (\\"royal high school of commerce\\") by a Royal Decree dated 6 August 1868, and teaching commenced in December of the same year. The idea of establishing such a school had arisen after the annexation of the Veneto to the new Kingdom of Italy in 1866, and was promoted by three people in particular: the Jewish political economist Luigi Luzzatti, later Prime Minister of Italy; Edoardo Deodati, senator of the Kingdom of Italy and vice- president of the province of Venice; and the Sicilian political economist Francesco Ferrara, director of the school for its first thirty years. The school was the first institute of higher education in commerce in Italy, and was from the outset conceived as a national rather than a regional institution; it had a diplomatic arm to prepare commercial consular staff for overseas service, and was also a training college for secondary school teachers of commercial subjects. Foreign languages were taught from the start. The school was modelled on the Institut Sup√©rieur de Commerce d'Anvers, founded in 1853 in Antwerp, Belgium. Following the establishment of a national syllabus for university teaching in 1935, the Istituto Superiore di Economia e Commercio di Venezia, as it was by then called, was authorised to teach and award four-year laurea degrees. In 1968 it obtained university status, and the name was changed to Universit√† degli Studi di Venezia. In the following year two new faculties were created, of industrial chemistry and of philosophy and letters. Organisation The university is divided into eight departments: * Economics * Philosophy and cultural heritage * Management * Environmental science, computer science and statistics * Molecular science and nanosystems * Linguistic and comparative cultural studies * Humanities * Asian and Mediterranean African studies Rankings Ca' Foscari is ranked among the best universities in Italy, ranking 5th in 2017 out of 89 universities. In 2017 Ca' Foscari's economics department was ranked as Italy's 3rd best, surpassed by University of Bologna and University of Padua. The QS World University Ranking by subject has placed Ca‚Äô Foscari of Venice among the top 100 universities in the world for modern languages, among the top 150 in the world for humanities, and among the top 200 in the world for economics and management. The University also ranked as the third best public university in Italy for their quality of research according to ANVUR (the National Agency for the Evaluation of University Research Systems) in 2018.  Nobel prize- winner lectures  In 2018 six recipients of the Nobel Prize gave lectures at the university: Robert F. Engle, Martin Karplus, Mario Vargas Llosa, Robert C. Merton, Amartya Sen, Wole Soyinka and Muhammad Yunus.

Design and description There were eight Attacker class escort carriers in service with the Royal Navy during the Second World War. They were built between 1941 and 1942 by Ingalls Shipbuilding and Western Pipe & Steel shipyards in the United States, both building four ships each.Cocker (2008), p.79. The ships had a complement of 646 men and crew accommodation was different from the normal Royal Navy's arrangements. The separate messes no longer had to prepare their own food, as everything was cooked in the galley and served cafeteria style in a central dining area. They were also equipped with a modern laundry and a barber shop.

History=Establishment Operation Ivy playing at Gilman As early as 1984, punk rock fan and Maximumrocknroll founder Tim Yohannan began thinking about establishment of an all ages music space in the San Francisco bay area where bands could play and interact with audience members free of the structure of conventional music promotion.Martin Sprouse in Brian Edge (ed.), 924 Gilman: The Story So Far... San Francisco, CA: Maximum Rocknroll, 2004; pg. 13. Actual organizational work began in 1985, with Yohannan joined in the effort by Victor Hayden, who had previously started a parallel project to start a punk club in Berkeley and who had already located a promising space in an industrial section of Berkeley.Kamala P. in Edge (ed.), 924 Gilman, pg. 38. Although Yohannan initially had misgivings about the 924 Gilman Street location spotted by Hayden, he was ultimately persuaded that the building was a suitable space for the project which was envisioned. Negotiations began with the landlord and in April 1986 a lease was signed.Tim Yohannan, \\"Interviewed by Hawk, April 1996,\\" in Edge (ed.), 924 Gilman, pg. 7. The organizing circle was expanded with a view to raising the $40,000 needed for rent and remodeling and for generating the volunteers necessary to make the construction project happen. Yohannan made use of his political connections and experience gained as a campaign volunteer for Berkeley Citizen's Action Group, an organization which had won majority control of the Berkeley City Council, and was able to call upon friends sitting on various city boards, urging their cooperation with the new venture.Yohannan in Edge (ed.), 924 Gilman, pp. 7‚Äì8. Berkeley mayor Gus Newport was supportive and project organizers crossed their t's and dotted their i's in winning the tacit approval for the project from businesses and residents of the area.Yohannan in Edge (ed.), 924 Gilman, pg. 8. The landlord also proved himself reliable and supportive of the goals of his new tenants. Tim Yohannan later recalled: > \\"We didn't know shit about construction, and people were coming out of the > woodwork, just showing up and helping‚Äîpeople who had the skills we needed, > carpenters, plumbers, electricians. We had to build new bathrooms, etc., and > pass the inspections. We got our final approval from the city the afternoon > of our first show, which was New Year's Eve, December 1986.\\" Rent on the 2,000 square foot building was $2,000 per month at the time of the club's launch‚Äîregarded as a reasonable and manageable rate. On December 31, 1986, the first musical performance was held at 924 Gilman. Since then, it has been one of the longest-running independent music venues in the United States. The club slowly progressed as a mecca for punk youth to get away from everyday issues at home, work, government, etc. In its initial phase hardcore punk shows were held three days a week‚Äîon Friday and Saturday nights as well as Sunday matinees.Jane G. in Edge (ed.), 924 Gilman, pg. 17. This quickly proved to be overwhelming for club volunteers, however, and as an alternative non- hardcore shows began to be run on Fridays by a separate crew of organizers.Jane G. in Edge (ed.), 924 Gilman, pp. 17‚Äì18. These Friday shows were more poorly attended than the Saturday night and Sunday afternoon hardcore extravaganzas but nevertheless served their purpose of providing an alternative venue to bands seeking to escape the grim reality of 21-and-over bar shows while allowing core volunteers to avoid the burnout associated with excessive event scheduling.Jane G. in Edge (ed.), 924 Gilman, pg. 18. This necessary scheduling adjustment had the serendipitous effect of diversifying and broadening the base of support for the 924 Gilman space. Founding principles As one early participant recalled, \\"in order to not be closed down by local police we had to have rules, such as no drinking in or around the club, no fighting, things like that.\\"Katja G. in Edge (ed.), 924 Gilman, pg. 21. This necessitated a regularized approach to security and resulted in events that were less violent than the 1980s hardcore norm, providing a more or less \\"safe environment\\" and sense of collective responsibility. Josh Levine, a long time punk rock fan, band member, and 1986 Gilman volunteer later recalled: > \\"There was something in the air, you could say, back then. A good feeling, > or a sense of pulling together, and unity among people who just wanted to > see bands that was free of sexism, homophobia, racism, and especially > violence. Shows were not as safe then‚Äîthere were shows I went to before > Gilman where I got beat up. ... Shows where I went to jail, just for being a > punk rock kid out after curfew. And worse, shows where I saw people getting > beat up by skinheads, or jocks, and there was not a damn thing I could do > about it if I wanted to stay healthy. Those were the kind of things that > motivated us to get involved.\\"Josh Levine in Edge (ed.), 924 Gilman, pg. 28. Despite a few early incidents of vandalism, a fertile creative environment rapidly developed. The venue saw the first public appearance of Operation Ivy, a thrashing ska-punk outfit that gained nearly instantaneous local popularity,Kamala in Edge (ed.), 924 Gilman, pg. 40. and was a proving grounds for the young Green Day‚Äîthe albums of whom helped to launch the Lookout Records empire of Larry Livermore and David Hayes. The eclectic sounds of this and other pioneer \\"Gilman bands\\" stood in contrast to the speed metal and ultra-aggressive hardcore which dominated the punk world during the middle 1980s.Ben Myers, Green Day: American Idiots and the New Punk Explosion. New York: The Disinformation Company, 2006; pg. 33. Staying true to the \\"independent spirit\\" was also a major component of the venue's philosophy, and many of the bands that started out at Gilman found themselves on the outs with the club after achieving mainstream success. Green Day's song \\"86\\" from their album Insomniac is about being banned from the club after their major label debut Dookie was released. September 1988 closure Although the Gilman \\"warehouse\\" provided a vital all-ages venue and spawned a vibrant local musical scene, its success was neither inevitable nor linear. On September 11, 1988, citing the \\"physical and emotional exhaustion\\" of volunteers, ongoing problems with vandalism, and financial difficulties resulting from a $16,000 legal award to a slam dancer who had fallen and broken his arm in the pit, and expiration of the building lease, Gilman shut its doors.\\"The Gilman Street Project, Dec. 31, 1986-Sept. 11, 1988: RIP ‚Äî The Spirit Lives!!!\\" Maximum Rocknroll, whole no. 65 (October 1988). Reprinted in Edge (ed.), 924 Gilman, pg. 78. In a published eulogy by Tim Yohannan, Gilman was remembered as a fun place where \\"the old macho bullshit got attacked\\" and a stand had been made against \\"creeping racist and fascist crap.\\" The club's core volunteers were not despondent, Yohannan noted, and hoped to \\"arrange special shows at other existing venues\\" in the future. A note was scrawled on a scrap of paper and taped to the window by Yohannan, noting that the Gilman Street Project was \\"now closed permanently due to lack of the creative juices necessary to make it worthwhile.\\"Yohannan note reprinted in Edge (ed.), 924 Gilman, pg. 79. Yohannan added that \\"apathy and taking Gilman for granted\\" had \\"led to a consumerist attitude\\" and that the decision had been made by core volunteers to \\"work together in other ways.\\" Although the September closure spelled an end to Tim Yohannan's personal connection with the club, core volunteers almost immediately reorganized to launch a \\"new club\\" at the 924 Gilman location, based upon the core principles established by the previous venture.Tim Yohannan, \\"More on Gilman Closing,\\" Maximum Rocknroll, whole no. 66 (November 1988). Reprinted in Edge (ed.), 924 Gilman, pg. 79. A new Gilman Street Project Newsletter was launched, in which it was announced that the number of shows would be cut from 8 to 5 a month to reduce volunteer workload and fan apathy.Jonathan D. in Edge (ed.), 924 Gilman, pg. 83. In addition, door prices were to be raised from $5 to $6 and a professional security guard was to be hired to help police troublemakers outside the venue. Booking, previously done by Tim Yo, would subsequently be done by new volunteers. 2016 Boycott In May 2016, members of the club's community anonymously called for a boycott of 924 Gilman in online posts over Facebook and Tumblrlefebvre,sam \\"Boycotters Accuse 924 Gilman St. Project of Ethical Backslide\\" https://www.eastbayexpress.com/oakland/boycotters- condemn-924-gilman-st-projects-ethical-backslide/Content?oid=4807011 , east bay express may 31 2016 anonymous, \\"Boycott 924 Gilman Street 2016\\" https://boycott924gilmanstreet.tumblr.com/ may 18 2016 citing several failures of the club in upholding its stated rules and ethics, notably a show featuring controversial hardcore punk bands Fang and Slapshot only narrowly being moved to an alternative venue, as well as allegations of sexism, transphobia and ableism made against some core volunteers at the time. Maximum Rocknroll expressed support for the boycott, with then-editor Grace Ambrose stating that \\"Gilman's actions run counter to the spirit that propels MRR\\" In 2018, the collective made an official response in the form of a Facebook post that acknowledged the frustrations brought to light by the boycott, as well as re-iterating the club's commitment to its values. gilman collective, january 1 2018 https://www.facebook.com/924Gilman/posts/1184533485015150?__tn__=K-R The response was made following the exit of many volunteers named in the boycott, and highlighted the diversity of its staff relative to earlier iterations of the club as well as stating a goal of \\"amplifying marginalized voices through the shows we book and the events we host\\" While the boycott has not officially concluded, several bands previously in support of the boycott have since returned to play at the venue.street eaters at 924 gilman https://www.facebook.com/events/171224144288086/  Music  Gilman showcases mostly punk rock, running the gamut from hardcore punk and grindcore to pop punk and ska punk, including as well industrial metal and, most recently, hip hop. Bands with major label contracts, including AFI, The Offspring, and Green Day, are only allowed to play the club when membership approves that individual show,Lefebvre, Sam, \\"Did Punk Break? Green Day Played Gilman Last Night.\\" Easy Bay Express, May 18, 2015. http://www.eastbayexpress.com/CultureSpyBlog/archives/2015/05/18/did-punk- break-green-day-played-gilman-last-night-photos a policy that enabled Green Day to play at Gilman again at least twice since they signed with a major label. Many of the other bands which have played the club in the past are now defunct. The venue still serves the East Bay and Northern California hardcore scene by bringing local, national, and international acts to the East Bay. A 2004 history of the club, 924 Gilman: The Story So Far, was written and edited by Brian Edge, who collected memories and anecdotes from many of the seminal contributors to the club's day-to-day operations from 1986 through publication in 2004. The book is available through AK Press and also contains a full list of Gilman's shows from 1986 through early 2004. Jello Biafra incident On May 7, 1994, an incident occurred in which former Dead Kennedys singer Jello Biafra was assaulted and injured. A group of rough slam dancers in the pit had been crashing into audience members.Tim Yohannan, \\"Something Ugly This Way Comes: Jello Biafra Beaten Up at Show,\\" Maximum Rocknroll, whole no. 134 (July 1994), pp. 46-49 (MRR News pp. 1-4). In the process one of these individuals, said to be a man using the punk rock name \\"Cretin,\\" knocked Biafra into a chair, with another rolling over his legs, causing serious damage to one knee and leg. Biafra is said to have yelled an epithet at the individual who crashed into him and demanded that he produce identification so that he could be billed for whatever hospital costs would ensue. A fight ensued, during which Biafra is said to have been knocked to the floor and held down, where he was kicked in the head by \\"Cretin.\\" During the incident others are said to have taunted Biafra, yelling \\"rich rock star\\" and \\"sellout.\\" Police were called but \\"Cretin\\" and his friends escaped the premises in a van bearing Arizona plates. Biafra was hospitalized, where it was determined that he suffered detached ligaments and a broken leg. Biafra was also forced to cancel a scheduled spoken word tour as a result of the injuries he suffered. Biafra held Maximum Rocknroll indirectly responsible for the incident, claiming that his assailants were repeating allegations that he was a \\"rich rock star\\" made in a column which had recently appeared in the magazine.

She was the second ship to carry the name. Barnes was laid down under a Maritime Commission contract and was transferred to the United States Navy on 1 May 1942. The ship was launched on 22 May 1942 by Seattle-Tacoma Shipbuilding, Tacoma, Washington, sponsored by Mrs. G. L. Hutchinson, the widow of Lieutenant Hutchinson. Barnes was commissioned on 20 February 1943 with Captain Cato Douglas Glover in command. Originally classified AVG-20, she was reclassified ACV-20 on 20 August 1942, CVE-20 on 15 July 1943, and CVHE-20 on 12 June 1955. Service history The major task of Barnes throughout World War II was the transporting of aircraft and personnel from the United States to the forward areas of the Pacific. In addition she served as a combat, training and pilot qualifying carrier. While performing these duties she launched her planes on several raids against Tarawa Atoll in the Gilbert Islands operation from 20 November‚Äì5 December 1943, and provided invaluable aircraft replenishment to the various task groups of the 3rd Fleet during the western Caroline Islands operation from 6 September‚Äì14 October 1944, and the Luzon attacks on 19 October 1944. After Japan's surrender, Barnes remained in the Far East on occupation duty until 3 November 1945. Returning to the United States in March 1946, Barnes remained on the West Coast for a period of time and then steamed to Boston, Massachusetts, where she was placed out of commission in reserve on 29 August 1946. Redesignated as a helicopter escort carrier (CVHE-20) on 12 June 1955, she was stricken for disposal on 1 March 1959. Awards Barnes was awarded three battle stars for her service during World War II.

The story was broken by The New York Sun during the 1872 campaign of Ulysses S. Grant. First, a fraudulent company, Cr√©dit Mobilier, was created by Union Pacific executives to greatly inflate construction costs. Though the railroad cost only $50 million to build, Cr√©dit Mobilier billed $94 million and Union Pacific executives pocketed the excess $44 million. Then, part of the excess cash and $9 million in discounted stock was used to bribe several Washington politicians for laws, funding, and regulatory rulings favorable to the Union Pacific.James Ford Rhodes, History of the United States from the Compromise of 1850 to the Final Restoration of Home Rule at the South in 1877: 1872-1877. Vol. 7, 1916, pp. 1-19. The scandal negatively affected the careers of many politicians and nearly bankrupted Union Pacific. The scandal caused widespread public distrust of Congress and the federal government during the Gilded Age.  Background  The scandal's origins dated to 1864, when the Union Pacific Railroad was chartered by Congress and the associated corporation Cr√©dit Mobilier was established. This company had no relation to the major French bank Cr√©dit Mobilier. In the Pacific Railroad Acts of 1864‚Äì68, Congress authorized and chartered the Union Pacific Railroad and provided $100 million (equivalent to over $1.6B in 2020) in capital investment to complete a transcontinental line west from the Missouri River to the Pacific coast. The federal government offered to assist the railroad with a loan of $16,000 to $48,000 per mile of track , variable according to location, for a total of more than $60 million in all, and a land grant of , worth $50 to $100 million. The offer initially attracted no subscribers for additional financing, as the conditions were financially daunting. Obstacles to investment The railroad would have to be built for through desert and mountains, which would mean extremely high freight costs for supplies. In addition, there was the likely risk of armed conflict with hostile tribes of Indians, who occupied many territories in the interior, and no probable early business to pay dividends. Moreover, there was no existing demand for railroad freight or passenger traffic for virtually the entire proposed route. Since no towns or cities of any significance yet existed on the western prairies, there was no commercial activity of any kind between Nebraska and the California border. Nor were there any branch lines running either north or south of the proposed route that would have been able to expand their traffic by connection with other future transcontinental railways. As a result, private investors refused to invest. The entire railroad scheme was proposed as a \\"going concern\\" ‚Äî a financially viable idea which relied on \\"below-market\\" financing and, thereafter, could continue to function as a business enterprise, covering its operating expenses through freight and passenger rail revenues. while providing profits for investors, interest payments to the US government for its borrowed U.S. government capital (at the Federal funds rate, based upon the US government bond rates), and, ultimately, realizing the retirement of its debt to the U.S. government. Private capital recognized that the realization of the objectives and economic projections of this proposed model were impossible. There simply was not a foreseeable demand for freight or passenger service capable of generating sufficient revenues.  Opposition  Opponents of the Pacific Railroad Acts believed the whole project was a bare-faced fraud by some capitalists to build a \\"railroad to nowhere\\" and to make tremendous profits doing so, while getting the United States government to bear the costs. The opponents of the Acts also thought the construction and its routing were being developed without regard for trying to create a viable and profitable transportation enterprise when the railroad line was completed.  Formation of Cr√©dit Mobilier of America  Thomas Durant, one of the founders of the Credit Mobilier company198x198px George Francis Train and Thomas C. Durant, the vice president of the Union Pacific Rail Road, formed Cr√©dit Mobilier of America in 1864. The creation of Cr√©dit Mobilier of America was a deliberate fa√ßade. Train and Durant aimed to present both to the government and to the general public the appearance that an independent corporate enterprise had been impartially chosen as the principal contractor and construction management firm for the project. In fact, Cr√©dit Mobilier was created to shield the companies's shareholders and management from the common charge that they were using the construction phase of the project, as opposed to the operating phase, to generate profit. As the conspirators believed that traditional profits from the operation of the railroad could not be expected, they created the sham company to charge the U.S. government extortionate fees and expenses during the construction phase.  Fraud  In simplified terms, the scheme worked as follows: * The Union Pacific made contracts with Cr√©dit Mobilier to build the railway at rates _significantly above cost_. * These construction contracts brought _high profits to Cr√©dit Mobilier_ , which was owned by Durant and the Union Pacific's other directors and principal stockholders. * The outsize profits were divided among the Union Pacific stockholders. The directors of the Union Pacific also engaged in stock fraud, circumventing requirements that they receive full payment for stock issued at par by instead paying Cr√©dit Mobilier in bank checks, which Cr√©dit Mobilier then used to purchase Union Pacific stock. In every major construction contract drawn up between the Union Pacific and Cr√©dit Mobilier, the contract's terms, conditions, and price had been offered and accepted through the actions of the same corporate officers and directors, operating on both sides of the contract. The underlying fraud of a common and unified ownership of the two companies, as regards their principal officers and directors, was not revealed for years.  Cover-up  The principal means of the fraud was the method of indirect billing. The Union Pacific presented genuine and accurate invoices to the U.S. government, as evidence of actual construction costs billed to them by Cr√©dit Mobilier of America for payment. Any audit of the Union Pacific invoices to the government would have revealed no evidence of fraud or profiteering, because the fraud took place one level deeper, on the invoices from Cr√©dit Mobilier to Union Pacific. Union Pacific was accepting for payment genuine Cr√©dit Mobilier invoices (based on fraudulent accounting) and was applying only an overhead expense for management and administration. If the Union Pacific's corporate officers had openly undertaken the management and construction of the railroad, this scheme to make windfall profits immediately from charges made during construction would have been exposed to public scrutiny by the opponents of the railroad project from the start.  Extent  Congress paid $94,650,287 to Cr√©dit Mobilier via the Union Pacific project, while Cr√©dit Mobilier incurred operating costs of only $50,720,959. Thus, the deal generated $43,929,328 in fraudulent profits (equivalent to over $724.9M in 2020) for Cr√©dit Mobilier, counting the Union Pacific shares and bonds that Cr√©dit Mobilier bought and paid itself. The Cr√©dit Mobilier directors reported this as a cash profit of only $23,366,319.81, a financial misrepresentation since these same directors were the recipients of the undisclosed $20,563,010 Union Pacific share of the total profits. Bribery Oakes AmesIn 1867, Cr√©dit Mobilier replaced Thomas Durant with Congressman Oakes Ames. Ames, still a member of Congress, distributed cash bribes and discounted shares of Cr√©dit Mobilier stock to fellow congressmen and other politicians in exchange for votes and actions favorable to the Union Pacific. Ames offered to members of Congress shares in Cr√©dit Mobilier at its discounted par value rather than the market value, which was much higher due to its superb (but fraudulent) profits and exclusive contract with the Union Pacific Railroad. It also declared substantial quarterly dividends on its stock. Those allowed to purchase shares at par value could reap enormous capital gains simply by offering these discounted shares on the market, knowing that they would be purchased at a higher price by investors desiring to own stock in such a profitable company. These same members of Congress made the company appear to be profitable by voting to appropriate additional government funds to cover Cr√©dit Mobilier's inflated charges. Ames's actions became one of the best-known examples of graft in American history.  Revelation and political impact  A politicla cartoon depicts 453x453px Following a disagreement with Ames, Henry Simpson McComb leaked compromising letters to The New York Sun, a reformist newspaper highly critical of incumbent President Ulysses S. Grant and his administration. On September 9, 1872, Sun broke the story.The Sun reported that Cr√©dit Mobilier had received $72 million in contracts for building a railroad worth only $53 million. After the revelations, the Union Pacific and other investors were left nearly bankrupt.  Congressional investigation  In 1872, the (Republican) House of Representatives submitted the names of nine politicians to the (Republican) Senate for investigation: * Representative William B. Allison of Iowa * Former Senator James A. Bayard, Jr. of Delaware * Former Representative George S. Boutwell of Massachusetts * Senator Roscoe Conkling of New York * Senator James Harlan of Iowa (retiring) * Senator John Logan of Illinois * Representative James W. Patterson of New Hampshire * Senator Henry Wilson of Massachusetts, also Grant's current running mate for Vice President * Vice President Schuyler Colfax All of those named were Republicans except Bayard, a Democrat who was largely dropped from the investigation after he wrote a letter disavowing any knowledge. Ultimately, Congress investigated 13 of its members in a probe that led to the censure of Oakes Ames and James Brooks, a Democrat from New York. During the 1872 campaign, Grant's running mate Henry Wilson initially denied involvement. However, in the February 1873 Senate investigation, Wilson admitted involvement and provided a complicated explanation claiming he had paid for stock in his wife's name, and with her money but had never taken possession of the shares. According to Wilson, when his wife (and later he himself) had concerns about the transaction, the transaction was reversed.Crawford, The Credit Mobilier of America: Its Origin and History, p. 126 Wilson's wife had died in 1870, so senators had to rely on Wilson's word and that of Ames, whose account corroborated Wilson's. The Senate accepted Wilson's explanation, and took no action against him, but his reputation for integrity was somewhat damaged because of his initial denial. Senator Henry L. Dawes of Massachusetts was also implicated. Dawes had purchased $1,000 in stock and had received a dividend. Dawes later had doubts about the propriety of the stock purchase and cancelled it. Ames returned the purchase price to Dawes with interest and Dawes returned the dividend to Ames. Dawes received $100 in interest on his returned purchase price, but he was not further implicated.  Department of Justice investigation  A Department of Justice investigation was also made with Aaron F. Perry as chief counsel. During the investigation, the government found that the company had given shares to more than 30 politicians from both parties, including James A. Garfield, Colfax, Patterson, and Wilson. James A. Garfield denied the charges and was elected President in 1880. In popular culture This scheme was dramatized in the AMC television series Hell on Wheels, beginning with the November 6, 2011 pilot episode. The scheme and scandal was proposed as a topic for a musical cabaret in season 10 of the FXX television series Archer.

The largest action of the war was the Fetterman Fight, with 81 U.S soldiers killed, and was the worst military defeat suffered by the United States Army on the Great Plains until the Battle of the Little Bighorn ten years later. After signing the Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868), Red Cloud led his people in the important transition to reservation life. Some of his opponents mistakenly thought of him as overall leader of the Sioux groups (Dakota, Lakota, and Nakota), but the large tribe had several major divisions and was highly decentralized. Bands among the Oglala and other divisions operated independently, even though some individual leaders were renowned as warriors and highly respected as leaders, such as Red Cloud. Early life Red Cloud was born close to the forks of the Platte River, near the modern-day city of North Platte, Nebraska. His mother, Walks As She Thinks, was an Oglala Lakota and his father, Lone Man, was a Brul√© Lakota leader. They came from two of the seven major Lakota divisions. As was traditional among the matrilineal Lakota, in which the children belonged to the mother's clan and people, Red Cloud was mentored as a boy by his maternal uncle, Old Chief Smoke (1774‚Äì1864). Old Chief Smoke played a major role in the boy's childhood, as the leader of the Bad Faces. He brought Red Cloud into the Smoke household when the boy's parents died around 1825. At a young age, Red Cloud fought against neighboring Pawnee and Crow bands, gaining much war experience. Red Cloud's War Red Cloud's War was the name the U.S. Army gave to a series of conflicts fought with Native American Plains tribes in the Wyoming and Montana territories. The battles were waged between the Northern Cheyenne, allied with Lakota and Arapaho bands, against the United States Army between 1866 and 1868. In December 1866, the Native American allies attacked and defeated a United States unit in what the whites would call the Fetterman Massacre (or the Battle of the Hundred Slain), which resulted in the most U.S. casualties of any Plains battle up to that point. Red Cloud Captain William J. Fetterman was sent from Fort Phil Kearny with two civilians and 79 cavalry and infantrymen to chase away a small Native American war party that had attacked a wood-gathering party days before. Captain Frederick Brown accompanied Fetterman; the two were confident in their troops and anxious to go to battle with the Native Americans. They disobeyed orders to stay behind the Lodge Trail Ridge and pursued a small decoy band of warriors, led by a Native American on an apparently injured horse. The decoy was the prominent warrior Crazy Horse. Fetterman and his troops followed the decoy into an ambush by more than 2,000 Sioux, Cheyenne, and Arapaho. Combined Native American forces suffered only 14 casualties, while they killed the entire 81-man U.S. detachment. Following this battle, a U.S. peace commission toured the Plains in 1867 to gather information to help bring about peace among the tribes and with the US. Finding that the Native Americans had been provoked by white encroachment and competition for resources, the commission recommended assigning definite territories to the Plains tribes. The Lakota, Northern Cheyenne, Arapaho, and other bands settled for peace with the U.S. under the Treaty of Fort Laramie. The U.S. agreed to abandon its forts and withdraw completely from Lakota territory. Treaty of 1868 The treaty established the Great Sioux Reservation, covering the territory of West River, west of the Missouri River in present-day Nebraska (which had been admitted as a state in 1867), and including parts of South Dakota. Uneasy relations between the expanding United States and the natives continued. In 1870, Red Cloud visited Washington D.C., and met with Commissioner of Indian Affairs Ely S. Parker (a Seneca and U.S. Army General), and President Ulysses S. Grant. In 1871, the government established the Red Cloud Agency on the Platte River, downstream from Fort Laramie. As outlined in the 1868 Treaty, the agency staff were responsible for issuing weekly rations to the Oglala, as well as providing the annually distributed supply of cash and annuity goods. The agent and Washington officials would determine how much of the annuity was to be paid in cash or goods, and sometimes the supplies were late, in poor condition, inadequate in amount, or never arrived at all. Red Cloud took his band to the agency (a predecessor of the Native American reservation) and tried to help them in the transition to a different way of life. In the fall of 1873, the agency was removed to the upper White River in northwestern Nebraska. (source?) According to Charles A. Eastman (Ohiyesa) Red Cloud was the last to sign \\"..having refused to do so until all of the forts within their territory should be vacated. All of his demands were acceded to, the new road abandoned, the garrisons withdrawn, and in the new treaty it was distinctly stated that the Black Hills and the Big Horn were Indian country, set apart for their perpetual occupancy, and that no white man should enter that region without the consent of the Sioux. ... Scarcely was this treaty signed, however, when gold was discovered in the Black Hills, and the popular cry was: \\"Remove the Indians!\\"... The government, at first, entered some small protest, just enough to \\"save its face\\"... but there was no serious attempt to prevent the wholesale violation of the treaty.\\" Indian Heroes and Great Chieftains, By Charles A.

He soon became embroiled in a controversy with the new Indian agent, Dr. John J. Saville. In 1874, Lieutenant Colonel George Custer led a reconnaissance mission into Sioux territory that reported gold in the Black Hills, an area held sacred by the local Native Americans. Previously the army had unsuccessfully tried to keep miners out of the region, and the threat of violence grew. In May 1875, Lakota delegations headed by Red Cloud, Spotted Tail, and Lone Horn traveled to Washington in an attempt to persuade President Grant to honor existing treaties and stem the flow of miners into their lands. The Native Americans met on various occasion with Grant, Secretary of the Interior Delano, and Commissioner of Indian Affairs Smith. He told them on May 27 that Congress was ready to resolve the matter by paying the tribes $25,000 for their land and resettling them into Indian Territory. The delegates refused to sign such a treaty, with Spotted Tail saying about the proposal: > When I was here before, the President gave me my country, and I put my stake > down in a good place, and there I want to stay. ... You speak of another > country, but it is not my country; it does not concern me, and I want > nothing to do with it. I was not born there. ... If it is such a good > country, you ought to send the white men now in our country there and let us > alone. Although Red Cloud was unsuccessful in finding a peaceful solution, he did not take part in the Lakota war of 1876‚Äì1877, which was led by T»üa≈°√∫≈ãke Witk√≥ (Crazy Horse) and T»üat»ü√°≈ãka √çyotake (Sitting Bull). In the fall of 1877, the Red Cloud Agency was removed to the upper Missouri River. The following year it was removed to the forks of the White River, in present-day South Dakota, where it was renamed the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. His last days Othniel C. Marsh and Red Cloud pictured in New Haven, Connecticut, c. 1880 Red Cloud became an important leader of the Lakota as they transitioned from the freedom of the plains to the confinement of the reservation system. His trip to Washington, DC had convinced him of the number and power of European Americans, and he believed the Oglala had to seek peace. He visited (not for the first time) the palaeontologist and geologist Othniel C. Marsh in New Haven, Connecticut in around 1880. Marsh had first visited the Red Cloud Agency in 1874, alleging, among other things, that \\"the Indians suffered for want of food and other supplies because they were cheated out of annuities and beef cattle and were issued inedible pork, inferior flour, poor sugar and coffee and rotten tobacco.\\"Waltmann, Henry George (1962). \\"The Interior Department, War Department and Indian Policy, 1865-1887\\". D.Phil. dissertation. Department of History, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, p. 269 [pdf 281]. Retrieved 10 December 2019. In 1884, he and his family, along with five other leaders, converted and were baptized as Catholics by Father Joseph Bushman. Red Cloud continued fighting for his people, even after being forced onto the reservation. In 1887 Red Cloud opposed the Dawes Act, which broke up communal tribal holdings, and allocated 160-acre plots of land to heads of families on tribal rolls for subsistence farming. The U.S. declared additional communal tribal lands as excess, and sold it to immigrant settlers. In 1889 Red Cloud opposed a treaty to sell more of the Lakota land. Due to his steadfastness and that of Sitting Bull, government agents obtained the necessary signatures for approval through subterfuge, such as using the signatures of children. He negotiated strongly with Indian Agents such as Dr. Valentine McGillycuddy. Outliving all the other major Lakota leaders of the Indian Wars, Red Cloud died on Pine Ridge Reservation in 1909 at the age of 87, and was buried there in the cemetery now bearing his name. In old age, he is quoted as having said, \\"They made us many promises, more than I can remember. But they kept but one -- They promised to take our land ... and they took it.\\" Legacy and honors Announcements of Red Cloud's death and recognition of his achievements were printed in major newspapers across the country. As had been typical of the U.S. perception during Red Cloud's prominence in war, The New York Times' article on his death mistakenly described him as leader of all the Sioux bands and tribes, but noted his abilities as a leader and diplomat. While he was a prominent leader, the Lakota were highly decentralized and never had one overall leader, especially of the major divisions, such as Oglala and Brul√©. Red Cloud was the most photographed American Indian of the nineteenth century. There are 128 known photographs picturing Red Cloud. He was first photographed in 1872 in Washington D.C. by Mathew Brady, just before meeting with President Grant. He was also among the Indians photographed by Edward S. Curtis. In 2000, he was posthumously selected for induction into the Nebraska Hall of Fame. He has been honored by the United States Postal Service with a 10¬¢ Great Americans series postage stamp. In 1871, the town of Red Cloud, Nebraska was named in his honor. Theodore Sorensen wrote in Kennedy that President John F. Kennedy considered naming one of the 41 for Freedom ballistic missile submarines after Red Cloud, but apparently bowed to Pentagon concerns that the name could be misinterpreted as being pro-Communist.

The Sagal twins enjoyed a brief run as the stars of a sitcom, Double Trouble, in 1984.

Their primary purpose is to provide detailed depth contours of ocean topography as well as provide the size, shape and distribution of underwater features. Topographic maps display elevation above ground and are complementary to bathymetric charts. Charts use a series of lines and points at equal intervals to showcase depth or elevation. A closed shape with increasingly smaller shapes inside of it can indicate an ocean trench or a seamount, or underwater mountain, depending on whether the depths increase or decrease going inward.Bathymetric map of Loihi SeamountBathymetric surveys and charts are associated with the science of oceanography, particularly marine geology, and underwater engineering or other specialized purposes. Bathymetric Map of Medicine Lake, CABathymetric data used to produce charts can also be converted to bathymetric profiles which are vertical sections through a feature.Bear Lake  History = Ancient Egypt  The use of bathymetry and the development of bathymetric charts dates back around the 19th century BC to ancient Egypt. Depictions on tomb walls such as the bas-relief carvings of Deir al-Bahri commissioned by Queen Hatshepsut in the 16th century BC show ancient mariners using long slender poles as sounding poles to determine the depth of the Nile River and into the Nile River Delta.  Ancient Greece  The first written account and mapped records of sounding did not occur until 1000 years after the Egyptians had begun sounding and mapping the Nile. The Greek historian Herodotus writes of a sounding in 66 feet of water of the mouth of the Nile in the river delta. He writes of yellow mud being brought up similar to the same that was deposited with the yearly floods. These accounts show a heightened awareness of regional depths and seafloor characteristics among ancient mariners and demonstrate that discoveries in bathymetry and the use of bathymetric charts had progressed significantly.  Ancient Rome  The New Testament recounts soundings being taken with the shipwreck of Paul on the island of Malta in the Book of Acts. Chapter 27, verses 27-44 recount the experience: > 27 \\"...as we were driven up and down in Adria, about midnight the shipmen > deemed that they drew near to some country;\\" 28 \\"And sounded, and found it > twenty fathoms: and when they had gone a little further, they sounded again, > and found it fifteen fathoms.\\" 29 \\"Then fearing lest we should have fallen > upon rocks, they cast four anchors out of the stern...\\" 39 \\"And when it was > day, they knew not the land...\\" 40 \\"And when they had taken up the anchors, > they committed themselves unto the sea . . . and made toward shore.\\" 41 And > falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground; and the > forepart stuck fast, and remained unmoveable, but the hinder part was broken > with the violence of the waves. Verse 39 states that \\"they knew not the land\\" indicating that their knowledge of sea was obtained from the experiences of others as well as the memory of having been there before. Sailing directions called a periplus did exist by the First Century A.D. giving general coastal configurations. Commercially avalaible charts of the depths of the sea and surrounding coast would not be avalaible for almost another thousand years.  Early modern period  Up to this point, bathymetric charts were rare as mariners continued to rely on heavy ropes and lead weights to take depth readings and chart the open ocean. Minor advances in the surveying and depth charting of the oceans occurred in the 200 years since Columbus sailed to the Americas. In 1647, Robert Dudley published the atlas, 'Dell Arcano del Mare (Secrets of the Sea). His work far outpaced anything that had been published previously with maps and charts constructed in the Mercator projection as well as containing some of the first charts to show printed depths on the North American Atlantic Seaboard. His publication provided the groundwork for future mariners and inventors to continue to develop new and inventive ways to produce high quality charts and surveys of the world's lakes and oceans.  Comparison with hydrographic chart  A bathymetric chart differs from a hydrographic chart in that accurate presentation of the underwater features is the goal, while safe navigation is the requirement for the hydrographic chart. A hydrographic chart will obscure the actual features to present a simplified version to help mariners avoid underwater hazards.  Joining a bathymetric chart and topographic map  In an ideal case, the joining of a bathymetric chart and topographic map of the same scale and projection of the same geographic area would be seamless. The only difference would be that the values begin increasing after crossing the zero at the designated sea level datum. Thus the topographic map's mountains have the greatest values while the bathymetric chart's greatest depths have the greatest values. Simply put, the bathymetric chart is intended to show the land if overlying waters were removed in exactly the same manner as the topographic map.  Within hydrography  Bathymetric surveys are a subset of the science of hydrography. They differ slightly from the surveys required to create the product of hydrography in its more limited application and as conducted by the national and international agencies tasked with producing charts and publications for safe navigation. That chart product is more accurately termed a navigation or hydrographic chart with a strong bias toward the presentation of essential safety information.  Bathymetric surveys  Originally, bathymetry involved the measurement of ocean depth through depth sounding. Early techniques used weighted rope or cable lowered over a ship's side. This technique measures the depth at one point at a time, and is therefore inefficient. It is also subject to movements of the ship and currents moving the line out of true and stretch of the line, therefore is not accurate. The data used to make bathymetric maps typically comes from an echosounder (sonar) mounted beneath or over the side of a boat, \\"pinging\\" a beam of sound downward at the seafloor or from remote sensing LIDAR or LADAR systems. The time it takes for the sound or light to travel through the water, bounce off the seafloor, and return to the transducer is proportional to the distance to the seafloor. LIDAR/LADAR surveys are usually conducted by airborne systems. The seafloor topography near the Puerto Rico Trench Since the early 1930s, single-beam sounders were used to make bathymetry maps. More recently multibeam echosounders (MBES) are typically used, which use hundreds of very narrow adjacent beams arranged in a fan-like swath of typically 90 to 170 degrees across. The tightly packed array of narrow individual beams provides very high angular resolution. The width of the swath is depth dependent, and allows a boat to map more seafloor per transect than a single-beam echosounder by making fewer passes. The beams update many times per second (typically 0.1‚Äì50 Hz depending on water depth), allowing faster boat speed while maintaining high coverage of the seafloor. Attitude sensors provide data for the correction of the boat's roll and pitch, and a gyrocompass provides accurate heading information to correct for vessel yaw. A Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)) positions the soundings with respect to the surface of the earth. Sound speed profiles (speed of sound in water as a function of depth) of the water column correct for refraction or \\"ray-bending\\" of the sound waves owing to non-uniform water column characteristics such as temperature, conductivity, and pressure. A computer system processes all the data, correcting for all of the above factors as well as for the angle of each individual beam. The resulting sounding measurements are then processed to produce a map. Satellites are also used to measure bathymetry. Satellite radar maps deep-sea topography by detecting the subtle variations in sea level caused by the gravitational pull of undersea mountains, ridges, and other masses. On average, sea level is higher over mountains and ridges than over abyssal plains and trenches.

Incumbents =National level President *Friedrich Ebert (Social Democrats) Chancellor *Gustav Bauer (Social Democrats) to 27 March, then Hermann M√ºller (1st term) (Social Democrats) to 25 June, then Constantin Fehrenbach (Centre)  Overview  Consider first the territorial changes which had been brought about by the Treaty of Versailles (and also certain internal territorial rearrangements which had taken place as the result of the revolution). By the Treaty of Versailles provinces had been severed from Germany in almost all directions. The two most important cessions of territory were the loss of Alsace-Lorraine to France and of a large stretch of territory in West Prussia, Posen, and Upper Silesia to Poland. Of these, the territory ceded to Poland amounted to nearly , and, coupled with the establishment of Danzig as an independent state, which was also imposed upon Germany, this loss had the effect of cutting off East Prussia from the main territory of Germany. Danzig and Memel were to be ceded to the Allies, their fate to be subsequently decided. A portion of Silesia was to be ceded to Czechoslovakia. Also, apart from the actual cessions of territory, the treaty arranged that plebiscites should be held in certain areas to decide the destinies of the districts concerned. Certain districts of East Prussia and West Prussia were to poll to decide whether they should belong to Germany or to Poland. A third portion of Silesia, which was in dispute between Germany and Poland, was to exercise the right of self-determination. The small districts of Eupen and Malmedy were to decide whether they would belong to Belgium or to Germany. The middle and southern districts of the province of Schleswig, which had been annexed to Prussia in 1866, were to decide their own destinies. Finally, the coal-producing valley of the Saarland, which had been provisionally separated from Germany, was to be the subject of a referendum after the lapse of fifteen years. The Allied and Associated governments had assumed the task of revising territorial changes and arrangements dating back to the latter half of the 18th century. The conference cancelled completely the expansion of Germany over the past 150 years; but did not cancel the schism in Germany‚Äîthe exclusion of Austria‚Äîwhich had been incidental to that expansion. Cut with the Kitchen Knife Dada Through the Last Weimar Beer-Belly Cultural Epoch in Germany is an example of photomontage by Dada artist Hannah H√∂ch. She is considered a progenitor of the subversive art style Raoul Hausmann, George Grosz, Hannah H√∂ch and other artists helped establish the Berlin wing of the Dada movement, an avant garde artistic movement that defied the established forms of classical art. Photomontage, a technique Hausmann claims to have originated with H√∂ch in 1918, becomes associated with Berlin Dada style.  Events =Internal territorial changes in Germany The following describes the internal territorial rearrangements which were made after the establishment of the German republic. During the period of the Hohenzollern empire there had been twenty-six states within the German federation. During the war the number had been reduced by one by the fusion of the principalities of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt and Schwarzburg-Sondershausen. After the revolution there was a rapid reduction in the number of smaller states. Alsace-Lorraine was, of course, returned to France, and the two principalities of Reuss‚Äîthe so-called Elder and Younger lines‚Äîunited into a single state. The Duchy of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha split into two halves; Coburg voluntarily united itself with Bavaria, and Gotha later in the year 1919 entered into negotiations with a number of the other small states of central Germany to bring about a general union of the little republics concerned. Six states took part in these negotiations, which were brought to a successful conclusion at the end of December 1919. The states which thus agreed to unite were: (1) Schwarzburg, (2) Reuss, (3) Gotha, (4) Saxe-Weimar, (5) Saxe- Meiningen, and (6) Saxe-Altenburg. The total population of the United States was just over 1,500,000, and their joint area was just over . The states took the name of Thuringia (Einheitsstaat Th√ºringen). The town of Weimar was made the capital of the new state. It will be seen that owing to these various fusions and changes the twenty-six states of the German federation were reduced to eighteen. Political situation at the beginning of the year In considering the general political situation in the country at the beginning of 1920, it is notable that from the time of the revolution until the end of 1919, the Liberal and Radical parties in combination with the so-called Majority Social Democratic Party had held power continuously, and had been strikingly confirmed in their position by the general election held in January 1919. The chief point of interest in the general election had been the close correspondence of the results with those that used to be obtained in the elections for the old Reichstag in the time of the Empire. On February 11, 1919, the new parliament elected Friedrich Ebert as president of the German republic. Philipp Scheidemann acted as minister-president during the first half of 1919, but at the time of the signing of the treaty of peace in June he was succeeded by Gustav Bauer, one of the best-known leaders of the Majority Social Democratic Party, who had not been a member of Scheidemann's government. The government persevered but the ministry and the parties which supported them were placed in an unstable and very difficult position. On one side, the government had to face the extreme hostility of the conservative party, who had been opposed from the beginning to the new republican institutions. On the other side, they faced the extreme revolutionaries, who, for entirely different reasons, had been opposed to the submission to the Entente, and desired an alliance with the Bolshevik forces of the Soviet Union. During 1919 the government had been faced greater difficulties from the parties of the left than the parties of the right, and the extreme Socialists had made several unsuccessful attempts at armed insurrection. The reactionary groups were also capable of making serious trouble for the government. Anti-government agitation During January and February there were no events of first-class importance, but in March there were kaleidoscopic changes in Berlin, which illustrated dramatically the difficulty of the position of the moderate German government, placed as it was, between the extremists of the right and of the left. During the early weeks of the year certain people in the conservative party were agitating actively against the government, and were endeavouring to find some pretext‚Äîpreferably a democratic pretext‚Äîfor taking action against them. One of the most prominent persons in this movement was Dr. Wolfgang Kapp, who had once held office as president of East Prussia, and had been a founder of the Fatherland Party and an associate of the Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz. During January and February Kapp entered into correspondence with the prime minister, Bauer, and brought complaints against the government. The chief of these complaints were that Ebert had remained in power too long, since according to the constitution the president ought to be elected by the whole nation, and not merely (as Ebert had been) by the National Assembly; that the ministry itself had likewise retained power too long, since it and the parliament which supported it were elected and established only for the purpose of concluding peace; that the government's administration had been inefficient and had failed to restore the economic position in the country, which had remained deplorable since the conclusion of the armistice. There was but little substance in any of these charges, except, perhaps, the first; and there is every reason to suspect that they were only put forward as a cover for different, and possibly sinister, designs. Ebert and Bauer naturally paid no attention to Dr. Kapp's demands; and in the middle of March the reactionaries seem to have thought that the time had arrived for them to come out into the open and declare opposition. On March 12 Bauer appears to have obtained information regarding the plot, and possibly it was this which induced the conspirators to act earlier than they had intended and certainly prematurely. Kapp had obtained an important accomplice in the person of General Baron Walther von L√ºttwitz, who was the commander of the 1st Division of the Reichswehr. Another commander of the Reichswehr, General Georg Maerker, also appears to have been very doubtful in his loyalty to the government. During the past twelve months both these soldiers had served well under the able, but ruthless, cruel, and traitorous war minister, Gustav Noske, in the work of suppressing the insurrections of the Spartacists, a group of anti-war German radicals. Repression of the German pacifists and internationalists, it would turn out, was an activity in which reactionaries and moderates could easily cooperate without friction. Coup in Berlin Finding that his plot was discovered, Dr. Kapp attempted a sudden coup d'√©tat in Berlin, which met with fleeting success. Supported by the Marine Brigade Erhardt (the first paramilitary group to use the swastika as its emblem), by the irregular \\"Baltic\\" troops (the German troops who had occasioned trouble in Courland in the previous year by fighting independently of any government), who were now stationed at D√∂beritz, by the former guard cavalry division, and by the Reichswehr troops whom General von L√ºttwitz had led, Kapp advanced upon Berlin in the early hours of March 13. Realizing that the generals in command of the Reichswehr had betrayed their trust, Ebert and Bauer fled from Berlin to Dresden, and were fortunate in being able to escape before the Baltic troops arrived. Immediately after he reached Berlin, at 10 am, Dr. Kapp issued a proclamation declaring that the Ebert-Bauer administration had ceased to exist and that he was himself acting as imperial chancellor, and that General von L√ºttwitz had been appointed minister of defense. The proclamation also stated that Dr. Kapp only regarded his administration as provisional, and that he would \\"restore constitutional conditions\\" by holding new elections. The new government disclaimed any intention of restoring the monarchy, but all Kapp's chief supporters were monarchists, and he had the old imperial colours‚Äîblack, white, and red‚Äîhoisted in the capital. It was also perhaps significant that immediately after the coup d'√©tat much coming and going was reported from ex- Kaiser Wilhelm II's Dutch home at Amerongen. Ebert and his associates were not slow to decide upon the measures to be taken against the reactionaries. They issued an appeal to the working classes to engage in a drastic general strike. The appeal, which was signed by Ebert, Bauer, and Noske, read as follows: :\\"The military revolt has come. Ehrhardt's naval brigade is advancing on Berlin to overthrow the government. These servants of the state, who fear the dissolution of the army, desire to put reactionaries in the seat of the government. We refuse to bend before military compulsion. We did not make the revolution in order to have again to recognize militarism. We will not cooperate with the criminals of the Baltic states. We should be ashamed of ourselves, did we act otherwise. :A thousand times, No! Cease work! Stifle the opportunity of this military dictatorship! Fight with all the means at your command to retain the republic. Put all differences of opinion aside. :Only one means exists against the return of Wilhelm II. That is the cessation of all means of communication. No hand may be moved. No proletarian may assist the dictator. Strike along the whole line.\\" The response to this appeal by the working classes was enthusiastic and almost universal. Except in East Prussia and to some extent in Pomerania and Silesia, the Kapp \\"government\\" obtained scarcely any support in the country; and the Saxon, Bavarian, W√ºrttemberg, and Baden governments all rallied to the support of President Ebert‚Äîthough notwithstanding the loyalty of the Saxons, the president and the prime minister thought it advisable to remove from Dresden to Stuttgart. Kapp and von L√ºttwitz met with the bitter hostility of the working classes in Berlin, who succeeded in bringing to a standstill the whole life of the capital. It was, indeed, apparent after forty-eight hours that the extraordinary success of the general strike would make the new Kapp regime impossible. During the first two days there were rumours that in order to avoid civil war Ebert and Bauer were willing to compromise with the conspirators; but it soon became obvious that any such course would be unnecessary. The feature which hampered Kapp fatally was the complete success of the strike in Berlin itself; and since his writ did not even run in the capital, the usurping chancellor felt compelled to resign on March 17. He endeavoured to cover up his failure, by alleging that his mission had been fulfilled, in that the government had now proclaimed that they would hold a general election within a few weeks, but his protestations notwithstanding, it was obvious to all the onlookers that his real designs had been to displace the old government altogether, and very probably to upset the entire republican regime. A meeting of the National Assembly was held at Stuttgart on March 18, and the prime minister made a long speech dealing with Kapp's escapade, but before then, the crisis had already passed‚Äîand had in fact given place to a crisis of a totally different kind. On March 18 some of the members of the government returned to Berlin, and on that day also Kapp's troops‚Äîwho were known as the \\"Baltic\\" troops, although the name properly applied only to a section of them‚Äîleft the capital. Their departure was unfortunately marked by a most disagreeable incident. As they marched through the streets towards the Brandenburg Gate, the populace which had always been entirely hostile to them, collected in great numbers and followed the soldiers, jeering vociferously. The legionaries were in an ill- humour at the failure of their coup, and being further aggravated by the behaviour of the crowds, when the last detachment reached the Brandenburg Gate they wheeled about, and fired several volleys into the mass of civilians who had followed them. A panic ensued, and a considerable number of persons were killed and wounded. Kapp himself fled to Sweden. See also Kapp Putsch. Return of government When the government returned to the capital, they found that the strike which they had utilized to overcome Kapp had now got beyond control; and indeed in the east end of Berlin, Soviets were being declared, and Daunig had declared himself president of a new German Communist republic. The government called off the strike, but a large number of the strikers refused to return to work. On March 19 Spartacist risings occurred in many different places, especially in western Prussia, Bavaria, W√ºrttemberg, and Leipzig. In Leipzig the rising was extremely serious, and in suppressing this local insurrection the government had to use aeroplanes over the streets of the city in order to intimidate the Communists. The Communist leaders decided to direct the strike, the power of which had been proved against Kapp, against the government itself. In Berlin, with the active assistance of the prime minister of Prussia, Paul Hirsch, the federal government were soon able to gain control of affairs; and in Saxony, Bavaria, and W√ºrttemberg the troops were also able to overcome speedily the insurrection. But in the west, in Westphalia and the Rhineland, the situation became extremely serious. The position was in this part of Germany complicated by the existence of the neutral zone lying between the territory occupied by the Entente, and the main part of Germany, where the government were of course free to move their forces as they pleased. Apart from a small force for police purposes, the German government were not allowed to send troops into the neutral zone. The military police in the zone were quite incapable of dealing with the Spartacist insurrection; and the insurgents speedily took possession of Essen, after a treacherous attack on the rear of the small government force. The revolutionists also seized Wesel. The union of \\"Red\\" Germany with Bolshevik Russia was proclaimed. The government took alarm at the development of the Spartacist peril, and on March 23 it was even rumoured that a purely Socialist government‚Äîcontaining several members of the Independent Social Democratic Party‚Äîwas to be formed. This rumour proved to be untrue, but two of the ablest members of the cabinet, Noske and Matthias Erzberger, who were especially obnoxious to the Communists, were asked by Bauer to resign. The resignation of these two ministers was in some sense a concession to the extremists, but the latter refused to consider compromise. Feeling overwhelmed with the difficulty of the situation, Bauer himself resigned on March 26. Fortunately Ebert had no difficulty in finding a statesman willing to undertake the burden of the chancellorship. The president asked Hermann M√ºller, who had previously held the office of minister for foreign affairs, to form an administration. Within forty-eight hours it was announced that M√ºller had succeeded in forming a cabinet, which included (as did the previous administration) members of all the three moderate parties, the Clericals, the Democrats, and the Majority Social Democrats. The new cabinet was composed as follows: { -----  Chancellor and Minister for Foreign Affairs Hermann M√ºller -----  Undersecretary for Foreign Affairs  von Haniel -----  Minister of the Interior and Vice-Chancellor  Erich Koch-Weser -----  Minister of Posts  Johannes Giesberts -----  Minister of Finance  Joseph Wirth -----  Minister of Transport  Johannes Bell -----  Minister of Justice  Andreas Blunck -----  Minister of Labour  Alexander Schlicke -----  Minister of Economics  Robert Schmidt -----  Minister of Defense  Otto Gessler -----  Minister of Food  Andreas Hermes -----  Minister without Portfolio  Eduard David -----  President of the Treasury  Gustav Bauer } M√ºller's tenure of the Foreign Office was only temporary, and before the middle of April he relinquished that position to Dr. Adolf K√∂ster. At the same time there was a reconstruction of the government of Prussia, Otto Braun becoming premier. The new ministry was constituted on much the same lines as that of Germany, and including members of all the three moderate parties. Ruhr Uprising As soon as he assumed office M√ºller had to deal with the pressing problem of the insurrection in the Ruhr valley, and the neutral zone generally. The German government applied to the Allies for permission to send troops into the disturbed districts in excess of the numbers allowed by the Treaty of Versailles. It appears that in view of the situation which had arisen the British and Italian governments made various suggestions for a temporary modification of these particular provisions of the Treaty of Versailles (Articles 42 to 44). It was proposed, for instance, that German forces might be allowed to occupy the Ruhr valley under whatever guarantees Marshal Foch might think necessary; or that the German troops should be accompanied by Allied officers; or that the matter should be left in the hands of the German government with a warning that if the neutral zone were not re- evacuated as soon as practicable, a further district of Germany would be occupied by the Entente. The French government, however, raised difficulties; and declared that if the Germans were allowed to send forces into the Ruhr District, they (the French) should be allowed to occupy Frankfurt, Homburg, and other neighbouring German towns, with the sanction of the Allies, during the period that the German troops were in the neutral zone. Owing to these differences of opinion between the Allied governments no quick decision was reached; in the meantime, the insurrection in the Ruhr Valley was becoming daily more serious. Moreover, the German government themselves hindered a settlement by indicating that they could not accept the French suggestion of a parallel occupation of Frankfurt by French troops. It was obvious that matters would soon reach a crisis, notwithstanding the conciliatory efforts of the British government It came as no great surprise, when, on April 3, German regular troops, of the Reichswehr, entered the neutral zone in force, although no permission for them to do so had been granted by the Entente. The troops were under the command of General von Watter, and they experienced no serious difficulty in dealing with the Spartacists, although the latter possessed some artillery. The revolutionary headquarters at M√ºlheim were taken on April 4. International intervention These incidents led to somewhat sensational developments between the French, British, and German governments. Immediately after the German troops crossed the line, the French government itself gave orders to its own troops to advance, and Frankfurt was occupied on April 6 and Homburg on the following day. The French government proclaimed the necessity of this move on the ground that Articles 42 to 44 of the Treaty of Versailles had been broken by the Germans. The French advance occasioned extreme bitterness of feeling in Germany, more particularly as some of the occupying troops were black; and the attitude of the crowds in Frankfurt became so hostile, that on one occasion the French troops brought a machine-gun into action, and a number of civilians were killed and wounded. The British government also disapproved of the French action, partly because they regarded the advance as an extreme measure which should only have been adopted in the last resort, and still more so because the French move had been made independently, and without the sanction of the other Allied governments. The British held that the enforcement of the terms of the Treaty of Versailles was an affair for the Allies collectively, and not for any single Allied government. The Franco-British difference of opinion was, however, of short duration (see 1920 in France); and it was soon made clear that whilst the British government were disposed to think that there had been a genuine necessity to send the German troops into the Ruhr valley, they were equally as determined as the French to see that the terms of the treaty were observed. And the extreme rapidity with which the German troops overcame the revolutionaries tended to bring the whole crisis to an end. On April 12 M√ºller made a statement on the situation in the National Assembly at Berlin. He complained of French militarism, and in particular that Senegalese negroes should have been quartered in Frankfurt University. He laid the blame for the developments largely upon Kapp and his associates; and said that it was owing to the undermining of the loyalty of the Reichswehr by the reactionaries, that the working classes had now lost confidence in the republican army. The latest casualty list which had been received from the disturbed area proved the severity of the actions which had taken place; 160 officers and men had been killed and nearly 400 had been wounded. The advance of the German troops into the Ruhr had been necessary in order to protect the lives and property of peaceable citizens living in that district. It was true, said the speaker, that according to Articles 42 and 43 of the treaty of peace, the German government were not allowed to assemble armed forces in the neutral zone, because to do so would constitute a hostile act against the signatory powers; but, he asked, was this prescription laid down in order to prevent the reestablishment of public order? By an agreement of August 1919, the Entente had sanctioned the maintenance in the neutral zone of a military police force, and therefore the Entente, including France, had recognized that measures necessary for the preservation of order in the neutral zone did not constitute a violation of the treaty. San Remo meeting A meeting of the Supreme Council, consisting of the British, French, and Italian prime ministers, was opened at San Remo on April 19; and the Council had to deal, among other questions, with the German invasion of the Ruhr Valley, and with the problem of disarmament generally. David Lloyd George, with the support of Francesco Saverio Nitti, proposed that the German government should be invited to attend the conference; but this was strongly opposed by Alexandre Millerand, and the proposal therefore lapsed. The result of the discussions at San Remo on the German question was that a note dealing with the question of disarmament was sent to the German government at the end of April. The note declared that so long as the German government was not taking serious steps to carry out the disarmament clauses of the Treaty of Versailles, it was impossible for the Allied governments even to consider the German request that the permanent force of 100,000 men, allowed by the treaty, should be increased. Germany was not fulfilling her engagements either in the destruction of the materials of war, or in the reduction of the number of troops, or in the provision of coal, or with regard to reparation. The Allied governments intended to insist upon the carrying out of the terms of the treaty, though in cases where the German government were faced with unavoidable difficulties, the Allied governments would not necessarily insist upon a literal interpretation of the terms. It was not their intention to annex any portion of German territory. So far as the occupation of the Ruhr valley was concerned the above note came almost after the event as the rapidity with which the Reichswehr overcame the insurgents made it possible for the German government to withdraw the troops within a few weeks. At the end of April the foreign minister, Dr. K√∂ster, declared that the French ought now to evacuate Frankfurt, Darmstadt, and Homburg, because the German troops had been reduced to 17,500 which was permitted by the agreement of August 1919. On the Allied side, however, it was stated that the force must be reduced forthwith to twenty battalions, six squadrons, and two batteries; and that even this force would have to be replaced entirely by a body of 10,000 police by July 10. The German government made the necessary reductions, and on May 17 the French evacuated Frankfurt and the other occupied towns. General election The reactionary and Spartacist insurrections having been thus quelled, the German government proceeded, in accordance with their declarations, to make the necessary preparations for holding the general election. The elections were fixed for Sunday, June 6. All the parties undertook active campaigns, but the general public showed less interest in these elections for the new Reichstag than they had shown in the elections for the temporary National Assembly in January 1919. The total number of electors was about 32,000,000, approximately 15,000,000 men and 17,000,000 women; but only about 80% of the voters exercised their rights. In the elections of 1919, the results had been strikingly in accord with the last general election for the Reichstag before the war; and had therefore constituted a remarkable popular confirmation of the attitude of the Reichstag bloc during the war. The present elections yielded different results. The three moderate parties had been in an overwhelming majority both in the last imperial Reichstag and also in the new republican National Assembly. They were again returned with a majority over the right and left political wings combined, but the majority was now very small. The German political parties were now grouped, from right to left, as follows: the National Party (the old Conservatives), the German People's Party (the old National Liberals); the Democrats (the old Radicals); the Clericals (the old Centre, which now included Protestant as well as Catholic Clericals); the Majority Social Democrats; the Minority or Independent Social Democrats; and lastly the Communists or Spartacists, whose opinions were comparable with those of the Bolsheviks of Russia. In January 1919, the Communists, presumably realizing their numerical insignificance, had refused to take part in the polling. On this occasion, however, they decided to enter the contest, and one of the remarkable features of the elections was the utter collapse of the Spartacists. The satisfaction which the rout of the Spartacists caused to most moderate Germans was, however, tempered by the success of the Independent Social Democrats, who had for months been growing increasingly more extreme in their views, and were now, indeed, one of the most extreme Socialist parties in all Europe, outside Russia. The total number of deputies in the new Reichstag was slightly greater than in the National Assembly, being about 470, the exact number being doubtful until the destinies of the plebiscite areas in West Prussia, East Prussia, and Silesia had been decided. The Spartacists won only two seats. The Independent Social Democrats, however, increased their membership of the house from twenty-two to eighty. The success of the Independent Social Democrats was gained, as might have been expected, chiefly at the expense of the Majority Social Democrats, who had been by far the largest party in the National Assembly. Indeed, the reduction in numbers of the Majority Social Democrats was almost exactly the same as the increase in numbers of the Minority Social Democrats. The total of the Majority Social Democrats fell from 165 to 110. The Clerical electorate, whose strength lay in the west and south, was as always a remarkably constant feature. The Clericals returned with eighty-eight deputies, as against ninety in the Assembly. Passing to a consideration of the Liberal and Conservative parties, one finds that on the right wing of politics there had also been a remarkable change. The Democrats fared worse in the elections than any other party. The two parties of the right were returned in far greater strength than they had possessed in the National Assembly. The number of Democrats fell from 75 to 45, which was the more remarkable when the increased size of the house is considered. The German National Party, representing the old Conservatives, and still avowed monarchists, increased their strength from 43to 65. But the most remarkable gains were those of the German People's Party. This party‚Äîthe old National Liberals‚Äîrepresented chiefly the great industrial interests and had been very influential, though not very numerous, under the Empire. In January 1919, they had been almost annihilated at the polls, and had won only twenty- two seats. Now, however, they returned with over sixty deputies. It will be seen that the elections apparently revealed two diametrically opposite tendencies: a drift from the moderates to the extreme left, and a drift from the moderates to the extreme right. These two tendencies had affected adversely the Majority Social Democrats and Democrats respectively. To some extent this possibly reflected popular discontent with the existing government, with a tendency for the Democrats to vote for the German People's Party and the Majority Social Democrats to drift to the Independent Social Democrats. The exception in this drift to the political extremes was to be found, with the supporters of the Clerical Party, whose political fidelity was proverbial. It was not the most extreme parties, the German Nationals and the Communists, who profited by the ministerial discontent, but the German People's Party and the Independent Social Democrats. The Majority Social Democrats were still the largest party in the country, as in the house, and secured about 5,500,000 votes‚Äînearly 1,000,000 more than the respective totals of the Independent Social Democrats and the Clericals, whose strength was about equal. The Democrats secured a little over 2,000,000 votes; whilst the two parties of the right together secured over 7,000,000 votes, about equally divided between them. The two parties of the right had increased their total vote by some 3,500,000, and the democratic vote had sunk by about the same number. The total poll of the Majority Social Democrats had sunk by some 5,500,000, whilst the poll of the Minority Social Democrats had risen by more than 2,500,000. When allowance is made for the decrease in the total poll, there was virtually no difference in the Clerical poll, as compared with January 1919. It will be seen that as between the non-Socialists and the Socialists as a whole, the position of the non-Socialists had markedly improved, and they had, in fact, slightly increased their aggregate poll, notwithstanding the diminution of the total number of electors who exercised their rights. New cabinet Owing to the changes in the relative strength of parties, it was several weeks before a cabinet could be formed; and after several politicians had attempted in vain to form a new cabinet, Konstantin Fehrenbach, one of the most respected leaders of the Clerical Party, succeeded in doing so. What might have been an extremely unstable parliamentary position was avoided by the good sense shown by the German People's Party, who were led by Gustav Stresemann. The German People's Party decided to abandon their position of opposition and their association with the Conservatives, and agreed to unite with the Clericals and Democrats to form a government. The Majority Social Democrats would not actually join a ministry which included the German People's Party, but they agreed to lend the new government their general support in the Reichstag. Thus it came about that twenty months after the revolution an entirely non-Socialist government came into power in Germany, though it was true that the new government depended partly upon the support of the Majority Social Democrats, whose moderation, however, made them more comparable to the Radical-Socialists of France and to Radicals in other countries, than to the Socialist parties of most other countries in Europe. Fehrenbach was born in 1852 and entered the Bavarian parliament as a Catholic and a representative of Freiburg when he was about thirty years of age. He was elected to the Reichstag in 1903 and he became president of that house in 1918. And in 1919 he became president of the National Assembly. Fehrenbach was able to form a strong cabinet from the personal point of view. Rudolf Heinze became vice-chancellor and minister for justice, Dr. Walter Simons became foreign minister, Joseph Wirth became minister of finance, Erich Koch-Weser was minister of the interior, and Johannes Giesberts was minister of posts. Noske was not a member of the new cabinet. The new chancellor made his first declaration to the Reichstag on June 28, and declared that so long as the formerly hostile states refused to modify the Treaty of Versailles, the German government could have no other policy than to endeavour to the best of their ability to carry out the terms of that treaty. Spa conference At the meeting of the Supreme Council at San Remo in April it was decided to invite the German government to a conference at Spa, in Belgium, in order to settle the questions relating to disarmament and reparations which arose under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles. The Spa Conference was held during the first half of July, and Fehrenbach himself attended the conference at which Lloyd George and Millerand were also present. Before going into the conference with the Germans the Allies agreed amongst themselves as to the proportions of the total German reparation which should be allotted to each of the Allied countries. Thus France was to receive 52%, the British Empire 22%, Italy 10%, Belgium 8%, and Serbia 5%, the small remaining proportion to be divided amongst other claimants. Apart from her 8% Belgium was to have the privilege of transferring her entire war debt to Germany's shoulders, and she was also to have a prior claim upon the first ¬£100,000,000 paid by Germany. These proportions were settled, but the total amount to be paid by Germany was not decided. The conference was to have been opened on July 5, and a preliminary sitting was in fact held on that day, but owing to the non-arrival of Otto Gessler, the German minister of defense, it was not possible to proceed with the serious consideration of the first subject on the agenda, which was the question of German disarmament. The conference was held under the presidency of the Belgian prime minister, L√©on Delacroix, and the Belgian foreign minister, Paul Hymans, also attended. The British representatives, in addition to Lloyd George himself, were Lord Curzon and Sir Laming Worthington-Evans. The chief Italian representative was Count Sforza, the distinguished and successful foreign minister. The German chancellor was accompanied by Simons and Wirth. On the following day Gessler arrived, and he proceeded at once to make a formal request that the 100,000 men, which was the limit of the German army allowed by the treaty, should continue to be exceeded, on the ground that it was impossible for the government to keep order with such a small force. Lloyd George then explained the reasons for the Allies' anxiety. He said that the treaty allowed Germany 100,000 men, 100,000 rifles, and 2,000 machine guns. Germany, however, still possessed a regular army of 200,000 men, and also possessed 50,000 machine guns, and 12,000 guns. Moreover, she had only surrendered 1,500,000 rifles, although it was obvious that there must be millions of rifles in the country. During the discussions on the following days it transpired from statements made by the chief of the General Staff himself, General von Seeckt, that in addition to the Reichswehr there were various other organized forces in Germany such as the Einwohnerwehr and the Sicherheitspolizei. The Einwohnerwehr alone appear to have numbered over 500,000 men. General von Seeckt proposed that the regular army should be reduced gradually to 100,000 men by October 1921. A discussion upon this matter took place between the Allies, and it was decided that Germany should be given until January 1, 1921, to reduce the strength of the Reichswehr to the treaty figure of 100,000 men. The exact conditions laid down were that Germany should reduce the Reichswehr to 150,000 men by October 1, withdraw the arms of the Einwohnerwehr and the Sicherheitspolizei, and issue a proclamation demanding the surrender of all arms in the hands of the civilian population, with effective penalties in the event of default. On July 9 the German delegates signed the agreement embodying these stipulations in regard to disarmament. The later sittings of the conference were concerned with the question of the trial of the German \\"war criminals\\", the delivery of coal as a form of reparation, and various other financial matters. It was the question of coal which required the closest attention, largely owing to the extreme need of France for supplies of coal, and the agreement relating to this matter was signed on July 16. It was decided that for six months after August 1 the German government should deliver up 2,000,000 tons of coal per month. The question of the war criminals referred to above had been under discussion since the beginning of the year. The Treaty of Versailles had required that certain persons with an especially evil record in the war should be handed over to the Allies. Lists of the chief persons coming under the heading of \\"war criminals\\" were published by the Allied governments at the end of January. The lists included a number of very well known persons, such as the Crown Prince Rupprecht of Bavaria, Field Marshal August von Mackensen, General von Kluck, Admiral von Tirpitz, and Admiral von Capelle. However, the ex- Emperor Wilhelm had fled to the Netherlands, and since the Dutch government definitely declined to hand him over to the Allies, it was generally held, especially in Britain, that it was difficult to press forward very vigorously with the punishment of those who, however important their positions, had only been the emperor's servants. It was therefore subsequently decided that the German government itself should be instructed to proceed with the punishment of the war criminals concerned. But it transpired at Spa that the German government had been extremely dilatory in taking the necessary proceedings. Rest of 1920 The last five months of the year were much less eventful in Germany. The country was still suffering from a shortage of food, though not in the acute degree which was so painfully characteristic of Austria and also of some of the other countries farther east. The German government appears to have made serious efforts to comply with their treaty obligations regarding disarmament and reparation. Thus, in the three weeks following the Spa Conference over 4,000 heavy guns and field guns were destroyed; and measures were taken to obtain the very large number of arms which existed all over the country in the hands of the civilian population. Great numbers of livestock were also handed over to the Allies. Thus France received from Germany (up to November 30) over 30,000 horses, over 65,000 cattle, and over 100,000 sheep. Belgium received, up to the same date, 6,000 horses, 67,000 cattle, and 35,000 sheep. The financial position of the country remained extremely serious. The total national debt (funded debt and floating debt) amounted to 200,000,000,000 marks, that is, ¬£10,000,000,000 sterling at the old prewar rate of exchange. The anticipated revenue for the year 1920‚Äì21 was 27,950,000,000 marks, and the anticipated ordinary expenditure was 23,800,000,000 marks. There was, however, also an anticipated extraordinary expenditure of no less than 11,600,000,000 marks. A heavy deficit on the railways was also expected. The exchange value of the mark had fallen disastrously since the armistice, and though it rose towards the end of the year, the mark was still reckoned at over 200 to the pound sterling in December. Various statistics of population were published during the year. Among other significant features, it was stated that the number of children under five years of age, in the whole of the territories of the former Hohenzollern empire, had sunk from 8,000,000 in 1911 to 5,000,000 in 1919.

The idea of a anti-monopoly board game dates to 1903 and the original Monopoly created by Lizzie Magie.  Background and history  Anspach created Anti-Monopoly in part as a response to the lessons taught by the mainstream game, which he believed created the impression that monopolies were something desirable. His intent was to demonstrate how harmful monopolies could be to a free-enterprise system, and how antitrust laws work to curtail them in the real world. The game was originally to be produced in 1973 as Bust the Trust, but the title was changed to Anti-Monopoly. It has seen multiple printings and revisions since 1973. In 1984, a new version appeared as Anti-Monopoly II; this version was updated and re-released in 2005 without the numerical designation. The game is currently still in print, and is produced and distributed worldwide by University Games. Gameplay The original Anti-Monopoly game begins with the board in a monopolised state, effectively the result of a completed Monopoly game. Instead of real estate and public utilities, properties in Anti-Monopoly are individual businesses that have been brought under single ownership. Players take the role of federal case workers bringing indictments against each monopolised business in an attempt to return the state of the board to a free market system. In Anti-Monopoly II individual players choose to play either by monopolist or competitor rules at the beginning of the game. This version plays more like the actual Monopoly game in that it is based on the buying and selling of real estate. Among other differences, competitors charge lower rents and can improve any property they own at any time, while monopolists must own at least two properties in a group before building houses on them and charge much higher rents. Trademark lawsuit In 1974, Parker Brothers sued Anspach over the use of the \\"Monopoly\\" name, claiming trademark infringement. While preparing his legal defense, Anspach became aware of Monopolys history prior to Charles Darrow's sale of the game to Parker in 1935, and how it had evolved from Elizabeth Magie's original Landlord's Game into the version Darrow appropriated. Anspach based his defense on the grounds that the game itself existed in effectively the public domain before Parker purchased it, and therefore Parker's trademark claim on it should be nullified. The case dragged on for ten years,Anti-Monopoly official website with numerous appeals and overturned judicial verdicts, until Anspach and Parker ultimately reached a settlement, permitting him to continue using the name Anti-Monopoly and distributing the game. For a time during the dispute, the game was marketed as simply \\"Anti.\\" Related games * Syndrome, a similar game in that it inverts the objective of Monopoly but with the aim of giving away money and property, was described by science fiction author Philip K.

At the height of its success in 2007, the party had one Member of Parliament (MP) in the House of Commons and nineteen councillors in local government. The Respect Party was established in London by Salma Yaqoob and George Monbiot in 2004. Arising in the aftermath of the 2003 invasion of Iraq, it grew out of the Stop the War Coalition and from the start revolved largely around opposition to the United Kingdom's role in the Iraq War. Uniting a range of leftist and anti-war groups, it was unofficially allied to the Muslim Association of Britain (MAB) and the Socialist Workers Party (SWP), a far-left, Marxist group. In 2005, Respect's candidate George Galloway was elected MP for Bethnal Green and Bow, and the party came second in three other constituencies. Respect made further gains in the 2006 and 2007 local elections, at which point its support peaked. In 2007, a schism emerged in the party between SWP supporters and the Respect Renewal group led by Galloway and Yaqoob; the former group left the party to form the Left List. Over the coming years, Respect gradually lost its council seats and it deregistered with the Electoral Commission in 2016. Avowedly socialist and opposed to capitalism, Respect called for the nationalisation of much of the UK economy, increased funding to public services, and further measures to tackle poverty and discrimination. It was Eurosceptic and promoted an anti-imperialist worldview. It was also anti-Zionist, opposing the existence of Israel and endorsing the Palestinian solidarity movement. Due to its links with MAB, several commentators claimed that Islamism was a component of its ideology and regarded it as part of a wider alliance between socialists and Islamists within Western Europe. Respect's voting base was primarily among the British Muslim communities in East London, Birmingham and Bradford, where it built upon opposition to the Iraq War and disenchantment among leftist voters with the governing Labour Party. Ideology The political scientists Matthew Goodwin and Robert Ford characterised Respect as a \\"broad coalition of left-wing interests\\" which had arisen in opposition to the New Labour government and the UK's involvement in the invasion of Iraq. Other political scientists characterised the party as far-left. The socialist activist Tariq Ali characterised the party's programme as being social democratic in orientation. Eran Benedek described the party as \\"an amalgamation of radical international socialism and Islamism\\", adding that its radical socialist position was informed by Marxism‚ÄìLeninism and Trotskyism. Benedek characterised it as a manifestation of what Amir Taheri called the \\"Marxist- Islamist coalition\\" which united around opposition to the United States, a desire to destroy the state of Israel, and a wish to overthrow international capitalism. Similarly, Emmanuel Karagiannis characterised the party as \\"the epitome\\" of the \\"convergence\\" between radical left and Islamist groups in Western Europe. Socialism and anti-capitalism The party's policies have been described as \\"traditionally leftist and anti-capitalist\\". Respect encouraged the nationalisation of many sectors of the economy, including the railways, water, gas, electricity, and the North Sea oil industry. It urged a substantial increase in corporation tax in order to increase funding to public services. It sought to overturn what it described as \\"anti-trade union\\" legislation, and to introduce policies to deal with issues of poverty and discrimination. Respect promoted revolutionary socialism and international socialism. The party was largely hostile to Western capitalism and neoliberalism, and interpreted many world events through the prism of anti- imperialism, calling for an end to what it characterised as imperialist wars like that in Iraq. Respect was anti-globalization, believing that it resulted in the exploitation of the working class. It also expressed a Eurosceptic approach to the European Union, deeming the Union to be lacking in democracy and exploitative toward the working class. Anti-Zionism Respect was anti-Zionist and rejected the state of Israel's right to exist. It presented this position through the terminology of social justice and human rights. One of its core principles was stated support for the Palestinian people and opposition to what Respect described as \\"the apartheid system that oppresses them\\". It was constitutionally committed to supporting the Palestine Solidarity Campaign and the boycotting of Israel. It calls for Israel to withdraw from any land conquered in 1967, and for the right of return to be granted to all Palestinians forced to move on the formation of the state of Israel in 1948. On its website and published fliers, it included maps of the Levant in which the entirety of Israel was labelled \\"Occupied Palestine\\". In 2017, the party's website asserts: \\"Respect supports the idea of a democratic bi-national solution of one state from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea in which all people, Jews, Muslims and Christians live equally; one man, one woman, one vote\\" and says British foreign policy should recognise Britain's \\"partial responsibility for the problem by their participation in the creation of the state of Israel\\". According to the party's national council member Yvonne Ridley, speaking at London's Imperial College in February 2006, Respect \\"is a Zionist-free party... if there was any Zionism in the Respect Party they would be hunted down and kicked out.\\" This rejection of Israel's right to exist and characterisation of it as a garrison of American imperialism in the Middle East had a longer presence in Trotskyist thought, having been espoused by the SWP prior to the establishment of Respect. In February 2013, George Galloway walked out of a debate organised by Christ Church, Oxford because his opponent was an Israeli citizen.Rob Williams \\"'I don't debate with Israelis': George Galloway accused of racism after walking out of Middle East debate at Oxford\\", The Independent, 21 February 2013 He explained his actions thus: \\"The reason is simple: no recognition, no normalisation. Just boycott, divestment and sanctions, until the apartheid state is defeated. I never debate with Israelis nor speak to their media. If they want to speak about Palestine ‚Äì the address is the PLO.\\"Warren Murray and Sam Jones \\"George Galloway refuses to debate with Israeli student at Oxford\\", The Guardian, 21 February 2013; retrieved 21 February 2013. The Zionist Federation called it a \\"racist\\" walkout displaying \\"xenophobic\\" tendencies.\\"British lawmaker Galloway called 'racist' for quitting debate with Israeli\\", jta.org, 21 February 2013. Respect was supportive of anti-Zionist Islamist militant groups like Hezbollah and Hamas. In July 2006, Respect official Lindsey German stated that \\"whatever disagreements I have with Hamas and Hezbollah, I would rather be in their camp... they want democracy. Democracy in the Middle East is Hamas, is Hezbollah\\". Galloway met with Hamas leader Khaled Mashal In September 2006, and that November the party's national-secretary John Rees attended the Beirut International Conference organised by Hezbollah. History=Formation: 2004 George Galloway in September 2005 Respect emerged from the British anti-war movement which had developed from late 2001 onward. The Stop the War Coalition (StWC) had been established in September 2001, with a central role being played by the Socialist Workers Party (SWP), which was then the largest radical left group in the UK. The StWC's president was Tony Benn, a Labour Member of Parliament (MP) until 2001, while it also gained the support of several rebel Labour MPs, among them Katy Clark, Jeremy Corbyn, Tam Dalyell, Alice Mahon, and George Galloway. The StWC had also attracted significant support from within Britain's Muslim community, and the Muslim Association of Britain (MAB) officially affiliated itself with the coalition. The movement politicised a large number of young British Muslims, among them Salma Yaqoob, who became the head of the StWC branch in Birmingham. Galloway later revealed that, about a year before the UK and US launched the Iraq War, he had broached the subject of leaving Labour and establishing a new party with his friends Seumas Milne and Andrew Murray. At the time‚Äîhe later stated‚Äîhe was of the view that UK Prime Minister Tony Blair and US President George W. Bush had already committed themselves to invading Iraq. Galloway was vocal in his opposition to Blair's calls for an invasion, and in May 2003 he was suspended from the Labour Party and then expelled in October, having been found to have brought it into disrepute. He then announced that he would stand against Labour in the 2004 European Parliament elections, and that he would \\"seek to unify the red, green, anti-war, Muslim and other social constituencies radicalised by the war, in a referendum on Tony Blair\\". The two main instigators of the party were Yaqoob and George Monbiot, a journalist with The Guardian. They had been part of a discussion surrounding the unification of a broad range of anti-war forces that were to the left of Labour, a successor to the Socialist Alliance electoral list that had contested the 2001 general election. They wanted to reach out beyond the far left's traditional support base and gain support from peace activists and religious groups, particularly the Muslim community. In November 2003, a number of public meetings were held under the title of \\"British Politics at the Crossroads\\", at which it was agreed that a new political party should be established. At a convention on 24 January 2004, the party, titled \\"Respect ‚Äì the Unity Coalition\\", was officially declared. The name \\"RESPECT\\" was a contrived acronym for respect, equality, socialism, peace, environmentalism, community, and trade unionism. Galloway said in April 2004: \\"Respect. It's a young word. It's a black word. It's the first postmodern name for an electoral political movement; most are one or other arrangement of the words The, Something, and Party. With respect, we're different.\\" Opposition to the Iraq War was the party's primary issue, around which it galvanised much of its support. At its foundation, the party also called for a halt to privatisation and the renationalisation of the British railways. Although it did not secure the full backing of any major trade unions, some local branches of the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT)‚Äîwhich had disaffiliated from Labour in February 2004‚Äîvoted to support Respect. Although containing members from both the SWP and MAB, Respect was not a formal coalition between the two groups. From the beginnings of Respect, there remained tension within the party between SWP members and Muslim leaders. This alliance was also criticised by some observers; in June 2004, the political commentator Nick Cohen wrote that \\"for the first time since the Enlightenment, a section of the left is allied with religious fanaticism and, for the first time since the Hitler-Stalin pact, a section of the left has gone soft on fascism.\\"Nick Cohen \\"Saddam's very own party\\", New Statesman, 7 June 2004 Respect initially tried to form an electoral pact with the Green Party of England and Wales but this proved unsuccessful.Matthew Tempest \\"Monbiot quits Respect over threat to Greens\\", The Guardian, 17 February 2004 The Greens stated that they had selected their candidates for the 2004 European Parliamentary elections by postal ballot months previously and that they were also sceptical of the SWP's influence over Respect. After Respect decided to stand candidates against the Greens, Monbiot stepped down from the party in February 2004, claiming that to compete against the Greens might threaten the positions of \\"two of the best elected representatives in Britain\\", the Green Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) Caroline Lucas and Jean Lambert. Early electoral campaigns: 2004‚Äì05 Respect fringe meeting at the 2004 European Social Forum Respect fielded candidates for both the 2004 elections for the European Parliament (EP) and for the London Assembly, attempting to present these elections as a referendum on Blair's Labour government. The party claims that this support was achieved primarily as a result of the anti-war protests and by attracting votes from \\"disillusioned\\" Labour voters. The party was widely derided in the British media, which viewed Respect as a single-issue party that would soon disappear from British politics. Respect polled a quarter of a million votes in the EP election. Its proportion of the national vote was 1.7%, which grew to 5% in London, although it failed to win any seats. The strong showing of the Greens and the UK Independence Party had been part of the reason for this failure to secure a seat. In the London Assembly election, Respect secured 4.5% of the vote, meaning that they did not secure a seat on the Assembly. However, within both the London Borough of Newham and the London Borough of Tower Hamlets‚Äîboth areas with large Muslim populations‚ÄîRespect secured the largest number of votes, with over 20% in both. Respect mocked Ken Livingstone's Labour candidacy as the \\"Blair Mayor Project\\". Respect's first election victory was in the council by-election for the St Dunstan's and Stepney Green ward of Tower Hamlets, where its candidate, Oliur Rahman, secured 31% of the vote. At the Birmingham Hodge Hill and Leicester South by- elections, both held on 15 July 2004, the party gained 6.3% and 12.7% of the vote respectively. At the time, following defections from other parties, Respect had a council seat in Nuneaton and another in Preston. Respect campaigners decorating a bus in Manchester for the 2005 elections The coalition put up candidates in 26 constituencies across England and Wales, just under half of them from the SWP. However, Britain's first past the post electoral system made it difficult for small parties to make gains unless they geographically concentrated their vote. Respect recognised that East London, an area with large numbers of Muslim British Bangladeshis, would be electorally lucrative, particularly as three of the area's four sitting Labour MPs had voted in favour of British participation in the invasion of Iraq. At the 2005 general election Respect fielded candidates in this area: Lindsey German in West Ham, Abdul Khaliq Mian in East Ham, Rahman in Poplar and Canning Town, and Galloway in Bethnal Green and Bow. Galloway sought to unseat the sitting Labour MP, Oona King, and the ensuing campaign for the seat has been cited as \\"one of the most acrimonious in recent history\\". King accused Galloway of sexual impropriety, although was later forced to retract those allegations. She alleged that she had been the victim of antisemitism from Respect supporters after having been pelted with eggs at a Jewish memorial service. She also claimed that Respect canvassers had urged Muslims not to vote for her because she is Jewish. Respect threatened legal action if King repeated the claim.Patrick Barkham \\"MP accuses Galloway backers of anti- semitism\\", The Guardian, 12 April 2005 Respect won 0.3% of the national vote, with an average of 6.8% of the vote in the constituencies it had contested; 17 of its candidates failed to have their deposits returned. However, Galloway won the seat of Bethnal Green and Bow by a narrow margin of 823 votes. Galloway's surprise victory provided much momentum for his party. His victory represented the first time that a party to the left of Labour had won a seat in the Houses of Parliament since 1951. Respect also did well in several other constituencies, coming second to Labour in both West Ham and East Ham, and also securing second place in Birmingham Sparkbrook and Small Heath, where Yaqoob had been its candidate, securing 27.5% of the vote. Respect made \\"rapid progress\\", aided by growing finances and the existing campaign experience of the far left. By the end of 2005, in the London Borough of Newham, two Labour and one Liberal Democrat councillor had defected to Respect. By December 2005, it had an official membership of 5,674. Galloway, however, told Decca Aitkenhead in April 2012 for a Guardian profile that Respect, at its peak, only had about 3‚Äì4,000 members. Its university wing, Student Respect, claimed by 2007 to have branches in over fifty campuses across England and Wales. Benedek suggested that this probably made it the fastest growing student political group in the UK. The SWP's student group, the Socialist Worker Student Society (SWSS), encouraged its members to join Respect and became largely dormant. Local electoral victories: 2006‚Äì07 Respect candidate Ghazi Khan, with someone dressed as Blair, at the 18 March 2006 Anti-War Protest in London In 2006, Galloway appeared on Channel 4's reality television show Celebrity Big Brother. His hope was to use it as a public relations exercise in which he could promote his views to a wider audience, however this backfired as Channel 4 producers censored most of his political discussions. Media attention instead focused on the fact that he had seemingly abandoned his constituents to appear in the show and on an episode in which he had impersonated a cat. This did little to damage Respect's electoral appeal. Respect stood about 150 candidates in the 2006 local elections, at which it secured 16 seats. At Respect's campaign launch, Galloway anticipated a \\"referendum on new Labour\\", and said the election \\"will be the last blow that will knock out Tony Blair\\". In Tower Hamlets, Respect took eleven new council seats, giving it a total of twelve and making it the borough's official opposition to Labour. In Newham, Respect gained 26% of the vote and returned its three councillors, although was disappointed not to gain further ones. In Birmingham, Respect gained 55% of the vote in the Sparkbrook ward and Yaqoob was elected as the city's first female Muslim councillor. None of the new Respect councillors were connected with the SWP. Galloway explained at the time that many Respect supporters \\"are small business people and wouldn't describe themselves as socialists and are not bound to accept it.\\" Respect stood 48 candidates in the 2007 local election, of which three were elected. The party had peaked, and following this would witness a decline. In July 2007, Galloway was suspended from the House of Commons for 18 days after the standards and privileges commit accused him of a lack of transparency in the financing of is charity, the Mariam Appeal. In August, a Respect councillor in Tower Hamlets resigned, triggering a by-election which Harun Miah narrowly secured for Respect. Schism: 2007 The SWP had been members of Respect's \\"Unity Coalition\\" since its early years, although relations between them and Galloway had been strained. In August 2007 he wrote a letter to the party's national council stating that Respect had various internal weaknesses, with many deeming this a veiled criticism of the SWP.Galloway slams own Respect party , The Muslim Weekly, 14 September 2007 This generated rifts within the SWP itself as two of its members were expelled for refusing to step down as Galloway's parliamentary assistants. By October, SWP publications were claiming that there was a \\"witch hunt\\" against socialists within Respect, despite the presence of socialist groups other than the SWP. That month, disagreements between Rahman and Abjol Miah, leader of the Respect group in Tower Hamlets, resulted in four of the borough's councillors resigning the Respect Party whip. By November 2007, Respect had split into two rival factions. The first consisted largely of members affiliated with the SWP and included the rebel councillors from Tower Hamlets. The second, which named itself Respect Renewal, was led by Galloway and Yaqoob and had the support of virtually all of the party's elected representatives and national council. According to political scientist Timothy Peace, these events were \\"characteristic of the faction fighting that has always plagued the radical left.\\" The SWP-allied faction controlled the party's website and claimed that Galloway had simply left the party, of which they were the rightful representatives. The Respect Renewal group changed the locks of the party's national office and barred access to SWP supporters. On 17 November, both groups held conferences at which they claimed to be the legitimate manifestation of Respect. The Electoral Commission subsequently ruled that control of the party's name rested with Fire Brigades Union activist Linda Smith, the nominating officer; she had sided with Galloway, meaning that the Respect Renewal group were able to continue using the name. The SWP faction split and began using the name Left List. The SWP attributed the split to a shift to the right by Galloway and his allies, motivated by electoralism (seeking to gain Muslim votes) and attacks on the left.Alex Nunns \\"Car crash on the left\\", Red Pepper, December 2007. This opinion was shared by Hilary Wainwright, who saw a common pattern of \\"leaderism\\" in this and other leftist debacles, although she thought Galloway possessed positive qualities. SWP- dominated branches of Respect were reportedly less active than those with far fewer members of that group. A narrow failure of John Rees in 2006 to gain election in the Tower Hamlets local elections, while the 12 candidates from the Bangladeshi community were all elected, was also alleged to have alienated the SWP from the project. In December 2009, the party de-registered (removed) itself from the Register of Political Parties for Northern Ireland, but remained registered for England, Scotland and Wales. Decline: 2008‚Äì2010 Respect went into gradual decline after 2008. By this point its primary unifying issue, anger at Labour over the Iraq War, had become less salient, with the political scientist Stephen Driver suggesting that for this reason Respect \\"struggled to be anything more than a one-trick pony\\". The party was in disarray following the schism and only forwarded one candidate for the 2008 London Assembly elections. This candidate, Hanif Abdulmuhit, stood for the City and East constituency and secured 15% of the vote but trailed behind their Labour and Conservative Party rivals. Overall Respect attained 2.4% of the London Assembly vote, below the 5% threshold needed to secure a seat. Galloway had headed the Respect (London-wide) top-up list. Respect had not fielded a candidate for London Mayor, instead endorsing Labour's Ken Livingstone, while Left List had fielded German, who secured significantly fewer votes than she had gained as a Respect candidate for Mayor in 2004. The outbreak of the 2008 Gaza War provided renewed impetus for Respect's campaigning. Throughout much of 2009, the party devoted much of its resources to raising funds for the Viva Palestina aid convoy to alleviate the humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip. The first convoy, which set off from Glasgow in February 2009, was led by Respect member Kevin Ovenden. At the time of the 2010 general election, Yaqoob was Respect's leader Respect Renewal stood 10 candidates in the local council elections also taking place on 1 May across England and Wales. They returned one new councillor, Nahim Khan, in Birmingham Sparkbrook, who received 42.64% of the vote. The party did not field any candidates for the 2009 European Parliament elections, instead urging supporters to vote for either the Green Party or the left-wing Eurosceptic alliance, No2EU. Instead, Arthur Scargill's Socialist Labour Party proved to be the most successful radical left party in the election, securing 1.1% of the national vote. Respect fielded ten candidates in the 2010 general election, with a particular focus on three that they considered winnable. The party's manifesto highlighted that a hung parliament would be likely, and that if there were three Respect MPs in the House of Commons then they would have a chance of forming a coalition with a minority government. Their three targeted seats were Birmingham Hall Green, which was being contested by Yaqoob‚Äîwho was then party leader‚ÄîPoplar and Limehouse, which was contested by Galloway, and Galloway's existing seat of Bethnal Green and Bow, which was being defended by Miah. The election however proved disastrous for Respect. Labour secured all three of the seats that Respect had targeted, with Galloway and Miah being pushed into third place with 17% of the vote. Nationwide it had secured 33,251 voted, less than half of that which it had attained in the 2005 general election. Local elections were held on the same day which also resulted in significant losses for Respect; in Tower Hamlets it went from having eight councillors to one, and in Newham is lost all its councillors. However the party had better results elsewhere. In Birmingham Hall Green constituency Respect candidate Salma Yaqoob performed better, receiving 12,240 votes, 25.1%, placing second after Labour candidate Roger Godsiff, who received 16,039 votes, 32.9%. Respect fielded eight more candidates in other constituencies, who together polled 4,319 votes. Arshad Ali received 1,245 votes, 3.1%, in Bradford West, and Kay Phillips received 996 votes, 2.9%, in Blackley and Broughton. In total, Respect candidates received 33,269 votes, which amounted to 6.8% of the total vote in the constituencies where they stood and 0.1% of the total UK vote. \\\\- During the 2010 General Election the Green Party stood down in favour of Respect candidates in Birmingham Sparkbrook and Manchester, Blackley and Broughton indicating the beginning of a tentative co-operation. Galloway told Decca Aitkenhead in April 2012: \\"When we lost the three parliamentary seats in 2010 that we'd hoped to win, we became almost minuscule\\"; Respect he said then had about 8-900 members. Abjol Miah was elected as the National Chair of Respect in January 2011.\\"Abjol Miah Elected National Chair of Respect\\", East London News, 21 January 2011. After the introduction of directly elected mayors in Tower Hamlet‚Äîsomething that Respect had campaigned for locally‚Äîthe party backed the successful independent candidate Luftur Rahman. 2012: Galloway wins Bradford West by-election In 2011, Galloway tried to become a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP). On 5 May 2011, in the 2011 Scottish Parliament election, the Respect Party, on whose list Galloway stood in the Glasgow electoral region, received 6,972 votes (3.3%). He campaigned under the banner of Coalition Against the Cuts, but the vote was insufficient to gain a seat in the Scottish proportional voting system. In the Birmingham City Council elections of 2011, Respect lost one of its three councillors to Labour. In July, Yaqoob then resigned due to health reasons, leaving the party with only one councillor in the city. Galloway successfully contested Bradford West in a by-election held on 29 March, following the resignation of Labour MP Marsha Singh due to ill health.Former MP George Galloway to stand in Bradford West BBC News Galloway and his supporters, such as the Muslim Public Affairs Committee (MPACUK), were active in a campaign against Imran Hussain, the Muslim deputy leader of Bradford City Council, whose commitment to his faith was queried because he is reported to drink alcohol. Meanwhile, one of Galloway's supporting speakers at a rally on the Sunday before the byelection was Abjol Miah, once group leader of the Respect councillors in Tower Hamlets, who is also active in the IFE.Andrew Gilligan \\"Fundamentalist liar loses another complaint against us\\", Daily Telegraph, 12 October 2010 Galloway was elected with a majority of 10,140 with one of the largest swings in the polls against the defending political party in modern political history.Andy McSmith \\"Andy McSmith's Diary: Respect MP George Galloway needs to work on his swing\\", The Independent, 26 March 2015 2012: party resignations Yaqoob resigned as party leader in September following Galloway's remarks about rape with respect to the Julian Assange case.Andrew Woodcock \\"Respect chief Salma Yaqoob quits over George Galloway rape row\\", The Independent, 12 September 2012 She told a reporter from The Guardian that she had had to make a choice between \\"standing up for the rights of women\\" and her admiration for Galloway's \\"anti- imperialist stance\\".Aida Edemariam \\"Respect's Salma Yaqoob: 'Why I quit'\\", The Guardian, 22 September 2015 In October 2012, party secretary Chris Chilvers said Respect had 2,000 members, while before the by-election it had 300.Helen Pidd \\"George Galloway: is Bradford losing respect for its maverick MP?\\", The Guardian, 14 October 2012 Arshad Ali, who succeeded Yaqoob as leader, resigned as national chair in December 2012 after it was discovered that he has a spent conviction for electoral fraud (dating from his time in the Labour Party), although at this point the Electoral Commission still had Yaqoob listed as the party's leader. Kate Hudson had originally been selected for the Manchester Central by-election, but stood down in early September following Galloway's comments on rape,\\"Galloway Rape Remark: Respect Candidate Quits\\", Sky News, 4 September 2012 and left the party in October. In the same month, Respect announced that Catherine Higgins, a local \\"community advocate\\", would contest the by-election on 15 November 2012. Higgins finished 9th out of 12 candidates. In November 2012, at a rally in Rotherham, Respect announced Yvonne Ridley had been chosen to contend the Rotherham by-election.\\"Yvonne Ridley Respect candidate in Rotherham election\\", BBC News, 12 November 2012 The election took place on 29 November 2012; Ridley finished fourth with 8% of the vote, ahead of both the Conservative and Liberal Democrat candidates, but behind UKIP and the BNP. 2012‚Äì15: Respect's Bradford councillors Respect won five seats on Bradford Council in May 2012 following Galloway's success in the by-election at the end of March. Amid a fiercely fought campaign, there were claims and complaints of violence and harassment by the Respect Party and its opponents. The party came second in Oldham's Werneth ward and Tower Hamlets' Weavers ward. After several months of inconclusive reports in the media,Marcus Dysch \\"Galloway in bid for Boris‚Äôs job?\\", The Jewish Chronicle, 13 June 2013 on 10 August 2013, the Bradford Telegraph & Argus reported that Galloway might not be a candidate in Bradford at the 2015 general election and instead stand in the 2016 London Mayoral election.Dolores Cowburn \\"George Galloway: 'I could stand for Mayor of London'\\", Telegraph & Argus, 10 August 2013 The five Respect councillors in Bradford elected the previous year resigned from the party whip on 15 August 2013\\"Bradford councillors resign from Respect party\\", BBC News, 15 August 2013 after coming into conflict with Galloway over his comments that he might run in the London mayoral election. They argued that the MP was needed in Bradford. Two of the councillors had said the MP should resign if he intended to stand in London; Galloway and his associates had immediately suspended them, although their three fellow council members were in agreement.Helen Pidd \\"George Galloway urged to resign as MP if he wants to be London mayor\\", The Guardian, 13 August 2013. One of the other three councillors, Alyas Karmani, then leader of the Respect group on Bradford City Council, said the party had not, in fact, been consulted about Galloway's plans. Galloway had also claimed that the councillors were working against him and the party with Aisha Ali Khan, his former aide, and her husband. (Both Ali Khan and her husband later received criminal convictions related to her former employment by Galloway.)PA \\"George Galloway's ex-secretary gets conditional discharge for data breaches\\", theguardian.com, 31 July 2014. After no retraction of the assertions made against them had been forthcoming,Andrew Robinson \\"No respect as Bradford councillors quit Galloway‚Äôs party\\", Yorkshire Post, 25 October 2013. the five councillors entirely severed their connections with Respect towards the end of October and then intended to sit as independents for the remainder of their term of office.\\"Bradford Respect councillors resign in George Galloway row\\", BBC News, 25 October 2013 Claims that they had been \\"conniving\\" with Galloway's former aide were false, they said.Helen Pidd \\"Respect councillors in Bradford resign en masse\\", theguardian.com, 25 October 2013. A spokesman from Respect accused them of attempting to gain control of the party in Bradford. In the 2014 local elections, Respect stood eight candidates in Bradford, but none of them won in their council wards.Helen Pidd \\"Labour gains control of Bradford as Respect fails\\", theguardian.com (blog), 23 May 2014 Two other Respect councillors lost their seats, leaving Respect without any representation on local authorities. In 2014, the party had only 630 members and assets of ¬£1,947. By that point, the party was largely a vehicle for Galloway's personality. This changed in March 2015 when 4 of the former Respect councillors rejoined and a Labour member of the council, Asama Javed, left the party and aligned herself with Respect.Rob Lowson, \\"Four Bradford councillors rejoin Respect\\", Bradford Telegraph & Argus, 29 March 2015. \\\\- Claire Wilde, \\"Sitting Bradford councillor defects from Labour party to Respect\\", Bradford Telegraph & Argus, 27 March 2015. \\\\- Helen Pidd, \\"Four Bradford councillors rejoin George Galloway's Respect party\\", The Guardian, 31 March 2015.

In July 2015, the four councillors who had rejoined reversed their decision and decided to continue under the Bradford Independent Group label, although rejoining Respect was still a possibility. 2015‚Äì16: general election and de-registration At the 2015 general election, Respect had four candidates, in Halifax and two Birmingham seats (Hall Green and Yardley) in addition to Bradford West.\\"UK General Election 2015 candidates: Other candidates\\", Political Resources.net Where Respect was not standing in the election, Galloway had urged a vote for Labour in 2013, having met and been impressed with then Labour leader Ed Miliband. None of the Respect candidates were elected. In George Galloway's own seat, the 10,000 majority he had gained at the 2012 Bradford West by- election was reversed, and the Labour Party candidate Naz Shah became the constituency's MP with a majority of 11,420 votes.\\"Election 2015: Bradford West\\", BBC News; accessed October 3, 2016. In December 2015, it became known that former Respect Party leader Salma Yaqoob had applied to join the Labour Party in Hall Green following Jeremy Corbyn's election as leader. Her application was rejected by her local constituency Labour Party owing to her standing against Labour candidates. Robert Colvile reported in The Spectator at the beginning of January 2016: Following his defeat in the 2015 general election, Galloway announced that he would stand as Respect's candidate in the 2016 London Mayoral Election. During hustings, he praised newly elected Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, but condemned Labour Mayoral candidate Sadiq Khan as a \\"flip-flop merchant\\" and a \\"product of the Blairite machine\\". In the final result of the London Mayoral election held on 5 May 2016, Galloway came seventh with 37,007 (1.4%) first preference votes. After second preference were accounted for, Sadiq Khan became London mayor. Respect failed to hold any of their seats in Bradford in the 2016 local elections, leaving them without any representation at any level of government. The Respect Party \\"voluntarily deregistered\\" from the Electoral Commission's Register of Political Parties on 18 August 2016, twelve years after it initially registered. Support=Voter base Since its formation, Respect has presented itself as being \\"genuinely left\\" and has sought to appeal to leftist voters dissatisfied with the Labour Party's shift to the centre under the leadership of Blair and Gordon Brown. There has however been little electoral support for parties to the left of Labour in Britain, with the party having to seek out an alternative voting base. The East London Mosque, where Respect helped canvass support for it The primary electoral support for Respect came from the British Muslim community. Traditionally, British Muslims voted for the Labour Party, but many had been disenchanted following the Labour government's decision to invade Iraq. Respect appealed in particular to British Muslims who had been disenchanted by the war. According to Emmanuel Karagiannis, \\"now that the old working class has assimilated into an expanded middle class, the radical Left is obviously looking for a new constituency, and Europe's deprived and alienated Muslim communities may well be the answer.\\" The political scientist Stephen Driver suggested that this over-reliance on dissatisfied Muslim voters left its electoral base \\"fragile\\", for when \\"the source of the protest disappears, so do the protest votes\\". At no point did Respect position itself as a specifically Muslim party akin to the Islamic Party of Britain or the Muslim Party in Birmingham, however from its beginnings it did specifically target Muslims with its campaign material, characterising itself as \\"the party for Muslims\\" and focusing on issues of particular concern to British Muslim communities. A local election flyer printed in 2004 featured the slogan \\"George Galloway ‚Äì Fighting for Muslim Rights!\\" It often fielded Muslim candidates to stand in largely Muslim areas, although this was not unusual in British politics, with Labour, the Conservatives, and the Liberal Democrats often doing the same. Respect's main electoral support base was in East London and Birmingham. However, there were other areas of Britain with large Islamic communities‚Äîsuch as Yorkshire, Lancashire, and Leicester‚Äîwhere the party did not do well. Peace suggested that Respect had been successful in East London and Birmingham and not other areas with Muslim communities because these two areas had established anti-war movements and that Respect candidates had already become well known within that movement. It has also been suggested that Respect's connection to religious groups and mosques has been crucial to the party's success in many areas. It attracted some controversy for allegedly being tied to the Islamic Forum of Europe (IFE), a group based at the East London Mosque in Tower Hamlets. Both The Telegraph and Dispatches have alleged that Respect activist Miah is an IFE member, although he has denied this.Andrew Gilligan \\"'Britain's Islamic republic': full transcript of Channel 4 Dispatches programme on Lutfur Rahman, the IFE and Tower Hamlets\\", Daily Telegraph, 22 October 2010.Andrew Gilligan \\"The Islamic Forum of Europe becomes a three-time loser in the complaint stakes\\", Daily Telegraph, 19 October 2011. Reception Respect received little attention from scholars of politics. This may be due to the perception that it was a single-issue party that provided a protest vote among a particular community. As with the Greens, Respect were recognised as having radical views but were nonetheless widely regarded as a legitimate part of politics in the UK. In this they contrasted with the pariah status accorded to contemporary far right groups like the British National Party. In just over two years, it had gained the electoral success that it had taken the BNP twenty years to attain. Respect was controversial within Britain's far left movement. Far left criticisms of the party included that it was engaging in political opportunism, that it invited the petty bourgeoisie into the socialist workers' movement, and that it focused on the narrow sectarian interests of British Muslims rather than the socio-economic issues of the working-class and in doing so neglected feminism and LGBT rights. According to The Guardian journalist Dave Hill, Respect were \\"a case study in the British far left's enduring gift for self-parodic, self- destructive splits\\". Criticisms of Respect=Equality Respect has been accused of abandoning some traditional social-liberal issues, including women's rights, abortion, gay rights and fighting homophobia, to attract Muslim support.Gove, Michael (2006). Celsius 7/7, p. 118. While Respect included opposition to discrimination based on gender and sexual orientation in its founding declaration, critics claim that Galloway ‚Äì during the time he was a Respect MP ‚Äì tended to avoid parliamentary votes involving equal rights for gay people. In a 2006 interview with PinkNews, Galloway praised New Labour's record on improving gay rights, and says of his absence from one vote that \\"there was never any doubt about the passage of the civil partnerships [bill], I wholly support it\\". According to a resolution at that year's conference, Respect's 2005 manifesto omitted the \\"defence of LGBT rights despite policy adopted at last year's AGM and contained in the founding statement\\". A resolution was passed calling for the end to all discrimination against lesbians, gay men, bisexuals and transgender people and that this policy would be stated in all of its manifestos and principal election materials. Despite this commitment, Respect and parts of the LGBT community have clashed on several occasions. In November 2005, Respect's second largest single financial donor, Dr Mohammad Naseem,Looking at the figures of political donations to Respect of ¬£15457 is the second highest after Mrs J Turner , search must be re-conducted, look for all donations to Respect ‚Äì The Unity Coalition was accused in an article by Peter Tatchell of being homophobic due to his senior position in the Islamic Party of Britain, which Tatchell claimed advocated the \\"banning of gay organisations\\" and the \\"execution of homosexuals\\". Naseem, however, stated that the Islamic Party was now little more than a thinktank, and furthermore, disagreed with the statements on the Islamic Party website which Tatchell pointed to, stating his views on homosexuality as follows: \\"These things are a matter of personal choice [...] I am not concerned with what people do in their bedrooms.\\" Naseem was also present at Respect's 2005 conference, where the vote to reaffirm Respect's support of LGBT rights was passed unanimously. In January 2006, an article attacking Tatchell's opposition to the party was written by Respect member and journalist Adam Yosef. Writing for Desi Xpress, Yosef accused Tatchell of Islamophobia but was attacked by gay organisations for \\"encouraging violence against Tatchell\\" and for using \\"xenophobic\\" and \\"homophobic\\" language. Yosef also used other articles to attack same-sex unions, describing them as a front for \\"tax fraud\\". Tatchell called on Respect to expel Yosef but the party responded with the following statement: \\"Adam Yosef has the right to voice his own opinions in his own column ‚Äì they range from an ecstatic review of Birmingham's gay pride to venting his thoughts about Peter Tatchell.\\" However, in October 2009, Yosef pledged his formal support to Tatchell's General Election parliamentary candidacy, calling for the left to \\"embrace a mutual personal and political commitment towards equality and human rights\\". \\\\- \\\\- Antisemitism Abul Hussain, a former member of Respect's national council, posted antisemitic comments on Facebook and was expelled for his comments in September 2010. The councillor joked about chopping off a Jewish person's sidelocks and confiscating their kippah. He also wrote about Jews, \\"Here's a penny go put it in the bank and [you] just might get a pound after ten years interest!\\". The Respect Party stated that \\"such views are demonstrably incompatible with party membership\\". In 2011 Carole Swords, of Bow, the chairwoman of the Respect Party in Tower Hamlets, was convicted for a public order offence after an altercation with a Jewish counter-protester, Harvey Garfield, at a protest inside a Covent Garden Tesco Metro supermarket. She was alleged to have struck him in the face, smacking off his eyeglasses, while he was protecting Israeli goods from potentially being damaged.Marcus Dysch \\"Tower Hamlets Respect chair guilty of assault at Tesco demo\\", The Jewish Chronicle, 2 February 2012 A subsequent appeal in December cleared her of the offence. Swords' defence team claimed Garfield had harassed and intimidated Swords inside the supermarket, and alleging he had called her a \\"Nazi\\", a \\"fishwife\\" and a \\"terrorist\\". The recorder determined that Garfield had followed Swords inside the Tesco and that she had demanded he desist. The recorder could not determine how Garfield's glasses had fallen based on the store footage, and allowed the appeal.Marcus Dysch \\"Anti-Israel activist Carole Swords wins appeal\\", The Jewish Chronicle, 6 December 2012 Swords had earlier described Zionists as \\"cockroaches ... bugs [which] need to be stomped out\\" and at a different rally, Swords had told a Jewish protester to \\"go back to Russia\\". \\"Carole Swords of Respect: 'Go back to Russia!, YouTube Following Naz Kahn's appointment as Respect's women's officer in Bradford in October 2012, it emerged that Kahn had recently commented on Facebook that \\"history teachers in our school\\" were and are \\"the first to start brainwashing us and our children into thinking the bad guy was Hitler. What have the Jews done good in this world??\\"Jennifer Lipman \\"Respect activist: was Hitler the bad guy?\\", The Jewish Chronicle, 25 October 2012. When she re-emerged in 2017, Naz Kahn was known as Nasreen Khan, see David Aaronovitch in The Jewish Chronicle wrote: What have the Jews done good in this world?' clearly means 'The Jews do only bad'. The Jews haven't suffered as much as they say they have, but insofar as they have suffered it's their own fault and, in any case, they have gone on to inflict equal or more suffering on others. That's 'the Jews' as a group, not 'many Jews', 'some Jews' or 'a few Jews'.\\"David Aaronovitch. \\"The everyday language of hate\\", The Jewish Chronicle, 4 November 2012 Ron McKay, Galloway's spokesman, said Kahn's comments had been written shortly before she joined Respect, on an \\"unofficial site\\" (the Respect Bradford Facebook page), and that she \\"now deeply regrets and repudiates that posting\\". The last formal leader of Respect, George Galloway, has been accused by The Guardian journalist Hadley Freeman of having \\"said and done things that cross the line from anti-Israel to antisemitic\\". He threatened to sue her for the comments made on Twitter in February 2015, although the tweet had already been deleted. Her tweet followed the Question Time George Galloway in Finchley controversy, an edition of the BBC's political debate series on which Freeman's Guardian colleague Jonathan Freedland had also appeared and made similar assertions about Galloway's conduct. Galloway's support for Hizbollah and Hamas, his refusal to debate with Israeli Jews, and his declaration of Bradford as being an \\"Israeli-free zone\\" are among the issues which have led to the attitudes of the politician being thought suspect.

interaction.Interactionism ‚Äì The Free Dictionary It is the study of how individuals shape society and are shaped by society through meaning that arises in interactions. Interactionist theory has grown in the latter half of the twentieth century and has become one of the dominant sociological perspectives in the world today. George Herbert Mead, as an advocate of pragmatism and the subjectivity of social reality, is considered a leader in the development of interactionism. Herbert Blumer expanded on Mead's work and coined the term \\"symbolic interactionism\\". Subdivisions Interactionism has several subdivisions: Phenomenology, Verstehen, Social action, Ethnomethodology, Symbolic interactionism, and Social constructionism. Interactions Interactionism is micro-sociological and believes that meaning is produced through the interactions of individuals. The social interaction is a face-to-face process consisting of actions, reactions, and mutual adaptation between two or more individuals. It also includes animal interaction such as mating. The interaction includes all language (including body language) and mannerisms. The goal of the social interaction is to communicate with others. If the interaction is in danger of ending before one intends to it, it can be conserved by conforming to the others' expectations, by ignoring certain incidents or by solving apparent problems. Erving Goffman underlines the importance of control in the interaction. One must attempt to control the others' behaviour during the interaction, in order to attain the information one is seeking and in order to control the perception of one's own image. Important concepts in the field of interactionism include the \\"social role\\" and Goffman's \\"presentation of self.\\" Interactionist methodology Interactionists are interested in how people see themselves in the broader social context. Interactionists want to understand each individual, and how they act within society. In extreme cases, they would deny class as an issue, and would say that we cannot generalize that everyone from one social class thinks in one way. Instead they believe everyone has different attitudes, values, culture and beliefs. Therefore, it is the duty of the sociologist to carry out the study within society. They set out to gather qualitative data. Rejection of Structuralist methods Interactionists reject statistical (quantitative) data, a method preferred by structuralists. These methods include; experiments, structured interviews, questionnaires, non-participant observation and secondary sources. They have a few basic criticisms, namely: *Statistical data is not \\"valid\\". This is to say that these methods don't provide us with a true picture of society on the topic being researched. *Research is biased and therefore not objective. Whilst the sociologist would be distant, it is argued that a hypothesis means the research is biased towards a pre-set conclusion (Rosenhan experiment in 1973). This is again rejected by Interactionists, who claim it is artificial, and also raises ethical issues to experiment on people. Preferred Interactionist Methods Interactionists prefer several methods to contrast with Structuralist methods, namely; unstructured interviews, covert participant observation, overt participant observation, and analysing historical, public and personal documents by content analysis. Interactionist methods generally reject the absolute need to provide statistics. Statistics allows cause and effect to be shown , as well as isolating variables so that relationships and trends can be distinguished over time. Instead, interactionists want to \\"go deep\\" to explain society. This draws criticisms such as: *Information and sociological research cannot be compared or contrasted, hence we can never truly understand how society changes. Data are not reliable. *The information that is gathered is interpreted (hence the name \\"Interpretivist\\") by a sociologist, therefore it isn't objective, but biased. Despite these criticisms, interactionist methods do allow flexibility. The fact that there is no hypothesis means that the sociologist is not rooted in attempting to prove dogma or theory. Instead, researchers react to what they discover, not assuming anything about society. (This is not entirely true. There can be hypotheses for many studies using interactionist methods. The researcher may then be inclined to observe certain events happening while ignoring the bigger picture. This will still bias the results, if such studies are not well conducted. This is arguably why some theorists have turned to this method. It also shows how human behaviour is affected and altered through interactions i.e. socialization.) Case studies *Field experiments: David Rosenhan 1973. Studied the treatment of mental health in California and got 8 normal researchers to carry out the study at 12 hospitals. Critics say the method is unethical, and the vast majority of Interactionists concur. *Unstructured interviews: William Labov 1973. Study of socio-linguistics. Joan Smith 1998. Aaron Cicourel and John Kitsuse 1963 ethno-methodology study in American schools. Howard Becker 1971. *Participant observation: John Howard Griffin, Michael Haralambos. Interactionist links to other theories Interactionism, or the idea that individuals have more awareness, skill and power to change their own situation, links to several other theories. Neo-Marxists Neo-Marxism is a loose term for various twentieth-century approaches that amend or extend Marxism and Marxist theory, usually by incorporating elements from other intellectual traditions, such as critical theory, psychoanalysis, or existentialism. Pluralism Pluralism is the idea that the \\"public gets what the public wants.\\" It is the notion that our lives offer choice like a representative democracy. This idea of consumer choice means that each individual has power as a consumer to change any aspect of life if he/she wishes to do so. The situation that exists is, according to the theory, a reflection of the norms, values and beliefs of the majority of people. It fits with the idea of individual power, although interactionist sociologists may not accept the idea that we are all labeled as \\"consumers\\".

History  Seal of Zwantepolc de Danceke, 1228 Danzig while part of the monastic state of the Teutonic Knights Danzig not affected by the First Partition of Poland (1772) The models for the Danzig Law were the statute books of the Holy Roman Empire and of other Hanseatic cities, especially L√ºbeck. The merchant city received L√ºbeck law in 1226. In the 15th century, the Prussian Confederation was founded to oppose the policy of the Teutonic Order. The Prussian Confederation supported accession to Poland, triggering the Thirteen Years' War. During that time, Danzig continued with its own set of law system, which its self-government. The recognition of this law, and other Danzig's privileges, by the King of Poland was a prerequisite for allying with him resp. subjecting as Royal Prussia to his overlordship. The Second Peace of Thorn of 1466 confirmed the rights. When they were in danger in the 1570s, it led to the Danzig rebellion and the Siege of Danzig (1577). In the First Partition of Poland in 1772, the Kingdom of Prussia took over Royal Prussia (but not yet Danzig and Thorn (Toru≈Ñ) and called it West Prussia. The Latin names Prussia Orientalis and Prussia Occidentalis were for centuries prior used for both parts (East and West) of Prussia. Danzig continued its self-government for two decades to come, then in 1793 was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia and its Prussian Danzig Law codes were supplanted by standardized Prussian laws.

Danzig had a special status, due to its large population (in 1772 47,600 inside the city walls, 35,000 to 40,000 outside), its harbour and wealth. Some of its politicians maintained that it was loyal only to the King of Poland, claiming that its status was similar to an Imperial Free City. This position was never accepted by the Sejm. Modern German author compare it to status of Marseille in 16th and 17th century towards the French King.Gegen√ºber der Szlachta und dem Sejm berief sich die Stadt auf den polnischen K√∂nig als alleinigen Oberherrn: \\"da√ü die Stadt dem K√∂nige von Polen, sowohl dem regierenden als dessen erstgekr√∂nten Nachfolgern, und sonst niemanden die Treue gelobet [...]. Wannenhero es ein Fehler ist, wann zuweilen vorgegeben wird, die Republik Polen sei Herr √ºber die Stadt und ihre Rechte [...].

It was introduced in 1893, and in the 21st century the brand name is recognized by 99 percent of Americans, with total sales in 2002 of 153 million units. Description Metal advertising sign. Flavor Which fruit serves as the model for its flavor is kept vague in advertising, though in 2003, advertising agency BBDO characterized it as a combination of banana and pineapple, and some people say it resembles jackfruit. According to two books in the Imponderables series, peach is one crucial flavor among many others. It is likely that the chemical used for flavoring is isoamyl acetate (sometimes known as banana oil), a carboxylic ester, which is also found in jackfruit . Consumer demographics The average age of the typical Juicy Fruit consumer is under 20, with three to eleven year olds making up the heart of the business; those twenty years old and over account for 40% of the purchases. Sean Payton, head coach of the New Orleans Saints of the NFL, is well known for requesting Juicy Fruit in the middle of games. Ingredients Juicy Fruit gum consists mostly of sugar contained in a synthetic gum base. Other ingredients include corn syrup and dextrose as bulk agents and natural sweeteners, natural and artificial flavorings, glycerol and lecithin as softening agents, aspartame (NutraSweet) and acesulfame K as artificial sweeteners, Yellow Lake 5 as a coloring and BHT as a preservative. In the UK the ingredients used are as listed: Sugar, Gum Base, Glucose Syrup, Flavourings, Humectant (Glycerol), Emulsifier (Soybean Lecithin), Sweeteners (Acesulfame K, Sucralose), Antioxidant (BHA). History When William Wrigley Jr. started his new business in Chicago, he began by selling his father's Scouring Soap, which he would entice customers to purchase by adding a free gift of baking powder. Unfortunately for Wrigley Jr., this ended up being far more popular than the Scouring Soap, so he switched to selling the baking powder instead. In 1892, Wrigley Jr. decided to give his baking powder customers a free gift, this time, attaching a few sticks of chewing gum to the box of baking powder. The chewing gum was far more popular than the baking powder, so Wrigley Jr. again switched his business this time to chewing gum. In 1893, Wrigley Jr. introduced a new flavor of gum, Juicy Fruit, which helped the Wrigley Company to become the most popular and successful chewing gum company in the world.http://www.wrigley.com/global/about-us/ourfounder.aspx A Juicy Fruit wrapper from 1946, described on the package as a \\"fascinating artificial flavor\\". When the brand first entered the market, it was packaged simply, with a plain wrapper and \\"JUICY FRUIT\\" in red, thin block letters. In 1914, Wrigley changed it to thin vertical white and green stripes with \\"Wrigley's Juicy Fruit Chewing Gum\\" centered in a stylized Maltese Cross emblem with a black background.Juicy Fruit Packaging , from Wrigley's website Juicy Fruit was taken off of the civilian market temporarily during World War II because of ingredient shortages and the demand for the gum to be included in C-rations. When the gum was re introduced to the general public after World War II ended, the striped packaging was replaced by one with a bright yellow background and \\"Juicy Fruit\\" bracketed between two stylized chevrons, the latter a motif meant to echo the \\"Wrigley arrow\\" element used for Wrigley's Spearmint since 1893. The bright yellow background remained into the 21st century, with variations since 2002 turning the arrowhead like chevrons into the corners of an elongated smile under the brand name. Juicy Fruit is still widely popular today. In 2003 in the United States, Wrigley's replaced some of the sugar in Juicy Fruit with two artificial sweeteners, aspartame and Ace K. In 2009, Wrigley's started selling a sugar free version of Juicy Fruit. \\"Grapefruit‚ÄîJuicy Fruit\\" is a song written and performed by American popular music singer songwriter Jimmy Buffett. It was first released on his 1973 album A White Sport Coat and a Pink Crustacean and was his third single from that album. The single reached #23 on the Billboard Easy Listening chart in September 1973. It also features in the 1983 song \\"Juicy Fruit\\" by Mtume. Separately, a Juicy Fruit jingle that ended with the lyrics‚Äî\\"the taste, the taste, the taste is gonna move ya!\\"‚Äîwas widely recognizable in TV advertisements throughout the 1980s.

It stars Oliver Reed and Orson Welles. The film deals with creativity and commercialism.  Plot  The opening credits run as a man carries a large axe through the streets of London. He then enters an office and destroys a desk with the axe. The man, Quint (Oliver Reed) works for Dallafield Advertising alongside Lute (Orson Welles). Although Quint is married he then goes through a series of affairs with younger women. He starts remembering his cruel school life and these memories become intertwined with the present. Disillusioned London advertising executive Andrew Quint (Reed) attempts to get back at his boss Jonathan Lute (Welles) by making a negative commercial reusing themes from earlier in the film, including Lute saying \\"The number one product of all human endeavor is waste... waste.\\" The commercial, advertising a Super-8 camera, talks about capturing events while you still can before everything is destroyed and discarded. It ends with Quint operating a car crusher and destroying numerous cameras. The commercial is hailed as a masterpiece, and wins an award, but Quint hurls the award into the River Thames, and escapes into Swinging London.  Cast  Soundtrack  The soundtrack by Francis Lai was released on LP by Decca Records.  Reception  The film received generally positive reviews.  Controversy  In the United States, the film was denied a MPAA seal of approval due to a scene between Oliver Reed and Carol White which supposedly implied cunnilingus. Winner, in his audio commentary, said he considered the scene to show masturbation. The Catholic League inaccurately described it as \\"fellatio\\". Universal distributed the film through a subsidiary that was not a member of the MPAA. Along with a similar scene in Charlie Bubbles (1967), this helped to bring about the end of the Production Code in the US and its replacement with a ratings system. The film has been incorrectly named as the first mainstream film to propose the use in the dialogue of fuck. In fact, the BBFC certified the film after demanding the removal, or at least obscuring, of the word fucking in June 1967, three months later than Ulysses, which suffered heavier cuts. The error seems to have arisen because of a longstanding lack of easily obtainable film release date information.

It is the administrative centre of the local government area of Hornsby Shire. History The name Hornsby is derived from convict-turned-constable Samuel Henry Horne, who took part in the apprehension of bushrangers Dalton and MacNamara on 22 June 1830. In return he was granted land which he named Hornsby Place. The suburb of Hornsby was established on the traditional lands of the Darug and Kurringgai people. There are more than 200 known Aboriginal sites in the Hornsby Shire. The first European settler in the area was Thomas Higgins, who received a grant of land in Old Mans Valley. A railway station named \\"Hornsby Junction\\" opened on 17 September 1886 to the north of the town of Hornsby, which had developed on the site of Horne's grant. It formed the junction of the Northern Line and the North Shore Line which were yet to be completed at that time. Hornsby station was one stop further south on the Northern Line. Due to confusion by commuters alighting at the incorrect station expecting to transfer to a connecting train, the old Hornsby station was renamed Normanhurst on 17 November 1898 after prominent local activist and engineer Norman Selfe, while the Hornsby Junction station assumed the current name of Hornsby. The first Hornsby Post Office opened on 1 August 1864, and was renamed South Hornsby on 1 May 1900, the same day Hornsby Junction office near the railway station (open since 1887) was renamed Hornsby. The latter office remains open; the South Hornsby office was renamed Normanhurst in 1905. Residential growth in the area was left to private developers, who acquired land both east and west of the railway station. Realizing that working class housing tended to be close to railway stations, the developers aimed at providing the middle classes with quality housing further from the station, in areas with views. One of the first purchasers of land in the area was Annie Roberts, wife of Oscar Garibaldi Roberts, who became one of the first councilors in the Hornsby Shire. Having acquired a property in Rosemead Road, the Roberts family built \\"Mount Errington,\\" a spectacular mansion in the Arts and Crafts style, now heritage-listed.State Heritage Register The Roberts family later acquired twelve blocks of land, which were then sub-divided into twenty-three blocks and offered for sale as the Roberts Mount Errington Sub- division. The area proceeded to grow as a prestige housing estate, featuring a number of houses in the Federation style. One of them was Birklands, a heritage-listed, Federation house built in 1902 in Dural Street. The house was originally built for Louis Spier Roberts and his wife Elizabeth, and stayed with the Roberts family until 1938.Hornsby Council Heritage List The Hornsby Shire Council was established in 1906. In 1961, The Westfield Group built a shopping mall at Hornsby, making it one of the first suburbs in Sydney with a modern-style shopping centre. A competing shopping centre, Northgate, opened in 1979 but was eventually bought by Westfield. In late 1999, the two sites were amalgamated when the original Westfield was demolished and Northgate was renovated to create the new Westfield Hornsby which opened in November 2001.

Hornsby railway station is the junction of the T1 North Shore and the T9 Northern Line of the Sydney Trains network and is a hub for some services and is connected via bridge to Westfield. There are frequent railway services to the central business district via Strathfield or via Gordon. Intercity and regional trains also stop at Hornsby on the way to the Central Coast, Newcastle and further north. Bus services operate from Hornsby Station Interchange. Services are operated by Transdev NSW's Upper North Shore service, Hillsbus and State Transit. Transdev NSW operates bus services to local residential areas including Hornsby, Westleigh, Normanhurst, Thornleigh, Wahroonga, Warrawee and Turramurra. Transdev NSW operates one cross regional service from the Hornsby Interchange with; * Route 575 to Macquarie University via Wahroonga, Turramurra, Pymble, Macquarie Park and Macquarie Centre; and Hornsby Station is also served by the Metrobus - a high capacity and high frequency bus network. * Route 600 operated by Hillsbus travels to Parramatta via Cherrybrook, Castle Hill & Baulkham Hills and Northmead at 5-15-minute frequencies. Hornsby Interchange is served by two NightRide bus routes with: * Route N80 - to Town Hall via Strathfield operated by Hillsbus; and * Route N90 - to Town Hall via Chatswood operated by State Transit. The Pacific Highway, which passes through Hornsby, was formerly the main road link between Sydney and north-eastern Australia. The completion of the Pacific Motorway (M1), which has its southern end at the neighbouring suburb of Wahroonga, means that the heavy traffic now bypasses the already busy Hornsby town area.F3 Freeway Commercial areas thumb Hornsby remains a busy commercial centre, just as it was a century ago. Over the years, the town centre has developed distinct characteristics on either side of the railway line. The western side consists of a traditional high street shopping village along the Old Pacific Highway. A short section of the highway north of the shops still has several antique lamp posts preserved. On the eastern side of the highway from south to north are the police station, the court housecourt house and the historic Hornsby Shire Council chamber (built in two stages in 1915 and 1930). On the western side is Hornsby Park with the new Hornsby Aquatic Centre complex and also Hornsby TAFE.Gregory's Street Directory, 59th Edition 1995, Map 191 F16 A large war memorial and the adjacent RSL Club is located at the southern end of the shops. The eastern side is dominated by Westfield Hornsby, a shopping centre, which features a David Jones department store, an Event Cinemas multiplex, 335 stores, a food court and several restaurants. The intersection of Florence Street and Hunter Street became a pedestrian mall in the early 1990s. At the centre of the pedestrian mall is a large water clock sculpture, designed by Victor Cusack. The public library, Hornsby Shire Library, is also located in this area. The north-western side of the suburb is occupied by various industries and the northern end of Hornsby features a major railway workshop. Residential areas Residential areas, consisting of low-to-medium density housing, are located on both sides of the railway line. Many of residential areas on the western side of the train line enjoy bushy surrounds and close proximity to Regional and National Parks, as well as the beautiful Lisgar Gardens. In recent years, high-rise apartments have been constructed adjacent to the train line as part of the NSW state planning policies to allow medium to high density development along transport corridors. Schools Hornsby is home to a number of schools, including primary schools Hornsby North Public School, Hornsby South Public School, Hornsby Heights Public School and Clarke Road Special School and the secondary schools Barker College and Hornsby Girls' High School, which is a selective school. There is also a TAFE College at the north-western side of Hornsby. Culture Hornsby has long been associated with Ginger Meggs,Ginger Meggs a cartoon by Jimmy Bancks who grew up in Hornsby, which has appeared in Australian newspapers since 1921.

Hornsby Aquatic Centre Hornsby Aquatic Centre, which was built in 1962, had reached the end of its safe working life, and was closed on Friday 24 December 2010. It had featured a fifty-metre pool with 8 lanes and a small twelve-metre pool, also with 8 lanes.

His house, known as Coringah, was located on a property at the corner of Burdett Street and Sherbrook Road, and included a large garden. This property had originally been obtained in 1901 by Edward Swain, who built the cottage that still stands. The property was purchased by Edward Lear in 1916 and then by Edgeworth David in 1920. David's wife continued to live there after his death in 1934. After David's death, subsequent owners preserved the garden, until Hornsby Council acquired the property in 1999. It is now known as Edgeworth David Garden and is open to the public. It is heritage-listed.State Heritage Register ; Lisgar Gardens Fishponds in Lisgar Gardens Lisgar Gardens are located in Lisgar Road, west of the Pacific Highway. The gardens were created by Max Cotton, who lived in Lisgar Road. In 1920, Cotton purchased land from his brother Leo and began developing the gardens for his own interest and satisfaction. With these gardens, Cotton could indulge his interest in horticulture and genetics. Aided by friends and family, he created extensive gardens and fishponds on the natural bushland that sloped down from Lisgar Road. Cotton became friends with Professor Eben Gowrie Waterhouse‚Äîowner of Eryldene in the suburb of Gordon‚Äîand the two spent much time together, sharing an interest in camellias. By the mid-1960s, Cotton's health was failing after forty-five years of working on the gardens, and they were acquired by Hornsby Council. They were officially opened to the public on 21 September 1968. They are heritage-listed.State Heritage Register ; Florence Cotton Park This park consists of a stretch of natural bushland between Frederick Street and Lisgar Gardens. Jimmy Bancks Creek runs through the park. Birdlife is varied and includes currawongs and brushturkeys. Hornsby Council has constructed a walking track that goes from Frederick Street to Lisgar Gardens. The park is named after Florence Cotton, wife of Leo Cotton, and was part of their estate. Florence Street in Hornsby was also named after her.Hornsby Council ; Ginger Meggs Park Plaque in Ginger Meggs Park This park is located in Valley Road and is named after Ginger Meggs, a comic-strip character created by the Australian cartoonist Jimmy Bancks. Bancks spent much time in the area around this park during his childhood, so Hornsby Council named it after his famous character Ginger Meggs. A nearby creek was named Jimmy Bancks Creek. The park was officially named Ginger Meggs Park during a formal naming ceremony by the Mayor of Hornsby, John Muirhead, on 26 July 1997. ; Hornsby Quarry The quarry, located at the end of Quarry Road Hornsby,Hornsby Quarry Google Maps was partially filled, to make it safe, using excavated material from the NorthConnex tunnel that is currently being built by the NSW Government to link the M1 and M2 motorways.

The genus is monotypic with a single species recognized, Stellamedusa ventana. The species was first described in the Journal of the Marine Biological Association in 2004 by Kevin Raskoff and George Matsumoto of the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute. As of February 2004, seven specimens have been observed, five off the California coast in Monterey Bay and two in the Gulf of California. Unlike most medusae, they lack marginal tentacles. Specimens so far found reach almost 10 cm in diameter, which is large for a scyphomedusa. The bell is blue-white in colour. The exumbrella is white, and this and the four oral arms are covered with large nematocyst-laden projections filled with stinging cells, enabling the jelly to capture food items of a variety of sizes; it seems to prefer large prey, up to half its size, which is unusual in jellies that capture prey with their bells rather than with tentacles. The bumpy appearance that the stinging cells give to the jelly led to its common name. The species name comes from the remotely operated vehicle (ROV) Ventana, a deep-diving robot submarine that first recorded the jelly on video in 1990. Stellamedusa ventana has so far been observed only at mesopelagic depths, i.e. between 150 and 550 meters. At these depths, sunlight does not penetrate, but there is still a reasonable amount of oxygen. Many species of jellyfishes live at this level, and it is likely that S. ventana feeds primarily on other jellies. Another large jellyfish discovered by the same researchers is Tiburonia granrojo.

The stores are aimed towards an audience interested in rock music and video gaming, and most of their audience ranges from teens to young adults. Approximately 40% of Hot Topic's revenue comes from sales of licensed band T-shirts. Hot Topic often negotiates exclusive licensing arrangements with musical artists, movie studios, and graphic artists. The majority of the stores are located in regional shopping malls. History The first Hot Topic store was opened in November 1989 in Montclair Plaza, Montclair, California, by Orv Madden, a former executive at The Children's Place, who retired as CEO in 2000 and was replaced by Betsy McLaughlin, who headed the company until 2011. Lisa Harper assumed the position of CEO in March 2011 until Steve Vranes was announced as the new CEO in 2016. The company went public and began trading on NASDAQ in 1996. In 2013, Hot Topic announced its sale to private equity firm Sycamore Partners for $600 million. Product assortment and sales Hot Topic at Universal CityWalk in Hollywood, California, displaying the Hot Topic logo used during the peak of the company's popularity. The store has been through a number of phases in its history, reflective of various alternative culture and pop culture (including geek culture) trends. In the early 2000s, the store was known for heavily marketing nu-metal merchandise relating to bands. During that period, the store was also known for its sales of controversial gel bracelets (often rumored to be \\"sex bracelets\\") as well as the equally controversial styles of phat pants-inspired bondage pants popular among teenagers in the late 1990s and early-to-mid 2000s. The store later focused on skinny jeans and merchandise related to scene, emo and hardcore music and fashion. At present, the store's selection is largely focused on licensed video game merchandise and internet memes popular on sites such as tumblr, as well as anime and manga, and the associated otaku subculture. Ventures Hot Topic launched Torrid, a concept store that sells clothing for plus-size women, in 2001. While still under the same parent umbrella as Hot Topic, in 2015 the company branched off to become Torrid, LLC. In 2008, Hot Topic launched ShockHound, an online retailer and social networking music site. In March 2011, Hot Topic made a public statement announcing the shutdown of ShockHound. The site is no longer live, all merchandise was moved to HotTopic.com, and the company ceased sales of MP3s. In August 2010, Hot Topic opened two new stores in Canada, which also marked the chain's first two international outlets. The first store opened on August 11 at Square One Shopping Centre in Mississauga, Ontario, and then at Scarborough Town Centre in Toronto, Ontario the following day. The company has since also opened additional Canadian locations as well as locations in Puerto Rico. In 2012, Hot Topic launched Blackheart Lingerie, a concept store that sells lingerie and clothing for women. On May 26, 2015, Hot Topic announced its intent to acquire Geeknet Inc., owner of the online retailer ThinkGeek, for $122 million. However, the company received a $140 million counter-offer from GameStop, which Hot Topic did not choose to exceed. On October 14, 2015, Hot Topic launched BoxLunch, a gift and novelty retail store. For every $10 spent, a meal is donated to a person in need.

Each player is commonly assigned a set of five consecutively numbered object balls, though the number of balls will vary by number of players. The object of the game is to be the last player with at least one ball of their group remaining on the table. The name \\"cutthroat\\" is not unique to pool, but is used to refer to other games played with three or more players in which all players must fend for themselves, e.g. cutthroat bridge and cutthroat American handball.  Gameplay  When the fifteen balls for cutthroat, the 1 ball is placed on the and the 6 ball and 11 ball are placed on the other two corners of the billiards rack. In cutthroat, there are (usually) three sets of balls. Balls 1‚Äì5 are called the \\"low\\" balls, the \\"mid\\" balls are 6‚Äì10, and the \\"high\\" balls are 11‚Äì15. Each of the three players will eventually \\"own\\" one of these sets of five balls. Winning is accomplished by legally () all of the other players' balls. Whether each shot must be is determined before the game. Each set of five balls is initially unclaimed ‚Äì the ball sets remain \\"open\\" until at least one ball from two sets have been pocketed. For example, if the breaking player pockets the 6 then the 9, that player definitely does not own the 6‚Äì10 group, but does not yet clearly own either 1‚Äì5 or 11‚Äì15. If the player had pocketed the 6 then the 2, the player would definitely be group 11‚Äì15. A foul break thus includes the possibility that the fouling breaker may eventually be assigned a group from which a ball was pocketed on the foul break shot. However, if there was a foul on the break, no set can be claimed and the table is still open, no matter what balls may have been pocketed. A player's turn continues so long as he legally pockets one or more object balls with each shot. A shooter can even knock in his own ball, allowing him to continue a turn in exchange for his now-weakened position. This circumstance is called \\"cutting one's own throat\\". If a player sinks his own last ball (intentionally or otherwise), he must sit out the rest of the game, except as noted below. Fouls A (knocking the cue ball into a pocket or off the table) is subject to special penalties, covered below, and results in the incoming player receiving . The general rules of pocket billiards apply, including typical fouls, such as striking the cue ball twice on the same shot, striking an object ball instead of the cue ball with the cue stick, knocking an object ball off the table, etc. Such fouls end the shooter's turn without further penalty. The incoming player does not have cue ball in-hand, but takes the table as it lies (after balls are spotted). Winning The object is to be the last player with at least one object ball left on the table. When a player has no balls on the table, he is said to be \\"out\\" (eliminated) and his turn is skipped in the player rotation. Under normal rules (where balls are retrieved on a scratch ‚Äì see below), being \\"out\\" may be a temporary condition. Spotting The consequence of a (knocking the cue ball into a pocket or off the table) is that all of the shooter's opponents are rewarded by taking one of their balls (if any have been pocketed) out of a pocket and it back onto the table (with the next shooting player's ball placed in front of the other's ball). Thus, a player who is \\"out\\" returns to the game, with one of their balls back in play, when any then-surviving player scratches. If a scratch occurs after first pocketing an opponent's ball on the same turn, still only one ball per opponent is returned to the table, as the penalty is intended not to nullify the effects of the scratch, but to punish the offender and reward the other players evenly. In the uncommon case that the final shot leaves only the cue ball on the table (the shooting player has pocketed both the final opponent's last ball the shooter's own last ball), one ball of player will be spotted in their order of shooting. The shooting player continues unless the last shot was not made legally. An object ball knocked off the table is spotted, unless it is the shooters own, in which case it is pocketed. Variations=Alternative group selection A common variation is that the first shooter to legally pocket a ball without a () gets to claim any set that he wants to be his own. If the shooter pockets any ball (without fouling), he can claim any set, and continues shooting. The next shooter who legally pockets a ball during his turn gets to claims ownership of one of the two remaining sets. In the advent of a foul break, the first successive shooter to legally pocket a ball gets to claim any set, and the next shooter who legally pockets a ball claims one of the remaining sets. A less common variation (because it involves risk to the breaker) is that the sets are assigned before the start of play: the breaking shooter has 1‚Äì5, the second player has 6‚Äì10, and the third has 11‚Äì15. Alternative scratch and spotting rules In the event of a cue-ball scratch, each of the fouling player's opponents who was still in the game before the foul may return one of their pocketed balls to the table. Players who were already \\"out\\" before that shot remain out. In this version, if the shooter pockets both the last remaining opponent object ball and the shooter's own final object ball (i.e. all balls are down but the cue ball), then only a player who was still in the game (typically the shooter and the final opponent) before that last shot may spot a ball; eliminated players do not return to the game. The same shooter continues. Another variation (regardless of the above spotting rule) that is common in North America is that the incoming player after a scratch receives cue ball in-hand behind the () only, not in-hand anywhere on the table. More players Team play can be pairs (or more) of players being assigned to each of the three sets of balls and taking alternating turns or (in format) alternating shots during their turn. The game generally is also playable by five players (or teams), with each owning three balls rather than five. Variant ball sets (with smaller and more numerous balls, and a custom rack for them) have also been manufactured for a larger number of players. The game is possible with any number of players from two to 15. Because some combinations would result in not all of the players having the same number of balls, sometimes one or more must be taken out of the rack. * Two players: seven balls each * Three players: five balls each * Four or five players: three balls each * Six or seven players: two balls each * Eight to 15 players: one ball each Eagle Pool Balls manufactures a ball set using colored rather than numbered groups of balls, with which three- to five-player cutthroat can be played. It makes use of different sizes and shapes of racks: a standard triangle rack of three groups of five balls each for three players; a custom, large diamond rack of four groups of four balls each for four players; and a standard triangle rack of five groups of three balls each for five players.United States Patent 6902490, http://www.freepatentsonline.com/6902490.html Multi-game scoring Various point systems may be used to play matches or sets, rather than just one game. With its uniqueness as a three player game, counting games won is possible but does not give credit for finishing second. One system is awarding three points for a win, plus an additional one point for each of the winner's remaining balls at the end of each game. The player last eliminated receives two points, the first eliminated player none. There may also be a bonus awarded for playing a perfect game, sinking both opponents' sets of 5 balls while having all 5 of yours remaining (Usually 2 points, making a perfect game worth 10 points total: 3 for the win, 5 for remaining balls, plus 2 bonus). This system emphasizes strategy regarding whom to eliminate first as the match goes on, often creating alliances of the two trailing players to catch the leader in points. The match may be won by reaching a set number of points, or reaching a set deadline in time. Coin-operated table play When played on coin- operated tables (such that balls cannot be returned to play at will once pocketed, only after paying for another game) a player who scratches selects one of his or her own balls to be pocketed immediately, in lieu of opponents' balls returning to the table. In the event that a scratch occurs on the same shot that an opponent's ball is pocketed, the affected opponent is permitted to select a ball belonging to the offender which is to be removed instead of the player that scratched choosing the ball to be pocketed. In either case, this can result in the scratching player being \\"out\\". In popular culture ‚Ä¢The game is referenced by Rick Danko of The Band in the opening scene of the classic rock film The Last Waltz. ‚Ä¢The game is referenced by Kato Kaelin and Tom Green of Celebrity Big Brother 2 during many hours of live feeds.

The F 5 was a low-wing tandem two-seat monoplane which retained the fabric- covered steel-tube fuselage of the earlier Fieseler F 4 but introduced a new two-spar cantilever wing. It had a fixed conventional landing gear with a tail-skid and the tandem open-cockpit were fitted with dual-controls. Behind the rear seat was a large luggage locker, the top decking at the rear could be removed to carry a spare propeller or skis.

His career as an actor spanned over forty years. His upper-class English accent and bass voice often led him to be cast as sophisticated but villainous characters. He is perhaps best known as Jack Favell in Rebecca (1940), Scott ffolliott in Foreign Correspondent (1940, a rare heroic part), The Saran of Gaza in Samson and Delilah (1949), the most popular film of the year, Addison DeWitt in All About Eve (1950, for which he won an Oscar), Sir Brian De Bois-Guilbert in Ivanhoe (1952), King Richard the Lionheart in King Richard and the Crusaders (1954), Mr. Freeze in a two-parter episode of Batman (1966), the voice of the malevolent man-hating tiger Shere Khan in Disney's The Jungle Book (1967), suave crimefighter, The Falcon during the 1940s (a role eventually bequeathed to his elder brother, Tom Conway), and as Simon Templar, The Saint, in five films made in the 1930s and 1940s.George Sanders The Guardian 26 Apr 1972: 5. Early life Sanders was born in Saint Petersburg, Russian Empire, at number 6 Petrovski Ostrov. His parents were Henry Peter Ernest Sanders (1868‚Äì1960),freebmd.org.uk (deaths) and Margarethe Jenny Bertha Sanders (n√©e Kolbe; 1883‚Äì1967), who was born in Saint Petersburg, of mostly German, but also Estonian and Scottish, ancestry. A biography published in 1990 claimed that Sanders' father was the illegitimate son of a prince of the House of Oldenburg and a Russian noblewoman of the Tsar‚Äôs court, married to a sister of the Tsar. The actor Tom Conway (1904‚Äì1967) was George Sanders' elder brother. Their younger sister, Margaret Sanders, was born in 1912. In 1917, at the outbreak of the Russian Revolution, Sanders and his family moved to England.Sanders 1960, pp. 9‚Äì10, 13. Like his brother, he attended Bedales School and Brighton College, a boys' independent school in Brighton, then went on to Manchester Technical College after which he worked in textile research.Sanders 1960, p. 17. Sanders travelled to South America where he managed a tobacco plantation. The Depression sent him back to England. He worked at an advertising agency, where the company secretary, the aspiring actress Greer Garson, suggested that he take up a career in acting.Sanders 1960, p. 54. Career In the trailer for Alfred Hitchcock's Foreign Correspondent (1940) Early British work Sanders learned how to sing and got a role on stage in Ballyhoo, which only had a short run but helped establish him as an actor. He began to work regularly on the British stage, appearing several times with Edna Best. He co-starred with Dennis King in The Command Performance. He appeared in a British film, Love, Life and Laughter (1934). Sanders travelled to New York to appear on Broadway in a production of No√´l Coward's Conversation Piece (1934), directed by Coward, which only ran for 55 performances. He returned to England, where he had small parts in films like Things to Come (1936), Strange Cargo (1936), Find the Lady (1936), The Man Who Could Work Miracles (1936), and Dishonour Bright (1936). Hollywood and 20th Century Fox Some of these British films were distributed by 20th Century Fox who were looking for an actor to play a villain in their Hollywood-shot film Lloyd's of London (1936). Sanders was duly cast as Lord Everett Stacy, opposite Tyrone Power, in one of his first leads, as the hero; Sanders' smooth upper-class English accent, his sleek manner and his suave, superior and somewhat threatening air made him in demand for American films for years to come.Sanders 1960, p.117 Lloyds of London was a big hit and in November 1936 Fox put Sanders under a seven-year contract (though he would frequently be loaned to other studios, notably RKO).MISSES LOMBARD AND RUSSELL DEBATED FOR \\"IDIOT'S DELIGHT\\" Schallert, Edwin. Los Angeles Times 02 Dec 1936: 8. Fox cast him opposite Power again in Love Is News (1937), then he supported Wallace Beery in Slave Ship (1937) and Gloria Stuart in The Lady Escapes (1937). Public response to Sanders had been strong, so Fox gave him his first heroic lead, in the B picture Lancer Spy (1937) with Dolores del R√≠o. He and del R√≠o were promptly reteamed in International Settlement (1938). Sanders was second-billed (to Richard Greene) in John Ford's Four Men and a Prayer (1938), Fox had him play a villain in Mr. Moto's Last Warning (1939). Sanders returned to Britain to make The Outsider (1939) for Associated British Picture Corporation and So This Is London (1939) for Fox. The Saint, The Falcon, and character roles Sanders returned to Hollywood, where RKO wanted him to play the hero in a series of B-movies, The Saint. The Saint in New York (1938) had already been made starring Louis Hayward in the title role, but when he decided not to return to the role Sanders took over for The Saint Strikes Back (1939).George Sanders to Play 'Saint' Role Schallert, Edwin. Los Angeles Times 15 Nov 1938: A15. Sanders was now being cast as international villains: in Mr. Moto's Last Warning, Confessions of a Nazi Spy, Nurse Edith Cavell, and Allegheny Uprising (all 1939). RKO sent Sanders to England, where its British unit (including director John Paddy Carstairs) filmed The Saint in London (1939). He played a double role in The Saint's Double Trouble (1940), then went to Universal for Green Hell (1940) and The House of the Seven Gables (1940). Alfred Hitchcock wanted him for a supporting role in Rebecca (1940), a huge success. After The Saint Takes Over (1940), Hitchcock used him again in Foreign Correspondent (1940). MGM used him as a villain in Bitter Sweet (1940) and he performed a similar function for Edward Small in The Son of Monte Cristo (1940). Sanders made his last appearance as Simon Templar in The Saint in Palm Springs (1941), then MGM called him back for Rage in Heaven (1941), an early film noir, playing the trustworthy good guy whose best friend, Robert Montgomery, goes murderously insane and sets him up for the rap. Sanders was a villain in Man Hunt (1941) but heroic in Sundown (1941). The Falcon RKO had been fighting with Leslie Charteris, creator of The Saint, so they stopped the series and put Sanders in a new B picture series about a suave crimefighter, The Falcon. The first entry was The Gay Falcon (1941). It was popular and quickly followed by A Date with the Falcon (1942). At Fox he was in Son of Fury: The Story of Benjamin Blake (1942) with Tyrone Power, then it was back to The Falcon Takes Over (1942), based on Farewell, My Lovely. MGM used him in Her Cardboard Lover (1942) and he was one of several stars in Tales of Manhattan (1942). Sanders was tiring of The Falcon, so he handed the role to his brother Tom Conway, in The Falcon's Brother (1942), in which both appeared (and Sanders was killed off). The only other film in which the two siblings appeared together was Death of a Scoundrel (1956), in which they also played brothers. A-picture leading man Sanders was borrowed by United Artists to play the lead in an A film, The Moon and Sixpence (1942), based on the novel by W.

Final years and death Sanders as Captain Billy Leech in The Black Swan (1942) Sanders suffered from dementia, worsened by waning health, and visibly teetered in his last films, owing to a loss of balance. Sanders grew increasingly reclusive and depressed due to a string of tragedies including the loss of his wife, his mother, and his brother Tom in the space of a year, followed by a failed sausage investment which cost him millions. According to Aherne's biography, he also had a minor stroke. Sanders could not bear the prospect of losing his health or needing help to carry out everyday tasks and became deeply depressed. At about this time he found that he could no longer play his grand piano, so he dragged it outside and smashed it with an axe. His last girlfriend persuaded him to sell his beloved house in Majorca, Spain, which he later bitterly regretted. From then on he drifted.Aherne 1979, pp. 183, 190. On 23 April 1972, Sanders checked into a hotel in Castelldefels, a coastal town near Barcelona.

It is located in a building designed by Peter and Ursula Trint (of Cologne) and Dieter Quast (of Heidelberg), adjacent to the Maschsee. The museum opened in 1979, and the building was extended in 1992. Bernhard Sprengel donated his extensive collection of modern art to the city of Hanover in 1969, as well as financially supporting the construction of the museum. The city of Hanover and the state of Lower Saxony agreed to jointly operate the museum.

The cuboid design of the new building was chosen from 65 entrants in an international architecture competition. The original plan would have created an extra of exhibition space, and was expected to cost around ‚Ç¨25m, with ‚Ç¨10m coming from Lower Saxony's EU funding, ‚Ç¨5m directly from Lower Saxony, ‚Ç¨5m from the city of Hanover, and ‚Ç¨5m expected from donors. These estimates have since been reduced. A major objective of the expansion is to allow extensive coverage of Niki de Saint Phalle and the Hanoverian artist Kurt Schwitters. The new building will also be used for one-off international exhibitions. Works Umberto Boccioni, 1911, The Street Enters the House, oil on canvas, 100 x 100.6 cm Besides Schwitters and de Saint Phalle, the Sprengel Museums's key works include those of Max Ernst, Fernand L√©ger, Paul Klee, Pablo Picasso, Emil Nolde, and Max Beckmann from before 1945. In 1988, the museum inherited the estate of the artists and married couple Robert Michel and Ella Bergmann- Michel. The museum publishes a printed inventory of this estate, of which two volumes have so far been published. Since 1993, the Sprengel Museum has contained the Kurt Schwitters Archive, of which the Merz Room is particularly notable.

The article was published in the North American Review, an opinion magazine for America's establishment. It was later published as \\"The Gospel of Wealth\\" in the Pall Mall Gazette. Carnegie proposed that the best way of dealing with the new phenomenon of wealth inequality was for the wealthy to utilize their surplus means in a responsible and thoughtful manner. This approach was contrasted with traditional bequest (patrimony), where wealth is handed down to heirs, and other forms of bequest e.g. where wealth is willed to the state for public purposes. Benjamin Soskis, a historian of philanthropy, refers to the article as the 'urtext' of modern philanthropy. Carnegie argued that surplus wealth is put to best use (i.e. produces the greatest net benefit to society) when it is administered carefully by the wealthy. Carnegie also argues against wasteful use of capital in the form of extravagance, irresponsible spending, or self-indulgence, instead promoting the administration of said capital over the course of one's lifetime toward the cause of reducing the stratification between the rich and poor. As a result, the wealthy should administer their riches responsibly and not in a way that encourages \\"the slothful, the drunken, the unworthy\\". At the age of 35, Carnegie decided to limit his personal wealth and donate the surplus to benevolent causes. He was determined to be remembered for his good deeds rather than his wealth. He became a \\"radical\\" philanthropist. Prior to publishing his ideas about wealth, he began donating to his favorite causes, starting by donating a public bath to his hometown of Dunfermline. As Carnegie tried to live his life in a way that the poor could benefit from his wealth, he decided he needed to share his ideas with the public.  Assertions  The Gospel of Wealth asserts that hard work and perseverance lead to wealth. Carnegie based his philosophy on the observation that the heirs of large fortunes frequently squandered them in riotous living rather than nurturing and growing them. Even bequeathing one's fortune to charity was no guarantee that it would be used wisely, due to the fact that there was no guarantee that a charitable organization not under one's direction would use the money in accordance with one's wishes. Carnegie disapproved of charitable giving that maintained the poor in their impoverished state, and urged a movement toward the creation of a new mode of giving that would create opportunities for the beneficiaries of the gift to better themselves. As a result, the gift would not be simply consumed, but would be productive of even greater wealth throughout the house. In \\"The Gospel of Wealth\\", Carnegie examines the modes of distributing accumulated wealth and capital to the communities from which they originate. He preached that ostentatious living and amassing private treasures were wrong. He praised the high British taxes on the estates of dead millionaires, remarking that \\"By taxing estates heavily at death the State marks its condemnation of the selfish millionaire's unworthy life. It is desirable that nations should go much further in this direction.\\" Carnegie made it clear that the duty of the rich was to live modest lifestyles,http://legacy.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1889carnegie.asp and that any surplus of money they had was best suited for re-circulation back into society where it could be used to support the greater good. He shunned aristocratic chains of inheritance and argued that dependents should be supported by their work with major moderation, with the bulk of excess wealth to be spent on enriching the community. In cases where excess wealth was held until death, he advocated its apprehension by the state on a progressive scale: \\"Indeed, it is difficult to set bounds to the share of a rich man's estates which should go at his death to the public through the agency of the State, and by all means such taxes should be granted, beginning at nothing upon moderate sums to dependents, and increasing rapidly as the amounts swell, until of the millionaire's hoard, at least the other half comes to the privy coffer of the State.\\" .  Reception  When Carnegie Steel busted the union in 1892, Carnegie was able to keep himself from blame because he focused on his new doctrine for the wealthy. The Homestead Strike ended in a showdown between 300 Pinkerton guards and a crowd of steel workers and supporters devolved into an exchange of gunfire. This outbreak left seven workers and three guards dead, and many more wounded. It made headlines around the world, and reporters reached Carnegie, who was in Scotland at the time. When questioned, Carnegie called the violence \\"deplorable\\" but otherwise pleaded ignorance, and stated \\"I have given up all active control of the business.\\" This move kept him innocent, and he began to focus on his philanthropic work and teaching the Gospel of Wealth. Largely as a result of said philanthropic work, the Homestead Strike did little to mar his reputation. Carnegie's controversial views on wealth sparked a trans-Atlantic debate that argued the nature, purpose, and disposition of wealth.  William Ewart Gladstone  William Ewart Gladstone, the head of the Liberal Party in England, and a friend of Carnegie's, had some sharp remarks on the publication. Even though they were close friends and had similar political ideals, Gladstone did not agree with Carnegie's paper. Gladstone defended primogeniture, unlimited inheritance, and the British Aristocracy. This led to many other critics joining Gladstone in denouncing Carnegie's \\"radical\\" philanthropic ways. These critical reviews led Carnegie to publish a series of essays defending himself. He defended individualism, private property, and the accumulation of personal wealth on the grounds that they benefited the human race in the long run. In an effort to convince his critics that he wasn't saying everyone should get free handouts from the upper class, he edited his original doctrine, so that it read \\"Help those who will help themselves, to provide part of the means by which those who desire to improve may do so.\\" Since many interpreted his writing to mean that all those in poverty should be assisted by the wealthy, it was necessary for Carnegie to clarify that charity has its limitations.  Phoebe Apperson Hearst's \\"Gospel of Wealth\\"  In 1901, U.S. Senator Jonathan Prentiss Dolliver wrote an article for the celebrity magazine Success, titled \\"Phoebe Apperson Hearst and the New Gospel of Wealth\\". Hearst was an American philanthropist and suffragist. According to Dolliver, Hearst saw inadequacies of public schools and was concerned about urban poverty and vice. She, like Carnegie, believed that as a millionaire, it was her duty to help those less fortunate. The purpose of Dolliver's article was to explain Hearst's \\"Gospel of Wealth\\" and illustrate how she should be viewed as a complementary equal to men like Carnegie. She declared that women who were wealthy had a sacred and moral duty to give away their fortunes to causes, especially progressive education and reform, to benefit their communities. Like Carnegie, Hearst was very concerned with giving the lower class the opportunity to be educated at the same level at which the upper class was educated. Also like Carnegie, she established her own free public library. Hers was located in Anaconda, Montana.  Relevance in the Modern Age  Carnegie Free Library of Braddock in Braddock, Pennsylvania, built in 1888, was the first Carnegie Library in the United States. Carnegie put his philosophy into practice through a program of gifts to endow public libraries, known as 'Carnegie libraries' in cities and towns throughout the United States and the English-speaking world, with the idea that he was thus providing people with the tools to better themselves.Abigail Ayres Van Slyck Free To All, p. 22, University of Chicago Press, 1995 In order to ensure that his gifts would not be wasted, he stipulated that the municipality must pass an ordinance establishing a tax to support the library's ongoing operating costs after the initial grant provided the costs for building and equipping the library. Each of these organizations had its own endowment and its own board of trustees. Many of them still exist today. After several communities squandered their grants on extravagant buildings, Carnegie established a system of architectural guidelines that mandated simplicity and functionality. When it became obvious that Carnegie could not give away his entire fortune within his lifetime, he established the Carnegie Foundation to continue his program of giving.

The earliest known code was drafted in 1744 and, since 1788, it has been owned and maintained by its custodian, the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in London. There are currently 42 Laws (always written with a capital \\"L\\") which outline all aspects of how the game is to be played. MCC has re-coded the Laws six times, the seventh and latest code being released in October 2017. The 2nd edition of the 2017 Code came into force on 1 April 2019. The first six codes prior to 2017 were all subject to interim revisions and so exist in more than one version. MCC is a private club which was formerly cricket's official governing body, a role now fulfilled by the International Cricket Council (ICC). MCC retains copyright in the Laws and only the MCC may change the Laws, although usually this is only done after close consultation with the ICC and other interested parties such as the Association of Cricket Umpires and Scorers. Cricket is one of the few sports in which the governing principles are referred to as \\"Laws\\" rather than as \\"rules\\" or \\"regulations\\". In certain cases, however, regulations to supplement and/or vary the Laws may be agreed for particular competitions as required. Those applying to international matches (referred to as \\"playing conditions\\") can be found on the ICC's website. History=Oral tradition The origin of cricket is uncertain and it was first definitely recorded at Guildford in the 16th century. It is believed to have been a boys' game at that time but, from early in the 17th century, it was increasingly played by adults. Rules as such existed and, in early times, would have been agreed orally and subject to local variations. Cricket in the late 17th century became a betting game attracting high stakes and there were instances of teams being sued for non- payment of wagers they had lost.Birley, pp. 14‚Äì16.Buckley (FL18C), p. 2.Maun, p. 33. Articles of Agreement In July and August 1727, two matches were organised by stakeholders Charles Lennox, 2nd Duke of Richmond and Alan Brodrick, 2nd Viscount Midleton. References to these games confirm that they drew up Articles of Agreement between them to determine the rules that must apply in their contests.McCann, pp. 6‚Äì7. The original handwritten articles document drawn up by Richmond and Brodrick has been preserved. It is among papers which the West Sussex Record Office (WSRO) acquired from Goodwood House in 1884.McCann, plate 1 facing page lxiv. This is the first time that rules are known to have been formally agreed, their purpose being to resolve any problems between the patrons during their matches. The concept, however, was to attain greater importance in terms of defining rules of play as, eventually, these were codified as the Laws of Cricket.Birley, pp. 18‚Äì19. The Articles are a list of 16 points, many of which are easily recognised despite their wording as belonging to the modern Laws of Cricket, for example: (a) a Ball caught, the Striker is out; (b) when a Ball is caught out, the Stroke counts nothing; (c) catching out behind the Wicket allowed. Points that differ from the modern Laws (use of italics is to highlight the differences only): (a) the wickets shall be pitched at twenty three yards distance from each other; (b) that twelve Gamesters shall play on each side; (c) the Batt Men for every one they count are to touch the Umpire's Stick; (d) no Player shall be deemed out by any Wicket put down, unless with the Ball in Hand. In modern cricket: (a) the pitch is 22 yards long; (b) the teams are eleven-a-side; (c) runs were only completed if the batsman touched the umpire's stick (which was probably a bat) and this practice was eventually replaced by the batsman having to touch the ground behind the popping crease; (d) run outs no longer require the ball to be in hand.Bowen, p. 43. 1744 code The earliest known code of Laws was enacted in 1744 but not actually printed, so far as it is known, until 1755. They were possibly an upgrade of an earlier code and the intention must have been to establish a universal codification. The Laws were drawn up by the \\"noblemen and gentlemen members of the London Cricket Club\\", which was based at the Artillery Ground, although the printed version in 1755 states that \\"several cricket clubs\\" were involved, having met at the Star and Garter in Pall Mall. A summary of the main points: * there is reference to the toss of a coin and the pitch dimensions (length = 22 yards); * the stumps must be high with a six-inch (152 mm) bail; * the ball must weigh between five and six ounces; * overs last four balls; * the no ball is the penalty for overstepping, which means the hind foot going in front of the bowling crease (i.e., in direct line of the wicket); * the popping crease is exactly 3 feet ten inches before the bowling crease; * various means of \\"it is out\\" are included; * hitting the ball twice and obstructing the field are emphatically out following experiences in the 17th century; * the wicket-keeper is required to be still and quiet until the ball is bowled; * umpires must allow two minutes for a new batsman to arrive and ten minutes between innings (meal and rain breaks presumably excepted); * the umpire cannot give a batsman out if the fielders do not appeal; * the umpire is allowed a certain amount of discretion and it is made clear that the umpire is the \\"sole judge\\" and that \\"his determination shall be absolute\\" The 1744 Laws do not say the bowler must roll (or skim) the ball and there is no mention of prescribed arm action so, in theory, a pitched delivery would have been legal, though potentially controversial. Underarm pitching is believed to have begun in the early 1760s when the Hambledon Club was rising to prominence. The modern straight bat was introduced as a consequence, replacing the old \\"hockey stick\\" bat which was good for hitting a ball on the ground but not for addressing a ball on the bounce.Nyren, pp. 153‚Äì154. In 1771, an incident on the field of play led to the creation of a new Law which remains extant. In a match between Chertsey and Hambledon at Laleham Burway, the Chertsey all-rounder Thomas White used a bat that was the width of the wicket. There was no rule in place to prevent this action and so all the Hambledon players could do was register a formal protest which was signed by Thomas Brett, Richard Nyren and John Small, the three leading Hambledon players. As a result, it was decided by the game's lawmakers that the maximum width of the bat must be four and one quarter inches; this was included in the next revision of the Laws and it remains the maximum width. 1774 code New articles of the game of cricket, 25 February 1774 On Friday, 25 February 1774, the Laws were revised by a committee meeting at the Star and Garter. Chaired by Sir William Draper, the members included prominent cricket patrons the 3rd Duke of Dorset, the 4th Earl of Tankerville, Charles Powlett, Philip Dehany and Sir Horatio Mann. The clubs and counties represented were Kent, Hampshire, Surrey, Sussex, Middlesex and London. A summary of the main points vis-√†-vis the 1744 code: * the bat must not exceed four inches and one quarter in the widest part; * the bowler must deliver the ball with one foot behind the bowling-crease, and within the return-crease; and shall Bowl four balls before he changes wickets, which he shall do but once in the same innings; * the striker is out if he puts his leg before the wicket with a design to stop the ball, and actually prevent the ball from hitting his wicket. The main innovation was the introduction of leg before wicket (lbw) as a means of dismissal. The practice of stopping the ball with the leg had arisen as a negative response to the pitched delivery. As in 1744, there is nothing about the bowler's delivery action. The maximum width of the bat was confirmed following the incident in 1771. As in 1744, the 1774 code asserted that \\"the stumps must be twenty-two inches, the bail six inches long\\". There were only two stumps then, with a single bail. At the Artillery Ground on 22 & 23 May 1775, a lucrative single wicket match was played between Five of Kent (with Lumpy Stevens) and Five of Hambledon (with Thomas White).Haygarth, p. 21‚Äì22. Kent batted first and made 37 to which Hambledon replied with 92, including 75 by John Small. In their second innings, Kent scored 102, leaving Hambledon a target of 48 to win. Small batted last of the Hambledon Five and needed 14 more to win when he went in. He duly scored the runs and Hambledon won by 1 wicket but a great controversy arose afterwards because, three times in the course of his second innings, Small was beaten by Lumpy only for the ball to pass through the two-stump wicket each time without hitting the stumps or the bail.Nyren, p. 156. As a result of Lumpy's protests, the middle stump was introduced, although it was some years before its use became universal.Haygarth, p. 21. 1788 code MCC was founded in 1787 and immediately assumed responsibility for the Laws, issuing a new version on 30 May 1788 which was called \\"The LAWS of the NOBLE GAME of CRICKET as revised by the Club at St. Mary-le-bone\\". The third Law stated: \\"The stumps must be twenty-two inches out of the ground, the bail six inches in length\\". These were the overall dimensions and the requirement for a third stump was unspecified, indicating that its use was still not universal.Haygarth, p. 79. The 1788 code is much more detailed and descriptive than the 1774 code but, fundamentally, they are largely the same. The main difference was in the wording of the lbw Law. In 1774, this said that the batsman is out if, with design, he prevents the ball hitting the wicket with his leg. In 1788, the \\"with design\\" clause was omitted and a new clause was introduced that the ball must have pitched straight. Also in 1788, protection of the pitch was first included in the Laws. By mutual consent between the teams, the pitch could be rolled, watered, covered and mown during a match and the use of sawdust was authorised. Previously, pitches were left untouched during a match. Later MCC codes MCC has revised the Laws periodically, usually within the same code, but at times they have decided to publish an entirely new code: * 19 May 1835 (1835 code) * 21 April 1884 (1884 code) * 7 May 1947 (1947 code) * 21 November 1979 (1980 code) * 3 May 2000 (2000 code) * 1 October 2017 (2017 code). This included gender-neutral language (except that the word \\"batsman\\" was retained), and a code of conduct.New gender-neutral cricket laws officially released by MCC, The Guardian, 12 Apr 2017 Significant changes to the Laws since 1788 Changes to the Laws did not always coincide with the publication of a new code and some of the most important changes were introduced as revisions to the current code and, therefore, each code has more than one version. * The 46 inches between the popping and bowling creases, specified in 1744, was increased to 48 inches in 1819. * The length of the bowling crease, specified as three feet either side of the wicket, was increased to four feet each side in 1902 (i.e., eight feet eight inches in total). After the width of the wicket was increased from eight to nine inches in 1939, the bowling crease was by default reduced in length by half an inch on each side. * The creases were originally cut into the turf. Whitewash was not introduced until the second half of the 19th century, following a suggestion made by Alfred Shaw.Altham, p. 95. * Pitch protection was authorised from 1788 and a number of changes to this Law have been made including the length of time that rolling was permitted, covering of the bowler's footholds, etc. * The dimensions of the wicket changed several times until the current 28 inches by nine inches was agreed in 1931 and confirmed in 1947. At the end of the 17th century, the two-stump wicket then in use is believed to have been 22 inches by six inches. * The width of the bat has been unchanged at four and a quarter inches since the 1771 incident and the length was specified as the current 38 inches in 1835. * The weight of the ball is unchanged since 1774. Its circumference was ruled as between nine and 9.25 inches in 1838; this was reduced to the current measure in 1927. * There were four balls an over in 1744 and this did not change until 1889 when a five-ball over was introduced. In 1900, the over was increased to six balls. The over in Australia and some other countries has at times varied from the English but, from 1979, the six-ball over has been worldwide. * The no ball was at first ruled for overstepping the bowling crease only. Legislation against \\"throwing\\" was first attempted in 1816 when roundarm was coming into use. It was ruled then that the bowler's hand on delivery must not be above the elbow. In many matches, this rule was flagrantly disregarded and matters came to a head in 1827 with the roundarm trial matches. There was no control over bowling action until 1835 when it was ruled that the bowler's hand on delivery must not be above his shoulder. In 1864, overarm bowling was authorised. The rule allowing either of the umpires to call a no ball was introduced in 1899. * Declarations were not authorised until 1889 and then \\"only on the third day\\". In 1900, it was allowed after lunch on the second day; and in 1910 at any time on the second day. It was not until 1957 that a declaration on the first day was authorised. * The follow on was largely unknown in the 18th century and the Laws did not address it until 1835 when it became compulsory after a deficit of 100 runs. The deficit changed a few times in the 19th century until, in 1900, the follow on became optional after a deficit of 150 runs, which remains the position for first-class matches other than Tests, in which the deficit is 200. * According to Gerald Brodribb: \\"No dismissal has produced so much argument as lbw; it has caused trouble from its earliest days\\".Brodribb, p. 241. First introduced in 1774, the main issue has always been the \\"must pitch straight\\" clause. It was changed to \\"must be delivered straight\\" in 1821 and then reverted in 1839. A campaign to have \\"must pitch straight\\" omitted began in 1901 but failed to gain the necessary majority at MCC. In 1937, the Law did change, following a two-year trial period, to allow dismissal after the ball pitched outside the off stump. After long and heated controversy about \\"pad play\\" over the next three decades, the Law was changed again in 1972 to penalise the batsman who had \\"played no stroke\\". The revised wording was confirmed by inclusion in the 1980 code and remains part of the 2000 code. The Laws today Starting on 1 October 2017, the current version of the Laws are the \\"Laws of Cricket 2017 Code\\" which replaced the 6th Edition of the \\"2000 Code of Laws\\". Custodianship of the Laws remains one of MCC's most important roles. The ICC still relies on MCC to write and interpret the Laws, which are the responsibility of MCC's Laws sub-committee. The process in MCC is that the sub-committee prepares a draft which is passed by the main committee. Certain levels of cricket, however, are subject to playing conditions which can differ from the Laws. At international level, playing conditions are implemented by the ICC; at domestic level by each country's board of control. The code of Laws consists of: * Preface; * Preamble to the Laws; * 42 Laws (see below); * 5 Appendices, adding further definitions to the Laws; Setting up the game The first 12 Laws cover the players and officials, basic equipment, pitch specifications and timings of play. These Laws are supplemented by Appendices B, C and D (see below). Law 1: The players. A cricket team consists of eleven players, including a captain. Outside of official competitions, teams can agree to play more than eleven-a- side, though no more than eleven players may field. Law 2: The umpires. There are two umpires, who apply the Laws, make all necessary decisions, and relay the decisions to the scorers. While not required under the Laws of Cricket, in higher level cricket a third umpire (located off the field, and available to assist the on-field umpires) may be used under the specific playing conditions of a particular match or tournament. Law 3: The scorers. There are two scorers who respond to the umpires' signals and keep the score. In men's cricket the ball must weigh between 5.5 and 5.75 ounces (155.9 and 163 g) and measure between 8.81 and 9 in (22.4 and 22.9 cm) in circumference. Law 4: The ball. A cricket ball is between 8.81 and 9 inches (22.4 cm and 22.9 cm) in circumference, and weighs between 5.5 and 5.75 ounces (155.9g and 163g) in men's cricket. A slightly smaller and lighter ball is specified in women's cricket, and slightly smaller and lighter again in junior cricket (Law 4.6). Only one ball is used at a time, unless it is lost, when it is replaced with a ball of similar wear. It is also replaced at the start of each innings, and may, at the request of the fielding side, be replaced with a new ball, after a minimum number of overs have been bowled as prescribed by the regulations under which the match is taking place (currently 80 in Test matches). The gradual degradation of the ball through the innings is an important aspect of the game. Law 5: The bat. The bat is no more than in length, no more than wide, no more than deep at its middle and no deeper than at the edge. The hand or glove holding the bat is considered part of the bat. Ever since the ComBat incident, a highly publicised marketing attempt by Dennis Lillee, who brought out an aluminium bat during an international game, the Laws have provided that the blade of the bat must be made of wood. The Cricket pitch dimensions Law 6: The pitch. The pitch is a rectangular area of the ground long and wide. The Ground Authority selects and prepares the pitch, but once the game has started, the umpires control what happens to the pitch. The umpires are also the arbiters of whether the pitch is fit for play, and if they deem it unfit, with the consent of both captains can change the pitch. Professional cricket is almost always played on a grass surface. However, in the event a non-turf pitch is used, the artificial surface must have a minimum length of and a minimum width of . Law 7: The creases. This Law sets out the dimensions and locations of the creases. The bowling crease, which is the line the stumps are in the middle of, is drawn at each end of the pitch so that the three stumps at that end of the pitch fall on it (and consequently it is perpendicular to the imaginary line joining the centres of both middle stumps). Each bowling crease should be in length, centred on the middle stump at each end, and each bowling crease terminates at one of the return creases. The popping crease, which determines whether a batsman is in his ground or not, and which is used in determining front-foot no-balls (see Law 21), is drawn at each end of the pitch in front of each of the two sets of stumps. The popping crease must be in front of and parallel to the bowling crease. Although it is considered to have unlimited length, the popping crease must be marked to at least on either side of the imaginary line joining the centres of the middle stumps. The return creases, which are the lines a bowler must be within when making a delivery, are drawn on each side of each set of the stumps, along each sides of the pitch (so there are four return creases in all, one on either side of both sets of stumps). The return creases lie perpendicular to the popping crease and the bowling crease, either side of and parallel to the imaginary line joining the centres of the two middle stumps. Each return crease terminates at one end at the popping crease but the other end is considered to be unlimited in length and must be marked to a minimum of from the popping crease. Diagrams setting out the crease markings can be found in Appendix C. A wicket consists of three stumps, upright wooden poles that are hammered into the ground, topped with two wooden crosspieces, known as the bails. Law 8: The wickets. The wicket consists of three wooden stumps that are tall. The stumps are placed along the bowling crease with equal distances between each stump. They are positioned so that the wicket is wide. Two wooden bails are placed on top of the stumps. The bails must not project more than above the stumps, and must, for men's cricket, be long. There are also specified lengths for the barrel and spigots of the bail. There are different specifications for the wickets and bails for junior cricket. The umpires may dispense with the bails if conditions are unfit (i.e. it is windy so they might fall off by themselves). Further details on the specifications of the wickets are contained in Appendix D to the Laws. Law 9: Preparation and maintenance of the playing area. When a cricket ball is bowled it almost always bounces on the pitch, and the behaviour of the ball is greatly influenced by the condition of the pitch. As a consequence, detailed rules on the management of the pitch are necessary. This Law contains the rules governing how pitches should be prepared, mown, rolled, and maintained. Law 10: Covering the pitch. The pitch is said to be 'covered' when the groundsmen have placed covers on it to protect it against rain or dew. The Laws stipulate that the regulations on covering the pitch shall be agreed by both captains in advance. The decision concerning whether to cover the pitch greatly affects how the ball will react to the pitch surface, as a ball bounces differently on wet ground as compared to dry ground. The area beyond the pitch where a bowler runs so as to deliver the ball (the 'run-up') should ideally be kept dry so as to avoid injury through slipping and falling, and the Laws also require these to be covered wherever possible when there is wet weather. Law 11: Intervals. There are intervals during each day's play, a ten-minute interval between innings, and lunch, tea and drinks intervals. The timing and length of the intervals must be agreed before the match begins. There are also provisions for moving the intervals and interval lengths in certain situations, most notably the provision that if nine wickets are down, the lunch and tea interval are delayed to the earlier of the fall of the next wicket and 30 minutes elapsing. Law 12: Start of play; cessation of play. Play after an interval commences with the umpire's call of \\"Play\\", and ceases at the end of a session with a call of \\"Time\\". The last hour of a match must contain at least 20 overs, being extended in time so as to include 20 overs if necessary. Innings and Result Laws 13 to 16 outline the structure of the game including how one team can beat the other. Law 13: Innings. Before the game, the teams agree whether it is to be one or two innings for each side, and whether either or both innings are to be limited by time or by overs. In practice, these decisions are likely to be laid down by Competition Regulations, rather than pre-game agreement. In two-innings games, the sides bat alternately unless the follow-on (Law 14) is enforced. An innings is closed once all batsmen are dismissed, no further batsmen are fit to play, the innings is declared or forfeited by the batting captain, or any agreed time or over limit is reached. The captain winning the toss of a coin decides whether to bat or to bowl first. Law 14: The follow-on. In a two innings match, if the side batting second scores substantially fewer runs than the side which batted first, then the side that batted first can require their opponents to bat again immediately. The side that enforced the follow-on has the chance to win without batting again. For a game of five or more days, the side batting first must be at least 200 runs ahead to enforce the follow-on; for a three- or four-day game, 150 runs; for a two-day game, 100 runs; for a one-day game, 75 runs. The length of the game is determined by the number of scheduled days play left when the game actually begins. Law 15: Declaration and forfeiture. The batting captain can declare an innings closed at any time when the ball is dead. He may also forfeit his innings before it has started. Law 16: The result. The side which scores the most runs wins the match. If both sides score the same number of runs, the match is tied. However, the match may run out of time before the innings have all been completed. In this case, the match is drawn. Overs, scoring, dead ball and extras The Laws then move on to detail how runs can be scored. Law 17: The over. An over consists of six balls bowled, excluding wides and no-balls. Consecutive overs are delivered from opposite ends of the pitch. A bowler may not bowl two consecutive overs. Law 18: Scoring runs. Runs are scored when the two batsmen run to each other's end of the pitch. Several runs can be scored from one ball. Law 19: Boundaries. A boundary is marked around the edge of the field of play. If the ball is hit into or past this boundary, four runs are scored, or six runs if the ball doesn't hit the ground before crossing the boundary. Law 20: Dead ball. The ball comes into play when the bowler begins his run up, and becomes dead when all the action from that ball is over. Once the ball is dead, no runs can be scored and no batsmen can be dismissed. The ball becomes dead for a number of reasons, most commonly when a batsman is dismissed, when a boundary is hit, or when the ball has finally settled with the bowler or wicketkeeper. Law 21: No ball. A ball can be a no-ball for several reasons: if the bowler bowls from the wrong place; or if he straightens his elbow during the delivery; or if the bowling is dangerous; or if the ball bounces more than once or rolls along the ground before reaching the batsman; or if the fielders are standing in illegal places. A no-ball adds one run to the batting team's score, in addition to any other runs which are scored off it, and the batsman can't be dismissed off a no-ball except by being run out, hitting the ball twice, or obstructing the field. Law 22: Wide ball. An umpire calls a ball \\"wide\\" if, in his or her opinion, the ball is so wide of the batsman and the wicket that he could not hit it with the bat playing a normal cricket shot. A wide adds one run to the batting team's score, in addition to any other runs which are scored off it, and the batsman can't be dismissed off a wide except by being run out or stumped, by hitting his wicket, or obstructing the field. Law 23: Bye and leg bye. If a ball that is not a wide passes the striker and runs are scored, they are called byes. If a ball hits the striker but not the bat and runs are scored, they are called leg-byes. However, leg-byes cannot be scored if the striker is neither attempting a stroke nor trying to avoid being hit. Byes and leg-byes are credited to the team's but not the batsman's total.  Players, substitutes and practice  Law 24: Fielders' absence; Substitutes. In cricket, a substitute may be brought on for an injured fielder. However, a substitute may not bat, bowl or act as captain. The original player may return if he has recovered. Law 25: Batsman's innings; Runners A batsman who becomes unable to run may have a runner, who completes the runs while the batsman continues batting. (The use of runners is not permitted in international cricket under the current playing conditions.) Alternatively, a batsman may retire hurt or ill, and may return later to resume his innings if he recovers. Law 26: Practice on the field. There may be no batting or bowling practice on the pitch during the match. Practice is permitted on the outfield during the intervals and before the day's play starts and after the day's play has ended. Bowlers may only practice bowling and have trial run-ups if the umpires are of the view that it would waste no time and does not damage the ball or the pitch. Law 27: The wicket-keeper. The keeper is a designated player from the bowling side allowed to stand behind the stumps of the batsman. They are the only fielder allowed to wear gloves and external leg guards. Law 28: The fielder. A fielder is any of the eleven cricketers from the bowling side. Fielders are positioned to field the ball, to stop runs and boundaries, and to get batsmen out by catching or running them out. Appeals and dismissals Laws 29 to 31 cover the main mechanics of how a batsman may be dismissed. Law 29: The wicket is down. Several methods of dismissal occur when the wicket is put down. This means that the wicket is hit by the ball, or the batsman, or the hand in which a fielder is holding the ball, and at least one bail is removed; if both bails have already been previously removed, one stump must be removed from the ground. Law 30: Batsman out of his/her ground. The batsmen can be run out or stumped if they are out of their ground. A batsman is in his ground if any part of him or his bat is on the ground behind the popping crease. If both batsman are in the middle of the pitch when a wicket is put down, the batsman closer to that end is out. Law 31: Appeals. If the fielders believe a batsman is out, they may ask the umpire \\"How's That?\\" before the next ball is bowled. The umpire then decides whether the batsman is out. Strictly speaking, the fielding side must appeal for all dismissals, including obvious ones such as bowled. However, a batsman who is obviously out will normally leave the pitch without waiting for an appeal or a decision from the umpire. Laws 32 to 40 discuss the various ways a batsman may be dismissed. In addition to these 9 methods, a batsman may retire out, which is covered in Law 25. Of these, caught is generally the most common, followed by bowled, leg before wicket, run out and stumped. The other forms of dismissal are very rare. Law 32: Bowled. A batsman is out if his wicket is put down by a ball delivered by the bowler. It is irrelevant whether the ball has touched the bat, glove, or any part of the batsman before going on to put down the wicket, though it may not touch another player or an umpire before doing so. Law 33: Caught. If a ball hits the bat or the hand holding the bat and is then caught by the opposition within the field of play before the ball bounces, then the batsman is out. Law 34: Hit the ball twice. If a batsman hits the ball twice, other than for the sole purpose of protecting his wicket or with the consent of the opposition, he is out. Law 35: Hit wicket. If, after the bowler has entered his delivery stride and while the ball is in play, a batsman puts his wicket down by his bat or his body he is out. The striker is also out hit wicket if he puts his wicket down by his bat or his body in setting off for a first run. \\"Body\\" includes the clothes and equipment of the batsman. Law 36: Leg before wicket (LBW). If the ball hits the batsman without first hitting the bat, but would have hit the wicket if the batsman was not there, and the ball does not pitch on the leg side of the wicket, the batsman will be out. However, if the ball strikes the batsman outside the line of the off-stump, and the batsman was attempting to play a stroke, he is not out. Law 37: Obstructing the field. If a batsman wilfully obstructs the opposition by word or action or strikes the ball with a hand not holding the bat, he is out. If the actions of the non-striker prevent a catch taking place, then the striker is out. Handled the Ball was previously a method of dismissal in its own right. Law 38: Run out. A batsman is out if at any time while the ball is in play no part of his bat or person is grounded behind the popping crease and his wicket is fairly put down by the opposing side. Law 39: Stumped. A batsman is out when the wicket-keeper (see Law 27) puts down the wicket, while the batsman is out of his crease and not attempting a run. Law 40: Timed out. An incoming batsman must be ready to face a ball (or be at the crease with his partner ready to face a ball) within 3 minutes of the outgoing batsman being dismissed, otherwise the incoming batsman will be out. Unfair play Law 41: Unfair play. There are a number of restrictions to ensure fair play covering: changing the condition of the ball; distracting the batsmen; dangerous bowling; time-wasting; damaging the pitch. Some of these offences incur penalty runs, others can see warnings and then restrictions on the players. Law 42: Players' conduct. The umpires shall penalise unacceptable conduct based on the severity of the actions. Serious misconduct can see a player sent from field; lesser offences, a warning and penalty runs.

Boutonneuse fever can be seen in many places around the world, although it is endemic in countries surrounding the Mediterranean Sea. This disease was first described in Tunisia in 1910 by Conor and Bruch and was named boutonneuse (French for \\"spotty\\") due to its papular skin-rash characteristics. Presentation After an incubation period around seven days, the disease manifests abruptly with chills, high fevers, muscular and articular pains, severe headache, and photophobia. The location of the bite forms a black, ulcerous crust (tache noire). Around the fourth day of the illness, a widespread rash appears, first macular and then maculopapular, and sometimes petechial. Diagnosis The diagnosis is made with serologic methods, either the classic Weil‚ÄìFelix test, (agglutination of Proteus OX strains), ELISA, or immunofluorescence assays in the bioptic material of the primary lesion. The Weil‚ÄìFelix test demonstrated low sensitivity (33%) in diagnosing acute rickettsial infections and low specificity, with a positive titre of 1:320 seen in 54% of healthy volunteers and 62% of non-rickettsial fever patients. Therefore, the use of the WFT should be discouraged in the diagnosis of acute rickettsial infections. Treatment The illness can be treated with tetracyclines (doxycycline is the preferred treatment), chloramphenicol, macrolides, or fluoroquinolones.

In physics, the v represents the time or virtual dimension, and the p for the space and physical dimension. Alternatively, it can be defined as the dimensions of a maximal positive and null subspace. By Sylvester's law of inertia these numbers do not depend on the choice of basis. The signature thus classifies the metric up to a choice of basis. The signature is often denoted by a pair of integers implying r= 0, or as an explicit list of signs of eigenvalues such as or for the signatures and , respectively.Rowland, Todd. \\"Matrix Signature.\\" From MathWorld--A Wolfram Web Resource, created by Eric W. Weisstein. http://mathworld.wolfram.com/MatrixSignature.html The signature is said to be indefinite or mixed if both v and p are nonzero, and degenerate if r is nonzero. A Riemannian metric is a metric with a positive definite signature . A Lorentzian metric is a metric with signature , or . There is another notion of signature of a nondegenerate metric tensor given by a single number s defined as , where v and p are as above, which is equivalent to the above definition when the dimension n = v + p is given or implicit. For example, s = 1 ‚àí 3 = ‚àí2 for and its mirroring s' = ‚àís = +2 for .  Definition  The signature of a metric tensor is defined as the signature of the corresponding quadratic form. It is the number of positive and zero eigenvalues of any matrix (i.e. in any basis for the underlying vector space) representing the form, counted with their algebraic multiplicities. Usually, is required, which is the same as saying a metric tensor must be nondegenerate, i.e. no nonzero vector is orthogonal to all vectors. By Sylvester's law of inertia, the numbers are basis independent.  Properties = Signature and dimension  By the spectral theorem a symmetric matrix over the reals is always diagonalizable, and has therefore exactly n real eigenvalues (counted with algebraic multiplicity). Thus .  Sylvester's law of inertia: independence of basis choice and existence of orthonormal basis  According to Sylvester's law of inertia, the signature of the scalar product (a.k.a. real symmetric bilinear form), g does not depend on the choice of basis. Moreover, for every metric g of signature there exists a basis such that for , for and otherwise. It follows that there exists an isometry if and only if the signatures of g1 and g2 are equal. Likewise the signature is equal for two congruent matrices and classifies a matrix up to congruency. Equivalently, the signature is constant on the orbits of the general linear group GL(V) on the space of symmetric rank 2 contravariant tensors S2V‚àó and classifies each orbit. Geometrical interpretation of the indices  The number v (resp. p) is the maximal dimension of a vector subspace on which the scalar product g is positive-definite (resp. negative-definite), and r is the dimension of the radical of the scalar product g or the null subspace of symmetric matrix of the scalar product. Thus a nondegenerate scalar product has signature , with . A duality of the special cases correspond to two scalar eigenvalues which can be transformed into each other by the mirroring reciprocally.  Examples = Matrices  The signature of the identity matrix is . The signature of a diagonal matrix is the number of positive, negative and zero numbers on its main diagonal. The following matrices have both the same signature , therefore they are congruent because of Sylvester's law of inertia: :\\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\\\end{pmatrix}, \\\\quad \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\\\end{pmatrix}.  Scalar products  The standard scalar product defined on \\\\mathbb{R}^n has the n-dimensional signatures , where and rank . In physics, the Minkowski space is a spacetime manifold \\\\R^4 with v = 1 and p = 3 bases, and has a scalar product defined by either the \\\\check g matrix: :\\\\check g=\\\\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\end{pmatrix} which has signature (1, 3, 0)^- and known as space- supremacy or space-like; or the mirroring signature (1,3, 0)^+, known as virtual-supremacy or time-like with the \\\\hat g matrix. :\\\\hat g=\\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & -1 \\\\end{pmatrix}=-\\\\check g  How to compute the signature  There are some methods for computing the signature of a matrix. * For any nondegenerate symmetric of matrix, diagonalize it (or find all of eigenvalues of it) and count the number of positive and negative signs. * For a symmetric matrix, the characteristic polynomial will have all real roots whose signs may in some cases be completely determined by Descartes' rule of signs. * Lagrange's algorithm gives a way to compute an orthogonal basis, and thus compute a diagonal matrix congruent (thus, with the same signature) to the other one: the signature of a diagonal matrix is the number of positive, negative and zero elements on its diagonal. * According to Jacobi's criterion, a symmetric matrix is positive-definite if and only if all the determinants of its main minors are positive.  Signature in physics  In mathematics, the usual convention for any Riemannian manifold is to use a positive-definite metric tensor (meaning that after diagonalization, elements on the diagonal are all positive). In theoretical physics, spacetime is modeled by a pseudo-Riemannian manifold. The signature counts how many time-like or space-like characters are in the spacetime, in the sense defined by special relativity: as used in particle physics, the metric has an eigenvalue on the time-like subspace, and its mirroring eigenvalue on the space-like subspace. In the specific case of the Minkowski metric, : ds^2 = c^2 dt^2 - dx^2 - dy^2 - dz^2 , the metric signature is (1, 3, 0)^+ or (+, ‚àí, ‚àí, ‚àí) if its eigenvalue is defined in the time direction, or (1, 3, 0)^- or (‚àí, +, +, +) if the eigenvalue is defined in the three spatial directions x, y and z. (Sometimes the opposite sign convention is used, but with the one given here s directly measures proper time.) Signature change If a metric is regular everywhere then the signature of the metric is constant. However if one allows for metrics that are degenerate or discontinuous on some hypersurfaces, then signature of the metric may change at these surfaces. Such signature changing metrics may possibly have applications in cosmology and quantum gravity.

Traditionally, cricket requires \\"gentlemanly\\" conduct from all players. The Code of Conduct is written and enforced by the International Cricket Council. Under the ICC regulations, players may be fined a percentage of the salary, banned for number of matches, or even banned for a number of years or life. The ICC appoints a match referee for each Test match, One Day International and Twenty20; the Referee has the power to set penalties for most offences, the exceptions being the more serious ones. The following are the general categories of serious offences, carrying the highest penalties: * Gambling on matches (betting). * Failing to perform in a match in return for a benefit, such as money or goods (match fixing). * Inducing a player to perform one of the above two actions. * Failure to report certain incidents relating to match-fixing or gambling. * Other related offences. Other offences are categorized as Level 1, Level 2, Level 3, or Level 4 as follows: Level 1 * Breach of the Logo Policy (except for a commercial logo or player's bat logo). * Abuse of equipment clothing, or any part of the ground. * Showing dissent at an umpire's decision by word or by action. * Using language or a gesture that is obscene, offensive or insulting. * Excessive appealing. * Aggressive pointing towards the pavilion by a member of the fielding side upon the dismissal of a batsman Level 2 * Repeat of any Level 1 Offence within 12 months. * Showing serious dissent at an umpire's decision by word or action. * Breach of the Logo Policy relating to a commercial logo or a player's cricket bat logo. * Public criticism of a match related incident or match official. * Inappropriate and deliberate physical contact between players during play. * Aggressively charging towards an umpire while appealing. * Deliberate distraction or obstruction on the field. * Throwing the cricket ball at a player, umpire or official in a dangerous manner. * Using language or a gesture that is obscene, offensive or of a seriously insulting nature to another player, umpire, referee, team official or spectator. * * Any attempt to manipulate a match in regard to the result (In a negative way), net run rate, bonus points or otherwise. (Example: Intentionally losing so that a team will face a weaker opponent in the Finals.) Level 3 * Repeat of any Level 2 Offence within 12 months. *Changing the condition of the ball. * Intimidation of an umpire or referee. * Threat of assault on a player, team official, or spectator. * Using language or gestures that offends race, religion, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin. Level 4 * Repeat for any Level 3 Offence within 12 months. * Threat of assault on an umpire or referee. * Physical assault of another player, umpire, referee, official or spectator. * Any act of violence during play. * Using language or gestures that seriously offends race, religion, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin. Penalties The penalties available for each offence are based on the level. The penalties are as follows: * Level 1: Fine of 0% to 50% of match fee. * Level 2: Fine of 50% to 100% of match fee and/or ban for 1 Test or 2 ODIs. * Level 3: Ban for 6 Tests or 12 ODIs. * Level 4: Ban for Tests to life or 20 ODIs to life. Fines in Level 3 and 4 Offences are determined by the ICC without regard to match fee. Offences relating to gambling or match-fixing carry penalties of bans from 12 months to life, and unlimited fines. If an offence occurred in a Test match, then the ban for a number of Tests applies; if an offence occurred in an ODI, then the ban for a number of ODIs applies.

A new company, Triumph Motorcycles Ltd, based in Hinckley, gained the name rights after the end of the company in the 1980s and is now one of the world's major motorcycle manufacturers. Origins Model H, the \\"Trusty Triumph\\". 57,000 were made between 1915 and 1923 The company was started by Siegfried Bettmann, who had emigrated from Nuremberg, part of the German Empire, to Coventry in England in 1883. In 1884, aged 20, Bettmann had founded his own company, the S. Bettmann & Co. Import Export Agency, in London. Bettmann's original products were bicycles, which the company bought and then sold under its own name. Bettmann also distributed sewing machines imported from Germany. In 1886, Bettmann sought a more specific name, and the company became known as the Triumph Cycle Company. A year later, the company was registered as the New Triumph Co. Ltd, now with funding from the Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Company. During that year, another native of Nuremberg, Moritz Schulte, joined the company as a partner. Schulte encouraged Bettmann to transform Triumph into a manufacturing company, and in 1888 Bettmann purchased a site in Coventry using money lent by his and Schulte's families. The company began producing the first Triumph-branded bicycles in 1889. In 1896 Triumph also opened a bicycle factory in Nuremberg. In 1898 Triumph decided to extend production at Coventry to include motorcycles, and by 1902 the company had produced its first motorcycle‚Äîa bicycle fitted with a Belgian Minerva engine. In 1903, after selling more than 500 motorcycles, Triumph began motorcycle production at the Nuremberg factory. During the first few years the company based its designs on those of other manufacturers, but in 1904 Triumph began building motorcycles based on its own designs, and 1905 saw the first entirely in-house designed motorcycle. By the end of that year, the company had produced more than 250. In 1907, after the company opened a larger plant, it produced 1,000 machines. Triumph had also initiated a lower-end brand, Gloria, also manufactured in the company's original plant. Confusion between motorcycles produced by the Coventry and Nuremberg Triumph companies resulted in the latter's products being renamed Orial for certain export markets. However, a company named Orial already existed in France, so the Nuremberg motorcycles were renamed again as \\"TWN\\", standing for Triumph Werke N√ºrnberg. First World War and the 1920s 1924 Triumph Ricardo The beginning of the First World War was a boost for the company as production was switched to provide for the Allied war effort. More than 30,000 motorcycles‚Äîamong them the Model H Roadster also known as the \\"Trusty Triumph\\", often cited as the first modern motorcycle‚Äîwere supplied to the Allies. After the war, Bettmann and Schulte disagreed about planning, with Schulte wishing to replace bicycle production with cars. Schulte ended his association with the company, but during the 1920s Triumph purchased the former Hillman company car factory in Coventry and produced a saloon car in 1923 under the name of the Triumph Motor Company. Harry Ricardo produced an engine for their latest motorbike. By the mid-1920s Triumph had become one of Britain's main motorcycle and car makers, with a plant capable of producing as many as 30,000 motorcycles and cars each year. Triumph also found its bicycles demanded overseas, and export sales became a primary source of the company's revenues, although for the United States, Triumph models were manufactured by licence. The company's first automotive success was the Super Seven model, which debuted in 1928. Soon after, the Super Eight model was developed. 1930s 1929 Triumph prototype with bevel-gear OHC When the Great Depression began in 1929, Triumph sold its German subsidiary as a separate, independently owned company, which later merged with the Adler company to become Triumph- Adler Company. The Nuremberg company continued to manufacture motorcycles as TWN (Triumph Werke N√ºrnberg) until 1957. In 1932, Triumph sold another part of the company, its bicycle manufacturing facility to Raleigh Bicycle Company. By then, Triumph had been struggling financially, and Bettmann had been forced out of the job of chairman. He retired completely in 1933. In 1936, the company's two components became separate companies. Triumph always struggled to make a profit from cars, and after becoming bankrupt in 1939 was acquired by the Standard Motor Company. The motorcycle operations fared better, having been acquired in 1936 by Jack Sangster, who also owned the rival Ariel motorcycle company. That same year, the company began its first exports to the United States, which quickly grew into the company's single most important market. Sangster formed the Triumph Engineering Co Ltd. largely directed by ex-Ariel employees, including Edward Turner who designed the 500 cc 5T Triumph Speed Twin‚Äîreleased in September 1937, and the basis for all Triumph twins until the 1980s. Contrary to popular belief, however, this was not Triumph's first parallel twin. The first was the Val Page designed model 6/1, introduced in 1933. This first twin performed well as a racer but was ultimately unpopular with the public and did not sell well. After Turner arrived, with his usual brusque manner, the 6/1 ended, later to be replaced with Turner's design. The 6/1 engine was later reused, somewhat modified, as the BSA A10. In 1939, the 500 cc Tiger T100, capable of , was released, and then the war began. Second World War Triumph 3HW 350cc single made at Meriden from 1942 Motorcycles were produced at Coventry until the Second World War. The city of Coventry was virtually destroyed in the Coventry Blitz (7 September 1940 to May 1941). Tooling and machinery was recovered from the site of the devastation and production restarted at the new plant at Meriden, Warwickshire in 1942. Post-war era The Triumph Speed Twin designed by Edward Turner before the war was produced in large numbers after the war. Efforts to settle the Lend-Lease debts caused nearly 70% of Triumph's post-war production to be shipped to the United States. Post war, the Speed Twin and Triumph Tiger 100 were available with a sprung rear hub, Triumph's first attempt at a rear suspension. Privateers put wartime surplus aluminium alloy barrels on their Tiger 100 racers, and won races, inspiring the Triumph GP model. By 1950 the supply of barrels was exhausted, and the GP model was ended. The American market applied considerable demand to reverse this action, and a die-cast close finned aluminium alloy barrel was made available. The aluminium alloy head made the valve noise more obvious, so ramp type cams were introduced for aluminium alloy head models to reduce the noise. Another motorcycle based on the wartime generator engine was the 498 cc TR5 Trophy Twin, also introduced at the 1948 Motor Cycle Show. It used a single carburettor, low compression version of the Grand Prix engine. Britain won the prestigious 1948 International Six Days Trial. The Triumph works team had finished unpenalised. One team member, Allan Jefferies, had been riding what amounted to a prototype version.Veloce.co.uk V4065.pdf. Retrieved 26 December 2006. To satisfy the American demand for motorcycles suited to long distance riding, Turner built a 650 cc version of the Speed Twin design. The new bike was named the Thunderbird (a name Triumph would later license to the Ford Motor Company for use for a car model). Only one year after the Thunderbird was introduced, a motorcyclist in Southern California mated the 650 Thunderbird with a twin carb head intended originally for GP racing and named the new creation the Wonderbird. That 650 cc motor, designed in 1939, had the world's absolute speed record for motorcycles from 1955 until 1970. The Triumph brand received considerable publicity in the United States when Marlon Brando rode a 1950 Thunderbird 6T in the 1953 film, The Wild One. The Triumph Motorcycle concern was sold to their rivals BSA by Sangster in 1951. This sale included Sangster becoming a member of the BSA board. Sangster was to become Chairman of the BSA Group in 1956. The production 650 cc Thunderbird (6T) was a low-compression tourer, and the 500 cc Tiger 100 was the performance motorcycle. That changed in 1954, with the change to swing arm frames, and the release of the aluminium alloy head 650 cc Tiger 110, eclipsing the 500 cc Tiger 100 as the performance model. In 1959, the T120, a tuned double carburettor version of the Triumph Tiger T110, came to be known as the Bonneville. As Triumph and other marques gained market share, Harley became aware that their 1-litre-plus motorcycles were not as sporty as modern riders would like, resulting in a decreasing share of the market. The Triumphs were models for a new, \\"small\\" Harley- Davidson as a result: the now-fabled Harley-Davidson Sportster, which started as Harley's version of a Triumph Bonneville. With its anachronistic V-twin, the Sportster was no match for the Bonneville, but it proved a solid competitor in US sales and eventually also in longevity. During the 1960s, despite internal opposition from those who believed that it would reduce the macho image of the brand, Triumph produced two scooters; the Triumph Tina, a small and low-performance 2-stroke scooter of about 100 cc with automatic clutch and a handlebar carry basket, and the Triumph Tigress, a more powerful scooter available with either a 175 cc 2-stroke single or a 250 cc 4-stroke twin engine for the enthusiast. In 1962, the last year of the \\"pre-unit\\" models, Triumph used a frame with twin front down-tubes, but returned to a traditional Triumph single front downtube for the unit construction models that ensued. The twin down tube, or duplex frame, was used for the 650 twins, as a result of frame fractures on the Bonneville. Introduced in 1959, for the 1960 model year, it soon needed strengthening, and was ended in 1962, with the advent of the unit engines for the 650 range. The 3TA (21) was the first unit construction twin, soon followed by the short-stroke, 490 cc \\"500\\" range. From 1963 all Triumph engines were of unit construction. In 1969 Malcolm Uphill, riding a Bonneville, won the Isle of Man Production TT race with a race average of per lap, and recorded the first ever more than lap by a production motorcycle at . For many Triumph fans, the 1969 Bonneville was the best Triumph model ever. American sales had already maximised, in 1967. In truth, the demand for motorcycles was increasing, but Triumph could not supply the demand. During the 1960s, 60% of all Triumph production was exported, which, along with the BSA's 80% exports, made the group susceptible to the Japanese expansion. By 1969 fully 50% of the US market for motorcycles more than 500 cc belonged to Triumph, but technological advances at Triumph had failed to match those of the foreign companies. Triumphs lacked electric start mechanisms, relied on push-rods rather than overhead cams, vibrated noticeably, often leaked oil and had antiquated electrical systems; while Japanese marques such as Honda were building more advanced features into attractive new motorcycles that sold for less than their British competitors. Triumph motorcycles, as a result, were nearly obsolete even when they were new. Further, Triumph's manufacturing processes were very labour-intensive and largely inefficient. Also disastrous, during the early 1970s the US government mandated that all motorcycle imports must have their gearshift and brake pedals in the Japanese configuration, which required expensive retooling of all the motorcycles for US sale. Triumph and BSA were well aware of Honda's ability but while the Japanese were only making smaller engined models, the large engine market was considered safe. When the first Honda 750 cc four cylinder was released for sale to the public, Triumph and BSA had trouble. Despite developing and releasing a 3-cylinder 750 cc engined motorcycle prior to the Japanese fours‚Äîthe BSA Rocket 3/Triumph Trident‚Äîthe Japanese bikes were praised in the press for their modernity (disc brakes, 4-cylinder engines, leak-free engine casings, etc.). The British triples outperformed the Japanese fours (top speed, acceleration and handling) but the Japanese fours required less maintenance and they did not leak. The 1970 Tiger/Bonneville re-design and taller twin front downtube oil tank frame had a mixed reception from Triumph enthusiasts at the time, and was insufficient to win back those already riding the Japanese bikes that had been sold since 1969‚Äîthe Honda 750 Four, and the Kawasaki 500 Mach 3. The Triumph 350 cc Bandit received pre-publicity, but its development was quietly brought to an end. Triumph was still making motorcycles, but they no longer looked like the motorcycles Triumph fans expected. The Trident attracted its own market, but the Japanese motorcycles were improving more rapidly. The parent BSA group had losses of ¬£8.5 million in 1971, ¬£3 million for BSA motorcycles alone. The British government became involved. The company was sold to Manganese Bronze Holdings, which also owned Norton, AJS, Matchless, Francis-Barnett, James-Velocette and Villiers.

Norton and BSA/Triumph were merged under the umbrella of a new company, Norton Villiers Triumph (NVT) in 1972. Poore was made NVT Group chairman and put in charge, even though Norton had produced far fewer bikes than the once-mighty BSA/Triumph. Poore then held consultations with factory personnel to propose consolidation plans he thought necessary to compete with the Japanese. In September 1973 he announced that the Meriden factory was to close in February 1974, with 3,000 employees out of 4,500 being made redundant.  The Meriden Motorcycle Co-operative  Concerned about unemployment and losing their products to a rival factory, the workers at the Meriden factory demonstrated against the proposed relocation to the BSA site at Small Heath, Birmingham, and staged a sit-in for two years. With political aid of the newly elected Labour government and, in particular, the then minister for Trade and Industry, Tony Benn, the Meriden worker's co- operative was formed, supplying Triumph 750 cc motorcycles to its sole customer, NVT. After the collapse of NVT in 1977, the co-operative bought the marketing rights for Triumph with more government loans, later becoming Triumph Motorcycles (Meriden) Limited. The venture, with only two 750 cc models, the Bonneville and Tiger, started well with a successful variant, the 1977 Silver Jubilee Bonneville T140J and by 1978 was the best selling European motorcycle in the vital USA market. Emissions compliant models during 1978 and 1979 such as the aluminium alloy-wheeled Triumph T140D Bonneville Special and T140E Bonneville were introduced to the dominant USA market, but the strong British pound made these bikes prohibitively expensive and they failed to sell in significant numbers. Moreover, despite updates such as electric starting and a faired Triumph Bonneville Executive T140EX with luggage, by 1980 Meriden's debt was ¬£2 million‚Äîadditionally more than the earlier ¬£5 million loan. In October 1980, the new Conservative British government wrote off ¬£8.4 million owed but still left the company owing ¬£2 million to Britain's Export Credits Guarantee Department. Meriden introduced several new models such as the dual purpose TR7T Tiger Trail and budget 650 cc Triumph TR65 Thunderbird during its last years but none were able to stop the decline, worsened by a UK recession and a continuing strong pound harming sales to the US. However, the Triumph Royal Wedding T140LE Bonneville celebrating the Prince of Wales' nuptials was a popular collector's item for 1981 and that year a 750 cc TR7T Tiger Trail won the Rallye des Pyr√©n√©es on/off-road rally. Large orders for police motorcycles from Nigeria and Ghana were won at critical moments thereby saving the firm during 1981 and 1982 respectively. 1982 was the last year of \\"full\\" production, with the custom-styled Triumph T140 TSX and 8-valve Triumph T140W TSS model initiated--although a porous cylinder head made by external contractors and insufficient development quickly eroded the latter's initial market popularity. In 1983, the debt-ridden company briefly considered buying the bankrupt Hesketh Motorcycles, and even badged one as a marketing trial. Despite also touting a 900cc prototype water-cooled twin at the 1983 National Exhibition Show to attract outside investment, Triumph Motorcycles (Meriden) Ltd itself became bankrupt on 23 August 1983.

When Triumph went into receivership in 1983, John Bloor, a former plasterer who acquired his wealth from building and property development, became interested in keeping the brand alive, and bought the name and manufacturing rights from the Official Receiver. The new company, initially Bonneville Coventry Ltd, ensured that Triumph has produced motorcycles since 1902, winning it the title of the world's longest continuous production motorcycle manufacturer. A licensing agreement granted to pattern spares manufacturer, Les Harris, kept the Triumph Bonneville in production until Triumph initiated a new range during 1990 and 1991. Triumph now makes a range of motorcycles reviving model names of the past, including a newly designed Bonneville twin.

Initially developed by Microsoft Research, the game was later released under a shared source license in 2004 and is maintained and developed by volunteers. On July 27, 2017, Microsoft Research changed the license from MSR shared source license to MIT license. Gameplay Allegiance is an online multiplayer real time strategy/space simulation game. Players pilot spacecraft (from small one-man vessels to large capital ships), flying in a team with other players and trying to gain victory through various means, such as destroying or capturing all enemy bases, or eliminating the enemy's will to fight. Teams are led by a single Commander who makes tactical decisions and invests in technology and bases. Flight and combat is done in either a first or third person view in a 3D environment, with a real-time, top-down \\"Command View\\" of the player's immediate surroundings also available. Flying a ship is unlike other space sims as Allegiance uses a linear drag flight model, where the absolute speeds are limited, but ship inertia still plays an important role in maneuver considerations. A Technoflux Heavy Interceptor destroys an enemy bomber. Bombers are used to destroy bases whereas Interceptors excel at defending them. Game objective Gameplay involves expanding from one's starting Garrison in order to secure mining areas, and then either destroying enemy bases or destroying his capacity to fight (through economic warfare), much like a conventional Real time strategy game. However, due to Allegiance's combination of RTS and space sim elements, some reviewers classify Allegiance in a genre of its own. Like an RTS, there is a commander who builds bases and miners, controls the team's cash and develops the team's plan for victory. On the other hand, individual units are controlled by other human players instead of a computer AI which faithfully carries out the commander's orders. All teams start (by default) with a single Garrison base, a single miner, a set amount of cash and access to a couple of starting ships. One of those starting ships is always the scout. One of the most important ships in Allegiance, the scout is responsible for finding all of a map sectors and alephs at the beginning of the game. It is also capable of repairing friendly ships under attack, deploying probes to detect enemy movements, deploying minefields which destroy or delay enemy ships, and assisting more powerful ships by spotting enemy targets. =The three stages of a conquest game= A conquest game splits into three phases, the transition between these stages are smooth. *opening - Players will explore the map to plan further tactics. At the same moment the first base constructors will launch and move into the newly discovered sectors. Losing one of the constructors or a miner in this stage can change the outcome of the whole game, so both teams try to defend and/or attack the enemy ones. *mid game - At this point the first bases were built and teams economy are more vulnerable than in the beginning. Also the first technology will be researched, so the teams have access to more powerful ships. The goal of this stage is to get money, hurt the enemy economy and claim sectors. Some teams will research technology to kill bases, others just focus on combat ships. *end game - One or both teams collected enough money to research advanced technology. Teams will try to destroy or capture the enemy technology bases with their superior technology. Sometimes one teams is unable to destroy or capture the others team last base, so it can end up in a drawn- out battle. These games are over if the team manages to coordinate their attacks or if they have enough money to spam last enemy sectors with bases and/or capital ships. The game is over if one team loses all its technology bases, one team resigns or both teams draw the game. Playable factions There are currently eight playable factions in the game of allegiance: * GigaCorp, a conglomerate that keeps costs down through lowered quality, which although has the weakest ships, has a powerful economy to allow them to upgrade their ships. * The Iron Coalition, remnants of the UN space force that struggle to maintain a semblance of order among the stars; their strategy is one of brute force, having the strongest ships overall and the sturdiest bases. * The Belters are motley collection of freelance traders, pirates and anarchists originating in the asteroid belt that specialize in the theft of other factions' technology and having the most versatile ships, being able to equip more types of technology onto their ships than other factions' equivalents. * The BIOS are characterized as stealthy super-soldiers, and have the lowest signature, making them hard to detect, to counter their comparatively weak hull. * The Rixian unity were the last faction to be developed by Microsoft. They are a race of short grey aliens that do not use missiles on their ships, but have the strongest ballistic weapons. In addition to these five factions developed by Microsoft, since official support for the game was dropped three other factions have been developed: * The Ga'taraan Federation, a faction finding its roots with the Iron Coalition, were formed by the uprising of two Coalition science colonies. They were isolated for many years, and as such have developed vastly different technologies to the rest of the factions. * The Dreghklar Empire, a group of sentient reptile-like creatures with exceptionally fast ships and highly developed missile technologies. * The Technoflux, another faction branching off from the Iron Coalition, formed of advanced robots controlled by \\"The Mastermind\\", they, like the Rixian Unity, employ only ballistic weapons and very rarely mount missiles on their ships. In addition to the eight currently playable factions there are also several more in development: * The Omicron Hive, a civilization of sentient arachnids that specialize in the use of turrets. * The BioLumen, a secretive alien race formed of living metal that are particularly proficient in the use of energy weapons * The Archangel Empire, a faction branching off from GigaCorp that specialize in defensive technologies. Another faction the Effix, a mysterious alien race that specializes in the use of missiles, was completed but withheld from the main servers meaning it is rarely played. Economy Teams earn money in Allegiance through the use of miners, drone craft which harvest Helium-3 from special asteroids. As miners are a team's principal source of income, commanders frequently buy as many miners as possible, and gameplay frequently revolves around defending friendly miners and destroying enemy ones. When the funds are available, Commanders can build new bases by purchasing a constructor drone. Once the constructor is ready, the commander orders it to a specific asteroid in a specific sector. It travels from sector to sector using Alephs, wormhole like structures floating in space. Once it arrives at the target sector, it travels to the designated asteroid and builds the base. Constructors are vulnerable until the base is built, so teams frequently focus on protecting their constructors and destroying hostile ones. The bases created by constructors range from simple outposts, used for offensive strikes and territory control, to advanced Technology Bases which allow development of new ships, weapons, and upgrades. Tech paths There are three principle technology paths in Allegiance, each relying on a specialized base. The Tactical path allows the team to fly stealth fighters, which excel at destroying drones such as miners and constructors. The Expansion path creates interceptors: tough, maneuverable craft specializing in defense and short-range dogfights. With a Supremacy Center, the commander can research fighters: versatile ships capable of teleporting to special bases around the map. Most games in Allegiance end with the destruction or capture of all one team's major bases, and each techpath has tools to accomplish that goal. Both the Supremacy and Tactical techpath rely on some variation of the Bomber, a base destroying ship originally researched at the team's Garrison. The Expansion techpath uses a special Heavy Troop Transport which captures bases. Additionally, teams can build a special Shipyard base, capable of producing expensive, base-destroying capital ships or capital ships with advanced missile systems that can destroy enemy fighters from long ranges. A typical game lasts between thirty and forty-five minutes, although games of more than two hours in length are not uncommon. Allegiance has a reputation for not being an easy game to learn, even with its simplified flight model. It has a complex control scheme and a heavy focus on teamwork, tactics and player co-ordination.  Plot =Setting The story in which the game is set takes place circa 2150, shortly after the destruction of Earth by an asteroid.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pW9e7lgjBFY Allegiance Intro Videohttp://www.freeallegiance.org/FAW/index.php/Original_storyline DataNet Timeline This cataclysm forced the remnants of humanity to the stars in search of new land and resources. Humanity quickly fractures into four main factions: * The militaristic Iron Coalition, descendants of a United Nations-sanctioned peacekeeping force. * GigaCorp, a transplanetary corporation bent on controlling all natural resources. * Belters, a motley collection of traders, freedom fighters and pirates. * and the Bios, a mysterious offshoot of genetically engineered humans with their own agenda for \\"stalegenes\\". In the midst of the ensuing civil war, humans discover the alien Rixian Unity. An ancient and advanced race, the Rixians seek to \\"enlighten\\" heathen races (such as the human race) and convert them to their religion. Story In 2008 Emmet Longstreet founded GigaCorp, allegedly through a series of shady dealings involving the consolidation of many powerful aerospace companies (as well as other technical industries). Their aim was to colonize and exploit the resources of near-Earth space. 25 years later, a subsidiary of GigaCorp begins genetically engineering humans to be better suited for life in space. Legal restrictions kept the experiments secret, and the resulting group of improved humans became known as BIOS. During 2057 another GigaCorp project discovers Helium-3 deposits in the asteroid belt. Experiments reveal that He3 would be a highly useful fuel for nuclear fusion. Fierce competition for He3 deposits lead to escalating tensions and political destabilization. In 2071, an He3-related dispute called \\"The Siege of Leonov\\" precipitates in United Nations peacekeeping involvement. With a surprise strike, the UN forces end the siege with military action and take over the rich He3 deposits in Leonov Crater. In the wake of this incident, attempts to claim He3 deposits become increasingly violent, leading to a series of minor conflicts involving the UN Coalition forces, independent prospectors and GigaCorp. In 2074, Gigacorp CEO unveiled the Mass Conveyor system, which transports Helium-3 rich asteroids from the Asteroid Belt to Lunar orbit for capture and mining. This technology is wildly successful, and within two years Gigacorp begins licensing it to other corporations. By 2079, scores of asteroids arrive daily in Lunar orbit, but the lack of a central traffic control system causes problems. Faster-than- light travel had previously been impossible, but in 2125 the first \\"Aleph\\" is discovered by the Crimson Group, a rival of Gigacorp. While their origin is unknown, Alephs are stable wormholes that connect far-flung regions of the galaxy. Soon all of humanity learns of the existence of alephs, which are the sole source of FTL travel in the Allegiance universe. Factions begin vying for control over alephs as fiercely as they battled for control over Helium-3 deposits. In 2140, a malfunction in the Mass Conveyor system ends with a large asteroid colliding with Earth, cracking the mantle, and killing roughly 95 percent of the Earth's population instantaneously. As the remnants of the Earth's population die in the aftermath, the Solar System plunges into chaos. The four strongest factions rise to seize power over the remnants of humanity. These are the Iron Coalition (UN forces), GigaCorp, the Belter Armada and the BIOS. The game begins in 2150, with BIOS aggression initiating widespread warfare between the factions. History=Development A screenshot from early development showing the command view and the Commander investing credits into a new base. Initially developed by Microsoft Research, Allegiance was first released for multiplayer on the Microsoft Zone under the name Allegiance Zone. This was a paid subscription service but free play was available on the Free Zone (which had fewer features). The game never achieved commercial success however, selling a mere 29000 units in the first year of release.  End-of-life  The official servers closed in 2002. During its brief retail life Allegiance had drawn a dedicated following that continued to play beyond Microsoft's discontinuation of support for Allegiance. Players created their own utilities to enable them to connect to LAN-hosted game servers and continued to play.  Community continuation  To allow the player community to maintain Allegiance themselves, on the commercial End-of-life the source-code was released under a shared source license in 2004. It is up-to now maintained and developed by volunteers of the fan-community under the name FreeAllegiance. On July 27, 2017 Microsoft Research changed the license from MSR shared source license to MIT license, due to the community's initiative to bring Allegiance to Steam.FREEING Allegiance, How it Happened (sort of) on freeallegiance.org (2017-07-28) Reception Allegiance was well received, claiming GameSpot's award for \\"Best Game No One Played\\", but it did not sell as well as Microsoft had hoped. Even with good reviews and a loyal playerbase, the game's steep learning curve made it unattractive to the average gamer. After Microsoft dropped support for Allegiance, the game has continued to be developed and the game has received additional praise and recognition, but the playerbase has not substantially increased. The game was nominated in the Massive Multiplayer/Persistent World category, for the Interactive Achievement Awards 2001.

Early life Winner was an only child, born in Hampstead, London, England, to Helen (n√©e Zlota) and George Joseph Winner (1910‚Äì1975), a company director. His family was Jewish;Faces of the week, BBC News, 29 April 2005. Accessed 28 August 2009. his mother was Polish, and his father of Russian extraction. Following his father's death, Winner's mother gambled recklessly and sold art and furniture worth around ¬£10M at the time, bequeathed to her not only for her life but to Michael thereafter. She died at the age of 78, in 1984. Winner was educated at St Christopher School, Letchworth, and Downing College, Cambridge, where he read law and economics. He also edited the university's student newspaper, Varsity, and was the youngest ever editor up to that time, both in age and in terms of his university career (being only in the second term of his second year). Winner had earlier written a newspaper column, \\"Michael Winner's Showbiz Gossip\\", in the Kensington Post from the age of 14. The first issue of Showgirl Glamour Revue in 1955 had him writing another film and show-business gossip column, \\"Winner's World\\".Showgirl Glamour Revue (closed) . A-Z of Men's Magazines Such jobs allowed him to meet and interview several leading film personalities, including James Stewart and Marlene Dietrich. He also wrote for the New Musical Express.NME: Still rocking at 50. BBC.co.uk (2002-02-24). Career=Shorts Winner directed his first travelogue, This is Belgium (1957), which was largely shot on location in East Grinstead. It was financed by his father. Later, he wrote, produced and directed a short, The Square (1957), starring A. E. Mathews, and which again was financed by Winner's father. Winner's first on-screen feature credit was earned as a writer for the low-budget crime film Man with a Gun (1958) directed by Montgomery Tully. He went on to direct the shorts Danger, Women at Work (1959) and Watch the Birdie (1959), and was Associate Producer on Floating Fortress (1959), produced by Harold Baim. Early British feature films Winner's first feature as director was Shoot to Kill (1960), which he also wrote. Dermot Walsh starred. He followed this with Climb Up the Wall (1960), which was essentially a series of music acts presented by Jack Jackson, but which Winner nonetheless wrote and directed. Winner's third feature as director was the thriller Murder on the Campus (1961), also known as Out of the Shadow, which Winner also wrote and helped produce. Dermot Walsh starred once again, together with Terence Longdon. Shortly afterwards, Winner wrote and directed the short Girls Girls Girls! (1961) which was narrated by Jackson, and directed the short feature Old Mac (1961), written by Richard Aubrey and starring Charles Lamb, Vi Stevens and Tania Mallet. Winner directed the shorts Haunted England (1961), It's Magic (1962), and Behave Yourself (1962), the latter of which was based on Emily Post's Book of Manners, and whose cast included Jackson and Dennis Price. Winner achieved success with a musical he directed, Play It Cool (1962), starring Billy Fury and Michael Anderson Jr., and which was distributed by Anglo-Amalgamated. Winner's next feature, Some Like It Cool (1962), is the tale of a young woman who introduces her prudish husband and in-laws to the joys of nudism. Filmed at Longleat, Winner was afraid the sight of bare flesh would offend the magistrate for the area, so he confided his worries to the landowner, the Marquess of Bath. 'Don't worry,' said the Marquess, 'I am the local magistrate.' The film cost ¬£9,000 and Winner said it made its money back in a week. Winner went on to update Gilbert and Sullivan, writing the screenplay and directing a version of The Mikado titled The Cool Mikado (1963), starring Frankie Howerd and Stubby Kaye and which was produced by Harold Baim. Winner's first significant project was West 11 (1963), a realistic tale of London drifters starring Alfred Lynch, Eric Portman and Diana Dors, and which was based on a script by Hall and Waterhouse. Oliver Reed Winner's film The System (1964), also known as The Girl-Getters, began a partnership with actor Oliver Reed that would last for six films over a 25-year period, and was based on a script by Peter Draper. Winner would later receive an offer from Columbia to direct a comedy, You Must Be Joking! (1965). It starred American import Michael Callan and the support cast included Lionel Jeffries and Denholm Elliott, while Winner also wrote the script. Winner was reunited with Reed on The Jokers (1967), a comedy where Reed was teamed with Michael Crawford. It was based on a script by Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais from a story by Winner for his own company, Scimitar Productions (for Universal's English operations, then under Jay Kanter). The resulting movie was a popular hit. Winner and Reed then made the comedy-drama I'll Never Forget What's'isname (1967), co-starring Orson Welles, Carol White and Harry Andrews, also for Scimitar. Draper wrote the script, which was a spoof of the advertising world, and the film was also done for Universal. Winner did some uncredited directing on A Little of What You Fancy (1967), a documentary about the history of the British music hall. Then he and Reed made their fourth feature together, the World War II satire Hannibal Brooks (1969), again from a Clement/La Frenais script and based on a story by Winner.Goodwin, Cliff Evil Spirits: The Life of Oliver Reed, London: Virgin Publishing Ltd, 2000 20th Century Fox hired Winner to direct The Games (1970), a film about the Olympic Games and which starred Ryan O'Neal and Stanley Baker, with script by Eric Segal. Early American films Hannibal Brooks drew notice in Hollywood, and Winner soon received an opportunity to direct his first American film, for United Artists; this was Lawman (1971), a Western starring Burt Lancaster and Robert Duvall, and for which Gerald Wilson was the writer. Back in England, Winner directed Marlon Brando in The Nightcomers (1971), a prequel to The Turn of the Screw by Henry James, the first of many films for which Winner was credited as editor using the pseudonym 'Arnold Crust'. Charles Bronson Winner edited, producer and directed Chato's Land (1972), recounting a mixed race American Indian fighting with Whites. It starred Charles Bronson and was done for Scimitar through United Artists. Once more, Gerald Wilson wrote the script. Winner's second film for Bronson and United Artists was The Mechanic (1972), a thriller in which professional assassins are depicted. It was based on a story and script by Lewis John Carlino and Winner also edited, although he did not produce; he replaced Monte Hellman as director. The following year, Winner cast Lancaster again in the espionage drama Scorpio (1973), co-starring Alain Delon and made for Scimitar and United Artists. Winner also produced and directed a third film with Bronson, The Stone Killer (1973), for Columbia and in collaboration with producer Dino De Laurentiis. =Death Wish= Winner and Bronson collaborated on Death Wish (1974), a film that defined the subsequent careers of both men. Based on a novel by Brian Garfield and adapted for the screen by Wendell Mayes, Death Wish was originally planned for director Sidney Lumet, under contract with United Artists. The commitment of Lumet to another film and UA's questioning of its subject matter, led to the film's eventual production by De Laurentiis through Paramount Pictures. Death Wish follows Paul Kersey, a liberal New York architect who becomes a gun-wielding vigilante after his wife is murdered and daughter is raped. With a script adjusted to Bronson's persona, the film generated controversy during its screenings but was one of the year's highest grossers. Non-Bronson period Winner tried to break out of action films with Won Ton Ton, the Dog Who Saved Hollywood (1976), an animal comedy Winner produced and directed, starring Bruce Dern, Madeline Kahn, Art Carney, and Milton Berle. Intended as a satire of Hollywood, it was a financial failure. Of modest success was his horror film The Sentinel (1977), which Winner wrote, produced and directed for Universal, and which was based on the novel by Jeffrey Konvitz. Winner then wrote, produced and directed the remake of Raymond Chandler's novel The Big Sleep (1978), starring Robert Mitchum as Philip Marlowe with a strong support cast including John Mills, Sarah Miles, Richard Boone and Candy Clarke. The film was relocated to England, and financed by ITC Films. Also for ITC, Winner produced, edited and directed the organized crime thriller Firepower (1979). It was meant to star Bronson, who withdrew, and wound up starring Sophia Loren and James Coburn. Reunion with Bronson/Cannon Films By the early 1980s, Winner found himself in great need of a successful film and accepted Charles Bronson's request to film Death Wish II (1981), a sequel to the 1974 hit. Bronson had already signed a lucrative deal with Cannon Films, independent producer of exploitation fare and marginal art house titles. The sequel, co- starring Bronson's wife Jill Ireland, considerably increased the violence to more graphic levels. Winner said the film was 'the same, but different', to the original. 'That's what sequels are ‚Äì Rocky II, Rocky III ‚Äì you don't see Sylvester Stallone move to the Congo and become a nurse. Here the look of LA is what's different. Besides ‚Äì rape doesn't date!' Death Wish II made a $2 million profit for Cannon filmsAndrew Yule, Hollywood a Go-Go: The True Story of the Cannon Film Empire, Sphere Books, 1987 p24 and made an extra $29 million worldwide. The success of Death Wish II enabled Winner to raise money from Cannon for a dream project: a 1983 remake of 1945's The Wicked Lady, this time starring Faye Dunaway and which Winner wrote, produced and directed. For Miracle Films, Winner produced and directed the thriller Scream for Help (1984). He also produced the film Claudia (1985), doing some uncredited directing and editing. Winner was reunited with Bronson and Cannon for Death Wish 3 (1985), which - although set in New York City - was mostly filmed in London for budgetary reasons. Winner produced and edited.\\" Winner was also attached to direct Cannon's 1990 film Captain America, from a script by James Silke, which he would revise with Stan Hey, and then Stan Lee and Lawrence Block. By 1987, however, Winner was off the project. Winner's final film for Cannon was an adaptation of the Agatha Christie novel Appointment with Death (1989) starring Peter Ustinov as Poirot. Winner produced, edited and directed; but despite a strong support cast including Lauren Bacall and Carrie Fisher, the film flopped. Final British films After Cannon Films entered bankruptcy, Winner confined himself to British productions. He produced and directed an adaptation of the Alan Ayckbourn musical play A Chorus of Disapproval (1989) with Anthony Hopkins, and also wrote the script with Ayckbourn. Winner produced, directed and edited the Michael Caine and Roger Moore farce Bullseye! (1990), based on a story by Winner. Later, he wrote, produced and directed Dirty Weekend (1993), starring Lia Williams; and hosted the television series True Crimes, which was cancelled in 1994. In 1994, Winner appeared as a guest artist - alongside Joan Collins, Christopher Biggins and Marc Sinden (who in 1983 had appeared in Winner's The Wicked Lady) - in Steven Berkoff's film version of his own play Decadence. Winner's final film as director was Parting Shots (1999), which he also wrote, produced and edited. The film was critically reviled and flopped commercially. Other media activity Winner was a regular panellist on BBC Radio 4's Any Questions, and later appeared on television programmes including BBC1's Question Time and BBC2's Have I Got News for You. He was also an occasional columnist for the Daily Mail throughout the 2000s, and an honorary member of BAFTA and of the Directors Guild of Great Britain. His autobiography Winner Takes All: A Life of Sorts was published by Robson Books in 2006, it largely describes his experiences with many big-screen actors. Winner also wrote a dieting book, The Fat Pig Diet Book. Winner also featured in television commercials that he himself directed for insurance company esure between 2002 and 2009, with his trade-mark catchphrase 'Calm down, dear! It's just a commercial!' He was referred to repeatedly in the QI edition \\"Illness\\". Personal life Winner, with Geraldine Lynton-Edwards, at a book signing for his autobiography Winner became engaged to Geraldine Lynton-Edwards in 2007. They had met in 1957, when he was a 21-year-old film-maker and she was a 16-year-old actress and ballet dancer. They married on 19 September 2011 at Chelsea Town Hall, London. Michael and Shakira Caine were witnesses to the ceremony. Winner lived in the former home of painter Luke Fildes in Holland Park, Woodland House, designed for Fildes by Richard Norman Shaw. It was announced in 2008 that Winner intended to leave his house as a museum, but discussions with Kensington and Chelsea council apparently stalled after they were unable to meet the ¬£15 million cost of purchasing the freehold of the property, which expires in 2046. On 1 January 2007, Winner acquired the bacterial infection Vibrio vulnificus from eating an oyster in Barbados. He almost had a leg amputated, and verged on the brink of death several times. Before recovering, Winner was infected with the 'hospital superbug' MRSA.https://www.standard.co.uk/news/how-i-beat-mrsa-by-michael- winner-6589509.html In September 2011, he was admitted to hospital with food poisoning after eating steak tartare, a raw meat dish, four days in a row. The dish is not recommended for those with a weak immune system, and in retrospect Winner regarded his decision to eat it as 'stupid'. Police Memorial Trust Winner was an active proponent of law enforcement issues, and established the Police Memorial Trust after WPC Yvonne Fletcher was murdered in 1984. Thirty-six local memorials honouring police officers who died in the line of duty, have been erected since 1985, beginning with that of Fletcher in St. James's Square, London. The National Police Memorial, opposite St. James's Park at the junction of Horse Guards Road and The Mall, was also unveiled by Queen Elizabeth II on 26 April 2005. In 2006, it was revealed that Winner had been offered but declined an OBE in the Queen's Birthday Honours for his part in campaigning for the Police Memorial Trust. Winner remarked: 'An OBE is what you get if you clean the toilets well at King's Cross station.'\\"Winner shuns 'toilet-cleaner OBE\\", BBC News (2006-05-28). Accessed 28 August 2009.

Winner's Dinners Winner remained prominent in British life for other reasons, including his outspoken restaurant reviews. His fame as a restaurant critic was such that, at a Cornwall cafe, an unconsumed piece of his serving of lemon drizzle cake was incorporated into the Museum of Celebrity Leftovers. Winner wrote his column, \\"Winner's Dinners\\", in The Sunday Times for more than twenty years. On 2 December 2012, he announced that he was to contribute his last review because of poor health, which had put him in hospital eight times in the previous seven months.Kuo, Patricia (2012-12-02).

His collection once included almost 200 signed colour-washed illustrations by Donald McGill. Winner spent his free time gardening ('my garden is floodlit, so I quite often garden after midnight') or with a string of girlfriends, notably the actress Jenny Seagrove. He claimed that his life had not altered in the past 40 years: 'I do essentially the same things I did as an 18-year-old', he said. 'I go on dates, I make films, I write. Nothing has really changed.' Death In an interview with The Times in October 2012, Winner said liver specialists had told him that he had between 18 months and two years to live. He said he had researched assisted suicide offered at the Dignitas clinic in Switzerland, but found the bureaucracy of the process off-putting.

Sina operates four major business lines: Sina Weibo, Sina Mobile, Sina Online, and Sinanet. Sina has over 100 million registered users worldwide. Sina was recognized by Southern Weekend as the \\"China's Media of the Year\\" in 2003. Sina owns Sina Weibo, a Twitter-like microblog social network, which has 56.5 percent of the Chinese microblogging market based on active users and 86.6 percent based on browsing time over Chinese competitors such as Tencent and Baidu. The social networking service has more than 500 million users and millions of posts per day, and is adding 20 million new users per month, says the company. The top 100 users now have over 180 million unique followers combined. It is the largest Chinese- language mobile portal. It is run by Sina Corporation, which was founded in 1998. The company was founded in Beijing, and its global financial headquarters have been based in Shanghai since October 1, 2001. Sina App Engine (SAE) is the earliest and largest PaaS platform for cloud computing in China. It is run by SAE Department, which was founded in 2009. SAE is dedicated in providing stable, effective web deployment and hosting service for those corporations, organizations and independent developers. Now more than 300,000 developers in China are using SAE.  Background = Business coverage  It mainly caters to the Chinese population around the globe, Sina stated that it has about 94.8 million registered users and more than 10 million active users engaged in their fee-based services (10,000 of whom are overseas Chinese in North America). It provides different services around the world, for example there are 13 access points within Greater China, and subsidiary tailored pages for overseas Chinese, which include Sina US, Sina Japan, Sina Korea, Sina Australia, Sina Europe and Sina Germany. It is one of the four major business lines of Sina Corporation (NASDAQ: SINA). The rest of the major business lines are Sina Mobile, Sina Online and Sinanet. Sina Edalat.

In November 1998, SRSNet (Stone Rich Sight Information Technology Ltd), the most visited internet portal site in China, established by and Wang Yan in 1996, merged with Sinanet, an web site for American Chinese community, created in California by Hurst Lin, , and Jack Hong in 1995. The merging of the two largest Chinese websites formed into the later Sina. Since then the service had been extended across the straits and North America, before it extended to Hong Kong in July 1999. After the merger, Sina maintained its dominant position as the most visited portal site in Mainland China over its major rivals Sohu and Netease, two other web-based companies in China. Especially through its fast, continuous, and comprehensive online news services covering a vast range of worldwide events, such as the NATO Bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade in 1999.survey.yam.com, Xin, 2002. Sina was the first to be approved for listing on the Nasdaq National market on 13 April 2000, through a variable interest entity (VIE) based in the Cayman Islands, followed by Netease and Sohu in June and July respectively. It succeeded in raising US$68,000,000 before Nasdaq plummeted in May 2000. In July 2000, Sina was the official website for on-line coverage of the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney as selected by the government and the Chinese Olympic committee. (Xin, 2002). The Cyberspace Administration of China reprimanded Sina in 2015, accusing the online portal of having \\"distorted news facts, violated morality and engaged in media hype\\".https://southerncourier.co.za/afp/62578/china- orders-media-giant-sina-to-improve-censorship On 16 April 2018, the CAC launched an investigation into the news portal for alleged inclinations to factual errors, and failure to curtail vulgar and explicit content. In August 2019, Sina Corp's Game Studio, Sina Games was sued by Blizzard Entertainment on a claim that their game Glorious Saga is a blatant rip-off of the long- running Warcraft games and related products.

Partnership  Sina cooperates with other web-based companies such as People, Nanfang Daily, Lifeweek and Xinhuanet, etc. Apart from the media partners, its clients include Microsoft, DELL, IBM, Motorola, and Kodak. Recently Sina started developing its business in the field of wireless internet, in the meantime collaborating with China Mobile, China Telecom, Ericsson. On January 13, 2004, Sina and Yahoo started to jointly provide online auction services in China; in response to this, EachNet (), which cooperates with eBay, lowered its registration fee in early February 2004 in order to keep its market share. Sina also sponsors the annual ChinICT conference held at the Tsinghua Science Park. Recently, Sina has begun collaborating with Qihoo 360 on internet security. Through this collaboration, Qihoo 360 intend to provide Sina Weibo tech support in order to protect Weibo from hackers and viruses. As of April 24, 2012 an official statement has not yet been made announcing the collaboration.  Marketing  To provide tailored internet services for local people, Sina has been conducting quantitative and qualitative marketing researches, including demographic research, psychograph, etc., on target audience in specific regions.  Features = Multiple services  Sina provides Internet services to the Chinese population around the world. In every localized website, there are over thirty integrated channels, including news, sports, technology information, finance, advertising services, entertainment, fashion, and travel. Sina is a multiple-service provider, its major services are SMS, eMail, Search, Games, Match, Entertainment, Sina Sports, Sina Blog, and Sina Microblogging. Sina Blog (‰∏≠Êñá: Êñ∞Êµ™ÂçöÂÆ¢) is the blog service of Sina, which features the blogs of celebrities, including the most popular blog in the world, the one of Xu Jinglei. Sina Weibo is an equivalent to Tencent Weibo. Many celebrities from mainland China, Taiwan and also Hong Kong use Sina's Microblog as a platform to reach out to their fans and supporters. Some famous users on Sina's Microblog include Taiwanese hosts Dee Shu and Kevin Tsai, with more than ten million followers on their microblogs each. A big challenge for Sina is monetizing the massive Weibo following. Sina Edalat has taken several steps in that direction, and is reportedly developing a \\"pay-for-forward\\" feature. The feature will enable users to pay to have a message forwarded by an account with a large following. Sina plans to keep 20% of the revenue generated from \\"pay-for-forward\\" fees.  Local content  Internationalized services have a common layout which consists of sections like news, information, infotainment and email services with localized content. Localization involves political censorship. As with all internet content providers operating within mainland China, the web pages which are geared toward mainland China audiences have internet censors controlling the discussion for sensitive political content. In addition, the news from sina comes from local newspapers, which in the case of mainland China are themselves subject to censorship by the government. This censorship does not extend to pages and forums which are not intended for audiences within mainland China.  Network technology  According to the company's published information, Sina.comXpressTM and Sina.comPlusTM are Sina.com's two main exclusive technologies, which bring ease-of-use benefits and enable the audience of Big 5 (traditional Chinese character), and GB (simplified Chinese characters) to view the webpages sourced from around the Chinese communities of the world.

The Huron‚ÄìManistee National Forests provide recreation opportunities for visitors, habitat for fish and wildlife, and resources for local industry. The headquarters for the forests is in Cadillac, Michigan. History Baldwin in the Manistee National Forest The Huron National Forest was established in 1909 and the Manistee National Forest in 1938. In 1945, they were administratively combined, although they are not adjacent. Huron has about 44.8% of the combined area, whereas the larger Manistee has about 55.2%. The Huron National Forest is prone to frequent seasonal forest fires, due to ecological and geological factors including the domination of the jack pine in sections the forests, the needles of which are extremely flammable, sandy soil composition as a result of glacial outwash plain geology of sections of the Huron National Forest, and jack pine barrens management practices to create nesting habitat for the Kirtland's warbler resulting in dense, young stands of jack pine that are extremely susceptible to crowning wildfires. In 2010, the Meridian Boundary Fire burned over in and near the Huron District of the Huron National Forest. The fire destroyed 13 homes, damaged two others, and destroyed or damaged 46 outbuildings. Features The Lumberman's Monument, dedicated to the workers of the early logging industry, is located within the eastern part of the forest near Oscoda. Huron‚ÄìManistee boasts thousands of lakes and miles of sparkling rivers and streams. The nationally known Pere Marquette and Au Sable Rivers offer quality canoeing and fishing. Additionally, over of trails are available for hiking. The Huron‚ÄìManistee National Forests are an attraction to many campers. You do not need a permit to camp on the National Forest campgrounds. However, some do require that one pays a reservation or camping fee. A wood permit is required to cut firewood. The Manistee National Forest portion is located in northwest lower Michigan. It has varying but largely sandy terrain covered with trees. There are numerous lakes and frontage on Lake Michigan. The area is popular for fishing, camping, boating, snowmobiling, cross-country skiing and hunting. The North Country Trail passes through it. It has a total area of . In descending order of land area it lies in parts of Lake, Newaygo, Wexford, Manistee, Mason, Oceana, Muskegon, Mecosta, and Montcalm counties. There are local ranger district offices located in Baldwin and Manistee. The Manistee National Forest is not one continuous mass but is broken by private property and towns. Much of the land had been abandoned by logging companies after being logged off a century ago. The Lumberjack 100, a 100-mile ultra-endurance mountain bike race is held annually within its bounds. The Nordhouse Dunes Wilderness is a unique feature in the Manistee portion. This relatively small area of , situated on the east shore of Lake Michigan is one of the few wilderness areas in the U.S. with an extensive lake shore dunes ecosystem. Most of the dunes are 3500 to 4000 years old and some stand about higher than the lake. The Nordhouse Dunes are interspersed with woody vegetation such as juniper, jack pine and hemlock. There are many small water holes and marshes dotting the landscape and dune grass covers many of the dunes. The beach is wide and sandy. The Huron National Forest portion is in northeast lower Michigan. Its southern boundary is approximately at the latitude of Manistee's northern boundary. It has a total area of . It lies in parts of Oscoda, Alcona, Iosco, Crawford, and Ogemaw counties. There are local ranger district offices in Mio and Oscoda. The Bull Gap ORV Trail is located in the Huron portion.

The Atlantic Forest has ecoregions within the following biome categories: seasonal moist and dry broad-leaf tropical forests, tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands, and mangrove forests. The Atlantic Forest is characterized by a high biodiversity and endemism.Dafonseca, G. 1985. The Vanishing Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Biological Conservation 34:17-34. It was the first environment that the Portuguese colonists encountered over 500 years ago, when it was thought to have had an area of , and stretching an unknown distance inland.Por, Francis Dov. 1992. Sooretama: the Atlantic rain forest of Brazil. The Hague: SPB Academic Pub. Over 85% of the original area has been deforested, threatening many plant and animal species with extinction. Ecology The Atlantic Forest region includes forests of several variations: * Restinga is a forest type that grows on stabilized coastal dunes. Restinga Forests are generally closed canopy short forests with tree density. Open Restinga is an open, savanna-like formation with scattered clumps of small trees and shrubs and an extensive layer of herbs, grasses, and sedges.Thomas, William Wayt, and Elizabeth G. Britton. 2008. The Atlantic coastal forest of Northeastern Brazil. Bronx, N.Y.: The New York Botanical Garden Press. * Seasonal tropical moist forests may receive more than 2000 mm of rain a year. These include Tropical Moist: Lowland Forests, Submontane Forest, and Montane Forests. * Tabuleiro forests are found over very moist clay soils and Tabuleiro Savannas occur over faster-draining sand soils. These are humid areas that rely on water vapor from the ocean.Galindo Leal, Carlos, and Ibsen de Gusm√£o C√¢mara. 2003. The Atlantic Forest of South America: biodiversity status, threats, and outlook. Washington: Island Press. * Further inland are the Atlantic dry forests, which form a transition between the arid Caatinga to the northeast and the Cerrado savannas to the east. These forests are lower in stature; more open, with high abundance of deciduous trees and lower diversity when compared to tropical moist forests. These forests have between 700‚Äì1600 mm of precipitation annually with a distinct dry season. This includes Deciduous and Semideciduous Seasonal Forest each with their own lowland and montane regions. * Montane forests are higher altitude wet forests across mountains and plateaus of southern Brazil. * The Mussununga forests occur in southern Bahia and northern Espirito Santo states. The Mussununga ecosystem ranges from grasslands to woodlands associated with sandy spodosols. The word Mussununga is Amerindian Tupi-Guarani meaning soft and wet white sand. * Shrubby montane savannas occur at the highest elevations, also called Campo rupestre. The Atlantic Forest is unusual in that it extends as a true tropical rain forest to latitudes as far as 28¬∞S. This is because the trade winds produce precipitation throughout the southern winter. In fact, the northern Zona da Mata of northeastern Brazil receives much more rainfall between May and August than during the southern summer. The geographic range of Atlantic Forest vary depending on author or institution that published them. Information on four most important boundaries as well as their union and intersection was reviewed in 2018. Geography The Atlantic Forest mainly covers regions of eastern Brazil (92% of the total area), but also reaches eastern Paraguay (6%) and northeastern Argentina (2%).{{State of the Atlantic Forest: Three countries, 148 million people, one of the richest forests on Earth History During glacial periods in the Pleistocene, the Atlantic Forest is known to have shrunk to extremely small fragmented refugia in highly sheltered gullies, being separated by areas of dry forest or semi-deserts known as caatingas. Some maps even suggest the forest actually survived in moist pockets well away from the coastline where its endemic rainforest species mixed with much cooler-climate species. Unlike refugia for equatorial rainforests, the refuges for the Atlantic Forest have never been the product of detailed identification. Biodiversity Despite having only 28% of native vegetation cover remaining, the Atlantic Forest remains extraordinarily lush in biodiversity and endemic species, many of which are threatened with extinction. Approximately 40 percent of its vascular plants and up to 60 percent of its vertebrates are endemic species, meaning they are found nowhere else in the world.Tabarelli, Marcelo, Antonio Venceslau Aguiar, Milton Cezar Ribeiro, Jean Paul Metzger, and Carlos A. Peres. \\"Prospects for Biodiversity Conservation in the Atlantic Forest: Lessons from Aging Human-modified Landscapes.\\" Biological Conservation 143.10 (2010): 2328-340. The official threatened species list of Brazil contains over 140 terrestrial mammal species found in Atlantic Forest. In Paraguay there are 35 species listed as threatened, and 22 species are listed as threatened in the interior portion of the Atlantic Forest of Argentina. Nearly 250 species of amphibians, birds, and mammals have become extinct due to the result of human activity in the past 400 years. Over 11,000 species of plants and animals are considered threatened today in the Atlantic Forest. Over 52% of the tree species and 92% of the amphibians are endemic to this area. The forest harbors around 20,000 species of plants, with almost 450 tree species being found in just one hectare in some occasions.World Wildlife Fund: Atlantic Forest. World Wildlife Fund. 29 November 2011. New species are continually being found in the Atlantic Forest. In fact, between 1990 and 2006 over a thousand new flowering plants were discovered. Furthermore, in 1990 researchers re- discovered a small population of the black-faced lion tamarin (Leontopithecus caissara, previously thought to have been extinct.Reaka-Kudla, Marjorie L, Don E. Wilson, and Edward O. Wilson. Biodiversity Ii: Understanding and Protecting Our Biological Resources. Washington, D.C: Joseph Henry Press, 1997.

Conservation=Human impact Atlantic Forest Fragmentation Deforestation of Atlantic Forest in Rio de JaneiroThe incorporation of modern human societies and their needs for forest resources has greatly reduced the size of the Atlantic Forest, which has resulted in species impoverishment. Almost 88% of the original forest habitat has been lost and replaced by human-modified landscapes including pastures, croplands, and urban areas. This deforestation continues at an annual rate of 0.5% and up to 2.9% in urban areas. :Agriculture: A major portion of human land use in the Atlantic Rain Forest is for agriculture. Crops include sugar-cane, coffee, tea, tobacco and more recently soybean and biofuel crops. :Pasture: Even more common than using land for agriculture is the conversion of forest to cattle pastures. This is commonly done by method of slash and burn which increases a forest chance of human-induced burning. :Hunting: Species in a fragmented forest are more susceptible to decline in population size because they are in an confined area that is more accessible to hunters. Larger animals make up the highest percentage of biomass. These animals are also the most rewarding to hunters and are heavily hunted in accessible fragments. This results in a change in species interactions such as seed dispersal and competition for resources. :Logging: Logging removes 10 to 80% of the canopy cover of a forest making that habitat more susceptible to natural elements such as wind and sunlight. This causes an increase in forest heating and desiccation.Laurance, William F., and Diana C. Useche. \\"Environmental Synergisms and Extinctions of Tropical Species.\\" Conservation Biology 23.6 (2009): 1427-437. Large amounts of organic litter and debris builds up which results in an increase in forests vulnerability to fires. Additionally, logging roads create accessibility for humans; and therefore increases the amount of human land disturbances and decreases the amount of natural forest. :Fire: Human activity such as logging causes an increase in debris along forest floors that makes the Atlantic Forest more susceptible to fires. This is a forest type that is not accustomed to regular fire activity, so human induced fires dramatically affect the forest understory because plants do not have fire adaptations. In result, the forest becomes even more vulnerable to secondary fires, which are far more destructive and kill many more species including large trees. =Results of human activity= Habitat fragmentation leads to a cascade of alterations of the original forest landscape. For example, the extent of human disturbances, including habitat destruction, in the Atlantic Forest has led to an extinction crisis.Brooks, Thomas M., Mittermeier, Russell A., Mittermeier, Cristina G., Da Fonseca, Gustavo A. B., Konstant, William R., Flick, Penny, Pilgrim, John, Oldfield, Sara, Magin, Georgina, Hilton-Taylor, Craig. ‚ÄúHabitat Loss and Extinction in the Hotspots of Biodiversity.‚Äù P√©rdida de H√°bitat y Extinciones en √Åreas Cr√≠ticas para la Biodiversidad 16.4 (2002).

Key ecological processes such as seed dispersal, gene flow, colonization and other processes are disturbed by fragmentation. With many key vertebrate seed dispersers going extinct, it is predicted that many regional, fruit-bearing tree species in the Atlantic forest will become extinct due to failure of seedling recruitment and recolonisation. With all these species already threatened, it is predicted that with the persistence of current deforestation rates the Atlantic forest will see continued extinction of species. Conservation by nongovernmental organizations Due to the Atlantic Forest's vast diversity of endemic plants and animals as well as the fragmentation affecting these species, many groups and organizations are working towards the restoration of this unique ecosystem. Non-governmental organizations (NGO) are huge benefactors in Brazil, providing funding as well as professional help to the Atlantic Forest due to the Brazilian Environmental Movement.Biodiversity Hotspots - Atlantic Forest - Conservation Action . Biodiversity Hotspots - Home. 03 Oct. 2011. One organization, called BirdLife International, is using their research to preserve bird biodiversity of the area by primarily working with people towards sustainability in the use of natural resources. Some organizations are receiving grants from the Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund (CEPF) if they abide by their directions. These include: :* Species protection program :* The Program for Supporting Private Natural Heritage Reserves :* The Institutional Strengthening Program Another strategy being implemented to maintain biodiversity within the Atlantic Forest is creating wildlife corridors. The World Bank is donating $44 million to create a corridor, which will be known as the Central Biodiversity Corridor, in the Atlantic Forest and one in the Amazon. The Brazilian Development Bank has been financing, with non-reimbursable loans, 16 to 18 ecosystem restoration projects totaling 3,500 hectares and costing approximately $22 million under the so-called Iniciativa BNDES Mata Atl√¢ntica.Iniciativa BNDES Mata Atl√¢ntica In order to preserve diversity, the state of Sao Paulo has created the Restinga de Bertioga State Park, a 9.3 thousand hectares park which also serves as a wildlife corridor linking the coastal regions to the Serra do Mar mountain range.S√£o Paulo Expands Atlantic Forest Protection Coverage.

If the stapes footplate is fixed in position, rather than being normally mobile, then a conductive hearing loss results. There are two major causes of stapes fixation. The first is a disease process of abnormal mineralization of the temporal bone called otosclerosis. The second is a congenital malformation of the stapes. In both of these situations, it is possible to improve hearing by removing the stapes bone and replacing it with a micro prosthesis - a stapedectomy, or creating a small hole in the fixed stapes footplate and inserting a tiny, piston-like prosthesis - a stapedotomy. The results of this surgery are generally most reliable in patients whose stapes has lost mobility because of otosclerosis. Nine out of ten patients who undergo the procedure will come out with significantly improved hearing while less than 1% will experience worsened hearing acuity or deafness. Successful surgery usually provides an increase in hearing acuity of about 20 dB. That is as much difference as having your hands over both ears, or not. However, most of the published results of success fall within the speech frequency of 500 Hz, 1000 Hz and 2000 Hz; poorer results are typically obtained in the high frequencies, but these are normally less hampered by otosclerosis in the first place. Indications Indications of stapedectomy: # Conductive hearing loss (due to fixation of stapes). # Air bone gap of at least 30 dB. # Presence of Carhart's notch in the audiogram of a patient with conductive hearing loss (relative) # Good cochlear reserve as assessed by the presence of good speech discrimination. Contraindications Contraindications for stapedectomy: * Poor general condition of the patient. * Only hearing ear. * Poor cochlear reserve as shown by poor speech discrimination scores * Patient with tinnitus and vertigo * Presence of active otosclerotic foci (otospongiosis) as evidenced by a positive flemmingo sign. * Conductive deafness due to Ehlers- Danlos Syndrome (EDS) Complications Complications of stapedectomy: * Facial palsy * Vertigo in the immediate post op period * Vomiting * Perilymph gush * Floating foot plate * Tympanic membrane tear * Dead labyrinth * Perilymph fistula * Labyrinthitis * Granuloma (Reparative) * Tinnitus When a stapedectomy is done in a middle ear with a congenitally fixed footplate, the results may be excellent but the risk of hearing damage is greater than when the stapes bone is removed and replaced (for otosclerosis). This is primarily due to the risk of additional anomalies being present in the congenitally abnormal ear. If high pressure within the fluid compartment that lies just below the stapes footplate exists, then a perilymphatic gusher may occur when the stapes is removed. Even without immediate complications during surgery, there is always concern of a perilymph fistula forming postoperatively. In 1995, Glasscock et al. published a 25-year single-centre review of over 900 patients who underwent stapedectomy and stapedotomy and found complications rates as follows: reparative granuloma 1.3%, tympanic membrane perforation 1.0%, total sensorineural hearing loss 0.6%, partial sensorineural hearing loss 0.3%, and vertigo 0.3%. In this series, there was no incidence of facial nerve paralysis or tinnitus.Glasscock ME 3rd, Storper IS, Haynes DS, Bohrer PS, \\"Twenty-five years of experience with stapedectomy\\". Laryngoscope. 1995 Sep;105(9 Pt 1):899‚Äì904. Stapedotomy A modified stapes operation, called a stapedotomy, is thought by many otologic surgeons to be safer and reduce the chances of postoperative complications. In stapedotomy, instead of removing the whole stapes footplate, a tiny hole is made in the footplate - either with a microdrill or with a laser, and a prosthesis is placed to touch this area, oval window. This procedure can be further improved by the use of a tissue graft seal of the fenestra, which is now common practice. Laser stapedotomy is a well-established surgical technique for treating conductive hearing loss due to otosclerosis. The procedure creates a tiny opening in the stapes (the smallest bone in the human body) in which to secure a prosthetic. The CO2 laser allows the surgeon to create very small, precisely placed holes without increasing the temperature of the inner ear fluid by more than one degree, making this an extremely safe surgical solution. The hole diameter can be predetermined according to the prosthesis diameter. Treatment can be completed in a single operation visit using anesthesia, normally followed by one or two nights' hospitalization with subsequent at-home recovery time a matter of days or weeks. Stapedectomy vs. stapedotomy Comparisons have shown stapedotomy to yield either as goodSedwick JD, Louden CL & Shelton C, \\"Stapedectomy vs stapedotomy: Do you really need a laser?\\" Arch Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg., 123(2):177‚Äì180, 1997. or betterMotta G, Ruosi M & Motta S, \\"Stapedotomy vs stapedectomy: Comparison of hearing results\\", Acta Otorhinolaryngologica, 16(2 Suppl 53): 36‚Äì41, 1996) results than stapedectomy (measured by hearing improvement and reduction in the air-bone hearing gap, and especially at higher sound frequencies), and to be less prone to complications.Thamjarayakul T, Supiyaphun P & Snidvongs K, \\"Stapes fixation surgery: Stapedectomy versus stapedotomy\\", Asian Biomedicine, 4(3): 429‚Äì434, 2010. In particular, stapedotomy procedure greatly reduces the chance of a perilymph fistula (leakage of cochlear fluid). Stapedotomy, like stapedectomy, can be successful in the presence of sclerotic adhesions (tissue growths abnormally linking the bones to the tympanic cavity), provided the adhesions are removed during surgery. However, the adhesions may recur over time. The stapedotomy method is not applicable in those relatively rare cases that involve scleroris of the entire ossicular chain. Because it is a simpler and safer procedure, stapedotomy is normally preferred to stapedectomy in the absence of predictable complications. However, the success rate of either surgery depends greatly on the skill and the familiarity with the procedure of the surgeon. Furthermore, a major success factor in both surgeries is correctly determining the length of the prosthesis.Paum PB, Pollak AM & Fisch U., \\"Utricle, saccule and cochlear duct in relation to stapedotomy: A histologic temporal bone study\\", Ann Oto Rhinol Laryngol, 12, 1991.Fisch U, \\"Commentary - stapedotomy versus stapedectomy\\", Otology & Neurotology, 30(8): 1166‚Äì1167, 2009. History The world's first stapedectomy is credited to Dr. John J.Shea Jr. who performed it in May 1956 on a 54-year-old housewife who could no longer hear even with a hearing aid. Significant contributions to modern stapedectomy techniques were then made by the late Dr. Antonio De La Cruz of the House Ear Institute in Los Angeles; by the late Professor Henri Andr√© Martin of the H√¥pital Edouard Herriot in Lyon, France, including calibrated platinotomy (stapes footplate rather than whole surgery) and trans-footplate piston surgery that also paved the way for modern stapedotomy; and by the late Dr. Jean-Ren√© Causse of the eponymous clinic in B√©ziers, France, who pioneered the use of Teflon piston prostheses (also critical progress for stapedotomy) and, with his late son Dr. Jean-Bernard Causse, the reattachment of the stapedius muscle alongside the use of veinous grafts.Causse JB, \\"Stapedotomy technique and results\\", American Journal of Otology, 6(1), 1985.

Design and development  In 1937, Claudius Dornier observed that adding extra engines and propellers to an aircraft in an attempt to increase speed would also attract a penalty of greater drag, especially when placing two or more engines within nacelles mounted on the wings. He reasoned that this penalty could be minimized by mounting a second propeller at the rear of an aircraft. In order to prevent tail-heaviness, however, the engine would need to be mounted far ahead of it. Dornier patented this idea and commissioned a test plane to evaluate it. The aircraft was designed by Dr Ulrich H√ºtter as a 40% sized, scaled-down version of the Dornier Do 17's fuselage and wing panels without the twin-engine nacelles, and built by Schempp-Hirth. The airframe was entirely of wood and used a retractable tricycle landing gear - one of the earliest non-Heinkel- built German airframe designs to use such an arrangement. Power was supplied by a Hirth HM 60 inverted, air-cooled inline four-cylinder engine mounted within the fuselage near the wings. Other than the engine installation, the only other unusual feature of the aircraft was its all-new, full four-surface cruciform tail, which included a large ventral fin/rudder unit of equal area to the dorsal surface. This fin incorporated a small supplementary tailwheel protruding from the ventral fin's lower tip that assisted in keeping the rear- mounted, four-blade propeller away from the ground during take-off and landing. The G√∂ 9 carried the civil registration D-EBYW. Operational history Initially towed aloft, flight tests began in June 1941, but later flights operated under its own power. The design validated Dornier's ideas, and he went ahead with his original plan to build a high-performance aircraft with propellers at the front and rear, producing the Dornier Do 335. The eventual fate of the G√∂ 9 is not known. Specifications (G√∂ 9)See alsoReferences=CitationsBibliography * *Selinger, P E. Segelflugzeuge Vom Wolf zum Discus.

A friend of the whole gang, Woods dates Chuck Clayton, a football player at Riverdale High. History Nancy was introduced in Pep Comics in 1976, and appeared infrequently. However, she has started appearing in the Archie books more frequently since the late 1990s. Unlike the rest of the gang, she did not appear in animated form before her appearance in Archie's Weird Mysteries. Unlike the other girls in Archie Comics, she has worn her hair in several different styles (in earlier appearances her hair was more often up). In the 2000s, she often wore glasses. Her last name was \\"Harris\\" when she first appeared, and has occasionally been \\"Baker\\" or \\"Jackson\\", but is now officially \\"Woods\\". Nancy loves fashion, shopping, and having girls nights with her friends Betty Cooper, Veronica Lodge and Midge Klump. She goes to Riverdale High, where she is a cheerleader and plays such sports as tennis and softball. She also works on the school newspaper, \\"The Blue and Gold\\", as both a reporter and editor. She is also known to be a talented artist, watercolor being her medium. Relationship with Chuck Unlike many of her friends, she and Chuck appear to date exclusively with each other. In her early appearances, this was due to Archie Comics considering interracial dating controversial; a series of one-time African-American girls (Georgette, Liza, Gina, etc.), whom Chuck had a crush on, appeared before Nancy was officially his girlfriend's name. In later stories, their exclusive relationship has been mainly attributed to their preference to be devoted to each other. At times, this has led to conflict. In one story, Chuck's dad Coach Clayton installs a curfew on the basketball team due to poor play. As a result, everybody on the team improves except for Chuck who was sneaking out of the house in order to date Nancy, that is until Archie shows her the error of her ways. Their relationship is not, however, entirely stable. A frequently-used story element is that Chuck pays so much attention to his cartooning or sports, as in earlier stories, that he forgets about Nancy or fails to notice her, thus angering her. Despite being critical of Chuck's obsession, she has an interest and talent in art herself. In the Afterlife with Archie series, which is not official canon, Nancy dates Chuck, but is revealed to be having a secret romantic relationship with her best friend, Ginger Lopez. Another non-canon version of Nancy appears in the fourth issue of Chilling Adventures of Sabrina. In this version she's a cheerleader whom Betty and Veronica try to recruit for their Witch coven.

Name The name of the river () is a corruption of the original Cache √† la Poudre,. or \\"cache of powder\\". It refers to an incident in the 1820s when French trappers, caught by a snowstorm, were forced to bury part of their gunpowder along the banks of the river. Geography Its headwaters are in the Front Range in Larimer County, in the northern part of Rocky Mountain National Park. The main source is Poudre Lake. The river descends eastward in the mountains through the Roosevelt National Forest in Poudre Canyon. It emerges from the foothills north of the city of Fort Collins. It flows eastward across the plains, passing north of the city of Greeley, and flows into the South Platte River approximately east of Greeley. History The river is a popular summer destination for fly fishing, whitewater rafting, tubing, and kayaking in the Poudre Canyon. The river has been substantially populated since the 1930s by year-round residences. While a popular summer destination, the area has residential communities and churches that provide a year-round presence in the rural area. The fish in the Cache La Poudre River include: rainbow, brown and brook trout. The river is subject to sudden and devastating floods which often impact nearby communities. A flood in 1864 destroyed the military post, Camp Collins, located near the river at La Porte. The military relocated the camp and renamed it Fort Collins. Although no fort was ever built, the current city of Fort Collins was established and continues to experience periodic flooding from the Cache La Poudre.http://k99.com/cache- la-poudre-river-flooding-at-epic-proportions/ Trout fishing From its headwaters downstream, through the city of Fort Collins, the Cache la Poudre River contains abundant populations of self-sustaining wild trout. The vast majority of trout that live within the river system are brown trout. The community of Fort Collins contains devoted Poudre River Anglers, who seek brown trout of all size, ranging from juvenile trout all the way up to piscivorous and predominantly nocturnal five to eight-pound trout. Anglers pursue these trout most actively in the guise of a fly fisher and dozens, if not hundreds, of local fly patterns have been developed purely for use on the Poudre. Many locals consider the Cache la Poudre River to be the life blood of the Fort Collins community. Yet, water rights run deep in the community's history and water ownership for uses such as irrigation, drinking and industry create unstable flow environments, greatly impacting the abundance of wildlife in and around the river. As a result, several conservation organizations have been formed in an effort to protect and enhance the natural state of the river. The heavy pressure from the rafting community and related tourism has tended to negatively impact the wildlife along the river corridor. Anglers seeking success on the Cache la Poudre River can find it in all seasons, as water remains open in certain areas year-round. Fishers in the winter often pursue skittish trout with flies the size of a pinhead at distances of up to forty feet. Brown trout spawn in the fall and rainbow trout in the spring, making for aggressive and active fish that are more than willing to take a fly, dressed of fur and feather and will fight the angler well. Spring, Summertime and Fall mark the highest amounts of anglers on the stream, but enough public water exists that one may always find solitude if he or she so desires it. Because of increasing fishing and rafting pressures on a finite resource, special regulations have been designated for certain stretches of the Poudre by the Colorado Division of Wildlife. These regulations include the use of flies and lures only and strict catch and release designations. This ensures that trout populations are left to thrive naturally and that fish who are caught for sport are released, unharmed, to live on for future generations. Special regulation waters include The Indian Meadows Section, The Hatchery Section and a small tailwater stretch of the North Fork of the Cache la Poudre River, which flows from Seamen Reservoir to the main fork of the Poudre. As the Cache la Poudre leaves the canyon for the valley to flow through Fort Collins the water quality decreases significantly. Although trout still live in the lower Cache la Poudre, the population is increasingly diminished due to marginal water flows and water quality, both of which greatly hinder self-sustained trout reproduction in the lower Poudre. Because of this, all fishermen whether bait or artificial should release their catch in town in order to make sure the fishery on the lower Cache la Poudre will remain for years to come. Many believe that with the right combination of flow, habitat and regulation, the Cache la Poudre River can become a world- class trout fishery. Furthermore, the Cache la Poudre River has and will continue to support tremendous fly fishing in a wild and beautiful setting. Glade Reservoir controversy A project has been proposed by the Northern Colorado Water Conservation District called the Northern Integrated Supply Project. It includes several water supply projects, but focuses on the Glade Reservoir, which would be located north of Fort Collins, Colorado, and the Galeton Reservoir, which would be located north of Eaton, Colorado, and would supply of water annually to 15 communities in Northern Colorado. Both reservoirs would be filled by a diversion from the Cache la Poudre River and would store that water for use by these communities. The project has been studied by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers since 2005, resulting in a draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) released in September, 2008. Corps of Engineers original DEIS Due to the number and complexity of significant comments received during the public comment period,http://fcgov.com/nispreview/pdf/core-news.pdf Corps of Engineers news release regarding supplemental DEIS the COE determined that additional analysis would be required before a decision on whether to approve or deny the permit can be made. They plan to release a supplemental DEIS in late 2013, delaying construction of the project ‚Äî if approved. To supply of water from the reservoirs, significant quantities of water would be diverted from the Poudre River above the city of Fort Collins, Colorado. Most diversions would occur during the peak snowmelt runoff in May and June. Essentially all the water that is diverted (and pumped) into the off-stream Glade Reservoir would be released back to the river at a later time. But these releases into the Poudre from Glade would be entirely offset by water that would normally be released from Horsetooth Reservoir into the Poudre, also upstream of Fort Collins. This Horsetooth water, originating from Colorado's west slope, would be piped to most of the NISP subscriber communities outside the Poudre basin instead of going to agricultural users downstream on the Poudre River and South Platte River. According to the first DEIS, the net diversion from the Poudre would represent anywhere from 26 to 71% of the flow as measured in downtown Fort Collins. These flow reductions are in addition to existing diversions that have removed approximately 50-60% of the river's water since European settlement began in the valley. The formation of the Glade Reservoir has been the highlight of backlash from local communities. A group called Save the Poudre was created from the formation of the project in 2005, and has fought the project since, citing negative environmental and economic impacts that will come in the fulfillment of this project. On the other hand, supporters of NISP and the Glade Reservoir cite a negative alternatives like buy and dry (which is when a farmer sells their water rights, and to ensure that the farmer doesn't divert any more water, the land is completely dried up), as a reason to support NISP. The potential necessity for this reservoir comes from the increasing population of the Northern Colorado area, causing an increase in the demand for water while the supply of water has been slightly decreasing due to decreased snow packing in the mountains, which is a major way of storing water for the Northern Colorado area. The City of Fort Collins, which diverts water from the Poudre River and has more senior water rights than NISP, has addressed concerns with the Glade Reservoir in terms of its negative environmental impacts, which NISP has been trying to mitigate through various projects. As of June 2018, NISP is working on releasing an environmental impact report, which is analyzed by the Army Corps of Engineers, and people can submit their comments on this report to the Army Corps of Engineers. The Army Corps of Engineers' final call on their approval of NISP is slated to happen sometime in 2019. With Save the Poudre stating they will take the Army Corps of Engineers to court if they approve the project, this process could possibly be dragged out to the point that NISP doesn't get any water rights until 2025 instead of the predicted year of 2020. National Heritage Area The Cache La Poudre River Corridor National Heritage Area includes the 100-year flood plain of the river from its emergence from the mountains to its confluence with the South Platte River. National Wild and Scenic Rivers designation On October 30, 1986, of the Cache la Poudre River were designated as a Wild and Scenic, under the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. The designation spans from the headwaters of the river at Cache la Poudre Lake in Rocky Mountain National Park, downstream along the south fork of the river. 30 miles are classified as wild, and 46 miles are classified as recreational.

It is a short-acting Œ≤2 adrenergic receptor agonist which works by causing relaxation of airway smooth muscle. It is used to treat asthma, including asthma attacks, exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It may also be used to treat high blood potassium levels. Salbutamol is usually used with an inhaler or nebulizer, but it is also available in a pill, liquid, and intravenous solution. Onset of action of the inhaled version is typically within 15 minutes and lasts for two to six hours. Common side effects include shakiness, headache, fast heart rate, dizziness, and feeling anxious. Serious side effects may include worsening bronchospasm, irregular heartbeat, and low blood potassium levels. It can be used during pregnancy and breastfeeding, but safety is not entirely clear. Salbutamol was patented in 1966 in Britain and became commercially available in the UK in 1969. It was approved for medical use in the United States in 1982. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Salbutamol is available as a generic medication. In 2017, it was the tenth most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 50 million prescriptions. Medical uses Salbutamol is typically used to treat bronchospasm (due to any cause‚Äîallergic asthma or exercise-induced), as well as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. It is also one of the most common medicines used in rescue inhalers (short-term bronchodilators to alleviate asthma attacks). As a Œ≤2 agonist, salbutamol also has use in obstetrics. Intravenous salbutamol can be used as a tocolytic to relax the uterine smooth muscle to delay premature labor. While preferred over agents such as atosiban and ritodrine, its role has largely been replaced by the calcium channel blocker nifedipine, which is more effective and better tolerated. Salbutamol has been used to treat acute hyperkalemia, as it stimulates potassium flow into cells, thus lowering the potassium in the blood. Adverse effects The most common side effects are fine tremor, anxiety, headache, muscle cramps, dry mouth, and palpitation. Other symptoms may include tachycardia, arrhythmia, flushing of the skin, myocardial ischemia (rare), and disturbances of sleep and behaviour. Rarely occurring, but of importance, are allergic reactions of paradoxical bronchospasms, urticaria (hives), angioedema, hypotension, and collapse. High doses or prolonged use may cause hypokalemia, which is of concern especially in patients with kidney failure and those on certain diuretics and xanthine derivatives. Pharmacology The tertiary butyl group in salbutamol makes it more selective for Œ≤2 receptors, which are the predominant receptors on the bronchial smooth muscles. Activation of these receptors causes adenylyl cyclase to convert ATP to cAMP, beginning the signalling cascade that ends with the inhibition of myosin phosphorylation and lowering the intracellular concentration of calcium ions (myosin phosphorylation and calcium ions are necessary for muscle contractions). The increase in cAMP also inhibits inflammatory cells in the airway, such as basophils, eosinophils, and most especially mast cells, from releasing inflammatory mediators and cytokines. Salbutamol and other Œ≤2 receptor agonists also increase the conductance of channels sensitive to calcium and potassium ions, leading to hyperpolarization and relaxation of bronchial smooth muscles. Salbutamol is either filtered out by the kidneys directly or is first metabolized into 4'-O-sulfate, which is excreted in the urine. Chemistry=Structure and activity (R)-(‚àí)-salbutamol (top) and (S)-(+)-salbutamol (bottom) Salbutamol is sold as a racemic mixture. The (R)-(‚àí)-enantiomer (CIP nomenclature) is shown in the image at right (top), and is responsible for the pharmacologic activity; the (S)-(+)-enantiomer (bottom) blocks metabolic pathways associated with elimination of itself and of the pharmacologically active enantiomer (R). The slower metabolism of the (S)-(+)-enantiomer also causes it to accumulate in the lungs, which can cause airway hyperreactivity and inflammation. Potential formulation of the R form as an enantiopure drug is complicated by the fact that the stereochemistry is not stable, but rather the compound undergoes racemization within a few days to weeks, depending on pH. History Salbutamol was discovered in 1966, by a team led by David Jack at the Allen and Hanburys laboratory (a subsidiary of Glaxo) in Ware, Hertfordshire, England, and was launched as Ventolin in 1969. The 1972 Munich Olympics were the first Olympics where anti-doping measures were deployed, and at that time beta-2 agonists were considered to be stimulants with high risk of abuse for doping. Inhaled salbutamol was banned from those games, but by 1986 was permitted (although oral beta-2 agonists were not). After a steep rise in the number of athletes taking beta-2 agonists for asthma in the 1990s, Olympic athletes were required to provide proof that they had asthma in order to be allowed to use inhaled beta-2 agonists. In February 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first generic of albuterol sulfate (Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Aerosol) for the treatment or prevention of bronchospasm in people four years of age and older with reversible obstructive airway disease and the prevention of exercise-induced bronchospasm in people four years of age and older. The FDA granted approval of the generic albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol to Perrigo Pharmaceutical Co. In April 2020, the FDA approved the first generic of Proventil HFA (albuterol sulfate) Metered Dose Inhaler, 90 mcg/Inhalation, for the treatment or prevention of bronchospasm in patients four years of age and older who have reversible obstructive airway disease, as well as the prevention of exercise-induced bronchospasm in this age group. The FDA granted approval of this generic albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol to Cipla Limited. Society and culture=Cost International wholesale price of 200 doses of salbutamolThe wholesale cost of a 200-dose inhaler is between and in the developing world and in the United Kingdom . In the United States, a typical month's supply is between $25 and $50 as of 2015. In 2020, generic versions were approved in the United States. Names Ventolin 2 mg tablets made by GSK (Turkey) Salbutamol is the international nonproprietary name (INN) while albuterol is the United States Adopted Name (USAN). The drug is usually manufactured and distributed as the sulfate salt (salbutamol sulfate). It was first sold by Allen & Hanburys (UK) under the brand name Ventolin, and has been used for the treatment of asthma ever since. The drug is marketed under many names worldwide. Doping there was no evidence that an increase in physical performance occurs after inhaling salbutamol, but there are various reports for benefit when delivered orally or intravenously. In spite of this, salbutamol required \\"a declaration of Use in accordance with the International Standard for Therapeutic Use Exemptions\\" under the 2010 WADA prohibited list. This requirement was relaxed when the 2011 list was published to permit the use of \\"salbutamol (maximum 1600 micrograms over 24 hours) and salmeterol when taken by inhalation in accordance with the manufacturers' recommended therapeutic regimen.\\" Abuse of the drug may be confirmed by detection of its presence in plasma or urine, typically exceeding 1000 ng/mL. The window of detection for urine testing is on the order of just 24 hours, given the relatively short elimination half-life of the drug, estimated at between 5 and 6 hours following oral administration of 4 mg. Research Salbutamol has been studied in subtypes of congenital myasthenic syndrome associated with mutations in Dok-7. It has also been tested in a trial aimed at treatment of spinal muscular atrophy; it is speculated to modulate the alternative splicing of the SMN2 gene, increasing the amount of the SMN protein whose deficiency is regarded as a cause of the disease. Veterinary use Salbutamol's low toxicity makes it safe for other animals and thus is the medication of choice for treating acute airway obstruction in most species. It is usually used to treat bronchospasm or coughs in cats and dogs and used as a bronchodilator in horses with recurrent airway obstruction; it can also be used in emergencies to treat asthmatic cats. Toxic effects require an extremely high dose, and most overdoses are due to dogs chewing on and puncturing an inhaler or nebulizer vial.

In the US and UK, there are restrictions on strikes against anyone but a direct contractual employer. In the majority of OECD countries, solidarity action is generally lawful, and the right to strike is seen as a part of broader political freedom. The term \\"secondary action\\" is often used with the intention of distinguishing different types of trade dispute with a worker's direct contractual employer. Thus, a secondary action is a dispute with the employer's parent company, its suppliers, financiers, contracting parties, or any other employer in another industry.  Australia  In Australia, secondary boycotts are prohibited by the Competition and Consumer Act 2010., sections 45D to 45DD. In the 1910s, sympathy strikes were sometimes called to extend a strike beyond the bounds of an Australian state to make it eligible for handling by the federal arbitration court.  United Kingdom  In the United Kingdom, sympathy strikes were outlawed by the Trade Disputes and Trade Unions Act 1927 in the aftermath of the general strike. That was repealed by the Trade Disputes and Trade Unions Act 1946, passed by the postwar Labour Government. Solidarity action remained legal until 1980, when the government of Margaret Thatcher passed the Employment Act 1980 to restrict it. That was followed by the Employment Act 1990, which outlawed solidarity action entirely. The laws outlawing solidarity strikes remain to this day. In 2005, union leaders called for the legalization of solidarity strikes in the aftermath of the strike action against the catering company Gate Gourmet, but Labour ministers stated that they had no intention of repealing the law. British Airways staff walked out in solidarity, however.  United States  Because farm laborers in the United States are not covered by the Wagner Act, the United Farm Workers union has legally used solidarity boycotting of grocery store chains to aid to its strikes against California agribusiness and its primary boycotts of California grapes, lettuce and wine. Its secondary boycotts involved asking consumers to stop shopping at a grocery store chain until the chain stopped carrying the boycotted grapes, lettuce, or wine. Secondary boycotting is frequently confused with secondary striking, also a prohibited tactic for labour unions covered by the Taft-Hartley Act. Some legal definitions for secondary boycotting divide it into two different kinds: secondary consumer boycotts according to the above definition of secondary boycotts, and secondary employee boycotts, also defined as a secondary strike.

In the late 1950s, Haden was an original member of the ground-breaking Ornette Coleman Quartet. Haden revolutionized the harmonic concept of bass playing in jazz. German musicologist Joachim-Ernst Berendt wrote that Haden's \\"ability to create serendipitous harmonies by improvising melodic responses to Coleman's free-form solos (rather than sticking to predetermined harmonies) was both radical and mesmerizing. His virtuosity lies‚Ä¶in an incredible ability to make the double bass 'sound out'. Haden cultivated the instrument's gravity as no one else in jazz. He is a master of simplicity which is one of the most difficult things to achieve.\\" Joachim Berendt, The Jazz Book Haden played a vital role in this revolutionary new approach, evolving a way of playing that sometimes complemented the soloist and sometimes moved independently. In this respect, as did his predecessor bassists Jimmy Blanton and Charles Mingus, Haden helped liberate the bassist from a strictly accompanying role to becoming a more direct participant in group improvisation. In 1969, he formed his first band, the Liberation Music Orchestra, featuring arrangements by pianist Carla Bley. In the late 1960s, he became a member of pianist Keith Jarrett's trio, quartet and quintet. In the 1980s, he formed his band, Quartet West. Haden also often recorded and performed in a duo setting, with musicians including guitarist Pat Metheny and pianist Hank Jones. Biography=Early life Haden was born in Shenandoah, Iowa.[ allmusic Biography] His family was exceptionally musical and performed on the radio as the Haden Family, playing country music and American folk songs. Haden made his professional debut as a singer on the Haden Family's radio show when he was just two years old. He continued singing with his family until he was 15 when he contracted a bulbar (brainstem) form of polio affecting his throat and facial muscles. At the age of 14, Haden had become interested in jazz after hearing Charlie Parker and Stan Kenton in concert. Once he recovered from his bout with polio, Haden began in earnest to concentrate on playing the bass. Haden's interest in the instrument was not sparked by jazz bass alone, but also by the harmonies and chords he heard in compositions by Bach. Haden soon set his sights on moving to Los Angeles to pursue his dream of becoming a jazz musician, and to save money for the trip, took a job as house bassist for ABC-TV's Ozark Jubilee in Springfield, Missouri. Early career Haden often said that he moved to Los Angeles in 1957 in search of pianist Hampton Hawes. He turned down a full scholarship at Oberlin College, which did not have an established jazz program at the time, to attend Westlake College of Music in Los Angeles. His first recordings were made that year with Paul Bley, with whom he worked until 1959. He also played with Art Pepper for four weeks in 1957, and from 1958 to 1959, with Hampton Hawes whom he met through his friendship with bassist Red Mitchell, For a time, he shared an apartment with the bassist Scott LaFaro. In May 1959, he recorded his first album with the Ornette Coleman Quartet, the seminal The Shape of Jazz to Come. Haden's folk-influenced style complemented Coleman's microtonal, Texas blues elements. Later that year, the Quartet moved to New York City and secured an extended booking at the avant-garde Five Spot Caf√©. This residency lasted six weeks and represented the beginnings of their unique, free and avant-garde jazz. Ornette's quartet played everything by ear, as Haden explained: ‚ÄúAt first when we were playing and improvising, we kind of followed the pattern of the song, sometimes. Then, when we got to New York, Ornette wasn‚Äôt playing on the song patterns, like the bridge and the interlude and stuff like that. He would just play. And that's when I started just following him and playing the chord changes that he was playing: on-the-spot new chord structures made up according to how he felt at any given moment.‚Äù In 1960, drug problems caused him to leave Coleman's band. He went to self-help rehabilitation in September 1963 at Synanon houses in Santa Monica, California and San Francisco, California. It was during the time he was at Synanon House that he met his first wife, Ellen David. They moved to New York City's Upper West Side where their four children were born: their son, Josh, in 1968, and in 1971, their triplet daughters Petra, Rachel and Tanya. They separated in 1975 and subsequently divorced. 1964 to 1984 Haden resumed his career in 1964, working with saxophonist John Handy and pianist Denny Zeitlin's trio, and performing with Archie Shepp in California and Europe. He also did freelance work from 1966 to 1967, playing with Henry ‚ÄúRed‚Äù Allen, Pee Wee Russell, Attila Zoller, Bobby Timmons, Tony Scott, and the Thad Jones/Mel Lewis Orchestra. He recorded with Roswell Rudd in 1966, and returned to Coleman's group in 1967. This group remained active until the early 1970s. Haden was known for being able to skillfully follow the shifting directions and modulations of Ornette's improvised lines. Haden became a member of Keith Jarrett's trio and his 'American Quartet' from 1967 to 1976 with drummer Paul Motian and saxophonist Dewey Redman. The group also included percussionist Guilherme Franco. He also organized the collective Old and New Dreams, which consisted of Don Cherry, Redman, and Ed Blackwell, who had been members of Coleman's band. These musicians understood, and could independently express and honor Coleman's improvisational concepts, applying it to their performances with this band. They continued to play Coleman's music in addition to their own original compositions. In 1970 Haden received a Guggenheim Fellowship for Music Composition upon the recommendation of the eminent conductor Leonard Bernstein. Over the years, Haden received several NEA grants for composition. Haden founded his first band, the Liberation Music Orchestra (\\"LMO\\") in 1969, working with arranger Carla Bley, Paul Bley's ex- wife. Their music was very experimental, exploring both the realms of free jazz and political music. The first album focused specifically on music from the Spanish Civil War which had markedly inspired Haden. Also inspired by the turbulent 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, he superimposed songs such as \\"You're a Grand Old Flag\\" and \\"Happy Days are Here Again,\\" contrasted with \\"We Shall Overcome\\". The original lineup consisted of Haden and Carla Bley, Gato Barbieri, Redman, Motian, Don Cherry, Andrew Cyrille, Mike Mantler, Roswell Rudd, Bob Northern, Howard Johnson (tuba and bass saxophone), Perry Robinson, and Sam Brown. Over the years, the LMO had a shifting membership comprising a \\"who's who\\" of jazz instrumentalists, and consisted of twelve members from multicultural backgrounds. Its members also included Ahnee Sharon Freeman and Vincent Chancey (French horn), Tony Malaby (tenor saxophonist) Joseph Daley (tuba), Seneca Black (trumpet), Michael Rodriguez (trumpet), Miguel Zen√≥n (alto saxophone), Chris Cheek (tenor saxophone), Curtis Fowlkes (trombone), Steve Cardenas (guitar), and Matt Wilson (drums). Through Bley's arranging, they employed not only more common trombone, trumpet and reeds but included the tuba and French horn. The group won multiple awards in 1970, including France's Grand Prix du Disque from the Acad√©mie Charles Cros, and Japan's Gold Disc Award from '. In 1971, while on tour with the Ornette Coleman Quartet in Portugal (at the time under a fascist dictatorship), Haden dedicated a performance of his \\"Song for Che\\" to the anticolonialist revolutionaries in the Portuguese colonies of Mozambique, Angola, and Guinea. The following day, he was detained at Lisbon Airport, jailed, and interrogated by the DGS, the Portuguese secret police. He was only released after Ornette Coleman and others complained to the American cultural attach√©, and he was later interviewed in the United States by the FBI about his choice of dedication.Jazz Legend Charlie Haden on His Life, His Music and His Politics. Democracy Now. September 01, 2006 Accessed January 5, 2009. Haden decided to form the LMO at the height of the Vietnam War, out of his frustration that so much of the government's energy was spent on the war (in which there were many fatalities), while so many internal problems in the United States (such as poverty, civil rights, mental illness, drug addiction, and unemployment), were neglected. Haden's goal was to use the LMO to amplify unheard voices of oppressed people. He wanted to express his solidarity with progressive political movements from around the world by performing music that made a statement about how to initiate and celebrate liberating change. The LMO's 1982 album The Ballad of the Fallen on ECM commented again on the Spanish Civil War as well as the United States involvement in Latin America. The LMO toured extensively throughout the 1980s and 1990s. In 1990, the orchestra returned with Dream Keeper, inspired by a poem of Langston Hughes, and which also drew on American gospel music and South African music to comment on racism in the US and apartheid in South Africa. The album featured choral contributions from the Oakland Youth Chorus. In 2005, Haden released the fourth Liberation Music Orchestra album Not in Our Name, a protest against the US invasion and occupation of Iraq. In 1982, Haden established the Jazz Studies Program at California Institute of the Arts in Valencia, California. His program emphasized smaller group performance and the spiritual connection to the creative process. He encouraged students to discover their individual sounds, melodies, and harmonies. Haden was honored by the Los Angeles Jazz Society as \\"Jazz Educator of the Year\\" for his educational work in this program. Haden's students included John Coltrane's son, tenor saxophonist Ravi Coltrane, trumpeter Ralph Alessi, pianist and composer James Carney and bassist Scott Colley. 1984‚Äì2000 In 1984 Haden met the singer and former actress Ruth Cameron. They married in New York City, and throughout their marriage, Ruth managed Haden's career as well as co-producing many albums and projects with him. In 1986, Haden formed his band Quartet West at Ruth's suggestion. The original quartet consisted of Ernie Watts on sax, Alan Broadbent on piano, and long-time collaborator Billy Higgins on drums. Higgins was later replaced by Larance Marable. When Marable became too ill to perform, drummer Rodney Green was added to the band. In addition to original compositions by Haden and Broadbent, their repertoire also included 1940s pop ballads which they played a noir-infused, bop-oriented style. A brief collaboration with tenor saxophonist Joe Henderson and drummer Al Foster showcased Haden's playing in a more hard-driving jazz context. In 1989, Haden inaugurated the \\"Invitation\\" series at the Montreal Jazz Festival. With different musicians he selected, they performed in concert for eight consecutive nights of the festival. Each of these events was recorded, and most have been released in the series, The Montreal Tapes. In 1994, Ginger Baker, legendary drummer from the band Cream, formed another trio called The Ginger Baker Trio with Haden and guitarist Bill Frisell. Duets: Haden performing in duets as he loved the intimacy the format provided. In 1995, Haden released Steal Away: Spirituals, Hymns and Folk Songs with pianist Hank Jones, an album based on traditional spirituals and folk songs. Haden both played on and produced the album. In late 1996, he collaborated with guitarist Pat Metheny on the album Beyond the Missouri Sky (Short Stories), exploring the music that influenced them in their childhood experiences in, respectively southwest Iowa and northwest Missouri, with what Haden called \\"contemporary impressionistic Americana\\". Haden was awarded his first Grammy award for the album, for Best Jazz Instrumental Performance. In 1997, classical composer Gavin Bryars wrote By the Vaar, an extended adagio for Haden. Instrumentation included strings, bass clarinet and percussion. The piece was recorded with the English Chamber Orchestra, on the album Farewell to Philosophy. It is a synthesis of jazz and classical chamber music, featuring resonant pizzicato notes and gut strings in imitation of Haden's bass sound. 2000‚Äì2014 In 2001, Haden won the Latin Grammy Award for Best Latin Jazz CD for his album Nocturne which contains boleros from Cuba and Mexico. In 2003, he won the Latin Grammy Award for Best Latin Jazz Performance for his album Land of the Sun. Haden reconvened the Liberation Music Orchestra in 2005, with largely new members, for the album Not In Our Name, released on Verve Records. The album dealt primarily with the contemporary political situation in the United States. In 2008, Haden co-produced, with his wife Ruth Cameron Haden, the album Charlie Haden Family and Friends: Rambling Boy. It features several members of his immediate family, including Ruth Cameron, his musician triplets, son Josh, and Tanya's husband, singer and multi-instrumentalist Jack Black. They were joined by banjoist B√©la Fleck, and guitarist/singers Vince Gill, Pat Metheny, Elvis Costello, Rosanne Cash, Bruce Hornsby (piano and keyboards), among other top Nashville musicians. The album harkens back to Haden's days of playing Americana and bluegrass music with his parents on their radio show. The idea came to Haden when his wife Ruth gathered the Haden family together for his mother's 80th birthday and suggested they all sing \\"You Are My Sunshine\\" in the living room, as that was a song everyone knew. Rambling Boy was intended to connect music from his early childhood in the Haden Family band to the new generation of the Haden family as well. The album includes songs made famous by the Stanley Brothers, the Carter Family, and Hank Williams, in addition to traditional songs and original compositions. In 2009, Swiss film director Reto Caduff released a film about Haden's life, titled Rambling Boy. It screened at the Telluride Film Festival and at the Vancouver International Film Festival in 2009. In the summer of 2009, Haden performed again with Coleman at the Meltdown Festival in Southbank, London. He also performed and produced duet recordings with pianist Kenny Barron, with whom he recorded the album Night and the City. In February 2010, Haden and pianist Hank Jones recorded a companion to Steal Away: Spirituals, Hymns and Folk Songs called Come Sunday. Jones died three months after the recording of the album. Awards: In 2012, Haden was a recipient of the NEA Jazz Masters Award. In 2013, Haden received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. In 2014, Haden was bestowed the Chevalier de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French Ministry of Culture. A posthumous ceremony in his honor took place at the French Cultural Services on January, 2015, in NYC where his wife Ruth was presented with the medal. Posthumous releases: In September 2014, three months after his death, the newly reactivated Impulse! label released Charlie Haden- Jim Hall, a recording of a duo performance at the 1990 Montreal International Jazz Festival. \\"This album documents a rarified journey\\", wrote pianist Ethan Iverson in the album's liner notes. Although terminally ill, Haden produced and worked on the album. In June 2015, Impulse released Tokyo Adagio, a 2005 collaboration with Gonzalo Rubalcaba, similarly produced by Haden when he was near death.Charlie Haden and Gonzalo Rubalcaba, Tokyo Adagio, Pop Matters, Jedd Beaudoin, August 11, 2015. Retrieved 29 March 2017. Legacy=Spirituality and teaching method While he did not identify himself with a specific religious orientation, Haden was interested in spirituality, especially in association with music. He felt it was his duty, and the duty of the artist, to bring beauty to the world, to make this world a better place. He encouraged his students to find their own unique musical voice and bring it to their instrument. He also encouraged his students to be in the present moment: \\"there's no yesterday or tomorrow, there's only right now\\", he explained. In order to find this state, and ultimately to find one's spiritual self, Haden urged one to aspire to have humility, and respect for beauty; to be thankful for the ability to make music, and to give back to the world with the music they create. He claimed that music taught him this process of exchange, so he taught it to his students in return. Music, Haden believed, also teaches incredibly valuable lessons about life: \\"I learned at a very young age that music teaches you about life. When you're in the midst of improvisation, there is no yesterday and no tomorrow‚Äîthere is just the moment that you are in. In that beautiful moment, you experience your true insignificance to the rest of the universe. It is then, and only then, that you can experience your true significance.\\" Musical philosophy Haden also viewed jazz as the \\"music of rebellion\\" and felt it was his responsibility and mission to challenge the world through music, and through artistic risks that expressed his own individual artistic vision. He believed that all music originates from the same place, and because of this, he resisted the tendency to divide music into categories. He was democratic in his tastes and musical partners, and was interested in musical collaboration with individuals who shared his sensibilities in music and life. His music (specifically the music he created with the LMO), was based on the music of peoples struggling for freedom from oppression. Haden spoke to this in reference to his 2002 album American Dreams, stating: ‚ÄúI always dreamed of a world without cruelty and greed, of a humanity with the same creative brilliance of our solar system, of an America worthy of the dreams of Martin Luther King, and the majesty of the Statue of Liberty...This music is dedicated to those who still dream of a society with compassion, deep creative intelligence, and a respect for the preciousness of life‚Äîfor our children, and for our future.‚Äù Musical style In addition to his lyrical playing, Haden was known for his warm tone and subtle vibrato on the double bass. His approach to the bass stemmed from his belief that the bassist should move from an accompanying role to a more direct role in group improvisation. This is particularly clear in his work with the Ornette Coleman Quartet where he frequently improvised melodic responses to Coleman's free-form solos instead of playing previously written lines. He frequently closed his eyes while performing, and assumed a posture in which he bent himself around the bass until his head was almost at the bottom of the bridge of the bass. In an interview with Haden, pianist Ethan Iverson noted that Haden's \\"combination of folk song, avant-garde sensibility, and Bach-like classical harmony is a stream in this music just as distinctive as Thelonious Monk or Elvin Jones.\\" Haden owned one three-quarters-sized bass, and one seven-eighths-sized bass. The larger bass is one of a small number of basses made by Jean-Baptiste Vuillaume, a French luthier, in the mid-nineteenth century. He greatly valued this bass, playing it only at recording sessions and jobs in close proximity to his home so as not to risk damaging it in transit. He attributed the bass's special and valuable nature to the varnish used by Vuillaume, which is similar to Italian varnish. Haden suffered from tinnitus, a ringing in both ears that he believed he acquired from constant exposure to playing in proximity to drums, and possibly from an extremely loud concert in which he played during the late 1960s. He also suffered from hyperacusis, or sensitivity to loud noises. As a result, when he played with a drummer, he had to play behind a Plexiglass divider. \\"American Quartet\\" pianist Keith Jarrett said of Charlie's way of playing, \\"He wanted to relate to the material in a very personal style all the time. He wasn't somebody to get into a groove and just enjoy it simply because it was a groove\\". Personal life Haden died in Los Angeles on July 11, 2014, at the age of 76. He had been suffering from effects of post-polio syndrome and complications from liver disease.Peter Hum, \\"RIP, Charlie Haden\\", Ottawa Citizen, July 12, 2014.Marc Myers, \\"Giving the Bass a Voice\\", Wall Street Journal, July 14, 2014.Marc Myers, \\"Charlie Haden (1937-2014)\\" , JazzWax, July 15, 2014. His wife, Ruth, and his four children were by his side. A memorial concert was held in New York City's Town Hall on January 13, 2015, produced and organized by Ruth, where his fellow musicians, family members, friends and fans remembered and celebrated his life. Haden was survived by his wife Ruth and his four children from his first marriage. His son, Josh Haden, is a bass guitarist and singer of the group Spain. His daughters, Petra, Tanya and Rachel Haden, are all singers and instrumentalists. Petra plays the violin, Rachel, the piano and bass guitar, and Tanya, a visual artist, plays the cello. They have a band called The Haden Triplets and recorded their self-titled album in 2012. Comedian/actor Jack Black was his son-in-law via Tanya. Material loss On June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Charlie Haden among hundreds of artists who had master recordings that were likely destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.

It saw a flourishing in art, music and fashion, and was symbolised by the city's \\"pop and fashion exports\\". Among its key elements were the Beatles, as leaders of the British Invasion of musical acts; Mary Quant's miniskirt; popular fashion models such as Twiggy and Jean Shrimpton; the mod subculture; the iconic status of popular shopping areas such as London's King's Road, Kensington and Carnaby Street; the political activism of the anti-nuclear movement; and sexual liberation. Music was a big part of the scene, with \\"the London sound\\" including the Who, the Kinks, the Small Faces and the Rolling Stones, bands that were the mainstay of pirate radio stations like Radio Caroline and Swinging Radio England. Swinging London also reached British cinema, which, according to the British Film Institute, \\"saw a surge in formal experimentation, freedom of expression, colour, and comedy\\". During this period, \\"creative types of all kinds gravitated to the capital, from artists and writers to magazine publishers, photographers, advertisers, film-makers and product designers\\". During the 1960s, London underwent a \\"metamorphosis from a gloomy, grimy post- war capital into a bright, shining epicentre of style\\". The phenomenon was caused by the large number of young people in the city (due to the baby boom of the 1950s) and the postwar economic boom. Following the abolition of the national service for men in 1960, these young people enjoyed greater freedom and fewer responsibilities than their parents' generation, and \\"[fanned] changes to social and sexual politics\\". Despite shaping the popular consciousness of Britain in the 1960s, however, Swinging London was a West End-centred phenomenon that only happened among young, middle class people, and was considered \\"simply a diversion\\" by some of them. The swinging scene also served as a consumerist counterpart to the countercultural British underground of the same period. Simon Rycroft writes: \\"Whilst it is important to acknowledge the exclusivity and the dissenting voices, it does not lessen the importance of Swinging London as a powerful moment of image making with very real material effect.\\"  Background  The Swinging Sixties was a youth movement emphasising the new and modern. It was a period of optimism and hedonism, and a cultural revolution. One catalyst was the recovery of the British economy after post-Second World War austerity, which lasted through much of the 1950s. \\"The Swinging City\\" was defined by Time magazine on the cover of its issue of 15 April 1966. In a Piri Halasz article 'Great Britain: You Can Walk Across It On the Grass', the magazine pronounced London the global hub of youthful creativity, hedonism and excitement: ‚ÄúIn a decade dominated by youth, London has burst into bloom. It swings; it is the scene\\",most famous (if not the first) identification of Swinging London Gilbert, David (2006) \\"'The Youngest Legend in History': Cultures of Consumption and the Mythologies of Swinging London\\" The London Journal 31(1): pp. 1‚Äì14, page 3, and celebrated in the name of the pirate radio station, Swinging Radio England, that began shortly afterwards. The term \\"swinging\\" in the sense of hip or fashionable had been used since the early 1960s, including by Norman Vaughan in his \\"swinging/dodgy\\" patter on Sunday Night at the London Palladium. In 1965, Diana Vreeland, editor of Vogue magazine, said that \\"London is the most swinging city in the world at the moment.\\"Quoted by John , Weekend Telegraph, 16 April 1965; and in Pearson, Lynn (2007) \\"Roughcast textures with cosmic overtones: a survey of British murals, 1945‚Äì80\\" Decorative Arts Society Journal 31: pp. 116‚Äì37 Later that year, the American singer Roger Miller had a hit record with \\"England Swings\\", which steps around the progressive youth culture (both musically and lyrically). The release in 1967 of Peter Whitehead's cult documentary film Tonite Lets All Make Love in London, which summed up both the culture of Swinging London through celebrity interviews, and the music, with its accompanying soundtrack release featuring Pink Floyd.  Music  The Kinks in 1967 Already heralded by Colin MacInnes' 1959 novel Absolute Beginners, Swinging London was underway by the mid-1960s and included music by The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, The Kinks, The Who, Small Faces, The Animals, Dusty Springfield, Lulu, Cilla Black, Sandie Shaw and other artists from what was known in the US as the \\"British Invasion\\". Psychedelic rock from artists such as Pink Floyd, Cream, Procol Harum, the Jimi Hendrix Experience and Traffic grew significantly in popularity. This sort of music was heard in the United Kingdom on TV shows such as Top Of The Pops and Ready Steady Go!, on commercial radio stations such as Radio Luxembourg, Radio Caroline and Radio London, and from 1967 on BBC Radio One. The Rolling Stones' 1966 album Aftermath has been cited by music scholars as a reflection of Swinging London. Ian MacDonald said, with the album the Stones were chronicling the phenomenon, while Philippe Margotin and Jean-Michel Guesdon called it \\"the soundtrack of Swinging London, a gift to hip young people\\".; ; ; .  Fashion and symbols  During the Swinging Sixties, fashion and photography were featured in Queen magazine, which drew attention to fashion designer Mary Quant. Mod-related fashions such as the miniskirt stimulated fashionable London shopping areas such as Carnaby Street and King's Road, Chelsea. Carnaby Street, circa 1968 The model Jean Shrimpton was another icon and one of the world's first supermodels. She was the world's highest paid and most photographed model during this time. Shrimpton was called \\"The Face of the '60s\\", in which she has been considered by many as \\"the symbol of Swinging London\\" and the \\"embodiment of the 1960s\\". Like Pattie Boyd, the wife of Beatles guitarist George Harrison, Shrimpton gained international fame for her embodiment of the \\"British female 'look' ‚Äì mini-skirt, long, straight hair and wide-eyed loveliness\\", characteristics that defined Western fashion following the arrival of the Beatles and other British Invasion acts in 1964. Available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required). Other popular models of the era included Veruschka, Peggy Moffitt and Penelope Tree. The model Twiggy has been called \\"the face of 1966\\" and \\"the Queen of Mod\\", a label she shared with, among others, Cathy McGowan, the host of the television rock show Ready Steady Go! from 1964 to 1966.Fowler, David (2008) Youth Culture in Modern Britain, C.1920‚Äìc.1970: From Ivory Tower to Global Movement ‚Äì A New History p. 134. Palgrave Macmillan, 2008 The British flag, the Union Jack, became a symbol, assisted by events such as England's home victory in the 1966 World Cup. The Jaguar E-Type sports car was a British icon of the 1960s. In late 1965, photographer David Bailey sought to define Swinging London in a series of large photographic prints. Compiled into a set titled Box of Pin-Ups, they were published on 21 November that year. His subjects included actors Michael Caine and Terence Stamp; John Lennon, Paul McCartney, Mick Jagger and five other pop stars; Brian Epstein, as one of four individuals representing music management; hairdresser Vidal Sassoon, ballet dancer Rudolf Nureyev, Ad Lib club manager Brian Morris, and the Kray twins; as well as leading figures in interior decoration, Pop Art, photography, fashion modelling, photographic design and creative advertising. Bailey's photographs reflected the rise of working-class artists, entertainers and entrepreneurs that characterised London during this period. Writing in his 1967 book The Young Meteors, journalist Jonathan Aitken described Box of Pin-Ups as \\"a Debrett of the new aristocracy\\".  Film  The mini became an icon of 1960s British popular culture, and featured in the 1969 caper film The Italian Job. The phenomenon was featured in many films of the time, including Darling (1965), The Pleasure Girls (1965), The Knack ...and How to Get It (1965), the Michelangelo Antonioni film Blowup (1966), Alfie (1966), Morgan: A Suitable Case for Treatment (1966), Georgy Girl (1966), Kaleidoscope (1966), The Jokers (1967), Casino Royale (1967), Smashing Time (1967), To Sir, with Love (1967), Bedazzled (1967), Poor Cow (1967), I'll Never Forget What's'isname (1967), Up the Junction (1968), Joanna (1968), Otley (1968), The Magic Christian (1969), The Brain (1969), If It's Tuesday, This Must Be Belgium (1969), and Performance (1970).

With a length of , it is the longest river that runs entirely in Brazilian territory, and the fourth longest in South America and overall in Brazil (after the Amazon, the Paran√° and the Madeira). It used to be known as the by the indigenous people before colonisation, and is today also known as (\\"Old Frank\\"). The S√£o Francisco originates in the Canastra mountain range in the central-western part of the state of Minas Gerais. It runs generally north in the states of Minas Gerais and Bahia, behind the coastal range, draining an area of over , before turning east to form the border between Bahia on the right bank and the states of Pernambuco and Alagoas on the left one. After that, it forms the boundary between the states of Alagoas and Sergipe and washes into the Atlantic Ocean. In addition to the five states which the S√£o Francisco directly traverses or borders, its drainage basin also includes tributaries from the state of Goi√°s and the Federal District. It is an important river for Brazil, called \\"the river of national integration\\" because it unites diverse climes and regions of the country, in particular the Southeast with the Northeast. It is navigable between the cities of Pirapora (Minas Gerais) and Juazeiro (Bahia), as well as between Piranhas (Alagoas) and the mouth on the ocean, but traditional passenger navigation has all but disappeared in recent years due to changes in the river flow (see below). Names The river is named after Saint Francis of Assisi, from its first discovery by Europeans on his feast day (4 October) in 1501. The river was called Kalesh√≠ in the now extinct Tux√° language, and Op√°ra in the extinct Nat√∫ language.Pompeu Sobrinho, Thomaz. 1958. L√≠nguas Tapuias desconhecidas do Nordeste: Alguns vocabul√°rios in√©ditos. Boletim de Antropologia (Fortaleza- Cear√°) 2. 3‚Äì19. History Tux√°, Truk√°, Nat√∫, Kariri languages, eastern Maxakal√≠an languages, J√™ languages, and various unclassified extinct languages were spoken in the S√£o Francisco River basin. The Italian explorer Amerigo Vespucci first saw the river on 4 October 1501. In 1865 the British explorer and diplomat Richard Francis Burton was transferred to Santos in Brazil. He explored the central highlands, canoeing down the S√£o Francisco river from its source to the falls of Paulo Afonso.Wright (1905), vol. 1, p. 200 .  Sections  River source S√£o Francisco River south of Paulo Afonso Metal bridge with 84 meters of height., Border with states of BA-AL The course of the river, running through five states, may be divided into four sections, as follows: #The high part, from its source to Pirapora in Minas Gerais #The upper middle part, from Pirapora, where the navigable part begins, up to Remanso (Bahia) and the Sobradinho Dam #The lower middle part, from the Sobradinho dam to Paulo Afonso, also in Bahia (bordering on Alagoas), and ending at the Itaparica Dam #The low part, from Paulo Afonso to the river's mouth on the Atlantic Ocean  Tributaries  The river obtains water from 168 rivers and streams, of which 90 are on the right bank and 78 on the left bank. The main tributaries are: *Paraopeba River *Abaet√© River *Das Velhas River *Jequita√≠ River *Paracatu River *Urucuia River *Verde Grande River *Carinhanha River *Corrente River *Grande River Navigability A river canyon on the S√£o Francisco river. The S√£o Francisco is naturally navigable all through the year between Pirapora (Minas Gerais) and the twin cities of Petrolina (Pernambuco) and Juazeiro (Bahia), a length of . However, there are large variations in depth depending on the rainfall. Because of the diversity of physical characteristics over the course of the navigable stretch, it may be divided into three substretches, as follows: *From Pirapora to Pil√£o Arcado (Bahia), a length of ; differences in height up to may occur due to rains and drought. *From Pil√£o Arcado to the Sobradinho Dam; the latter's reservoir is long, with a surface area of and a comfortable depth. *From the Sobradinho dam to Petrolina/Juazeiro, with a length of and an average depth of , sustained by a flow of . Until recent years, the S√£o Francisco was regularly navigated by a type of passenger boat called gaiola (Portuguese for \\"cage\\"). These were paddle-wheel steamboats, some of them having been Mississippi riverboats and dating from the time of the American Civil War. After the Sobradinho dam was built in Bahia, the conditions of navigability were altered considerably, since the reservoir's large size allowed for the formation of short waves of considerable height. Although the dam has a navigation lock, the waves and currents made traversing the lake difficult for the gaiolas. At the same time, deforestation and excessive agricultural use of the upper-course waters of the S√£o Francisco and its tributaries greatly reduced the water flow in the middle course, creating sand banks and islands that hindered navigation. In a short time, conditions were such that navigation became impossible for the large gaiolas, although still possible for smaller boats. The shells of those old riverboats can still be seen on the river at Pirapora. As of 2009, a single boat, the Benjamim Guimar√£es, remains in activity, making short-distance tourist cruises from Pirapora to S√£o Rom√£o and back. Fish More than 200 fish species are known from the S√£o Francisco River basin and it is expected that several additional species will be discovered in the future, especially from the relatively poorly known upper parts of the river.Reis, R.E.; J.S. Albert; F. Di Dario; M.M. Mincarone; P. Petry; and L.A. Rocha (2016). Fish biodiversity and conservation in South America. Journal of Fish Biology 89(1): 12‚Äì47. About 10% of the fish species known from the river basin are threatened and about 13% are important in fisheries.Guia da Pesca (8 March 2010). Belo Horizonte ganha o maior aqu√°rio de √°gua doce do Brasil. Retrieved 9 March 2013 About 64% of the fish species known from the basin are endemic, including Conorhynchos conirostris (a catfish of uncertain taxonomic affinities),Ferraris, Carl J., Jr. (2007).

Towns and population S√£o Francisco River, in Ibotirama, BA, Brazil Mouth of the S√£o Francisco river The area crossed by the river is vast and sparsely populated, but several towns lie on the river. Beginning in Minas Gerais, the river passes by Pirapora, S√£o Francisco, Janu√°ria, Bom Jesus da Lapa, the twin cities of Petrolina and Juazeiro, and Paulo Afonso. The hinterland is arid and underpopulated, so most of the towns are small and isolated. Only Petrolina and Juazeiro have grown into medium-sized cities and have become prosperous because of fruit production based on irrigation.  Hydroelectric dams  The river's hydroelectric potential started being harnessed in 1955, when the Paulo Afonso dam was built between Bahia and Alagoas. The Paulo Afonso plant now provides electric power for the whole of Northeastern Brazil. Four other large hydroelectric plants were later built: Tr√™s Marias in Minas Gerais, built in 1961, Sobradinho in Bahia, built in 1977, Luiz Gonzaga (Itaparica), between Bahia and Pernambuco, in 1988 and the Xing√≥ near Piranhas in 1994. The Sobradinho reservoir is one of the largest artificial lakes in the world, with an area of . The section of dramatic canyons between the Paulo Afonso and Xing√≥ dams, including part of the Xing√≥ reservoir, is protected by the Rio S√£o Francisco Natural Monument. Cultural significance The S√£o Francisco has great importance in history and particularly in folklore. That history is celebrated in song, legend and souvenirs based on the carrancas, a kind of gargoyle placed on the prow of the gaiola boats and intended to scare away river demons from the boat. Tourist shops far from the river have modernized replicas and miniatures of the vanishing originals. The stories of river demons and monsters persist today. From Paulo Afonso to the historic town of Penedo (Alagoas), the river lies at the bottom of a gorge or steep sided valley. Piranhas, a nearby town, was once the terminus of a railroad. The town has a number of abandoned historical buildings from that period. They have been restored and are emerging as a tourist attraction. Controversial diversion project (under construction) In 2005, the Brazilian government proposed a controversial water diversion project that will bring water from the river to semiarid areas of four Brazilian states (Cear√°, Pernambuco, Para√≠ba and Rio Grande do Norte). Environmentalists argue that the project will do more harm than good, benefitting only large landowners and a very small population, while bringing considerable ecological impact. The government insists that the project will give the people in the four states a much-needed water supply. The diversion project intake point is located at Cabrob√≥.

It is the opposite of the spoils system.  History = United States  The United States civil service began to run on the spoils system in 1829 when Andrew Jackson became president. The assassination of United States President James A. Garfield by a disappointed office seeker in 1881 proved its dangers. President Garfield was shot by Charles J. Guiteau who believed that the president owed him a civil service position and in not giving him the position, threatened the very being of the Republican Party. Two years later, the system of appointments to the United States federal bureaucracy was revamped by the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act, which made the merit system common practice. The merit system determines the fitness of the candidate by the ability to pass a written competitive examination, given by a commission of examiners. The answers submitted by candidates must be unsigned, so as to obviate the possibility of favoritism on the part of the examiners. A list is made of the successful candidates, arranged in the order of their merit as shown by the results of the examination. Appointments must be made from this eligible list in the order of rank unless good cause can be shown why one of higher rank should be set aside for one standing lower on the list.[4] Proponents of the system admit that the system does not always lead to the choice of most competent candidate but is effective in eliminating those most incompetent.[4] In addition the possible exclusion of most competent candidate is outweighed by the system's benefits such as limiting the ability of nepotism and political favoritism. The power of appointment being vested in the president of the United States by the United States Constitution, it is not within the power of the United States Congress to fetter the president's action by the enactment of laws restricting the exercise of the power of appointments. Thus, in the United States, the merit system has been extensively applied by the voluntary action of the president following self-imposed rules. It has been judicially determined that the civil-service rules promulgated by the president of the United States do not have the force of general law, and confer upon members of the civil service no right to invoke the aid of the courts to protect them against violation thereof. They are the president's laws, and the president alone can enforce them.[5] Working under the supervision of the president is the Merit Systems Protection Board. The MSPB follows nine core principles when governing the executive branch workforce.  Performance Assessment = Forced Ranking  Forced Ranking is a system in which performing employees are ranked into groups a company has established. The term 'Rank and Yank' was created by the former CEO of General Electric, Jack Welch. The 'Rank and Yank' encouraged terminating the employment of poor performers and replacing them with new personnel. Many like Welch and Former Chief Executive of Microsoft believe in replacing poor performers while others, such as Tom Barry, former Managing Director at BlessingWhite, believe in 're-engaging underperforming employees.'Rao, Pramila (2013). Taking Sides Clashing Views in Human Resource Management. New York, New York: McGraw-Hill. pp. 217‚Äì232. .  Consequences of Performance Assessment  As the United States has become Anti- Bureaucratic, it has moved away from the outdated depiction of Merit System. Twenty-eight states have established an ‚ÄòAt Will‚Äô environment where civil service employees can be fired at any time without cause. In 2014 the Department of Veteran Affairs became overwhelmed with problems with scheduling appointments. Congress called for immediate action and ordered the Department of Veteran Affairs to lay off ‚Äòmiscreant‚Äô employees. Donald F. Kettl, a Professor in the School of Public Policy at the University of Maryland, explores in his work, The Merit Principle in Crisis, ‚ÄòAt will‚Äô practices and whether they‚Äôre beneficial to the bureaucratic practices of the government. Kettl states that due to an increase in government programs, firing ‚Äòmiscreant‚Äô bureaucratic employees would only ‚Äòweaken the governments ability to steer‚Äô. Such repercussions such as Kettl‚Äôs are not the only measures taken by employers.Kettl, Donald F. \\"The Merit Principle In Crisis.\\" Governance 28.4 (2015): 421-424. Business Source Complete. Web. 13 Apr. 2016. Susan J. Wells, a writer for HR Magazine, expresses her take on Merit Pay and its meaning in No Results, No Raise. Wells believes that the concept of ‚ÄòTough Love‚Äô makes a more profound impact on the balance of protecting and rewarding those whose performance excels and those whose performance could be improved. Wells elaborates that not rewarding low performers with a merit increase at the end of the year is an ideal way of showing ‚ÄòTough Love.' The idea gives low performing employees a year to improve their performance and receive constant feedback from managerial staff. Pros The importance of the merit system in a work place is to provide good quality work to the public. When merit is truly assessed in the process of hiring or promoting personnel, an honest, effective, and productive workplace is created.\\"Merit System Principles and Performance Management.\\" U.S. Office of Personnel Management. N.p., n.d. Web. 13 Apr. 2016. Employees build organizations and the service they provide to customers allows the organization to be successful. Without its employees or customers, an organization would be doomed. Motivated and happy employees are the key principle of the merit system. Employees who are satisfied with their jobs are likely to provide a higher level of productivity (more work in less time, costing organizations less money), less likely to quit (low or lower employee turnover rates), great communication for voicing workplace concerns (trust and comfort between supervisor and employees), little to no abuse of company benefits/incentives, i.e.: lunch breaks, sick leave, bonuses, etc. Bottom line, administration is responsible for providing and setting the atmosphere and standards of a workplace that result in success.Caldwell, D. (1978). Employee Motivation Under Merit Systems. Public Personnel Management, 7(1), 65. Cons The merit system has been criticized that it leads to uncooperative behaviors among employees, creating conflict that can negatively affect productivity. It is based on performance compensation that encourages competition among employees, creating a competitive environment that puts employees at odds with one another. This can lead to unwanted behavior that can affect productivity. Disrupting team unity to look better on reviews and personal goals becomes more important than team goals.Johnson, Susan Moore.

The highway primarily consists of only three intersections: I-280, El Camino Real (State Route 82), and U.S. 101. Like the nearby I-280, I-380 never connects to Interstate 80, its parent Interstate Highway. However, there is no rule that says that spur routes need to. (Similarly, the spur route Interstate 795 branches off from Interstate 695, a beltway around Baltimore, and is only indirectly linked to Interstate 95.) I-380 is officially known as the Quentin L. Kopp Freeway, named after the prominent California State Senator from San Mateo County. This highway was previously named the Portola Freeway to honor the eighteenth-century Spanish explorer Gaspar de Portol√°, whose expedition in 1769-70 discovered the San Francisco Bay, from a viewpoint on the Sweeney Ridge located between San Bruno and Pacifica. Route description Along eastbound on I-380 near the SR 82 exit. Note the very broad freeway median. I-380 begins at a junction with I-280 in San Bruno. This junction is really only partially built, allowing room to build a proposed freeway extension west towards State Route 1 (see below). The freeway itself lacks overhead guide signs mentioning I-380. It then travels east through the City of San Bruno, intersecting with State Route 82, El Camino Real, before reaching US 101. At its terminus at US 101, the mainline lanes of I-380 continue to North Access Road. Meanwhile, the ramps to and from southbound US 101 provide connections to collector/distributor roads leading directly to San Francisco International Airport, allowing traffic between the Interstate and the airport to avoid merging with the main traffic lanes of US Highway 101. I-380 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. History There were plans to extend I-380 all the way to State Route 1 (the Cabrillo Highway), but due to the route's passing over the San Andreas Fault and opposition from members of the local community, this project has yet to be tackled. The westbound lanes of I-380 branch off to the right at I-280, leaving a very wide, paved space which would carry the freeway extension under I-280 towards SR 1. This space is currently often used as storage space for equipment used in highway maintenance. A pair of unused bridges crossing over the I-280 South to I-380 East offramp remain as evidence. Despite the opposition, Chapter 2, Article 3, Section 608 of the California Streets and Highways Code still legally defines Route 380 as traveling from \\"Route 1 near Pacifica to Route 280 in San Bruno\\", and the exit numbers assigned at I-280 start at five instead of one or zero. Exit list Mileage is measured from the unconstructed western terminus at State Route 1 near Pacifica.

Mr. Dressup is a Canadian children's television series. It originally ran on CBC from 1967 to 1996. Production Mr. Dressup was developed and produced by Daniel McCarthy, who later became the head of children's programming for CBC Television, as a replacement for Butternut Square, on which Mr. Dressup had been a featured character. Premise The series starred the actor Ernie Coombs as Mr. Dressup. The show aired every weekday morning, Mr. Dressup would lead children through a series of songs, stories, arts, crafts and imagination games, with the help of his puppet friends Casey and Finnegan, a child and a dog who lived in a tree house in Mr. Dressup's backyard. Some critics likened the series to the American series, Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, which started being broadcast a year later in 1968 on the U.S. network PBS and was produced by Coombs' former professional associate, Fred Rogers.\\"The Canadian origin story behind Mister Rogers' Neighborhood\\" Judith Lawrence was the puppeteer who created Casey and Finnegan, along with other occasional puppet visitors such as Alligator Al and Aunt Bird. The set for the show included the inside of Mr. Dressup's house, with scenes shot in the living room, kitchen and a play room. This included the Tickle Trunk (where costumes used in make-believe skits were stored) and a long counter where Casey and Finnegan often appeared. Sometimes, the action moved outside to Casey's and Finnegan's tree house. Typically during a segment, Mr. Dressup would get a costume from the Tickle Trunk, such as one for an animal, policeman or fireman. Donning the costume, he would play the suggested role. Occasionally, when the Tickle Trunk would not open, Mr. Dressup sang a song and tickled the lock, hence its name. The trunk appeared to be magic as it always had the right costumes, in the right sizes, neatly folded at the top of the piles of costumes. Occasionally, Mr. Dressup would need to make an accessory for his costume, which would lead to a craft. Mr. Dressup usually drew or made a craft and would sing a song with the puppets. On occasion, Mr. Dressup would also read a book or show a short documentary to the audience. The films were usually silent and Mr. Dressup would narrate. He often drew pictures on his drawing board to either illustrate a short story or to play a game with one of his visitors. He would frequently encourage children to try the craft at home or to sing along with the songs. In later years, Judith Lawrence chose to retire from the show. Rather than cast a new puppeteer in the roles of Casey and Finnegan, a team of new puppeteers was brought in. They created Karen Valleau (Chester the Crow), Nina Keogh (Truffles), Jani Lauzon (Granny), Ruth Danziger (Annie), Jim Parker (Alex), and Bob Dermer (Lorenzo the Raccoon). These new characters visited Mr. Dressup and over time, became the lead puppet characters, with Casey and Finnegan gradually being removed from the show. This was done gradually for a transition before Lawrence's retirement. When Casey and Finnegan stopped appearing on the show, an announcement was made that they were attending kindergarten. With the new characters came new sets, including the community centre. During the last 10 years of the show, singer, musician and Yo-Yo champion Mark Kersey appeared as recurring character \\"Mark the Repairman\\". Conclusion The final episode of Mr. Dressup was taped on February 14, 1996. Coombs spent most of the next few years touring college campuses giving talks about his time on the show aimed at students who grew up with his series. He died of a stroke at the age of 73, on September 18, 2001, in Toronto, Ontario. Legacy and honours Rebroadcasts of the series continued for a decade after it ended, until CBC announced that it was taking Mr. Dressup out of its weekday morning lineup and moving it to Sunday mornings, effective July 3, 2006. The final repeat aired on September 3, 2006. In 2017, episodes from the series were included on encore+, a YouTube channel run by the Canada Media Fund and Google Canada. Although the five episodes made available on YouTube in 2017 were deleted in June 2018, they were re-posted a month later in July 2018.https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXssjYeUyJVEVrwaZFx4LoMhVBgSo__be Due to the long run of the series, several generations of Canadian children, as well as Americans growing up in northern United States regions that received the CBC signal, grew up watching Mr. Dressup and his adventures. Ernie Coombs and the character of Mr. Dressup have become strong Canadian icons and a part of Canadian pop culture.Last official \\"Interview with Ernie Coombs\\", FrankTalks.com/Radio. In 2010 two elements of the series were preserved for public viewing. They were Casey's tree house, which is on display in the Canadian Broadcasting Centre in Downtown Toronto, and the Tickle Trunk (with assorted props), which was previously on display in the CBC Museum, close to where the tree house is located. The Tickle Trunk was not placed in another museum after the CBC Museum closed. On November 26, 2012, Mr. Dressup (along with Casey and Finnegan) were featured in a Google Doodle on the Canadian Google website as a tribute to Coombs' 85th birthday.

Kennedy's dream of a just and peaceful world. In 2014, Ethel Kennedy was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama. Early life and education Ethel Skakel was born in Chicago, to businessman George Skakel and secretary Ann Brannack. Her parents were killed in a 1955 plane crash.Schlesinger, Arthur Meier Jr. (2002). Robert Kennedy and His Times. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, p. 87 She was the Skakels' third of four daughters and sixth child of seven, having five older siblings, Georgeann, James, George Jr., Rushton, and Patricia, and one younger sister, Ann. George was a Protestant of Dutch descent while Ann was a Catholic of Irish ancestry. Ethel and her siblings were raised Catholic in Greenwich, Connecticut. George Skakel was the founder of Great Lakes Carbon Corporation, now a division of SGLCarbon. She attended the all-girls Greenwich Academy in Greenwich and graduated from the Convent of the Sacred Heart in Manhattan in 1945. In September 1945, Skakel began her college education at Manhattanville College, where she was a classmate of future sister-in-law Jean Kennedy. Ethel first met Jean's brother, Robert F. Kennedy, during a ski trip to Mont Tremblant Resort in Quebec in December 1945. During this trip, Robert Kennedy began dating Ethel's elder sister, Patricia. After that relationship ended, he began dating Ethel. She campaigned for his elder brother, John F. Kennedy, in his 1946 campaign for the United States Congress; she also wrote her college thesis on his book Why England Slept. Skakel received a bachelor's degree from Manhattanville in 1949. Marriage and family Ethel Kennedy in 1968 Robert Kennedy and Ethel Skakel became engaged in February 1950 and were married on June 17, 1950, at St. Mary's Catholic Church in Greenwich, Connecticut. During the 1950s, Robert F. Kennedy worked for the federal government in investigatory roles for the United States Senate as a counsel. The Kennedys purchased Hickory Hill, an estate in McLean, Virginia, from Robert's brother John and his wife, Jackie. Robert and Ethel Kennedy held many gatherings at their home and were known for their impressive and eclectic guest lists. In 1962, President Kennedy assigned Ethel and Robert to tour fourteen countries within a 28-day goodwill trip. Though the trip was said to be informal, the host countries viewed her and Robert as stand-ins for the President and First Lady. On November 22, 1963, Ethel learned of President Kennedy's assassination from her husband. She had answered the phone, identified the caller as J. Edgar Hoover and handed the phone over to Robert, who then informed her of the shooting. The FBI Director had never called the Attorney General's home before. Ethel was reportedly devastated by the assassination and worried for President Kennedy's children.Oppenheimer, p. 352. Ethel urged her husband to enter the Democratic primary for the 1968 presidential election. Biographer Evan Thomas portrayed her as RFK's \\"most consistent advocate of a race for the White House.\\" Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy Shortly after midnight on June 5, 1968, Robert F. Kennedy was mortally wounded by Sirhan Sirhan and died early the next day. U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson declared a national day of mourning. Ethel sent Johnson a handwritten note on June 19, thanking him and his wife, First Lady Lady Bird Johnson, for the help they had given her and the Kennedy family. Following her husband's assassination, Ethel Kennedy publicly stated that she would never marry again. For a time, she was escorted to dinners, parties, and the theater by singer and family friend Andy Williams. Children Robert and Ethel Kennedy had eleven children; Kathleen, Joseph, Robert Jr., David, Courtney, Michael, Kerry, Christopher, Max, Douglas, and Rory. Rory was born after Senator Kennedy was assassinated. Kathleen served as Lieutenant Governor of Maryland from 1995 to 2003, and Joseph was a member of the U.S. House of Representatives from the 8th congressional district of Massachusetts from 1987 to 1999. In the media, Ethel Kennedy's parenting has been alternately described as \\"quaint\\", \\"questionable\\", \\"tough love\\", \\"inattentive\\", and \\"angry\\". In a 1997 piece on the Kennedys' children, Vanity Fair noted \\"one son's death by drug overdose, another's arrest for heroin possession, and the involvement of Joe himself in reckless driving that left a girl paralyzed for life, along with a general trend of overindulgence among the sons that has sent several of them into rehab\\". These remarks respectively referred to her sons David, Robert Jr., and Joseph. Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights Ethel Kennedy founded the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights (now known as Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights in 1968. In February 2001, Kennedy visited Rodolfo Montiel and another peasant activist at their jail in Iguala, presenting Rodolfo with the Chico Mendes Award on behalf of American environmental group, the Sierra Club. In March 2016, Kennedy was among hundreds who marched near the home of Wendy's chairman Nelson Peltz in Palm Beach, Florida, as part of an effort by the Coalition of Immokalee Workers, a farm workers' group, to convince the company to pay an additional one cent per pound of tomatoes to increase the wages of field workers. As of September 2018, Kennedy's daughter Kerry Kennedy was president of Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights. Later life Kennedy sold Hickory Hill for $8.25 million in December 2009. Ethel Kennedy in 1999 During the 2008 Democratic Party presidential primaries, Ethel Kennedy endorsed Barack Obama. She publicly supported and held fundraisers at Hickory Hill for numerous politicians that included Virginia gubernatorial candidate Brian Moran. Kennedy hosted a $6-million fundraising dinner for Obama at Hickory Hill in June 2008. The $28,500-a-plate dinner was headlined by former Democratic presidential candidate and DNC chairman Howard Dean. In 2012, Kennedy appeared in a documentary about her life; the documentary was directed by her youngest child, daughter Rory. The documentary, entitled Ethel, covers Kennedy's early political involvement, her life with Robert F. Kennedy, and the years following his death when she raised eleven children on her own. It features interviews with Ethel and her children interspersed with family videos and archival photos. In August 2014, Kennedy nominated President Barack Obama to do the Ice Bucket Challenge as part of an effort to raise funds and awareness about amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease). Obama declined to perform the fundraising stunt, but expressed appreciation to Kennedy and made a monetary donation to the cause.Laura Stampler, Obama Declines Ice Bucket Challenge, Time (August 12, 2014). As of 2014, Kennedy reportedly wintered in Florida and summered in Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Five years later, she was known to reside at the Kennedy Compound in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts. Legacy and awards In 1981, President Ronald Reagan honored Kennedy with the Robert F. Kennedy medal in the White House Rose Garden. In 2014, a bridge over the Anacostia River was renamed the Ethel Kennedy Bridge in her honor, in recognition of her advocacy for environmentalism and social causes in the District of Columbia. Also in 2014, she was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Obama for her dedication to \\"advancing the cause of social justice, human rights, environmental protection, and poverty reduction by creating countless ripples of hope to effect change around the world.\\" See also * Kennedy family tree References ;Notes ;Further reading * Schlesinger, Arthur Meier Jr., Robert Kennedy and His Times, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2002, * Taraborrelli, J.

This genus is sometimes split off with various other southern warbler genera and given family status as the Cisticolidae. The croaking cisticola is a resident breeder in Africa south of the Sahara. It is a very small insectivorous bird. These small passerines are found in rank grassland habitats, often near swamps or water. Male cisticolas are polygamous; the female builds a discreet nest deep in the grasses, often binding living leaves into the soft fabric of felted plant-down, cobwebs, and grass. The croaking cisticola's nest is a ball shape with a side entrance; 2-4 eggs are laid. This is the largest cisticola. This warbler is grey-brown above, heavily streaked with black. The underparts are whitish, and the tail is broad, pale-tipped and flicked frequently. It has a chestnut wing-panel and a heavy bill. It is very similar to other members of its genus. It is best distinguished from its many African relatives by its size and froglike croaking breep-breep song. The song is always the easiest identification criterion for this genus. These birds are more easily heard than seen, and because of their small size (about 14 cm) not always easy to recognise, particularly outside the breeding season when they seldom emerge from their grasses.

The current title was created in 1801 for Thomas Pelham, 2nd Baron Pelham of Stanmer in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. Medieval earls of other places Modern sources occasionally refer to medieval Earls of Chichester in regard to the d'Aubignys, Earls of Arundel (created 1143) and/or the (de) Montgomeries, Earls of Shrewsbury (created 1074), previously seized of the fiefdom of and Castle of Arundel. As earldoms in that era were less defined - an earl could be referred to by various places such as the name of the place where he officiated - reference to those holders as such is deprecated. First creation The first formal creation of the earldom was in the Peerage of England in 1644 when Francis Leigh, 1st Baron Dunsmore was made Earl of Chichester (in the County of Sussex) with remainder to his son-in-law Thomas Wriothesley, 4th Earl of Southampton (the husband of his daughter Elizabeth). He had already been made a baronet, of Newnham, Warwickshire in 1618 (in the Baronetage of England),George Edward Cokayne Complete Baronetage Volume 1 1900 Leigh 1618 with remainder to the male heirs of his body, and Baron Dunsmore of Dunsmore, Warwickshire, in 1628 (in the Peerage of England) with special remainder to his stepson John Anderson (the son of his second wife Audrey Boteler and Sir Francis Anderson). Lord Chichester as predicted had no sons. On his death in 1653 his baronetcy became extinct, equally the barony of Dunsmore as his stepson Sir John (who was conferred a baronetcy in 1629) had died childless in 1630. The earldom passed to Lord Southampton (see the Earl of Southampton for earlier history of this title) who had no male issue; on his death in 1667 both earldoms became extinct. Family background ;Lord Mayor of London, Sir Thomas Leigh The first earl was the grandson of Sir William Leigh, third son of Sir Thomas Leigh (c. 1504‚Äì1571), Lord Mayor of London for 1558. ;Great- uncles of first Earl paternal ancestors of the Barons Leigh *Sir William's eldest brother Rowland was ancestor of the recipient of the final, second creation in 1838 *Sir William's next-eldest brother Sir Thomas was ancestor of the recipient of 1643-1786 creation and was made a baronet, of the same territorial designation of these baronies, Stoneleigh, Warwickshire, owning Stoneleigh Abbey. Second creation (1675) The title was created again in the Peerage of England in 1675 however as a subsidiary/courtesy title when Charles Fitzroy, illegitimate son of Charles II and Barbara Villiers, was created Duke of Southampton, Earl of Chichester and Baron Newbury. These titles ended in 1774 on the death of the third holder, who was in the third generation. Third creation (1801) ;Family background The Pelham family descends from Thomas Pelham of Laughton, Sussex, who represented Lewes and Sussex in the House of Commons. In 1611 he was created a baronet, of Laughton in the Baronetage of England.George Edward Cokayne Complete Baronetage, Volume 1 1900 Pelham 1611 He was succeeded by his son, the second Baronet who sat as MP for East Grinstead and Sussex. His son, the third Baronet, represented Hastings and Sussex in Parliament for many years. He was succeeded by his son, the fourth Baronet who was as MP for East Grinstead, Lewes and Sussex, served as a Commissioner of Customs and as a Lord of the Treasury. ;Baron Pelham In 1706 the fourth baronet was raised to the Peerage of England as Lord Pelham, Baron Pelham, of Laughton. He married as his second wife Lady Grace Holles, daughter of Gilbert Holles, 3rd Earl of Clare (see the Earl of Clare). ;Sons of 1st Baron Pelham serving as Prime Minister The second son of 1st Baron Pelham was the prominent statesman Henry Pelham, Prime Minister 1743‚Äì1754. Henry's older brother became the second Baron and served as Prime Minister 1754-1756 and 1757‚Äì1762. He inherited vast estates on the death of John Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle-upon-Tyne (1662‚Äì1711) (his mother's brother) and took by Royal licence the additional surname 'Holles' in 1711. In 1714 the Earldom of Clare was revived in his favour with special remainder to his younger brother, the earlier Prime Minister. Surpassing this, the next year his maternal uncle's title was revived; he was made Duke of Newcastle-upon- Tyne with similar remainder to his younger brother Henry. In 1756, Henry Pelham having died without male issue, the childless Duke of Newcastle-upon- Tyne was created Duke of Newcastle-under-Lyne which bore special remainder to Henry Pelham-Clinton, 9th Earl of Lincoln - son of his sister Lucy, wife of Henry Clinton, 7th Earl of Lincoln) (this 9th Earl, created 2nd Duke, married his first cousin Catherine, daughter of Henry). In 1762 he was also made Baron Pelham of Stanmer which bore special remainder to his first cousin once removed Thomas Pelham. ;Effect of Special Remainders The Duke was childless and on his death in 1768 the barony of Pelham and the creations of 1714 and 1715 became extinct. The dukedom of 1756 passed to the Earl of Lincoln. The Duke was also succeeded in the baronetcy and in the barony of Pelham of Stanmer by first cousin once-removed Thomas Pelham, the second Baron. He was the son of Thomas Pelham, Member of Parliament for Lewes, son of Henry Pelham, third son of the third Baronet. Like his cousins he was also a politician. He represented Rye and Sussex in the House of Commons and served as a Commissioner of Trade and Plantations, as a Lord of the Admiralty and as Comptroller of the Household. In 1801 he was honoured when he was created Earl of Chichester in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Earl. He was also an influential politician and held office as Chief Secretary for Ireland, as Home Secretary and as Postmaster General. In 1801, during his father's lifetime, he was summoned to the House of Lords through a writ of acceleration in his father's junior title of Baron Pelham of Stanmer. His eldest son, the third Earl, was Lord Lieutenant of Sussex from 1860 to 1886. On his death the titles passed to his eldest son, the fourth Earl. He sat as Liberal Member of Parliament for Lewes. He died childless and was succeeded by his younger brother, the fifth Earl. He was an Anglican cleric including Rector of Lambeth. The fifth Earl was succeeded by his eldest son, the sixth Earl, who died of pneumonia on 14 November 1926, age 55. His eldest son succeeded but also died of pneumonia having been Earl for eight days, on 22 November. He was succeeded by his younger brother, the eighth Earl, who was killed in a road accident in Doncaster while on active service in the Second World War. He was succeeded by his son, the ninth Earl, born seven weeks after his father's death. If the ninth earl had been born a girl or had not survived early childhood, the title would passed to Henry George Godolphin Pelham (1875‚Äì1949), second son of the fifth Earl. The ninth Lord Chichester has served as board member of music institutions.

Seats and other abodes The family laid out Stanmer Park and had built and lavishly decorated successions of Stanmer House, Stanmer, East Sussex which it acquired in 1713. In 1947, death duties following the unexpected deaths of three earls from 1926‚Äì44 forced trustees for the then-3-year-old ninth earl to sell the estate to a local Council, the Brighton Corporation.

The portion of I-480 in Nebraska has been named the Gerald R. Ford Expressway, named in honor of the former President, who was a native of Omaha. For most of its length, I-480 is overlapped by a U.S. Highway; for with U.S. Route 75 and for with U.S. Route 6. I-480 includes the Grenville Dodge Memorial Bridge over the Missouri River. Route description I-480/U.S. Route 75 sign in Omaha Interstate 480 begins at an interchange with Interstate 80 to the east and west and with U.S. Route 75, known as the Kennedy Freeway, to the south. Going north, I-480 passes the Hanscom Park neighborhood to the west and the Vinton Street Commercial Historic District to the east. At exit 1A, I-480 intersects Martha Street, which before January 1, 2003, was the eastern end of Nebraska Highway 38. North of Martha Street, I-480 passes the Gerald R. Ford Birthsite and Gardens. At the Leavenworth Street exit, the highway divides the Leavenworth neighborhood from the Old Market neighborhood. Shortly after the Leavenworth Street exit is the Harney Street exit, which provides access to U.S. Route 6 from eastbound I-480. before the North Freeway interchange, I-480 passes beneath Dodge and Douglas Streets, which are the westbound and eastbound lanes of U.S. 6, respectively. An aerial view of Downtown Omaha with I-480 skirting the northern edge Just to the southwest of the Creighton University campus is the North Freeway interchange, where US 75 leaves eastbound I-480 and joins westbound. The North Freeway was originally planned to be an Interstate Highway, \\"I-580\\", connecting northern Omaha to downtown, but this project was canceled with the interchange in midst of construction. A number of so-called ghost ramps can be found, but these are being eliminated during the reconstruction of this interchange. Here, I-480 turns to the east towards Council Bluffs, Iowa. I-480 passes between the NoDo and Downtown Omaha neighborhoods. Farther east, it dips to the southeast near CenturyLink Center Omaha, part of the \\"NoDo\\" neighborhood. Immediately before crossing the Missouri River, U.S. Route 6 joins I-480 to cross into Iowa. This bridge over the Missouri River was constructed in 1965 ‚Äì 66 to replace the old Ak-Sar-Ben Bridge which had been the first highway bridge across the river in this area. Upon entering Council Bluffs, I-480 meets up with Interstate 29 just from the Missouri River. On the other side of this interchange, I-480 ends where U.S. 6 traffic encounters signal-controlled intersections. History The I-480 bridge over the Missouri River between Council Bluffs, Iowa and Downtown Omaha, Nebraska. In the late 1950s the construction of what was then referred to as Route 3 was highly controversial. It conveniently crossed through the western and northern edges of Downtown Omaha, two areas city leaders had considered \\"blighted\\" since the 1930s. The heavily Catholic, ethnic European neighborhoods the route went through rallied against the demolition of their homes, and the city's parks advocates provided resistance as well. Eventually the Interstate planners won out, and the city's historic Jefferson Square was demolished, as well as dozens of homes along the route. In 1999, a bill was introduced in the United States House of Representatives that would have extended I-480 south along U.S. Highway 75 in southern Omaha and in Bellevue, Nebraska, then east through Plattsmouth to connect with Interstate 29 near Glenwood, Iowa, increasing the length of Interstate 480 to . However, this bill was tabled in the committee. In 2004, the Nebraska Department of Roads began a project to reconstruct the I-480 / US 75 interchange. Work took place in three phases spread out over the course of six years. The final phase of the $52-million ($ in ) project was funded with $13 million ($ in ) in American Recovery & Reinvestment Act stimulus money. The project was completed in May 2011 just in time for the College World Series.

","title":"School of Foreign Service"},{"id":"463326","text":"Thomas Dongan, 2nd Earl of Limerick. Earl of Limerick is a title that has been created twice in the Peerage of Ireland, associated first with the Dongan family, then with the Pery family. First creation The earldom was created for the first time in 1686 for Sir William Dongan, 4th Baronet, with remainder, failing male issue of his own, to his brothers Robert, Michael and Thomas and the heirs male of their bodies. He was made Viscount Dungan, of Clane in the County of Kildare, at the same time, also in the Peerage of Ireland and with similar remainder. His only son Walter Dungan, Viscount Dungan, was killed at the Battle of the Boyne and Lord Limerick was succeeded according to the special remainders (and normally in the baronetcy) by his brother Thomas Dongan, the second Earl. He was Governor of New York from 1683 to 1688. All three titles became extinct on his death in 1715. The Dungan Baronetcy, of Castletown in the County of Kildare, was created in the Baronetage of Ireland in 1623 for Walter Dungan. Second creation The title was created for the second time in 1803 in favour of Edmund Pery, 1st Viscount Limerick. He was the son of the Right Reverend William Pery, Bishop of Limerick from 1784 to 1794. In 1790 the latter was raised to the Peerage of Ireland as Baron Glentworth, of Mallow in the County of Cork. He was succeeded by his only son, the second Baron. He represented Limerick City in the Irish House of Commons and was a supporter of the Union with Great Britain. On 29 December 1800 he was created Viscount Limerick, of the City of Limerick, and on 11 February 1803 he was further honoured when he was made Earl of Limerick, of the County of Limerick. Both titles were in the Peerage of Ireland. Lord Limerick sat in the House of Lords as one of the 28 original Irish Representative Peers from 1800 to 1844. In 1815 he was also created Baron Foxford, of Stackpole Court in the County of Limerick, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. His great-grandson, the third Earl, was a Conservative politician and served as Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard from 1889 to 1892 and from 1895 to 1896. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the fourth Earl. He died without surviving male issue and was succeeded by his half-brother, the fifth Earl. He was a soldier and also served as President of the Medical Research Council between 1952 and 1960. His eldest son, the sixth Earl, was a successful businessman. Lord Limerick also served as Under-Secretary of State of Trade from 1972 to 1974 in the Conservative administration of Edward Heath. As of 2014 the titles are held by his son, the seventh Earl, who succeeded in 2003. Another member of the Pery family was Edmund Pery, 1st Viscount Pery, Speaker of the Irish House of Commons from 1771 to 1785. He was the elder brother of the first Baron Glentworth. The heir to the earldom (improperly) uses the title Viscount Glentworth. The family seat was Dromore Castle, near Pallaskenry, County Limerick.

It consists of four conventional metro lines and three premetro lines. The metro-grade lines are M1, M2, M5, and M6 with some shared sections, covering a total of , with 59 metro-only stations. The premetro network consists of three tram lines (T3, T4, and T7) that partly travel over underground sections that were intended to be eventually converted into metro lines. Underground stations in the premetro network use the same design as metro stations. A few short underground tramway sections exist, so there is a total of of underground metro and tram network. There are a total of 69 metro and premetro stations as of 2011. Most of the common section of the first two metro lines (between De Brouck√®re metro station and Schuman station) was inaugurated on 17 December 1969 as premetro tramways, converted in 1976 to the first two lines of the metro, then considered as one line with two branches, between De Brouck√®re and Tomberg and De Brouck√®re and Beaulieu. The metro is administered by STIB/MIVB (, ). In 2011, the metro was used for 125.8 million journeys, and it was used for 138.3 million journeys in 2012. The metro is an important means of transport, connecting with six railway stations of the National Railway Company of Belgium, and many tram and bus stops operated by STIB/MIVB, and with Flemish De Lijn and Walloon TEC bus stops. On 22 March 2016, Maelbeek metro station was bombed, killing about 20 people and injuring 106. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) claimed responsibility.  History  Development of the Brussels metro up to 2006 STIB/MIVB was created in 1954. The first underground tramway (or premetro) line was built between 1965 and 1969, from Schuman to De Brouck√®re. In 1970 a second line was opened, between Madou and Porte de Namur/Naamsepoort. An underground station at Diamant was opened in 1972 and the \\"outer ring\\" line was extended from Diamant to Boileau in 1975. This underground tramway section has not been developed further, and it is used by tramway lines 7 and 25. Rogier station was inaugurated in 1974. On 20 September 1976 the first metro opened. One branch went from De Brouck√®re to Beaulieu (in Auderghem), and the other one linked De Brouck√®re with Tomberg (in Woluwe-Saint-Lambert). The same year, the North-South Axis (premetro) was opened between the North Station and Lemonnier. In 1977 two new stations were built: Sainte-Catherine/Sint-Katelijne, which replaced De Brouck√®re as the last stop in the municipality of Brussels, and Demey, which replaced Beaulieu as the last stop of the southern branch. The next extension was the opening of stations in Molenbeek-Saint-Jean (Beekkant, the new terminus, Etangs Noirs/Zwarte Vijvers and Comte de Flandre/Graaf van Vlaanderen). In 1982, line 1 was split into line 1A from Bockstael (in Laeken, a former municipality now merged with Brussels) to Demey (Auderghem) and line 1B from Saint-Guidon/Sint- Guido (in Anderlecht) to Alma (at the Universit√© catholique de Louvain campus in Woluwe-Saint-Lambert). Three years later, line 1A was extended to Heysel (near the site of the 1958 World Fair and the Heysel Stadium) at one end and to Herrmann-Debroux at the other. That year also saw the opening of Veeweyde on line 1B, and Louise/Louiza on the premetro line under the small ring (from Louise/Louiza to Rogier). This line was extended to Simonis the next year and opened as metro line 2 in 1988, from Simonis to the South Station. Kraainem/Crainhem and Stockel/Stokkel opened in 1988http://thewordmagazine.com/neighbourhood-life/11-striking-examples-of- subway-art-in-brussels/ on the line 1B. At the other end of this line, Bizet opened in 1992. It was then the turn of line 2 to reach Clemenceau in 1993. The premetro section known as the North-South Axis, sometimes referred to as line 3, was extended to Albert that year with five new premetro stations (South Station, Porte de Hal/Hallepoort, Parvis de Saint-Gilles/Sint-Gillis Voorplein, Horta and Albert). In 1998 Roi Baudouin/King Boudewijn opened on line 1A. Four stations opened in 2003 on line 1B: La Roue/Het Rad, CERIA/COOVI, Eddy Merckx and Erasme/Erasmus.https://structurae.net/en/structures/erasme-metro-station With the opening of Delacroix in September 2006, line 2 was extended beyond Clemenceau. A further extension to Gare de l'Ouest/Weststation in April 2009 closed the loop of line 2 and led to a major restructuring of metro service. On 22 March 2016, the Islamic State bombed Maalbeek metro station in a terrorist attack that coincided with another bomb attack at Brussels Airport. The bombing at Maalbeek station killed twenty people. The incident prompted the temporary closure of the entire system, and a major reduction in service for several weeks. A fundamental review of security procedures on the metro is underway as of 2016. Network map Lines and stations  Brussels metro train at station Rogier There are four conventional metro lines and, , 59 stations (not including premetro stations). Most stations are underground, although some on lines 5 and 6 are at ground level. On 4 April 2009, the connection at Gare de l'Ouest/Weststation that enables line 2 to form a circular line was put into service. As a consequence, the metro network was significantly reorganised. The development plan for this change and related tram and bus network changes was approved by the Brussels Capital Region in July 2005. As of 4 April 2009 the four lines are as follows: * Line 1 from Gare de l'Ouest/Weststation to the west to Stockel/Stokkel at the east end (formerly part of line 1B); * Line 2 is a loop starting and ending in Simonis via the eastern side of the small ring road (an extension of former line 2 from Delacroix north-bound to Simonis); * Line 5 from Erasme/Erasmus to the south-west to Herrmann-Debroux to the south-east (combines parts of former lines 1A and 1B); * Line 6 from Roi Baudouin/Koning Boudewijn to the north- west to Simonis (including the loop of the newly extended line 2; combines the former line 2, the new connection, and a branch of the former line 1A). { class=wikitable style=\\"margin: 1em auto;\\" - style=\\"text-align: center;\\" ! style=\\"width: 25%; border-bottom: 12px solid rgb(185,044,146);\\"  Line 1 (M) ! style=\\"width: 25%; border-bottom: 12px solid rgb(247,142,030);\\"  Line 2 (M) ! style=\\"width: 25%; border-bottom: 12px solid rgb(252,184,020);\\"  Line 5 (M) ! style=\\"width: 25%; border-bottom: 12px solid rgb(000,128,179);\\"  Line 6 (M) - style=\\"vertical-align: top;\\"  * Gare de l'Ouest / Weststation * Stockel / Stokkel  * Simonis * Elisabeth  * Erasme / Erasmus * Herrmann-Debroux  * Roi Baudouin / Koning Boudewijn * Elisabeth } Premetro Line 3 and Line 4 are tram lines using the North-South Axis tunnel which crosses the city center from Brussels-North railway station to Brussels-South railway station and Albert premetro station. Line 3 runs from Churchill in the south to Esplanade in the north. Line 4 runs from Brussels-North railway station to the Stalle car park in the south. Line 7 is the main line of the greater ring, replacing Tram 23 and Tram 24 as of 14 March 2011. It services the Heysel/Heizel, runs under the Laeken Parc and then via the greater ring to the terminus of Line 3 to terminate one stop later at Vanderkindere for connections to tram lines 3, 4 and 92. { class=wikitable style=\\"margin: 1em auto;\\" - style=\\"text-align: center;\\" ! style=\\"width: 33%; border-bottom: 12px solid rgb(195,207,033)\\"  Line 3 (T) ! style=\\"width: 33%; border-bottom: 12px solid rgb(242,111,144)\\"  Line 4 (T) ! style=\\"width: 33%; border-bottom: 12px solid rgb(255,255,005)\\"  Line 7 (T) - style=\\"vertical-align: top;\\"  * Esplanade * Churchill  * Gare du Nord / Noordstation * Stalle car park  * Heysel / Heizel * Vanderkindere }  Ticketing  MoBIB is the STIB/MIVB smart card, introduced in 2007. It uses contactless technology based on the Calypso-system, comparable with London's Oyster card. All Metro stations, buses and trams have MoBIB readers. It is possible to buy monthly passes, yearly passes, 1 and 10-trip tickets and daily and 3-day passes. Customers can now buy these on the Internet with a card reader. GO vending machines accept coins, local and international chip and PIN credit and debit cards.  Rolling stock  M6 \\"Boa\\" train at Erasmus metro station The Brussels Metro is served by 217 carriages of M1-M5 series, manufactured by La Brugeoise et Nivelles, ACEC, Bombardier Transportation, Alstom and CAF and delivered between 1976 and 1999, as well as 21 six-car trainsets of the new M6 series (also known as \\"Boa\\"), manufactured by CAF and delivered between 2007 and 2012. A new train type known as M7 series will be commissioned on lines 1 and 5 in 2018 and will be fully automated. Future The STIB/MIVB had plans to make lines 1 and 5 fully automatic by 2016 which would have allowed a significant increase in the frequency of trains. A new metro line will be created from Brussels-North railway station through Schaerbeek towards Bordet railway station. The plan was finally approved in 2013, aiming to start construction in 2018 and operation in 2022. Eventually, this would be linked up with a new southbound line to Uccle (H√©ros/Helden), which will not be finished before 2025. At this moment, the axis of lines 3 and 4 is being transformed in a new metroline 3. For this, the existing stations will be upgraded. The present station Lemonnier though will be replaced with a new station Constitution/Grondwet.http://www.brusselnieuws.be/nl/nieuws/vergunning- aangevraagd-voor-nieuw-metrostation-grondwet In 2004, STIB/MIVB commissioned a planning document called STIB/MIVB 2020. More suggestions were made as to future plans, but these will not be enacted before completion of the north- and southbound lines. One suggestion included the construction of a new branch from Merode to Troon via Brussels-Luxembourg Station. This would help to relieve congestion on the central parts of Line 1/5. There may be a further metro line running south-west from Brussels-Luxembourg Station to Ixelles, the Chauss√©e de Waterloo/Waterloosesteenweg, and the Place Vanderkindereplein. Brussels-Luxembourg Station would become one of the major transfer points of the metro. The plan also hopes to make the railway stations more inter- connected, allowing for easier transfers from Brussels-South railway station, Schuman station, and Luxembourg. The metro system is complemented by an S-train network serving the broader metropolitan region opened in late 2015.

It is west of Queensland's capital city Brisbane by road. The estimated urban population of Toowoomba as of June 2018 was 136,861, Estimated resident population, 30 June 2018. having grown at an average annual rate of 1.02% year-on-year over the preceding five years. A university and cathedral city, it hosts the Toowoomba Carnival of Flowers each September and national championship events for the sports of mountain biking and motocross. There are more than 150 public parks and gardens in Toowoomba. It has developed into a regional centre for business and finance, being the headquarters for Australia's largest mutual bank; Heritage Bank and various government services. Toowoomba is served by Toowoomba Wellcamp Airport and the smaller Toowoomba City Aerodrome. Toowoomba is the second most populous inland city in the country after the national capital of Canberra and hence the largest town on the Darling Downs. It is also referred to as the capital of the Darling Downs. Geography A panorama of Toowoomba looking south-west from Mount Lofty Toowoomba is on the crest of the Great Dividing Range, around above sea level. A few streets are on the eastern side of the edge of the range, but most of the city is west of the divide. The city occupies the edge of the range and the low ridges behind it. Two valleys run north from the southern boundary, each arising from springs either side of Middle Ridge near Spring Street at an altitude of around 680 m. These waterways, East Creek and West Creek, flow together just north of the CBD to form Gowrie Creek. Gowrie Creek drains to the west across the Darling Downs and is a tributary of the Condamine River, part of the Murray‚ÄìDarling basin. The water flowing down Gowrie Creek makes its way some to the mouth of the Murray River near Adelaide in South Australia. Rain which falls on the easternmost streets of Toowoomba flows east to Moreton Bay a distance of around . The rich volcanic soil in the region helps maintain the 150 public parks that are scattered across the city. Jacaranda, camphor laurel and plane trees line many of the city streets. The city's reputation as 'The Garden City' is highlighted during the Australian Carnival of Flowers festival held in September each year. Deciduous trees from around the world line many of the parks, giving a display of autumn colour. Suburbs The City of Toowoomba includes the following suburbs: * Centenary Heights * Cotswold Hills2 * Cranley * Darling Heights * Drayton * East Toowoomba * Glenvale2 * Harlaxton * Harristown * Kearneys Spring * Middle Ridge * Mount Kynoch * Mount Lofty * Newtown * North Toowoomba * Prince Henry Heights * Rangeville * Redwood * Rockville * South Toowoomba * Toowoomba City (the city centre) * Torrington2 * Wilsonton * Wilsonton Heights 2 \\\\- from former Shire of Jondaryan History Main Street of Toowoomba in 1897.  Traditional owners  Giabal and Jarowair are recognised as the two main Aboriginal language groups of the Toowoomba with Giabal extending south of the city while Jarowair extends north of the city. The Jarowair (also known as Yarowair, Yarow-wair, Barrunggam, Yarrowair, Yarowwair and Yarrow-weir) language region includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of the Toowoomba Regional Council, particularly Toowoomba north to Crows Nest and west to Oakey. This traditional landscape changed dramatically with the settlement of Drayton in the 1840s and the pastoral expansion west. Those Aboriginal Australians that survived the frontier conflict of this time were pushed to the fringe of society in camps and later moved to missions such as Deebing Creek, Durundur and later Barambah (now Cherbourg). There is evidence that local Aboriginal Australians were working on the properties to the west of Toowoomba in this contact period. Ceremonies such as the Bonye Bonye festival remained active until the late 19th century ‚Äì groups from south east and south west Queensland as well as northern New South Wales gathered at Gummingurru, near Gowrie (west of Toowoomba) prior to attending the festival. The Gummingurru site is being restored and remains an important ceremonial place for not only the traditional groups but neighbouring groups.  European exploration and settlement  Toowoomba's colonial history traces back to 1816 when English botanist and explorer Allan Cunningham arrived in Australia from Brazil and in June 1827 discovered of rich farming and grazing land, which became known as the Darling Downs, bordered on the east by the Great Dividing Range and west of the settlement of Moreton Bay. Thirteen years later when George and Patrick Leslie established Toolburra Station south-west of Toowoomba the first settlers arrived on the Downs and established a township of bark-slab shops called The Springs which was soon renamed Drayton. Land for the town was first surveyed in 1849, then again in 1853. Towards the end of the 1840s Drayton had grown to the point where it had its own newspaper, general store, trading post and the Royal Bull's Head Inn, which was built by William Horton and still stands today. Horton is regarded as the true founder of Toowoomba despite not being the first European person to live there. Drovers and wagon masters spread the news of the new settlement at Toowoomba. By 1858 Toowoomba was growing fast. It had a population of 700, three hotels and many stores. Land selling at in 1850 was by then . Governor Bowen granted the wish of locals and a new municipality was proclaimed on 24 November 1860. The first town council election took place on 4 January 1861 and William Henry Groom won. The railway from Ipswich was opened in 1867, bringing with it business development. In 1892, the Under Secretary of Public Land proclaimed Toowoomba and the surrounding areas as a township and in 1904 Toowoomba was declared a city. Pastoralism replaced agriculture and dairying by the 1900s. In July 1902, 80 subdivided allotments of \\"The Lilley Estate\\" owned by the late Sir Charles Lilley, were advertised to be auctioned by Scholefield & Godsall. A map advertising the auction shows that the estate was bordered by Bridge, Mary and Lindsay Streets and overlooking and adjoining the Royal Agricultural Society's Showgrounds. The Rotary Club of Toowoomba was established in 1930. Toowoomba was named as Australia's Tidiest Town in 2008. Climate Toowoomba has a warm humid subtropical climate (Cfa) with warm summers and cool winters. Compared to other parts of Queensland, Toowoomba experiences more frequent high winds, hail and fog and is considered cooler than many other towns and cities in Queensland, having more similarities with the climate of Sydney in southern New South Wales. The city is rather sunny, receiving 107.2 clear days annually. Daily maximum temperatures in Toowoomba average in summer and in winter. Unlike most of inland Queensland, summer temperatures above are uncommon, whilst winter days rarely warm above . Winter nights seldom drop below freezing; however, in a situation unique among Queensland cities, snow has been reported on the higher parts of the city on several occasions. Light frost will be experienced several nights each winter in the city centre, more often in the western suburbs. According to the Bureau of Meteorology, the highest temperature ever recorded in Toowoomba was on 12 February 2017, while the lowest was on 12 July 1965. Average annual rainfall, according to the Bureau of Meteorology, is , which peaks in the warm season. Rainfall in the eastern suburbs along the Great Dividing Range nudges per year. The majority of Toowoombas rain falls from November to March, with January and February being the peak rainy months. Like most of south-east Queensland, severe thunderstorms can be a threat and Toowoomba may occasionally be affected by ex-tropical cyclones.  2011 flood  On 10 January 2011, Toowoomba suffered a catastrophic flash flood. Unusually heavy rainfall had occurred in the preceding days, causing the city's waterways to become swollen. Around midday, an intense storm moved in from the northeast, completely overwhelming East Creek and West Creek which run through the CBD. fell in one day with rainfall peaking at over one 10-minute interval. The flood caused damage to properties and infrastructure, and resulted in the deaths of 2 people in Toowoomba. Architecture and Heritage St. James Church of England during construction in 1869 New and old buildings in Ruthven Street, Toowoomba CBD Toowoomba's history has been preserved in its buildings. Examples of architecture drawing from the city's wealthy beginnings include Toowoomba City Hall which was Queensland's first purpose-built town hall, the National Trust Royal Bull's Head Inn and many examples in the heritage-listed Russell Street. Immediately to the east of the CBD is the Caledonian Estate, an area of turn-of-the-20th-century housing, ranging from humble workers cottages to large stately homes, in the classic wooden Queenslander style. Toowoomba is also home to the Empire Theatre, which was originally opened in June 1911, as a silent movie house. In February 1933, fire broke out, almost completely destroying the building. However, the Empire was rebuilt and reopened in November 1933. The architectural styling of the new Empire Theatre was art deco, in keeping with the trend of the 1930s. After years of neglect, the Empire Theatre was extensively renovated in the late 1990s, but retains much of its art deco architecture and decorations, especially the proscenium arch. Able to seat approximately 1,500 people, the Empire Theatre is now the largest regional theatre in Australia. The city also is home to the Cobb & Co Museum, hailing to the famous mail company's beginnings as a small mail run in the 1800s to transport mail and passengers to Brisbane and beyond. It also houses Australia's largest collection of horse-drawn vehicles. The museum has undergone a A$8 million redevelopment before reopening in September 2010. Heritage listings Toowoomba has many heritage-listed sites, with over fifty on the Queensland Heritage Register in addition to listings on other local heritage registers. Governance Toowoomba is the seat of the Toowoomba Region local government area. The city is represented in the Parliament of Queensland by three seats: Toowoomba North, Toowoomba South and Condamine. In the Commonwealth Parliament, Toowoomba forms part of the Division of Groom, which is held by John McVeigh for the Liberal National Party of Queensland. The current Mayor of Toowoomba is Mayor Paul Antonio. Antonio was fined nearly $15,000 after he was found to have engaged in misconduct in his dealings with the Melbourne-to-Brisbane Inland Railway project where Mayor Antonio personally paid $4,900 to have an alternate route for the project investigated, which took the line to the very edge of his quarry.  Crime  Toowoomba has had a large amount of crime over the past years, but is still on average less than other parts of Queensland. It is well known for its many drug offences and stolen cars. Just recently in the December 2018 holidays, Toowoomba experienced the highest surge of stolen cars in 18 years. In 2018, the Royal Automobile Club of Queensland described Toowoomba as \\"one of Queensland's car theft hot spots\\", noting that there were insurance claims for over 3,000 cars stolen over a three year period from Harristown alone. Economy  The Australian Defence Force is also present in the local community, with the city providing housing and amenities for many of the personnel based at the Oakey Army Aviation Centre (in Oakey, NW of Toowoomba) and Borneo Barracks at Cabarlah to the city's North.

Culture=Festivals The annual Flower Festival is a chance to show off Toowoomba's parks and gardens at their best The Alfred Thomas Memorial in Queens Park during the Carnival of Flowers Toowoomba is nationally renowned for the annual Carnival of Flowers, held each year in September. Many of the city's major parks and gardens are especially prepared for the carnival, including an important home garden competition and parade of flower floats. Buses bring people from around the nation, and a popular way to arrive at the carnival from Brisbane is on chartered antique steam and diesel trains, which captures the yester-year aspect of travel to Toowoomba with 19th-century wooden carriages. In 1953 the Carnival of Flowers was the subject of a sponsored film produced by the Queensland Minister for Lands and Irrigation. The Carnival of Flowers depicts the floral parade, the home gardens competition and the crowning of the Floral Queen and is a wonderful portrait of life in 1950s Queensland. In 2009 as part of the Q150 celebrations, Carnival of Flowers was announced as one of the Q150 Icons of Queensland for its role as an \\"Events and festivals\\". The Toowoomba Carnival of Flowers received the Gold Award for Major Festival and Event at the Queensland Tourism Awards in 2015, 2016 & 2017, and Australian Tourism Awards in 2016 & 2017\\\\. In 2017, 255,639 people recorded as having attended the event Toowoomba also hosts 'First Coat Art and Music Festival'. First Coat is a street art festival, held annually in May. As a result of the festival, over 50 pieces of large-scale, public art exist throughout the Toowoomba CBD, which has led to a transformation of previously underutilised lane and alleyways, as well as a reduction in costs associated with graffiti management. Toowoomba was previously home to Easterfest (which was held annually over the Easter weekend.) The event has not continued after 2015. The \\"Food and Wine Festival\\", which usually spans for 3 days, happens every year at Carnival of flowers time . It provides entertainment, food and drinks and is a spectacle of the Carnival.

Water Toowoomba's third water storage Cressbrook Dam was completed in 1983 and supplied water to Toowoomba in 1988. It has a full capacity of about bringing total capacity of the three dams, Cooby, Perseverance, and Cressbrook, to . The city also has underground supplies in fractured basalt of the rock unit known as the Main Range Volcanics. Toowoomba also sits above the eastern edge of the Great Artesian Basin and to the west underground water is available beneath unconsolidated alluvium. Rainfall during the period from 1998 to 2005 was 30% below the long term average, consistent with a prolonged drought; with this trend continuing through to the spring of 2007. In mid-2005, the water situation for the city was becoming critical with water supply levels below 30%. Environmental flows from Cressbrook Dam into Cressbrook Creek were allowed to cease as Toowoomba approached level five water restrictions. During March 2006 the surface water storage in the dams fell below 25% of full capacity, falling further to 12.8% on 10 March 2008 and reaching an all-time low of 7.7% in December 2009. The former Toowoomba Mayor Di Thorley proposed a controversial potable reuse project under the Toowoomba Water Futures plan which would result in water reclaimed from the Wetalla Sewage Treatment Plant being returned to Cooby Dam to provide 25% of the potable water supply for Toowoomba. Other water supply options include importing water from Oakey Creek Groundwater Management Area (average TDS 1660 mg/L), importing water from Condamine Groundwater Management Area (average TDS 740 mg/L), and water from coal seam gas production (TDS 1200‚Äì4300 mg/L).Water Future . Toowoomba City Council. Retrieved 3 August 2014. The Duke and Duchess of York, with Mayor James Douglas Annand in Toowoomba, 1927. On 29 July 2006, Toowoomba City Council conducted a poll of Toowoomba residents on the proposal to use this multi-barrier filtration system for filtering sewage for drinking purposes. The poll question was: \\"Do you support the addition of purified recycled water to Toowoomba's water supply via Cooby Dam as proposed by Water Futures ‚Äì Toowoomba?\\" 38% of voters supported the proposal and 62% opposed. This meant that despite dams reaching critical levels, the city rejected the use of recycled water in a plebiscite. Since the public rejection in 2006 of adding recycled sewage to the drinking water supply, water conservation measures have included harvesting stormwater for use in public parks and adding filtered groundwater to the town water supply. The city was under level 5 water restrictions as of 26 September 2006. This prohibits residents from using town water on their lawns, gardens or cars, and residents are strongly urged to cut down on water consumption. In 2007, the Toowoomba City Council commenced a bore drilling program to augment the dwindling dam supplies and constructed several subartesian bores across the city and one artesian bore at Wetalla in the city's north. Many of the subartesian bores provided potable water with a reliable yield and have been developed into production however the artesian bore's water quality was very poor, prohibiting development as a potable source. This was an expensive setback for the city as the cost was over A$2 million for drilling to over . In January 2008, yield testing had been stalled due to the unavailability of appropriate pumping equipment. The Toowoomba Regional Council began supplementing the city's water supply with bore water from the Great Artesian Basin in September 2009. Groundwater has become a significant contributor to the city's water supply needs and now constitutes one third of the total volume of water treated for reticulated supply ( per week). The state government has built a $187 million pipeline from Wivenhoe Dam to Toowoomba. Water pumping along the pipeline to Cressbrook Dam began in January 2010.

It is native to the tropics, subtropics and temperate zones of the Afrotropics. Its range was formerly considered to include Asia, but the Asian species is now called the black drongo (Dicrurus macrocercus). Range and habitat The fork-tailed drongo is a common and widespread resident breeder in Africa south of the Sahara. These insect-eating birds are usually found in open forests or bush, and are tolerant of arid climates. Description The fork-tailed drongo is 25 cm long and has short legs. They are medium sized and usually weigh about 50 grams. Males are mainly glossy black, although their wings are duller. Females are similar but less glossy. It is large-headed with well- developed rictal and nasal bristles, which are used as sensory organs. The rectrices curve outwards, forming the forked tail for which the species is named. The hooked bill is black and heavy, and the eye is red. Calls The call is a metallic '. The fork-tailed drongo uses alarm calls to steal food from birds and animals such as meerkats. They make drongo-specific calls as well as mimicked calls. The mimicked calls help them while they target other animals that are eating food. The animals flee, and leave their food. Once they are gone, the drongo steals it. Vocal at dawn and dusk.  Behavior  They still-hunt by sitting very upright on a prominent perch, much like a shrike. They are usually solitary and form monogamous breeding pairs. They are aggressive and fearless, regularly mobbing or attacking much larger species, including birds of prey, if their nest or young are threatened or their territory is compromised. They also join mixed foraging bird parties, and will initiate mobbing of common enemies. To maintain their plumage condition they may rain-bathe, foliage-bathe or plunge-dive into water. Terrestrial foragers like babblers may use the drongo as a sentry. Feeding They are almost exclusively carnivorous, but may take nectar when available. They flycatch or take prey from the ground, and are attracted to bush fires. They also utilize disturbance caused by animals, and may perch on their backs. At times they catch ectoparasites on mammals, plunge-dive to catch fish, or kleptoparasitise mammals or birds. Kleptoparasitism Observations show that the fork- tailed drongo in Africa are capable of using deceptive mimicked alarm calls to steal food from birds like pied babblers and animals such as meerkats. Tom Flower observed that fork-tailed drongos spend a quarter of their time following other animals. Drongos sometimes act as sentries when a predator is approaching, warning their neighbours with genuine alarm calls. But drongos also earn a quarter of their daily calories by sounding a false alarm when another animal finds food. When the meerkats and babblers flee from the non- existent predator, the drongo steals their food. Though in doubt, researchers have considered the possibility that these drongos possess theory of mind, not fully shown in any animal other than humans. Nesting Two to four eggs are laid in a cup nest in a fork high in a tree. Drongos are brood hosts for African Cuckoos and Jacobin Cuckoos. Races Its populations are genetically highly structured, and four races are accepted. The races D. a. modestus (Pr√≠ncipe) together with D. a. coracinus and D. a. atactus (Bioko to west and central mainland Africa, from Guinea east to western Kenya and south to Angola) are usually split as a separate species, the velvet-mantled drongo, D. modestus (Hartlaub, 1849). * D. a. apivorus Clancey, 1976 ::Range: Gabon, Congo Republic, DRC, Angola, northwestern Zambia, Namibia, Botswana and northwestern South Africa ::Description: primary remiges with brown outer vanes and pale inner vanes (noticeable while perched and in flight respectively) ::Habitat: Arid savanna * D. a. fugax W.K.H.Peters, 1868 ::Range: Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania and Zanzibar, southeastern Zambia, Malawi, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Botswana, eastern Eswatini and northeastern South Africa ::Description: Smaller than nominate, outer vanes of primaries brown, and inner vanes dark * D. a. adsimilis (Bechstein, 1794) ::Range: western Eswatini, Lesotho and eastern to southern South Africa ::Description: Darker remiges, especially noticeable in flight * D. a. jubaensis van Someren, 1931 ::Range: Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Somalia Gallery File:Fork-tailed Drongo, Dicrurus adsimilis, at Mapungubwe National Park, Limpopo, South Africa (18214043114).jpgView of pronounced rictal and nasal bristles and deep red eye File:Fork-tailed Drongo, Dicrurus adsimilis at Marakele National Park, South Africa (7745670048).jpgThe western race D. a. apivorus has brown edges to the primaries, and occurs in dry woodlands of southwestern Africa File:Fork-tailed Drongo (Dicrurus adsimilis) (16324315529).jpgEastern race D. a. fugax is somewhat smaller than the nominate File:Dicrurus adsimilis 6.jpgImmature D. a. adsimilis with dusky primaries ReferencesFurther reading * African Bird Club (2006) ABC African Checklist: Passerines.

Earl of Powis (Powys) is a title that has been created three times. The first creation came in the Peerage of England in 1674 in favour of William Herbert, 3rd Baron Powis, a descendant of William Herbert, 1st Earl of Pembroke (c. 1501‚Äì1570). In 1687, he was further honoured when he was made (and as detailed at the article of) Marquess of Powis. The title was created again in 1748 in the Peerage of Great Britain for Henry Arthur Herbert, the husband of Barbara, daughter of Lord Edward Herbert, brother of William, 3rd Marquess of Powis. He notably represented Bletchingley and Ludlow in Parliament and served as Lord Lieutenant of Montgomeryshire and Shropshire. Herbert had already been created Baron Herbert of Chirbury in 1743 and was made Baron Powis and Viscount Ludlow at the same time he was given the earldom. In 1749 he was also created Baron Herbert of Chirbury and Ludlow, with remainder firstly to his brother Richard Herbert and secondly to his kinsman Francis Herbert, of Ludlow. His son, the second Earl, was also Lord Lieutenant of Montgomeryshire and Shropshire. However, on his death in 1801 all the titles became extinct (the persons in remainder to the 1749 barony had died without heirs before the 2nd Earl). The title was created for the third time in the Peerage of the United Kingdom in 1804 when Edward Clive, 2nd Baron Clive, (being son-in-law of the 1st Earl of the previous creation) was made Earl of Powis, in the County of Montgomeryshire. He had previously represented Ludlow in the House of Commons and served as Lord Lieutenant of Shropshire and Montgomeryshire. Clive was the husband of Lady Henrietta, daughter of the 1st Earl of Powis of the 1748 creation and sister and heiress of the 2nd Earl. He had already been created Baron Clive, of Walcot in the County of Shropshire, in 1794, in the Peerage of Great Britain, and was made Baron Powis, of Powis Castle in the County of Montgomery, Baron Herbert, of Chirbury in the County of Shropshire, and Viscount Clive, of Ludlow in the County of Shropshire, at the same time he was given the earldom. Clive was the son of the famous soldier Robert Clive, who had been raised to the Peerage of Ireland as Baron Clive of Plassey in the County of Clare, in 1762. Known as \\"Clive of India\\", he is regarded as a key figure in the establishment of British India. The 1st Earl was succeeded by his eldest son, the 2nd Earl. He sat as Member of Parliament for Ludlow and served as Lord Lieutenant of Montgomeryshire. In 1807, Lord Powis assumed by Royal licence the surname and arms of Herbert. His son, the 3rd Earl, represented Shropshire North in Parliament and served as Lord Lieutenant of Montgomeryshire. He was succeeded by his nephew, the 4th Earl. He was the son of Lieutenant-General The Rt Hon. Sir Percy Egerton Herbert, second son of the 2nd Earl. Lord Powis was Lord Lieutenant of Shropshire. In 1890, he married Violet Ida Evelyn Herbert (who later became, in 1903, The 16th Baroness Darcy de Knayth, suo jure). Their eldest son Percy Robert Herbert, Viscount Clive, died of wounds received fighting in the Battle of the Somme; their second son Mervyn Horatio Herbert, Viscount Clive, succeeded his mother in the barony on her death in 1929. However, he too predeceased his father and was succeeded in the barony by his daughter Davina as the suo jure 18th Baroness Darcy de Knayth. Lord Powis was succeeded by his first cousin once removed, the 5th Earl. He was the son of the Hon. Colonel Edward William Herbert, son of the Hon. Robert Charles Herbert, fourth son of the second Earl. On his death the titles passed to his younger brother, the 6th Earl. He was succeeded by his second cousin, the 7th Earl. He was the son of the Right Reverend Percy Mark Herbert, Bishop of Blackburn and of Norwich, son of Major-General the Hon. William Henry Herbert, fifth son of the second Earl. the peerages are held by his son, the 8th Earl, who succeeded in 1993. Lord Powis is also Lord of the Manor of Clun. The Hon. Robert Henry Clive, second son of the 1st Earl, married Harriett Windsor (later Baroness Windsor), in 1819. Their grandson Robert Windsor-Clive, 14th Baron Windsor, was created Earl of Plymouth in 1905. Consequently, the present holder of the Earldom of Plymouth is also in remainder to the Earldom of Powis and its subsidiary titles. George Windsor-Clive, second son of the Hon. Robert Henry Clive and Lady Windsor, was Member of Parliament for Ludlow for many years. Another branch of the Clive family was founded by Reverend Benjamin Clive, uncle of the 1st Baron Clive. Members of this branch include George Clive, Edward Clive, George Clive, Edward Clive, Sir Sidney Clive and Sir Robert Clive. The family seat is Powis Castle, near Welshpool, Montgomeryshire, Wales.

He was the first to describe the shape of the Milky Way and to speculate that faint nebulae were distant galaxies. Early life Wright was born at Byers Green in County Durham being the third son of John and Margaret Wright of Pegg's Poole House.Thomas Wright, Durham University Library, Archives and Special Collections His father was a carpenter.History and characteristics of Bishop Auckland by Matthew Richley He was educated at home as he suffered from speech impediment and then at King James I Academy. In 1725 he entered into clock-making apprenticeship to Bryan Stobart of Bishop Auckland, continuing to study on his own. He also took courses on mathematics and navigation at a free school in the parish of Gateshead founded by Dr. Theophilus Pickering. Then, he went to London to study mathematical instrument-making with Heath and Sisson and made a trial sea voyage to Amsterdam. In 1730, he set up a school in Sunderland, where he taught mathematics and navigation.Biographical History of Mr. Thomas Wright, The Gentleman's Magazine, January 1793, Volume 73, p. 9. He later moved back to London to work on a number of projects for his wealthy patrons. That was before retiring to County Durham and building a small observatory at Westerton.Wright's observatory/folly at alt= Astronomy Wright's publication An original theory or new hypothesis of the Universe (1750) explained the appearance of the Milky Way as \\"an optical effect due to our immersion in what locally approximates to a flat layer of stars.\\"Thomas Wright, An Original Theory or New Hypothesis of the Universe‚Ä¶ (London, England: H. Chapelle, 1750). From p.48: \\"...the stars are not infinitely dispersed and distributed in a promiscuous manner throughout all the mundane space, without order or design,... this ph√¶nomenon [is] no other than a certain effect arising from the observer's situation,.... To a spectator placed in an indefinite space,... it [i.e., the Milky Way (Via Lactea)] [is] a vast ring of stars.‚Ä¶ \\" His idea was taken up and elaborated by Immanuel Kant in his Universal Natural History and Theory of the Heavens, and later empirically advanced by William Herschel in 1785, leading to galactocentrism (a form of heliocentrism, with the Sun at the center of the Milky Way). Another of his ideas, which is also often attributed to Kant, was that many faint nebulae are actually incredibly distant galaxies. Wright wrote:Wright (1750), pages 83-84.quoted from An original theory or new hypothesis of the universe by Freeman Dyson, Disturbing the Universe, 1979, pg 245, Kant termed these \\"island universes.\\" However \\"scientific arguments were marshalled against such a possibility,\\" and this view was rejected by almost all scientists until 1924, when Edwin Hubble showed \\"spiral nebulae\\" were distant galaxies by measuring Cepheids. In his letters, Wright emphasised the possible enormity of the universe, and the tranquility of eternity:Wright (1750), page 76. Wright's grand orrery He was also credited with expanding the Grand Orrery to include Saturn. The orrery is now at the Science Museum, London. Garden design Wright has been credited with work for William Capel, 3rd Earl of Essex at Cassiobury Park in Watford, illustrating his designs in A Walk in Cassiobury Gardens and Views of Cassiobury. In Grotesque Architecture of 1767 there is a design for a rockwork bridge to decorate \\"the fine piece of water\\" he had \\"with great pleasure seen... at Cassiobury\\", believed to be by Wright. A man of talents, he also gave the Earl's daughters mathematical instruction. Another patron was the Earl of Halifax, at Horton House. In the 1750s, he laid out the grounds of Netheravon House, Wiltshire and after 1753, completed the design and construction of Horton Hall in Northamptonshire and gardens. He designed in 1769 the folly or eye-catcher known as Codger Fort at Rothley, Northumberland, on the Wallington Hall estate. One of the largest existing examples of Wright's work is the Stoke Park Estate. . The estate was remodelled by Wright between 1748 and 1766.  Death  Wright died in 1786 in Byers Green and was buried in the churchyard of St Andrew's, South Church, Bishop Auckland. He was survived by his illegitimate daughter.

It was created on 20 November 1805 for the Rev. William Nelson, 2nd Baron Nelson, one month after the death of his younger brother Vice-Admiral Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson, the famous naval hero of the Napoleonic Wars and victor of the Battle of Trafalgar of 21 October 1805 (during which he was killed in action). The title is extant, the present holder being Simon Nelson, 10th Earl Nelson, who has an heir apparent. The family seat of Trafalgar House in Wiltshire (also known as Standlynch Park) was sold in 1948 by Edward Nelson, 5th Earl Nelson. History The title was created on 20 November 1805 for the Reverend William Nelson, 2nd Baron Nelson, who was a son of the Reverend Edmund Nelson (1722‚Äì1802) and an elder brother of Horatio Nelson. The Nelson family had been settled in Norfolk for many generations, and the Reverend Edmund Nelson was Rector of Hillborough and of Burnham Thorpe in that county. He married Catherine Suckling, whose maternal grandmother Mary was the sister of both The 1st Earl of Orford and The 1st Baron Walpole of Wolterton. Their fifth but third-surviving son was the renowned naval commander Horatio Nelson. After defeating the French at the Battle of the Nile in 1798, Horatio Nelson was raised to the Peerage of Great Britain on 6 November 1798 as Baron Nelson, of the Nile, and of Burnham Thorpe in the County of Norfolk, with normal remainder to the heirs male of his body. In 1799, he was created Duke of Bront√© (Italian: Duca di Bronte), of the Kingdom of Sicily, by King Ferdinand, which title he was given royal sanction to use in Britain. After defeating the Danish fleet at the Battle of Copenhagen in April 1801, Nelson was further honoured when he was made Viscount Nelson, of the Nile, and of Burnham Thorpe in the County of Norfolk, with normal remainder to the heirs male of his body, on 22 May 1801. On 18 August of the same year, he was created Baron Nelson, of the Nile, and of Hillborough in the County of Norfolk, with remainder, in default of male issue of his own, to his father and the heirs male of his body, and failing them to the heirs male of the body severally and successively of his sisters Mrs Susannah Bolton and Mrs Catherine Matcham. Both titles were in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. Nelson was killed at the Battle of Trafalgar on 21 October 1805. Since he had no legitimate children, the barony of 1798 and the viscountcy became extinct upon his death. He was succeeded in the barony of 1801 according to the special remainder (and also in the dukedom of Bront√©) by his elder brother the Reverend William Nelson, who became the second Baron. On 20 November 1805, the second Baron was created Viscount Merton, of Trafalgar and of Merton in the County of Surrey, and Earl Nelson, of Trafalgar and of Merton in the County of Surrey, in honour of his late brother and with similar remainder to the barony of 1801. Both titles are in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. The first Earl died without surviving male issue and was succeeded in the dukedom of Bront√© by his daughter Charlotte, wife of The 2nd Baron Bridport. The first Earl was succeeded in the British titles (according to the special remainders) by his nephew Thomas Bolton, the second Earl. He was the eldest son of the aforementioned Susannah Bolton, a sister of the first Earl and the wife of Thomas Bolton of Wells in Norfolk. The second Earl assumed the surname of Nelson upon succeeding to the peerages. He only held the titles for eight months and on his early death, the titles passed to his eldest son, the third Earl. He was succeeded by his third but eldest surviving son, the fourth Earl. He never married and on his death in 1947, the titles passed to his eighty-seven-year-old younger brother, the fifth Earl. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the sixth Earl, who was a lecturer in astronomy and anthropology. Two of his younger brothers, the seventh and eighth Earls, both succeeded in the titles. , the peerages are held by Simon John Horatio Nelson, 10th Earl Nelson (born 1971), a great-grandson of the fifth Earl. He succeeded in 2009 and is the eldest son of Peter John Horatio Nelson, the ninth Earl. Two other members of the family also had distinguished naval careers. The Hon. Maurice Horatio Nelson (1832‚Äì1914), third son of the second Earl, was a Rear-Admiral in the Royal Navy. His eldest son, Maurice Henry Horatio Nelson (1864‚Äì1942), was a Captain in the Royal Navy. Coat of arms Contemporary drawing of the heraldic achievement of Admiral Horatio Nelson before Trafalgar Arms of William Nelson, 1st Earl Nelson, displaying the additional augmentation that he was granted Arms were granted to Admiral Horatio Nelson and confirmed on 20 October 1797. Nelson's paternal arms (Or, a cross patonce sable over all a bendlet gules) were augmented to honour his naval victories. After the Battle of Cape St Vincent (14 February 1797), Nelson was created a Knight of the Bath and was granted heraldic supporters (appropriate for peers) of a sailor and a lion.Adkin 2007, p. 550 In honour of the Battle of the Nile in 1798, the Crown granted him an augmentation of honour blazoned: On a chief wavy argent a palm tree between a disabled ship and a ruinous battery all issuant from waves of the sea all proper\\", the Latin motto Palmam qui meruit ferat (\\"let him who has earned it bear the palm\\"), and added to his supporters a palm branch in the hand of the sailor and the paw of the lion, and a \\"tri-colored flag and staff in the mouth of the latter\\". After Nelson's death, his elder brother and heir William Nelson, 1st Earl Nelson, was granted the further augmentation: On a fess wavy overall azure the word TRAFALGAR or.

A primary hydrocele causes a painless enlargement in the scrotum on the affected side and is thought to be due to the defective absorption of fluid secreted between the two layers of the tunica vaginalis (investing membrane). A secondary hydrocele is secondary to either inflammation or a neoplasm in the testis. A hydrocele usually occurs on one side, but can also affect both sides. The accumulation can be a marker of physical trauma, infection, tumor or varicocele surgery, but the cause is generally unknown. Indirect inguinal hernia indicates increased risk of hydrocele. Hydroceles are more common in boys than girls. A hydrocele is normally seen in infant boys as an enlarged scrotum. In infant girls it appears as enlarged labia. Signs and symptoms A hydrocele feels like a small fluid-filled balloon inside the scrotum. It is smooth, and is mainly in front of the testis. Hydroceles vary greatly in size and are typically painless and harmless. However, as the fluid continues to accumulate and the scrotum further enlarges, more discomfort can be expected. Large hydroceles will cause discomfort because of their size. Sometimes pain can be in both testicles as pressure from the enlarged area puts pressure against the unaffected area which can cause discomfort to the normal testicle. It has also been found to decrease a man's sex drive and makes him less active for fear of enlarging the mass. As the fluid of a hydrocele is transparent, light shone through the hydrocelic region will be visible from the other side. This phenomenon is called transillumination. Symptoms of a hydrocele can easily be distinguished from testicular cancer, as a hydrocele is soft and fluid-filled, whereas testicular cancer feels hard and rough. Fertility A hydrocele testis is not generally thought to affect fertility. However, it may be indicative of other factors that may affect fertility. Cause During embryogenesis, the testis descends through the inguinal canal, drawing a diverticulum of peritoneum into the scrotum as it descends. This peritoneal tissue is known as the processus vaginalis. Normally, the communication between the processus vaginalis and the peritoneum is obliterated, and the tunica vaginalis is the tissue that remains overlying the testis and the epididymis. Congenital hydrocele results when the processus vaginalis remains, allowing fluid from the peritoneum to accumulate in the scrotum. Diagnosis Scrotal ultrasound of a 1 dm large hydrocele, with anechoic (dark) fluid surrounding the testicle. Communicating hydrocele, caused by the failure of the processus vaginalis closure. Through diagnostic ultrasound the accumulation of fluids can be diagnosed correctly. Treatment The fluid accumulation can be drained by aspiration, but this may be only temporary. A more permanent alternative is a surgical procedure, generally, an outpatient ambulatory (same-day) procedure, called a hydrocelectomy. There are two surgical techniques available for hydrocelectomy. ; Hydrocelectomy with Excision of the Hydrocele Sac: Incision of the hydrocele sac after complete mobilization of the hydrocele. Partial resection of the hydrocele sac, leaving a margin of 1‚Äì2 cm. Care is taken not to injure testicular vessels, epididymis or ductus deferens. The edge of the hydrocele sac is oversewn for hemostasis (von Bergmann's technique) or the edges are sewn together behind the spermatic cord (Winkelmann's or Jaboulay's technique). Hydrocele surgery with excision of the hydrocele sac is useful for large or thick-walled hydroceles and multilocular hydroceles. ; Hydrocele Surgery with Plication of the Hydrocele Sac: The hydrocele is opened with a small skin incision without further preparation. The hydrocele sac is reduced (plicated) by suture Hydrocele surgery: Lord's technique. The plication technique is suitable for medium-sized and thin-walled hydroceles. The advantage of the plication technique is the minimized dissection with a reduced complication rate.Ku u.a. 2001 KU, J. H.; KIM, M. E.; LEE, N. K.; PARK, Y. H.:The excisional, plication and internal drainage techniques: a comparison of the results for idiopathic hydrocele.In: BJU Int 87 (2001), Nr. 1, S. 82‚Äì4 If the hydrocele is not surgically removed, it may continue to grow. The hydrocele fluid can be aspirated. This procedure can be done in a urologist's office or clinic and is less invasive but, recurrence rates are high. Sclerotherapy, the injection of a solution following aspiration of the hydrocele fluid may increase success rates. In many patients, the procedure of aspiration and sclerotherapy is repeated as the hydrocele recurs.

Tomb of Chikamatsu at Kousai Temple In those days, doctors who served the daimy≈çs held samurai status. But Chikamatsu's father lost his office and became a r≈çnin, a masterless samurai. At some point in his teens, between 1664 and 1670, Chikamatsu moved to Kyoto with his father. where he served for a few years as an obscure page for a noble family, but other than that, little is known about this period of Chikamatsu's life. He published his first known literary work in this period, a haiku that appeared in 1671. After serving as a page, he next appears in records of the Gonsh≈ç-ji (ËøëÊùæÂØ∫) temple (long suggested as the origin of his pen name \\"Chikamatsu\\", which is kun reading of ËøëÊùæ) in ≈åmi Province, in present-day Shiga Prefecture. With the production in 1683 of his puppet play in Kyoto about the Soga brothers (The Soga Successors or \\"The Soga Heir\\"; Yotsugi Soga), Chikamatsu became known as a playwright. The Soga Successors is believed to have been Chikamatsu's first play although sometimes 15 earlier anonymous plays are contended to have been by Chikamatsu as well. Chikamatsu also wrote plays for the kabuki theatre between 1684 and 1695, most of which were intended to be performed by a famous actor of the day, Sakata T≈çj≈´r≈ç (1647‚Äì1709). After 1695, and until 1705, Chikamatsu wrote almost exclusively Kabuki plays, and then he abruptly almost completely abandoned that genre. The exact reason is unknown, although speculation is rife: perhaps the puppets were more biddable and controllable than the ambitious kabuki actors, or perhaps Chikamatsu did not feel kabuki worth writing for since T≈çj≈´r≈ç was about to retire, or perhaps the growing popularity of the puppet theater was economically irresistible. In 1705, Chikamatsu became a \\"Staff Playwright\\" as announced by early editions of The Mirror of Craftsmen of the Emperor Y≈çmei. In 1705 or 1706,The Encyclop√¶dia Britannica states that \\"he moved in 1705 from Kyoto to Osaka to be nearer to Gidayu's puppet theatre, the Takemoto-za. Chikamatsu remained a staff playwright for this theatre until his death.\\" although Keene states he moved in 1706. Chikamatsu left Kyoto for Osaka, where the puppet theater was even more popular.. Chikamatsu's popularity peaked with his domestic plays of love- suicides, and with the blockbuster success of The Battles of Coxinga in 1715, but thereafter the tastes of patrons turned to more sensational gore fests and otherwise more crude antics; Chikamatsu's plays would fall into disuse, so even the actual music would be lost for many plays. He died January 6, 1725, in either Amagasaki in Hy≈çgo,\\"Chikamatsu Monzaemon\\". 2006. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online. 12 November 2006. or Osaka. In 1706, he wrote a three-act puppet play entitled Goban Taiheiki (\\"A chronicle of great peace played on a chessboard\\"), based on the story of the Forty-seven r≈çnin; this became the basis of the later and much better-known Ch≈´shingura. Chikamatsu was the first known Japanese playwright who did not act in the pieces he wrote. Currently, 130 plays have been verified to have been authored by Chikamatsu, with another 15 plays (mostly early Kabuki works) suspected to also have been penned by him. Japanese composer Mayako Kubo wrote an opera based on Chikamatsu's play Osan: Secret of Love. It premiered at the New National Theatre Tokyo in 2005. Quotations * \\"Art is something that lies in the slender margin between the real and the unreal.\\" ‚Äî Chikamatsu Monzaemon, Naniwa Miyage Reception Chikamatsu's bunraku (j≈çruri) pieces, of which 24 are sewamono (domestic plays), came to be regarded as high literature in the Meiji and Taish≈ç eras. Many have argued that his genius was ‚Äúhis masterful depiction of the passions, obsessions, and irrationality of the human heart.‚Äù While Chikamatsu's jidaimono (history plays) were considered more important in his own time, the domestic tragedies are now ‚Äúthe main focus of critical attention and the more frequently performed‚Äù, praised as deeply drawn in their portrayals of commoners. The Love Suicides at Sonezaki (1703), one of the earliest domestic plays in puppet theater, was a hit that revived the fortunes of the Takemoto Theater in Osaka. While it is not considered as strong as his later play The Love Suicides at Amijima (1721), Donald Keene praised the death passage as ‚Äúone of the loveliest passages in Japanese literature‚Äù. Also, it was written in Early Modern Japanese Literature: An Anthology, 1600-1900 that The Drum of the Waves of Horikawa (1707) is ‚Äúof considerable interest for its exploration of female sexuality and its implicit critique of the life of lower-level samurai‚Äù. Rei Sasaguchi listed the same play as one of Chikamatsu's most striking bunraku works along with The Couriers of Love to the Other World. The Love Suicides at Amijima is generally regarded as the greatest of his domestic plays, though The Courier for Hell (1711), The Uprooted Pine (1718), and The Woman-Killer and the Hell of Oil (1721) have also been praised as works ‚Äúof exceptional power‚Äù. The last of the three initially was not well-received, and acquired a high reputation only in the late 19th century. Robert Nichols wrote that The Almanac of Love (1715) is highly regarded. Kenneth P. Kirkwood argued that the work is somewhat thin in texture but ‚Äúnevertheless reveals the playwright‚Äôs skill in making a dramatic plot out of the slightest materials.‚Äù The histories are mostly considered weaker, with Nichols writing that character in them tends to be subordinated to plot. The Battles of Coxinga (1715), however, ran for seventeen months and became the classical model for later history plays. It remains in the repertoires of both the bunraku and kabuki traditions, and Donald Keene referred to it as the only jidaimono ‚Äúwith real literary value‚Äù. Keisei hotoke no hara (1699) and Keisei mibu dainembutsu (1702) are among the most renowned kabuki plays, though Keene argued that even they are ‚Äúinferior in every respect‚Äù to the j≈çruri works written around the same period. Nichols listed The Courtesan‚Äôs Frankincense, The Tethered Steed, and Fair Ladies at a Game of Poem-Cards as the best histories. ‚ÄúDevil‚Äôs Island‚Äù, the second scene of the second act of Heike and the Island of Women (1719), became part of the kabuki repertory in the 19th century and today is usually performed in j≈çruri and kabuki as a single play.

It is long. Route description Interstate 180 begins as a continuation of Route 71 at a diamond interchange with Route 26 northeast of Hennepin. The interchange is located adjacent to a former steel mill that was most recently operated by ArcelorMittal until 2009. The freeway travels northwest, carrying I-180 and Route 26 in a concurrency, and crosses the Illinois River on the north side of Hennepin to enter Bureau County. On the west side of the river, Route 26 separates from I-180 and the freeway crosses over Route 29 before splitting at a Y-interchange. I-180 turns north, intersecting an expressway that connects to Route 29, and travels northeast across Big Bureau Creek to intersect Route 26. The freeway intersects U.S. Route 6 east of Princeton and continues due north to its terminus, a trumpet interchange with I-80. I-180 has four lanes for its entire length. History Construction of I-180 was completed in 1969. The freeway was built primarily to connect Interstate 80 to a new Jones & Laughlin steel plant built in 1965 in Hennepin, IL. However, the steel plant closed soon after I-180 was built, and did not re-open until August 2002. Federal auditors criticized its construction and called it a political favor that was put ahead of other requests from Tucson, Arizona and Tacoma, Washington. I-180 is one of the least traveled interstates in the nation, serving 1,950‚Äì3,600 vehicles per day as of 2013.

Incumbents *President: Alexandre Millerand *President of the Council of Ministers: Georges Leygues (until 16 January), Aristide Briand (starting 15 January) Events Alexandre Millerand had been elected president of the republic in 1920, with Georges Leygues taking his place as prime minister. Frequent changes of ministry had shown that even in peace times an unstable government was in a difficult situation. In a time of unrest and insecurity, the interests of the government might be wholly prejudicial to those of the country. Millerand's acts during his ministry both in his domestic and his foreign policy had met with the unanimous approval of the nation, and his popularity reached its height in September 1920, when by 695 votes out of 892 he was elected president of the republic. Among the members of Parliament opposed to his appointment there were many keen partisans of the leader whose eminent qualities had been put to the test during a period of over eight months. They did not wish to see Millerand occupying a merely representative position, which is all the French constitution allows to the president. They wanted to see so able a man at the helm of the ship of state, with real and not apparent power. Hopes were therefore raised in some quarters that the constitution would be amended to give more scope to the president. But these hopes were dashed to the ground when, on 12 January, Leygues retired from office. The Chamber of Deputies, by dismissing the minister selected by Millerand, expressed its wish to give power to a strong man whose conduct was not to be modified by any influence. Lack of firmness was the principal fault with which Leygues was charged by the majority of the Parliament. As a matter of fact, the dismissal of the premier was expected as an imminent event when Parliament reopened on 11 January. On that day Raoul P√©ret, who was reelected chairman of the Chamber, delivered a most interesting speech dealing with the difficulties of the moment. Leygues' request for the postponement of the intended interpellations of several deputies until after the inter-Allied conference due on the 19th was refused in the House by 447 votes out of 563. The cabinet was therefore compelled to retire. Next day the Senate met and reelected L√©on Bourgeois as its chairman. Millerand confided to P√©ret, chairman of the Chamber, the task of constituting a new ministry. After having endeavoured to obtain the cooperation of various personalities specially designated by the voice of public opinion, P√©ret found he was unable to surmount the difficulties caused by private antagonisms. He was particularly unsuccessful in obtaining the support of Aristide Briand and Raymond Poincar√©, whose views on certain points of foreign policy differed from his own. Thereupon Briand was entrusted with the difficult task of forming a cabinet. Briand had already been premier three times. Born in 1862 at Nantes, he was first elected deputy in 1902 for the Department of Loire, which reelected him until 1914. He was minister of public instruction in 1906, minister of justice in 1908, and prime minister in 1909. He was again prime minister in 1913 and, during the war, from 1915 to 1917. In 1919 he was reelected deputy by the Department of Loire-Inf√©rieure, the chief town of which is his native place. Like most French politicians Briand had gradually changed his mind in the course of the last years before the war. From fervent socialism he turned towards moderate opinions; as they say in France, \\"he put water into his wine\\". On 16 January Briand succeeded in constituting his cabinet as follows: { -----  Presidency of the Cabinet Council and Minister for Foreign Affairs Aristide Briand -----  Minister of Justice  Laurent Bonnevay -----  Minister of Finance  Paul Doumer -----  Minister of the Interior  Pierre Marraud -----  Minister of War  Louis Barthou -----  Minister of Marine  Gabriel Guist'hau -----  Minister of Public Instruction  L√©on B√©rard -----  Minister for the Liberated Districts and Reparations  Louis Loucheur -----  Minister of Agriculture  Edmond Lefebvre du Prey -----  Minister for the Colonies  Albert Sarraut -----  Minister of Commerce  Lucien Dior -----  Minister of Labour  Daniel Vincent -----  Minister of Pensions  Andr√© Maginot -----  Minister of Public Health  Georges Leredu -----  Minister of Public Works  Yves Le Trocquer } In accordance with the suggestion made by the British government that, owing to the French ministerial crisis, the inter-Allied conference should be postponed, the new government agreed that the conference should take place on 24 January. On 17 January nine under-secretaries of state were appointed as follows: { -----  Presidency of Cabinet Council  Th√©odore Tissier -----  Interior  Maurice Cobrat -----  Post and Telegraphs (Public Works)  Paul Laffont -----  Stocks (Finances)  Andr√© Paisant -----  Merchant Marine  Rio -----  Technical Instruction  Gaston Vidal -----  Liberated Districts  Lugol -----  Food (Agriculture)  Puis -----  Air Ministry  Laurent Eynac } The new cabinet appeared before Parliament on 20 January, the ministerial declaration being read by Briand in the Chamber and by Pierre Marraud in the Senate. This long declaration, modelled on the usual patterns, expressed much that was encouraging, but was not as explicit as the remarkable speech which Briand delivered on the following day, and which dealt with the political programme of the new government. In regard to foreign policy, Briand expressed his firm intention to make Germany pay, and he also promised to make every effort toward the revival of diplomatic relations with the Vatican. The Chamber expressed its confidence in the new cabinet by 462 votes out of 539. On the 24th, the Paris conference opened at the Foreign Office, with Briand in the chair. Eight days had been sufficient for him to make himself familiar with the grave problems of the moment, and France realized and valued the marvellous effort of the new premier. The leading personalities of the delegations at the conference were: for France, Briand, Louis Barthou, and Philippe Berthelot; for Britain, David Lloyd George and Lord Curzon; for Italy, Count Carlo Sforza, Count Lelio Bonin Longare, and Marquis Pietro Tomasi Della Torretta; for Belgium, Henri Jaspar and Georges Theunis; and for Japan, Viscount Kikujiro Ishii. The conference lasted five days, and was marked by a complete agreement among the Allies. The terms of the conditions of disarmament and reparations fixed by unanimous accord were forwarded to Germany. On the day before the conference ended (28 January) there took place the solemn burial of the Unknown Soldier under the Arc de Triomphe. Barthou, the war minister, delivered a most moving oration, and Lloyd George who was present threw into the grave Britain's floral tribute. Amongst the significant events which occurred in January, the dissolution of the General Confederation of Labour (C.G.T.) is not the least important. The breaking-up of this organization was promulgated on the 13th by the Tribunal Correctionnel following on the revolutionary strikes which had occurred in April and May 1920. The majority of the nation approved of this course. Many workmen themselves had protested against certain strike-orders, given by their leaders, as was alleged, for merely political or revolutionary purposes; and no doubt the C.G.T. had lost the support of public opinion. Before the close of January there was a distinct improvement in the value of the franc, which dropped from sixty to fifty-two for the pound sterling. During the whole of February French opinion watched the attitude of Germany with no little expectancy. On the 1st Millerand expressed his most ardent congratulations to Briand and his colleagues on the part they had taken in the Paris conference. The results of the conference were placed before the Chamber by Briand on 3 February, and after discussing the question for seven days, the House expressed its confidence in the cabinet by 387 votes out of 522. On 19 February, three more generals were promoted \\"marshals of France\\", viz., General √âmile Fayolle, General Louis Franchet d'Esperey, and General Hubert Lyautey. These, together with Marshal Joseph Joffre, Marshal Ferdinand Foch, and Marshal Philippe P√©tain, raised the number of French marshals to six. During February Marshal J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski, the head of the Polish state, paid a visit to France in the interests of Franco-Polish amity. Franco-British friendship was also deepened as a result of Lloyd George's reply to the German delegation at the London conference. Indeed, never since the armistice had the Entente Cordiale been so greatly appreciated in France. The results of the conference were approved by the Chamber on 17 March, after a two days' debate, by 490 votes out of 559. French troops joined British and Belgian battalions in the further occupation of German territory. The Chamber had already authorized the minister of war, on 4 March, to incorporate the conscripts born in 1901. The government also cultivated Franco-American relations. On 19 March Ren√© Viviani, a former prime minister, was sent to the United States, where he was received in special audience by President Warren G. Harding. Meanwhile, questions of finance were before both houses of Parliament. Early in April the Senate discussed expenditure on foreign affairs, finally agreeing to the proposals of the government. The Senate also agreed to the government's request for 120 million francs for the continuance of French propaganda in Syria. The budget of 1921 was finally discussed by the Senate on 16 April. One of the provisions of the Finance Law limited the number of ministries in future to twelve, and of under-secretaries of state to four. On 12 April, by a unanimous vote of the Chamber, the dignity of Marshal of France was granted to the late General Joseph Gallieni, who defended Paris in 1914. An event of national importance of a much earlier date was commemorated by Joan of Arc's day (8 May) instituted as a national holiday by the law of July 1920. On 16 April Marraud, minister of the interior, sent to the prefects a circular regarding this celebration, requesting them to take the necessary steps in order to solemnize the day with great display. He pointed out that the memory of Jeanne d'Arc should not be the exclusive possession of any one religious body, but should be the common property of the whole nation. These sentiments, echoed by a cabinet minister, reflected the government's changed attitude towards the Catholic Church which culminated in the endeavour to reestablish diplomatic relations with the Vatican. As regards the inter-Allied decisions, the Senate on 21 April ratified the laying of a 50% tax on German imports as decided at the last London conference. In the following week Briand started for London to attend the inter-Allied conference. From London, on 2 May, he instructed the war minister by telephone to call back the 1919 class to the colours, in view of the possible decision of the Allies to occupy the Ruhr district, in accordance with the scheme drawn up by Marshal Foch. But as on 10 May Germany acceded to the Allied terms, this possibility did not arise. Nevertheless, the 1919 class were not liberated until 21 June. It is worthy of note that May Day passed off in France without any popular manifestations. All the more remarkable were the other celebrations during May. On the 4th and 5th France recalled the hundredth anniversary of the death of Napoleon; on the 8th Jeanne d'Arc's day was fitly observed; while on the 15th an important meeting of athletic societies was held at Lille which Millerand attended, thus giving his high approval to the general tendency towards the encouragement of sport in France. The London conference was followed by a debate in Parliament on the government's foreign policy. For six days, from 19 to 25 May, the government was subjected to attacks, which the prime minister met successfully, carrying with him the Chamber, which gave him a vote of confidence of 390 votes out of 552. On 27 May, the Chamber passed a resolution authorizing the free import of wheat, and on 7 June the peace treaty with Hungary was ratified. During the last days of June parliamentary circles were somewhat excited by the bankruptcy of the \\"Banque Industrielle de Chine\\", and the government was once again strongly attacked by several deputies on account of its supposed relations with the bank. On 1 July, the Journal Officiel published the result of the census taken in March, according to which the total population was found to be 37,499,300, as against over 38,000,000 in 1911. The drop, of course, was chiefly due to the loss of 1,500,000 men in the war. Owing to the great heat prevailing at the beginning of July, the government decided not to hold the annual review of troops which was due to take place on the race- course of Longchamp, near Paris, on the morning of the National Day, 14 July. But as usual the French government received on that day the congratulations of foreign governments. The United States happily timed for 14 July the arrival in Paris of their new ambassador, Myron T. Herrick, a gentleman well known among French people as a fervent admirer of their country. Briand met him at the Gare Saint-Lazare, and the Parisians gave him a hearty reception all along his route. The esteem in which Herrick was held was shown a few months later by the general indignation expressed at the odious attempt to assassinate him which occurred on 19 October at the American embassy. The end of July was marked by a great maritime display at Havre, which Millerand attended as well as the minister of marine. This meeting was organized by the \\"Maritime and Colonial League\\" with a view to help the recovery of the French navy and merchant fleet. A further step in the same direction was the creation in October of an Academy of Shipping constituted by leading personalities of the shipping world for the revival of the shipping trade and the improvement of freight conditions. Early in August an event took place the significance of which need hardly be pointed out to those who remember the attitude of the French government towards the Catholic Church during the last ten years before the war. On the 6th of that month Mgr. Bonaventure Ceretti handed to Millerand, at the Ch√¢teau de Rambouillet, his credentials as legate from the pope to the government of the French Republic. \\"This reception\\", said the legate, \\"which in other times would have been merely a happy incident of no great consequence, today constitutes an event of historic importance, and it is especially to you and to your distinguished predecessor that should be attributed the merit of having prepared the way for its realization.\\" Briand, on his own authority and without waiting for the formal approval of Parliament, sent Auguste Jonnart as extraordinary ambassador to the Vatican. This action was brought up in the Senate on 8 December, and led to a fierce debate, the question being treated by the government as one of confidence. The Left strongly opposed the government, stating the dangers to which the \\"laicality\\" of the republic would be exposed by the appointment of a French ambassador to the Vatican. The chief spokesman of this view was Gaston Doumergue, a senator of the Left, but he was successfully opposed by some Alsatian senators who said that this standpoint had been abandoned during the war, and a return to it was not in the best interests of the country. In the end the Senate on 15 December passed a vote of confidence in the government, approving of the revival of diplomatic relations between France and the Vatican, Briand thus securing one of the greatest triumphs of his political career. A few days after the arrival of Mgr. Ceretti as ambassador from the pope, France gave a hearty reception to the members of the American Legion who had crossed the Atlantic to pay a visit to the battlefields where so many of their comrades were laid to rest. On 11 September there was celebrated at Meaux the seventh anniversary of the victory of the Marne. Barthou, the minister of war, attended the ceremony together with Marshal Joffre and General Maunoury, one of those who had contributed to the victory which saved Paris. Meanwhile, a general strike had broken out in the north of France, as a consequence of a strike of textile workers owing to a threat to reduce wages when the cost of living was still as high as ever. The dispute was finally settled by the intervention of the government. On 2 October Georges Clemenceau, the \\"Tiger\\", who had just returned from his tiger shooting in India, reentered the political arena for the first time since his resignation, by delivering a speech at Sainte-Hermines in La Vend√©e on the occasion of the unveiling of his own monument. Replying to the many reproaches levelled at him since his return to private life, he said that it was his successors who had not upheld the rights of France under the Treaty of Versailles. \\"Yesterday\\", he declared, \\"we were victorious. May we not be put today in such a position that we shall wonder whether we are still victorious!\\" These words referred to the charge brought against Clemenceau of having sacrificed the rights of France to what is called \\"the policy of alliances\\". The conflict of these two principles has placed all the French premiers since the armistice on the horns of a dilemma. They have had to choose repeatedly between insisting on the rights of France in their integrity, especially the claim to reparation in full from Germany, and consenting to concessions required by their allies. If they lean to the former alternative, they have to face a protest from the Left; if to the latter, they incur the censure of the Right and Centre. Briand in this respect has fared no better than his predecessors. On 9 October he delivered a speech at St. Nazaire which contained an eloquent statement of the results of the war and the aspirations of France, but gave no clear indication of the way to obtain the realization of these aspirations. The tone of the press showed that the country was somewhat disappointed. Parliament reopened on 18 October, and then began a keen fight against the government, carried on by the Right and Centre parties reinforced by the old followers of Clemenceau. Eighteen deputies had sent in notice of interpellation on the government's policy. L√©on Daudet, the Royalist deputy, led the attack, criticizing the government for having given up the customs-line of the Rhine which constituted the most important security for the payment of Germany's war debt. Maurice Barr√®s levelled the same reproach at Briand. He insisted that France should have a \\"Rhine policy\\", and his speech met with the approval of the majority of the Chamber. On the 25th Andr√© Tardieu, one of the negotiators of the Treaty of Versailles, in continuing the debate severely indicted the Left party, the \\"Bloc des gauches\\", the leading party before the war, which is now endeavouring to regain its lost supremacy from the \\"Bloc National\\", constituted by the last elections of 1919. √âdouard Herriot, the mayor of Lyon, one of the most prominent members of the \\"Bloc des gauches\\", vigorously refuted the charges of Tardieu. On 26 October the Chamber finally passed a vote of confidence in the government by 339 votes out of 517. Early in October, the minister of justice issued instructions to all the presidents of tribunals of France that the seconds of a duel should be prosecuted as accomplices in the offense, thus making the legislation in regard to duelling much more stringent. In the course of the same month Marraud, minister of the interior, gave notice of the introduction of a bill for the greater decentralization of the administration of France. France having decided to take part in the Washington conference, the opening of which had been fixed for 12 November, Marshal Foch sailed for the United States on 22 October on board the new liner Paris, the largest French vessel afloat, which had been put into service by the Compagnie G√©n√©rale Transatlantique on 15 June on the Havre-New York line; and on 29 October, Briand left France for Washington, accompanied by Albert Sarraut, minister for the colonies, Ren√© Viviani, ex- prime minister, Philippe Berthelot, general secretary at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the other members of the delegation. On the 21st, Briand delivered a sensational speech at Washington, in which he exposed the German danger. The delegates of the Allied countries approved of this statement, but the questions of naval disarmament and the Japanese alliance monopolized the attention of the conference to the exclusion of the vital questions of reparations and disarmament of Germany. As was expected, Briand had to face severe criticism when on 8 December he made a statement on the Washington conference before the Senate. During the absence of the premier, Millerand attended at Montpellier, together with four ministers, the celebration of the seventh centenary of the Faculty of Medicine, which took place on 6 November. A few days later, a great debate on the budget took place in the Chamber. Paul Doumer, minister for finance, announced a serious deficit. Several deputies took occasion to criticize the defective yield of the income tax. An ex- minister, Louis Deschamps, made an attack on the government monopolies, alleging that the state was a bad trader - an opinion general in France. The discussion of the budget lasted until 15 December, when the Chamber, in a night sitting, finally voted the whole of the credits asked for by the government. A few days later, on the 24th, the question of the bankruptcy of the Banque Industrielle de Chine, which had happened in the last days of June, was brought up again in the Chamber. The government met successfully a strong attack on its attitude towards this bank, but, as a consequence of this attack, Philippe Berthelot, general secretary at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, whose brother was the chairman of the bank, retired from office. On the 27th, after a long debate, the Chamber expressed its confidence in the government by 391 votes out of 604. The year 1921 has been one of slow recovery for France. The output of mines and factories has been notably increased, but the trading conditions are still unsatisfactory. It is believed in many quarters that the law instituting the eight-hour day is one of the chief reasons for the slowness in the revival of industry, and there is little doubt that the efforts which are being made by a few Socialists to extend this regulation to agriculture will be checked by Parliament. As regards the financial situation, it is noticeable that the government have decided not to issue any new loans, as these have the disadvantage of drawing private capital away from industry. The government hope to do more for reestablishing the public finances by encouraging the recovery of trade. But despite all this many Frenchmen believe that France needs reparations in order to restore her ruins, and that her revival depends on the payment of the German war debt. In the last days of 1921 the country was looking towards Cannes, where a new inter-Allied conference was due to take place. *9 March ‚Äì Cilicia Peace Treaty is signed. *20 October ‚Äì Treaty of Ankara is signed. *First European public radio broadcasting begins from Eiffel tower. *First vintage of Dom P√©rignon.

Sir John Pringle of London: Azure three escallops argent, a mullet of the last in the fess point for difference Biography=Youth and early career John Pringle was the youngest son of Sir John Pringle, 2nd Baronet, of Stichill, Roxburghshire (1662‚Äì1721), by his spouse Magdalen (d. December 1739), daughter of Sir Gilbert Eliott, 3rd Baronet, of Stobs. He was educated at St Andrews, at Edinburgh, and at Leiden. In 1730 he graduated with a degree of Doctor of Physic at the last-named university, where he was an intimate friend of Gerard van Swieten and Albrecht von Haller. He settled in Edinburgh at first as a physician, but between 1733 and 1744 was also Professor of Moral Philosophy at Edinburgh University. In 1742 he became physician to the Earl of Stair, then commanding the British army in Flanders. About the time of the battle of Dettingen in Bavaria in June 1743, when the British army was encamped at Aschaffenburg, Pringle, through the Earl of Stair, brought about an agreement with the Marshal of Noailles, the French commander, that military hospitals on both sides be considered as neutral, immune sanctuaries for the sick and wounded, and should be mutually protected. The International Red Cross, as constituted by the modern Geneva Conventions, developed from this conception and agreement. In 1744 he was appointed by the Duke of Cumberland physician-general to the forces in the Low Countries. In 1749, having settled in a smart house in Pall Mall, London, he was made physician in ordinary to the Duke of Cumberland. On 1 April 1752 he married Charlotte (d. Dec 1753) second daughter of Dr William Oliver (1695‚Äì1764) of Bath, the inventor of Bath Oliver biscuits, but they had no issue. In 1760, he wrote an appreciation of the Life of General James Wolfe. On 5 June 1766 John Pringle was created a baronet, and in 1774 he was appointed Physician to His Majesty King George III. He was also a frequent travelling companion to Benjamin Franklin. The successful London bookseller Andrew Millar noted Pringle and Franklin as dinner guests at his home. Academia His first book, Observations on the Nature and Cure of Hospital and Jayl Fevers, was published in 1750, and in the same year he contributed to the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society three papers on Experiments on Septic and Antiseptic Substances, which gained him the Copley Medal. Two years later he published his important work, Observations on the Diseases of the Army in Camp and Garrison, which entitles him to be regarded as the founder of modern military medicine. In November 1772 he was elected President of the Royal Society, a position he held until 1778. In this capacity he delivered six discourses, which were afterwards collected into a single volume (1783). In 1735, Pringle became a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh. Pringle was a regular correspondent and friend of James Burnett, Lord Monboddo, the Scottish philosopher. Monboddo was an important thinker in pre- evolutionary theory, and some scholars actually credit him with the concept of evolution; however, Monboddo was also quite eccentric, which was one reason for Monboddo's not receiving credit for the evolution concepts. It was in a letter to Pringle in 1773 that Monboddo revealed he did not really hold to a belief of men being born with tails, which was the chief point of his ridicule. At the age of 73 he went, briefly, to Edinburgh in 1780, but returned to London in September 1781, and died in the following year. Legacy There is a monument to Pringle in Westminster Abbey, executed by Joseph Nollekens. At Sir John's death his baronetcy became extinct. After a legal case in 2004, the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh was able to open the Pringle papers it holds to the public.

These were usually local or provincial groups using the Labour Party or Independent Labour Party name, backed by local labour councils (made up of many union locals in a particular city) or individual trade unions. There was an attempt to create a national Canadian Labour Party in the late 1910s and in the 1920s, but these were partly successful. The Communist Party of Canada, formed in 1921/22, fulfilled some of labour's political yearnings from coast to coast, and then the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation ‚Äì Worker Farmer Socialist\\" was formed in 1932. With organic ties to the organized labour movement, this was a labour party by definition. Prior to the CCFs formation in 1932, the Socialist Party of Canada was strong in BC (and in Alberta before WWI); the Dominion Labour Party and the Canadian Labour Party were strong in Alberta; the Independent Labour Party led by J.S. Woodsworth was strong in Manitoba. An Edmonton-based Independent Labour Party ran candidates in the 1921 provincial election. It was independent in the sense that it was separate from the Edmonton Labour Council, which was dominated by international craft unions. Later many of propopents joined the Communist Party. A number of local Labour parties and clubs participated in the formation of the Communist Party of Canada in 1921. The Independent Labour Party (Manitoba), the Canadian Labour Party, the Dominion Labour Party and other labour groups helped found the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) in 1932. Members of Parliament The first Labour Member of Parliament (MP) was Arthur Puttee who founded the Winnipeg Labour Party, and was elected to the House of Commons from Winnipeg, Manitoba in a 1900 by-election and kept his seat at the 1900 federal election held later the same year. Other MPs elected under the \\"Labour\\" or \\"Independent Labour\\" label include: *Ralph Smith, a miner, ran as an Independent Labour candidate in Vancouver in the 1900 federal election but took his seat in the Canadian House of Commons as a Liberal. He was subsequently re-elected as a Liberal in the 1904 and 1908 before being defeated in 1911. *Alphonse Verville was elected as a Labour candidate in the 1904 federal election in Maisonneuve, Quebec. He grew close to the Liberals through subsequent elections until he ran and was re-elected as a Laurier Liberal in the 1917 federal election. * James Lockwood ran as a Labour party candidate in the 1917 federal election in Algoma West, but was defeated. * John Wilfred Kennedy was elected as a United Farmers of Ontario-Labour MP for Glengarry and Stormont in a 1919 by-election. He was re-elected as a Progressive MP in the 1921 federal election and was defeated in 1925. *William Irvine, a close friend of J.S. Woodsworth, represented Calgary, Alberta as a Labour MP from 1921 to 1925 and as a United Farmers of Alberta MP from 1926 to 1935. He was a founding member of the CCF and sat as a CCF MP from British Columbia from 1945 to 1949. *Joseph Shaw also represented Calgary, Alberta as a Labour MP from 1921 to 1925 and also sat as a Liberal MP from 1926 to 1930. * Herbert Bealey Adshead was Labour MP for Calgary East from 1926 to 1930. * Angus MacInnis was an Independent Labour Party MP from 1930 to 1935 and sat as a CCF MP from 1935; *A. A. Heaps was elected as a Labour MP for Winnipeg North in 1925, 1926 and 1930 and was re- elected as a CCFer in 1935; * J. S. Woodsworth, who founded the Manitoba Independent Labour Party in December 1920. Woodsworth sat as an Independent Labour Party MP from 1921 until he became the founding leader of the CCF in 1932. *Humphrey Mitchell was elected as a Labour MP representing Hamilton East in a 1931 by-election. Close to William Lyon Mackenzie King's Liberals, he did not get along with other Labour and Independent Labour MPs and refused to join the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation when it was founded in 1932. The CCF ran a candidate against Mitchell in 1935 (the Liberals did not) and the vote split resulted in Mitchell's defeat by the Conservative candidate. In 1941 he was appointed to the federal Cabinet as Minister of Labour and soon after returned to the House of Commons as a Liberal MP via a by-election in Welland. MacInnis, Heaps and Woodsworth joined the Ginger Group of left wing MPs prior to forming the CCF Alberta Labour MPs Irvine and Shaw, and its UFA MPs, also were in the Ginger Group. *See also List of Labour MPs (Canada) Members of provincial legislatures=In Nova Scotia Four Independent Labour Party (ILP) MLAs and one Farmer-Labour MLA (all but one from Cape Breton) were elected to the Nova Scotia House of Assembly in the 1920 general election. They joined with six United Farmer MLAs to form the official opposition in the legislature with United Farmer MLA Daniel G. MacKenzie as leader. All the United Farmer and ILP MLAs were defeated in the 1925 general election. A single Labour MLA, Archibald Terris was elected in 1928 representing Cumberland County; he did not run for re-election in 1933. *D. W. Morrison, ILP, (Cape Breton), 1920-1925 *Arthur R. Richardson, Farmer-Labour, (Cape Breton), 1920-1925 *Joseph Steele, ILP, (Cape Breton), 1920-1925 *Arthur Forman Waye, ILP, (Cape Breton), 1920-1925 *Archibald Terris, ILP, (Cumberland), 1920-1925, 1928-1933 The Nova Scotia Co-operative Commonwealth Federation began running candidates with the 1933 general election and became the New Democratic Party in 1961. In 1982 the Cape Breton Labour Party was formed by MLA Paul MacEwan after he was expelled from the NDP. It ran 14 candidates in the 1984 general election but MacEwan was the only candidate to win the seat. The party soon dissolved and MacEwan was re-elected in 1988 as an independent before joining the Nova Scotia Liberal Party in 1990. In Quebec A number of members of the Legislative Assembly of Quebec were labelled Parti ouvrier (Labour Party) from the 1890 election until the 1931 election. They represented predominantly labour-class neighbourhoods in Montreal and Quebec City and consisted of: * Joseph B√©land, MLA for the district of Montr√©al n¬∞1 from 1890 to 1892; * Joseph-Alphonse Langlois, MLA for Saint-Sauveur from 1909 to 1916; * Aur√®le Lacombe, MLA for Montr√©al-Dorion from 1919 to 1923; * Ad√©lard Laurendeau, MLA for Maisonneuve from 1919 to 1923; * Joseph Gauthier, MLA for Montr√©al-Sainte-Marie from 1921 to 1923; * Pierre Bertrand, MLA for Saint-Sauveur from 1923 to 1927; * William Tremblay, MLA for Maisonneuve from 1927 to 1931; In Ontario *Daniel John O'Donoghue was the first Labour candidate elected to a Canadian legislature when in 1874 he was elected to the Ontario legislature as the candidate of the Ottawa Trades Council. *Allan Studholme was elected the first Labour Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) in the Ontario legislature in a 1906 by- election in Hamilton East. He remained in office until his death in 1919. A number of Labour MLAs were elected in the 1919 provincial election which led to the formation of a United Farmers of Ontario-Labour coalition government. Labour MLAs included: *James Bertram Cunningham, Labour, Sault Ste Marie *John Govenlock, Labour, Huron Centre, (1919) *Frank Greenlaw, Labour, St. Catharines, (1919) *George Grant Halcrow, Labour, Hamilton East, (1919) *Peter Heenan, Labour, Kenora, (1919, 1923, returned as Liberal 1934, 1937 see Liberal-Labour)) *Karl Homuth, Labour-UFO, Waterloo S., (1919, as Labour 1923, 1926, Conservative 1929, d. 1930) *Morrison MacBride, Labour, Brantford (1919, 1923, returned as Independent 1934, Ind.

He agreed to resign shortly after his re-election to allow former Labour MLA Peter Heenan to seek the Kenora seat in a by-election so that he could be appointed to the provincial cabinet by the newly elected Liberal government of Mitchell Hepburn. Hutchinson accepted an appointment by Hepburn to the post of vice-chairman of the Workmen's Compensation Board shortly after leaving politics. The Ontario Co-operative Commonwealth Federation was formed in 1932 with the support of a number of Independent Labour Party clubs and won its first seat in the 1934 provincial election, Samuel Lawrence in Hamilton East. In Manitoba *Reverend A. E. Smith was a Dominion Labour Party (DLP) MLA in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1920 to 1922. In 1925 he joined the Communist Party of Canada and was a prominent party leader until his death. *Fred Dixon was the DLP's leader in the early 1920s and a Manitoba MLA from 1914 to 1923. *William Ivens was a DLP and then an Independent Labour Party MLA in Manitoba from 1920 to 1926. *John Queen was a Manitoba MLA from 1921 to 1941 under various Labour labels, most significantly he was leader of the ILP from 1923 to 1935 and joined the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation upon the ILP's affiliation to it. He was also Mayor of Winnipeg for much of the time between 1934 and 1942.  In Alberta  *Donald McNabb, elected from Lethbridge in a 1908 by- election to become the first Labour MLA in Alberta. Defeated in the 1909 general election. *Charles M. O'Brien, Socialist Party of Canada MLA for Rocky Mountain from 1909 to 1913. He was defeated in 1913. *Alex Ross, Labour MLA for Calgary from 1917 to 1926, elected in Calgary in 1917 (as a candidate for the Alberta Labor Representation League), was re-elected as Labour candidate in 1921, was named to the provincial cabinet of the United Farmers of Alberta government, when it was elected in 1921, as Minister of Public Works. Helped form the Alberta wing of the Canadian Labour Party in 1922, was defeated in the 1926 general election. *Philip Christophers, Labour MLA for Rocky Mountain, elected in 1921 and re-elected in 1926. *William Johnston, Labour MLA for Medicine Hat from 1921 until 1926. *Fred J.

Did not run for re-election. * See also The Rise and Fall of the Labour Party in Alberta, 1917-42 As well, Alberta Labour candidates ran with some success at the civic level in Edmonton, Calgary, Medicine Hat, and Lethbridge and coal-mining towns, such as Drumheller and Blairmore (which even elected a Communist Party-dominated town council in the 1930s). In British Columbia *Although there were no parties in the British Columbia legislature until 1903, various candidates began to declare for labour parties in the 1890s. The first to succeed, in the 1898 election, was Ralph Smith, in the coal-mining riding of South Nanaimo. Once the party system was introduced, Smith joined the Liberal Party and was re-elected as a Liberal in the 1903 and then won a seat as MP in the House of Commons of Canada in the 1904 and 1908 elections, but was defeated for his seat in the 1911. He returned to provincial politics and won his seat again as part of the province's first Liberal government in the wake of the general election of 1916. He served as Finance Minister in that government until his death in 1917, and was succeeded by his wife, Mary Ellen Smith, who won the resulting by-election and sat as an Independent Liberal, later becoming the first female cabinet minister in the British Empire. *Thomas Uphill was the Labour MLA for Fernie in the British Columbia Legislative Assembly from 1920 until 1960. He was elected as a Federated Labour Party candidate in the 1920 British Columbia general election, re-elected as part of the Canadian Labour Party slate in 1924 continued to run and win as an Independent Labour or Labour candidate rather than join the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation until his last victory in 1956. Uphill retired, undefeated, in 1960. From 1941 until 1952 the CCF unsuccessfully ran candidates against him. They did not stand against Uphill beginning in the 1953 election. The Labor-Progressive Party, with which Uphill had sympathies, never stood candidates against him. Parties  In 1917, the Trades and Labour Congress (TLC) national convention in Toronto passed a resolution calling on provincial labour federations to establish a political party which would unite socialist and labour parties in the province and eventually form a national party. A Canadian Labour Party was formed, and endorsed several candidates in the 1917 federal election. The leadership of the TLC changed in 1918, however, and the new leaders favoured the \\"non-partisan\\" approach of American Federation of Labor leader Samuel Gompers. The CLP was abandoned, as such. Between 1920 and 1926, provincial parties (or provincial wings of national bodies) were founded in British Columbia, Manitoba, Alberta, Ontario and Quebec. The Federated Labour Party was created by the British Columbia Federation of Labour in 1920, absorbing the Social Democratic Party and part of the Socialist Party of Canada. From 1906 to 1909, there was a Canadian Labour Party of B.C. (CLP(BC)). This party was a split from and rival to a group calling itself the Independent Labour Party. A later Independent Labour Party was organized in British Columbia in 1926 by the Federated Labour Party and Canadian Labour Party (B.C. section) branches. In 1928, it severed its CLP(BC) connections. In 1931, it reorganized, and was renamed the Independent Labour Party (Socialist). The following year it became the Socialist Party of Canada. In Manitoba, a Dominion Labour Party (DLP) had been created in 1918. This was a reformist party, although more explicitly socialist than the previous such organizations in the province (see Winnipeg Labour Party, Manitoba Independent Labour Party, Manitoba Labour Party, Labour Representation Committee). The DLP elected several members to the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba in 1920. It was taken over by rightist elements affiliated with the American Federation of Labour later in the year, and most of the MLAs formed a new Independent Labour Party. The Alberta wing of the Dominion Labour Party was formed in 1920. Unlike the Manitoba DLP, radicals did not lose control of this group. and it was not split by a radical-versus-reformist schism. It remained a viable organization until the 1930s, in an alliance with the Canadian Labour Party (see below). It elected a few MPs in Calgary in the 1921, 1925, 1926 and 1930 federal elections. In Saskatchewan, the Independent Labour Party was formed in 1931 and led by M.J. Coldwell, It merged with the United Farmers of Canada (Saskatchewan Section) to form the Farmer-Labour Group in 1932. This group became the Saskatchewan CCF in 1934. The Ontario Labour Party was created in 1922, led by James Simpson of the Independent Labour Party, and the Reverend A. E. Smith, later of the Communist Party of Canada. In 1921, Simpson also revived the Canadian Labour Party. The CLP was intended to be an umbrella organization for the various labour parties throughout the country. It formed alliances with the Federated Labour Party, Ontario Labour Party, Dominion Labour Party and other groups, including local labour councils, (although not with the Manitoba ILP). The Alberta wing of the CLP was founded in 1922. Between 1922 and 1924, the provincial and city branches of the Workers Party of Canada (the legal face of the Communist Party of Canada) also joined the CLP. It was never a strong central organization, however, and never elected a candidate at the national level. The CLP ceased to exist in most parts of the country after 1929, when the Communists withdrew. In Alberta, the CLP survived until 1942, in arms-length alliance with the Alberta Co-operative Commonwealth Federation after 1932. Liberal-Labour At various times in political history of Canada and of Ontario, candidates have sought election as Liberal- Labour candidates. (Please see linked article.) Conservative Labour Conservative Labour was the label used by Conservative Party of Canada politician Henry Buckingham Witton as a candidate in Hamilton, Ontario from 1872 to 1875. Witton may have added \\"Labour\\" to the Conservative Party name because Hamilton is a largely industrial city. The first workingman ever to sit in parliament in Canada, Witton was elected largely on the strength of the Hamilton labour movement. Indeed, his candidacy was aided by workers throughout southern Ontario, as can be seen by the very supportive coverage he received in the (Toronto) Ontario Workman. Witton was employed as a master painter at the Great Western Railway Shops when he was elected in the 1872 federal election, and sat with the Conservative caucus of Sir John A. Macdonald before being defeated in the 1874 election. He ran again in an 1875 by-election but was again defeated. Farmer-Labour Across Canada, labour and the farmers movements, particularly the United Farmers, formed alliances, and often ran joint candidates. The Progressive Party of Canada was effectively a coalition of farmer and labour groups. John Wilfred Kennedy, a farmer, was elected as a United Farmers of Ontario-Labour MP for Glengarry and Stormont in a 1919 by-election. He was re-elected as a Progressive MP in the 1921 federal election and was defeated in 1925. Agnes Macphail, who was first elected to the House of Commons as a Progressive, was re-elected in 1935 as a UFO-Labour candidate before being defeated in 1940. She was a supporter of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, but ran as UFO-Labour because the UFO, of which she was a member, had disaffiliated from the CCF in 1934 after a brief association. A small number of candidates ran under the \\"Farmer-Labour\\" banner in federal elections of the 1930s and 1940s, although there was no organized party. None of these candidates ever won election to the House of Commons. One of these candidates was Beatrice Brigden who was the first Farmer-Labour candidate from Brandon, Manitoba. She ran in 1930, but was defeated by David Wilson Beaubier. Farmer-Labour co-operation would be enshrined as a guiding principle of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, founded in 1932, and of its successor, the NDP. Ontario Labour and Independent Labour Party Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) joined with members of the United Farmers of Ontario to form a Farmer-Labour coalition government from 1919 to 1923 with E. C. Drury as Premier of Ontario. Alberta The Labour MLAs elected in 1921 (six at the most at any one time) worked with the United Farmers of Alberta government during its 14 years in power, and one even sat as a cabinet minister in the UFA cabinet for five years. Alberta's Labour MPs and its UFA MPs were both active in the Ginger Group. Saskatchewan The United Farmers and the Independent Labour Party merged to form the Farmer-Labour Group in 1932. In the 1934 provincial election, the Farmer-Labour Group won almost 24% of the popular vote and 5 seats in the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan, where it became the official opposition to the Liberal government. After the election, it became the Saskatchewan section of the CCF. Nova Scotia Eleven United Farmers and Labour candidates were elected to the Nova Scotia Legislative Assembly in the 1920 general election forming the official opposition in the province. New Brunswick In the 1920 provincial election nine United Farmers candidates and two Farmer-Labour candidatesE. R. Forbes, Delphin Andrew MuiseThe Atlantic Provinces in Confederation, University of Toronto Press, 1993, page 236 were elected o the Legislature. They sat together and allowed the incumbent Liberals to maintain confidence in a minority government situation. None of the MLAs were re-elected in the 1925 election.

It was founded as a successor to the Western Canada Federation (West-Fed), a non-partisan organization, to fight the Liberal Party of Canada. The CoR aimed to fill the void on the right of the political spectrum left by the decline of the Social Credit Party of Canada and the growing unpopularity among westerners of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada under the leadership of Brian Mulroney. The party also attracted significant support as a protest vote against official bilingualism among some voters who were not necessarily ideologically opposed to mainstream Canadian political parties on other issues. The party proposed dividing Canada into four 'regions', western Canada, Atlantic Canada, Ontario and Quebec, each with an equal number of seats in the House of Commons of Canada. In the 1984 federal election, it nominated 55 candidates, who won 65,655 votes in total, or 0.52% of the popular vote across the country. The party took 2.2% of the vote in Alberta and peaked with 6.7% in Manitoba. In the 1988 federal election, its 51 candidates won 41,342 votes, 0.31% of the popular vote. One of its candidates was Paul Fromm, leader of the right-wing Citizens for Foreign Aid Reform and Canadian Association for Free Expression, and who was known to attend racist gatherings and associate with neo-Nazis. (See also: Confederation of Regions Party candidates, 1988 Canadian federal election). The party's greatest success came in New Brunswick, where its provincial wing, the New Brunswick Confederation of Regions Party, held the status of official opposition from 1991 to 1995. After the demise of CoR, many former supporters joined the Reform Party of Canada. Provincial wings The CoR captured about 2% of the vote in provincial elections in the 1988 Manitoba election and the 1990 Ontario election. Alberta The CoR's Alberta wing nominated candidates in the 1986 provincial election and the 1993 provincial election. In 1986, the party nominated 6 candidates, who won a total of 2,866 votes, or 0.40% of the total. In 1993, the party nominated 12 candidates, who won 3,556 votes, or 0.36% of the total. On 17 June 1996, the Chief Electoral Officer of Alberta, cancelled the registration of the Confederation of Regions Party of Alberta and the party was struck from the Register of Alberta Political Parties because the party failed to comply with the registration requirements of the Election Finances and Contributions Disclosure Act. The COR Party was struck from the register because two conflicting groups in the party claimed different persons were officers of the party. The party presented different addresses of record. The conflicting groups had different interpretations of the COR Party Constitution. As the Chief Electoral Officer did not have the authority to resolve such issues, he referred the participants in the dispute to the courts. Neither side in the dispute applied to the courts in an effort to resolve the problem.

History The party argued that Western Canada could not receive fair treatment while the interests of Quebec and Ontario dominated Canadian politics. The party gained popularity in Alberta when western alienation was at its height following the federal Liberal government announcement of the National Energy Program in October 1980. This policy aimed to ensure low energy costs for Canadian industry and consumers, which would have harmed the economy of Alberta, Canada's major producer of oil and gas. A member of the party, Gordon Kesler, was elected to the Alberta legislature in a 1982 provincial by-election in Olds-Didsbury riding that drew national attention. The best showing for the party came later in the same year in the Alberta general election, where they took 11.8 per cent of the vote, but did not elect any MLAs (Kesler lost his seat). Kesler became leader of the Alberta WCC with his election to the legislature. In 1984, he was replaced by Jack Ramsay, later a federal Reform Member of Parliament. Some of the more doctrinaire figures in the party opposed Ramsay's leadership, claiming that he was not genuinely committed to western independence. The Saskatchewan branch of the party attracted two sitting members of the Legislative Assembly who represented the party for a few months in 1986 before being kicked out of the party. In 1987, a group of Alberta members who were dissatisfied with the party's leadership and direction left the party to establish the Western Independence Party. The most prominent leader of the party was Doug Christie, a British Columbia lawyer best known for having represented neo-Nazis James Keegstra, Ernst Z√ºndel and Wolfgang Droege. To distance itself from Christie, the national party expelled him from the leadership in 1981 and denied him a membership in the party's Alberta branch. He later became leader of British Columbia's provincial WCC and ran for the party at the national and provincial levels several times. In 2005, he announced the creation of the Western Block Party which would be a western version of the Bloc Qu√©b√©cois. At the time of his death in 2013 Christie maintained a website with the \\"Western Canada Concept\\" name, but Western Canada Concept was no longer a registered political party. Party program # Independence for Western Canada, chosen by the people of each of the four Western provinces and northern territories in a referendum. # A citizen's constitutionally established right of reasonably accessible referendum, initiative and recall. # Protection for the sanctity and safety of human life, property and security of the person and their fundamental freedoms. # An end to immigration to preserve our environment, culture and stability. # Equal rights for all, with no special status for any race, or ethnic origin. # Preservation of our Christian culture and European heritage. # A federal republic with a two-house legislature, one elected by population the other by region, both with original legislative jurisdiction and both required to approve before a law was enacted. # One official language of Western Canada. # The establishment of a balanced budget by law under the constitution so no future debts can be incurred by government.

They mostly have a hard surface such as asphalt or concrete, although smaller general aviation airports sometimes use gravel or grass. Most airports do not have a specific speed limit for taxiing (though some do). There is a general rule on safe speed based on obstacles. Operators and aircraft manufacturers might have limits. Typical taxi speeds are 20‚Äì30 knots (37‚Äì56 km/h; 23‚Äì35 mph).  High-speed exit  Busy airports typically construct high-speed or rapid-exit taxiways to allow aircraft to leave the runway at higher speeds. This allows the aircraft to vacate the runway quicker, permitting another to land or take off in a shorter interval of time. This is usually accomplished by making the exiting taxiway longer, thus giving the aircraft more space in which to slow down, before the taxiways' upcoming intersection with another (perpendicular) taxiway, another runway, or the ramp/tarmac. Markings Taxiway at Munich Airport *Normal Centerline A single continuous yellow line, to in width. *Enhanced Centerline The enhanced taxiway center line marking consists of a parallel line of yellow dashes on either side of the taxiway centerline. Taxiway centerlines are enhanced for 150 feet (46 m) before a runway holding position marking. The enhanced taxiway centerline is standard (canceled and replaced by150/5340-1K) at all FAR Part 139 certified airports in the USA. *Taxiway Edge Markings Used to define the edge of the taxiway when the edge does not correspond with the edge of the pavement. **Continuous markings consist of a continuous double yellow line, with each line being at least in width, spaced apart. They divide the taxiway edge from the shoulder or some other abutting paved surface not intended for use by aircraft. **Dashed markings define the edge of a taxiway on a paved surface where the adjoining pavement to the taxiway edge is intended for use by aircraft, e.g. an apron. These markings consist of a broken double yellow line, with each line being at least in width, spaced apart (edge to edge). These lines are 15 feet (4.6 m) in length with 25 foot (7.6 m) gaps. *Taxi Shoulder Markings Taxiways, holding bays, and aprons are sometimes provided with paved shoulders to prevent blast and water erosion. Shoulders are not intended for use by aircraft, and may be unable to carry the aircraft load. Taxiway shoulder markings are yellow lines perpendicular to the taxiway edge, from taxiway edge to pavement edge, about 3 metres. *Surface Painted Taxiway Direction Signs Yellow background with a black inscription, provided when it is not possible to provide taxiway direction signs at intersections, or when necessary to supplement such signs. These markings are located on either side of the taxiway. *Surface Painted Location Signs Black background with a yellow inscription and yellow and black border. Where necessary, these markings supplement location signs located alongside the taxiway and assist the pilot in confirming the designation of the taxiway on which the aircraft is located. These markings are located on the right side of the centerline. *Geographic Position Markings These markings are located at points along low visibility taxi routes (when Runway visual range is below 1200 feet (370 m)). They are positioned to the left of the taxiway centerline in the direction of taxiing. Black inscription centered on pink circle with black inner and white outer ring. If the pavement is a light colour then the border is white with a black outer ring. Rocky Mountain Metropolitan Airport (KBJC) *Runway Holding Position Markings These show where an aircraft should stop when approaching a runway from a taxiway. They consist of four yellow lines, two solid and two dashed, spaced six or twelve inches (15 or 30 cm) apart, and extending across the width of the taxiway or runway. The solid lines are always on the side where the aircraft is to hold. There are three locations where runway holding position markings are encountered: Runway holding position markings on taxiways; runway holding position markings on runways; taxiways located in runway approach areas. *Holding Position Markings for Instrument Landing System (ILS) These consist of two yellow solid lines spaced two feet (60 cm) apart connected by pairs of solid lines spaced ten feet (3 metres) apart extending across the width of the taxiway. *Holding Position Markings for Taxiway/Taxiway Intersections These consist of a single dashed line extending across the width of the taxiway. *Surface Painted Holding Position Signs Red background signs with a white inscription to supplement the signs located at the holding position. The taxiways are given alphanumeric identification. These taxiway IDs are shown on black and yellow signboards along the taxiways. Signs The signs can often be combined, in this case a direction sign, a location sign, and a runway sign Airport guidance signs provide direction and information to taxiing aircraft and airport vehicles. Smaller airports may have few or no signs, relying instead on airport diagrams and charts. There are two classes of signage at airports, with several types of each: Operational guidance signs *Location signs ‚Äì yellow on black background. Identifies the runway or taxiway the aircraft is currently on or is entering. *Direction/Runway exit signs ‚Äì black on yellow. Identifies the intersecting taxiways the aircraft is approaching, with an arrow indicating the direction to turn. *Stop Bar signs ‚Äì white on blue background. The designation consists of the letter S followed by designation of the taxiway on which the Stop Bar is positioned. This sign is not standard. (LLBG AD 2.9 Surface Movement Guidance and Control System and Markings) *Other ‚Äì many airports use conventional traffic signs such as stop and yield signs throughout the airport. The yellow \\"W2\\" direction sign in the foreground leading to the black \\"W2\\" location sign in the background. The blue \\"SW 2\\" sign is non-standard. Mandatory instruction signs No entry sign Mandatory instruction signs are white on red. They show entrances to runways or critical areas. Vehicles and aircraft are required to stop at these signs until the control tower gives clearance to proceed. *Runway signs ‚Äì White text on a red background. These signs identify a runway intersection ahead, e.g. runway 12-30 in the photo above. *Frequency change signs ‚Äì Usually a stop sign and an instruction to change to another frequency. These signs are used at airports with different areas of ground control. *Holding position signs ‚Äì A single solid yellow bar across a taxiway indicates a position where ground control may require a stop. If two solid yellow bars and two dashed yellow bars are encountered, this indicates a holding position for a runway intersection ahead; runway holding lines must never be crossed without permission. At some airports, a line of red lights across a taxiway is used during low visibility operations to indicate holding positions. An \\"interrupted ladder\\" type marking with an \\"ILS\\" sign in white on red indicates a holding position before an ILS critical area. Lights Taxiway edge light Taxiway lights Taxiway lights Taxiways at Atlanta Airport For night operations, taxiways at many airports are equipped with lights, although some small airports are not equipped with them. *Taxiway Edge Lights: used to outline the edges of taxiways during periods of darkness or restricted visibility conditions. These fixtures may be elevated or in- pavement and emit blue light normally. Where a four-way intersection crosses, the light at the centre of the crossing may be omnidirectional and emit yellow light. Where a road for ground vehicles only meets a taxiway or at an end of usable service area for a ramp or taxiway, the light at the edge of the road or the final taxiway edge light may emit red light. *Taxiway Centerline Lights: They are steady burning and emit green light located along the taxiway centerline. Where a taxiway crosses a runway, or where a \\"lead-off\\" taxiway centreline leads off of a runway to join a taxiway, these lights will alternate yellow and green. *Clearance Bar Lights: Three in-pavement steady- burning yellow lights installed at holding positions on taxiways *Runway Guard Lights: Either a pair of elevated flashing yellow lights installed on either side of the taxiway, or a row of in-pavement yellow lights installed across the entire taxiway, at the runway holding position marking at taxiway/runway intersections. *Stop Bar Lights: A row of red, unidirectional, steady-burning in-pavement lights installed across the entire taxiway at the runway holding position, and elevated steady-burning red lights on each side used in low visibility conditions (below 1,200 ft RVR). A controlled stop bar is operated in conjunction with the taxiway centerline lead-on lights which extend from the stop bar toward the runway. Following the ATC clearance to proceed, the stop bar is turned off and the lead-on lights are turned on. Taxiway edge lights are spaced at a minimum of 50 to a maximum of 200 feet apart. On straightaways the spacing is typically 200 feet. These lights can be closer together at taxiway intersections. On straight segments, Taxiway Centerline Lights are spaced at either 50 or 100 foot intervals depending on the minimum authorized visibility. On curved taxiway segments, Taxiway Centerline Lights may be required to be closer together., Page 2-7, Table 2-1.

A part of the Golden Ring of Russian towns, it is located at the confluence of the rivers Volga and Kostroma. Population: History=Under the Rurikids The city was first recorded in the chronicles for the year 1213, but some historians believe it could have been founded by Yury Dolgoruky more than half a century earlier, in 1152.Official website of Kostroma. Kostroma Today Since many scholars believe that early Eastern Slavs tribes arrived in modern-day Belarus, Ukraine and western Russia 400 to 600 AD, Kostroma could be much older than previously thought. The city shares the same name as the East Slavic goddess Kostroma. Like other towns of the Eastern Rus, Kostroma was sacked by the Mongols in 1238. It then constituted a small principality, under leadership of Prince Vasily the Drunkard, a younger brother of the famous Alexander Nevsky. Upon inheriting the grand ducal title in 1271, Vasily didn't leave the town for Vladimir, and his descendants ruled Kostroma for another half a century, until the town was bought by Ivan I of Moscow. left As one of the northernmost towns of the Grand Duchy of Moscow, Kostroma served for grand dukes as a place of retreat when enemies besieged Moscow in 1382, 1408, and 1433. In 1375, the town was looted by Novgorod pirates (ushkuiniks). The spectacular growth of the city in the 16th century may be attributed to the establishment of trade connections with English and Dutch merchants (Muscovy Company) through the northern port of Archangel. Boris Godunov had the IpatievLocal History website. K. Torop. Kostroma and Epiphany monasteries rebuilt in stone. The construction works were finished just in time for the city to witness some of the most dramatic events of the Time of Troubles. Kostroma was twice ravaged by the Poles; it took a six-month siege to expel them from the Ipatiev monastery. The heroic peasant Ivan Susanin became a symbol of the city's resistance to foreign invaders; several monuments to him may be seen in Kostroma. The future Tsar, Mikhail Romanov, also lived at the monastery. It was here that an embassy from Moscow offered him the Russian crown in 1612. Under the Romanovs It is understandable why the Romanov Tsars regarded Kostroma as their special protectorate. The Ipatievsky monastery was visited by many of them, including Nicholas II, the last Russian Tsar. The monastery had been founded in the early 14th century by a Tatar prince, ancestor of the Godunov family. The Romanovs had the Trinity Cathedral rebuilt in 1652; its frescoes and iconostasis are notable. A wooden house of Mikhail Romanov is still preserved in the monastery. There are also several old wooden structures transported to the monastery walls from distant districts of the Kostroma Oblast. Town status was granted to Kostroma in 1719. Kostroma River, 2011 In 1773, Kostroma was devastated by a great fire. Afterwards the city was rebuilt with streets radiating from a single focal point near the river. They say that Catherine the Great dropped her fan on the city map, and told the architects to follow her design. One of the best preserved examples of the 18th century town planning, Kostroma retains some elegant structures in a \\"provincial neoclassical\\" style. These include a governor's palace, a fire tower, a rotunda on the Volga embankment, and an arcaded central market with a merchant church in the center. During and after the Russian Revolution The First Workers' Socialist Club based in Kostroma was one of the best documented workers' clubs run by Proletkult. Organised around the principle of a \\"public hearth\\" (obshchestvennyi ochag) this club combined both practical support for workers in need of accommodation, food or furniture, as well as providing a focus for popular education.

Photo by Sergey Prokudin-Gorsky, 1911 Resurrection Church (1652) is a superb example of the 17th-century Russian art. Color photograph by Sergey Prokudin-Gorsky in 1910 (Library of Congress) Built in 1559-1565, the five-domed Epiphany Cathedral was the first stone edifice in the city; its medieval frescoes perished during a fire several years ago. The minster houses the city's most precious relic, a 10th-century Byzantine icon called Our Lady of St. Theodore. It was with this icon that Mikhail Romanov was blessed by his mother when he left for Moscow to claim the Russian throne. They say that just before the Revolution of 1917, the icon blackened so badly that the image was hardly visible; it was interpreted as a bad sign for the Romanov dynasty. The Ipatyevsky monastery survives mostly intact, with its 16th-century walls, towers, belfry, and the 17th-century cathedral. Apart from the monasteries, most of the city churches were either rebuilt or demolished during the Soviet years. The only city church that survives from the 17th- century \\"golden age\\" is the Resurrection church on the Lowlands (Russian: —Ü–µ—Ä–∫–æ–≤—å –í–æ—Å–∫—Ä–µ—Å–µ–Ω–∏—è –Ω–∞ –î–µ–±—Ä–µ). As the story goes, the church was commissioned by one merchant who ordered in England ten barrels of dye but received ten barrels of gold instead. He resolved that the unearned gold was the devil's gift and decided to spend it on building a church. Two other 17th-century temples, of rather conventional architecture, may be seen on the opposite side of the Volga. Among the vestiges of the Godunov rule, a fine tent-like church in the urban-type settlement of Krasnoye-na-Volge (formerly an estate of Boris Godunov's brother) may be recommended.

History Before the 2.6 version of the Linux kernel, processes were the schedulable entities, and there were no special facilities for threads. However, it did have a system call ‚Äî ‚Äî which creates a copy of the calling process where the copy shares the address space of the caller. The LinuxThreads project used this system call to provide kernel-level threads (most of the previous thread implementations in Linux worked entirely in userland). Unfortunately, it only partially complied with POSIX, particularly in the areas of signal handling, scheduling, and inter-process synchronization primitives. To improve upon LinuxThreads, it was clear that some kernel support and a new threading library would be required. Two competing projects were started to address the requirement: NGPT (Next Generation POSIX Threads) worked on by a team which included developers from IBM, and NPTL by developers at Red Hat. The NGPT team collaborated closely with the NPTL team and combined the best features of both implementations into NPTL. The NGPT project was subsequently abandoned in mid-2003 after merging its best features into NPTL. NPTL was first released in Red Hat Linux 9. Old- style Linux POSIX threading is known for having trouble with threads that refuse to yield to the system occasionally, because it does not take the opportunity to preempt them when it arises, something that Windows was known to do better at the time. Red Hat claimed that NPTL fixed this problem in an article on the Java website about Java on Red Hat Linux 9.Red Hat Linux 9 and Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition 1.4.2: A Winning Combination NPTL has been part of Red Hat Enterprise Linux since version 3, and in the Linux kernel since version 2.6. It is now a fully integrated part of the GNU C Library.GNU C Library version 2.3.3 release There exists a tracing tool for NPTL, called POSIX Thread Trace Tool (PTT). And an Open POSIX Test Suite (OPTS) was written for testing the NPTL library against the POSIX standard. Design NPTL uses a similar approach to LinuxThreads, in that the primary abstraction known by the kernel is still a process, and new threads are created with the clone() system call (called from the NPTL library). However, NPTL requires specialized kernel support to implement (for example) the contended case of synchronisation primitives which might require threads to sleep and wake again. The primitive used for this is known as a futex. NPTL is a so-called 1√ó1 threads library, in that threads created by the user (via the \`pthread_create()\` library function) are in 1-1 correspondence with schedulable entities in the kernel (tasks, in the Linux case). This is the simplest possible threading implementation. An alternative to NPTL's 1√ó1 model is the m√ón model.

She was taken as war reparations by the Soviet Union after World War II and renamed Tovarishch. The ship was acquired by sponsors, after a short period under the Ukrainian flag in the 1990s and a prolonged stay in British ports due to lack of funds for necessary repairs. Then she sailed to her original home port of Stralsund where her original name of Gorch Fock was restored on 29 November 2003. She is a museum ship, and extensive repairs were carried out in 2008. The Federal German government built a replacement training ship which is still in service. History and details The German school ship Niobe, a three-masted barque, capsized on 26 July 1932 in the Baltic Sea near Fehmarn due to a sudden squall, killing 69. The loss prompted the German Navy to order a new training vessel built. The contract went to the shipyard of Blohm & Voss in Hamburg, where construction began on 2 December 1932. She was completed in only 100 days. On 3 May 1933 the ship was launched and named Gorch Fock in honor of German writer Johann Kinau who wrote under the pseudonym \\"Gorch Fock\\". Kinau had died in the 1916 Battle of Jutland aboard the cruiser . Commissioned by the German Navy on 26 June 1933, Gorch Fock is a three-masted barque. She has square sails on the fore and main masts, and is gaff rigged on the mizzen. The steel hull has a sparred length of , a width of and a draught of . She has a displacement at full load of 1510 tons. Her main mast stands high above deck and she carries 23 sails totalling . She is equipped with an auxiliary engine of . The training ship was designed to be robust and safe against capsizing. More than 300 tons of steel ballast in the keel give her a righting moment large enough to bring her back in the upright position even when she heels over to nearly a 90¬∞. Gorch Fock served as a training vessel for the German Reichsmarine prior to World War II. During the war, she was a stationary office ship in Stralsund, until she was officially reactivated on 19 April 1944. On 1 May 1945, the crew scuttled her in shallow waters off R√ºgen in an attempt to avoid her capture by the Soviets, who already had fired at her for 45 minutes with tanks. The Soviets ordered Stralsund-based company \\"B. Staude Schiffsbergung\\" to raise and salvage her, which after some difficulties was done in 1947 at a cost of 800,000 Reichsmark (equivalent to million euros). She was under restoration between 1948 and 1950. She was then named Tovarishch (Russian for \\"Comrade\\"See Wiktionary entry for —Ç–æ–≤–∞—Ä–∏—â) in 1951 and put into service as a training vessel. Her new home port was Odessa. She participated in many Tall Ships' Races and cruised far and wide on the seven seas. She made a voyage around the world in 1957 and won the Operation Sail race twice, in 1974 and 1976. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Tovarishch sailed under the Ukrainian flag (home port Kherson) until 1993, when she needed repairs and was deactivated for lack of funds. In 1995, she sailed from Kherson to Newcastle-upon-Tyne, where private sponsors wanted to have her repaired. This failed because of the high costs, and in 1999, the ship was transported to Wilhelmshaven, where she stayed in dock for four years until finally transferred to Stralsund in 2003. On 29 November 2003 the ship was re-christened Gorch Fock. As of 2011 the ship is in poor but stable condition. There is about six million dollars worth of restoration work required to bring this ship back to sailing condition. The museum had a dismal tourist season, resulting in a fifty thousand dollar loss in revenue from previous years. This has forced a layoff of five workers.

She was the first of a series of five sister ships built by Blohm & Voss, and a number of South American school ships are also based on the same design. Of the three original sister ships, only is an exact replica of Gorch Fock. Horst Wessel and are longer, and all three have slightly more powerful auxiliary engines. USCGC Eagle (ex Horst Wessel) Horst Wessel was launched in 1936--the growing Reichsmarine needed more school ships. Her home port was Kiel. At the end of World War II, she became one of several war reparations and was assigned to the United States After some repairs in Wilhelmshaven and Bremerhaven, she was sailed by her German crew including the Captain together with American sailors to her new home port of New London, Connecticut. Since then, she has sailed under the name for the United States Coast Guard. Sagres (ex Albert Leo Schlageter) Sagres at OpSail 2000 in New London, Connecticut where her sister ship Eagle is home- ported. Albert Leo Schlageter was launched on 30 October 1937. She was confiscated by the United States after World War II and then sold to Brazil, where she sailed as a school ship under the name Guanabara. In 1961, the Portuguese Navy bought her to replace the previous school ship Sagres (which was later transferred to Hamburg, where she is a museum ship under her original name Rickmer Rickmers). The Portuguese named her also. She still sails as of 2015, having completed a circumnavigation on 24 December 2010. Mircea Mircea at SAIL Amsterdam 2005 was built by Blohm & Voss for the Romanian Navy. She was launched in 1938 and has always sailed under the Romanian flag (except for a short period after World War II, when she was confiscated by the Soviet Union). She is the only one of the sister ships that is truly identical to Gorch Fock. She was overhauled at the Blohm & Voss shipyards in Hamburg in 1966, and she still sails . Herbert Norkus Named after the Hitler Youth martyr Herbert Norkus, another ship of the Gorch Fock design--with the same dimensions as Horst Wessel--was begun at the Blohm & Voss shipyard. However, the unfinished ship had to be launched prematurely on 7 November 1939 because the slipway had to be cleared to build submarines. The hull stayed in the harbor of Hamburg throughout World War II. It was damaged in a bomb raid in 1945, and instead of being sold to Brazil as had been considered, ended up being filled with gas grenades and sunk in the Skagerrak in 1947. The yards, which had been prepared, but not yet mounted, and the tackle, which had not yet been rigged, were later used for Gorch Fock built in 1958. Gorch Fock Gorch Fock of 1958 As Germany had lost all of its training vessels as war reparations after World War II, the West German Bundesmarine decided in 1957 to have a new training ship built following the plans for Gorch Fock. The new ship was a modernized rebuild of Horst Wessel. Coincidentally, her design had been influenced by another shipwreck: whereas the 1933 Gorch Fock was built in response to the Niobe disaster, the plans of SSS Gorch Fock were altered somewhat after the sinking of in 1957. The modern- day was launched on 23 August 1958 and commissioned on 17 December of that year. Latin American ships A number of similar ships have been built by the Astilleros Celaya S.A. shipyard in Bilbao for Latin American Navies, possibly following the Blohm & Voss design. The hulls and rigging of these ships are very similar, the main differences are in the superstructure and they also have larger tanks for both diesel and water, and they are also longer. These ships are (1967, Colombia), (1976, Ecuador), (1979, Venezuela), and (1982, Mexico).

Variations include rice rocket, referring most often to Japanese superbikes, rice machine, rice grinder or simply ricer. Riced out is an adjective denigrating a badly customized sports compact car, \\"usually with oversized or ill-matched exterior appointments\\". Rice boy is a US derogatory term for the driver or builder of an import-car hot rod. The terms may disparage cars or car enthusiasts as imposters, or wanna-bes, using cheap modifications to imitate appearance of high performance. The term is often defined as offensive or racist stereotyping. In some cases, users of the term assert that it is not offensive or racist, or else treat the term as a humorous, mild insult rather than a racial slur. Early usage 1917 to 1930s Examples of \\"rice burner\\" used literally, meaning one who burns rice or rice fields, as in stubble burning, date to 1917. In 1935 it appeared in a US newspaper caption in with a racial connotation, disparaging East Asian people. Korean War early 1950s Canadian troops in the Korean War initially referred to the Korean labor and support unit providing their food, water, ammunition and other supplies as \\"G Company\\" which was short for the racist slur gook. They quickly became known instead as \\"rice burners,\\" due to the Canadians' admiration for their Korean support unit's demonstrated strength and stamina in carrying loads over rough terrain, sometimes in snow and ice. While dehumanizing the Koreans as machines that ran on rice was a form of contempt, it was condescendingly approved by the men serving at the time as an improvement over the word it replaced. Comparably, Alaskan slang for a sled dog is \\"fish burner,\\" as in a beast of burden that runs on fish.

It was used in the US by \\"Detroit loyalists\\" to disparage more economical Japanese competitors of the US car industry during the 1970s energy crisis. It continued to appear in US publications through the 2002 to as a put-down for Japanese and other Asian cars.

First, he won the 2590 metre steeplechase, sprinting to the 800 metres title days later. Finally, he won the 1500 metres in a new world record. Later that day, he added a second place to his tally, when he competed with the Chicago Athletic Association in the 4 mile team event. In 1905, Lightbody won AAU titles in both the 800 and 1500 metres, and the following year he competed in his second Olympics, the 1906 Intercalated Games of in Athens.

The term was historically used in Bulgaria, Poland, and the Soviet Union, and remains in use today in 10 of the post-Soviet states. This type of locality has been used in all 15 member republics of the former Soviet Union since 1922 when it replaced a number of terms which could have been translated by the English term \\"town\\" (Russia - posad, Ukraine - , Belarus - (the last two are diminutives from and , correspondingly, similarly to being derived from ) and others). It was introduced later in Poland (1954) and Bulgaria (1964). All the urban-type settlements in Poland were transformed into other types of settlement (town or village) in 1972, while in Bulgaria and five of the post-Soviet republics (namely Armenia, Moldova, and the three Baltic states) - in the early 1990s. Today this term is still used in the other nine post-Soviet republics - Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan. What counts as an urban-type settlement differs between time periods and countries, and often between different divisions of a single country. However, the criteria generally focus on the presence of urban infrastructure or resort facilities for urban residents. Soviet Union In the Soviet Union the criteria of urban-type settlements were set independently by the Soviet Republics. Those criteria, however, only differed very slightly from one republic to another. Russian SFSR In the Russian SFSR, urban- type settlements were subdivided into three types: *Work settlements (): localities with factories, mining industry, power stations, construction industry, with population of at least 3,000 and with at least 85% of the population being workers, professionals, and the members of their families; *Resort settlements (): localities focusing on resort and health facilities (around beaches, mineral water spas, etc.), with population of at least 2,000, with at least 50% of the average annual population being non-permanent residents; *Suburban settlements (dacha settlements, ): settlements with a focus on private summer-time and weekend recreation, with no more than 25% of the permanent population being employed in the agricultural sector. Ukrainian SSR In 1981, the Verkhovna Rada of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic defined an urban-type settlement as follows: Official Decree of the Presidium of Verkhovna Rada of March 12, 1981 \\"To the category of an urban-type settlement may be included any settlement located near industrial enterprises, buildings, railroad connections, hydro-technical constructions, and enterprises in production and refining of agrarian products as well as settlements that include higher or middle occupation educational establishments, science-researching institutions, sanatoria, and other stationary treatment and recreation establishments that have a state housing provided to no less than 2,000 inhabitantsUkrainian Soviet Encyclopedia (–£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω—Å—å–∫–∞ —Ä–∞–¥—è–Ω—Å—å–∫–∞ –µ–Ω—Ü–∏–∫–ª–æ–ø–µ–¥—ñ—è), vol. 10, p. 94 , 1983 out of which no less than two-thirds consist of workers, servicemen, and their families. In exceptional cases, settlements could be classified to the category of urban- type settlements if they had a population less than 2,000, but more than 500; this happened when they had a close perspective of an economic and social development or a potential increase in number of people. The term was introduced in Ukraine in 1920s and became official since the resolution of the Central Executive Committee of Ukraine of October 28, 1925 replacing all towns (mistechko) as urban-type settlement.

In exceptional cases, administrative, economic and cultural centers with a potential of economical development and population growth can be classified as urban-type settlements. RussiaInhabited localities= In modern Russia, the task of deciding whether an inhabited locality meets the criteria of urban-type settlements is delegated to the federal subjects. In most cases, the federal subject's legislative body is responsible for all administrative and territorial changes, including granting and revoking of the urban-type settlement and town status. =Administrative divisions= Apart from being used to refer to a type of inhabited locality, the term \\"urban-type settlement\\" and its variations is also used to refer to a division of an administrative district, and sometimes to a division administratively subordinated to a city district of a city of federal subject significance. This kind of administrative division is equal in status to the towns of district significance and selsoviets, and is normally centered on an inhabited locality with urban-type settlement status. As of 2013, the following types of such entities are recognized: *Resort settlement (): in Nizhny Novgorod Oblast *Settlement (): in the Republic of Dagestan and the Sakha Republic; in Krasnoyarsk and Stavropol Krais *Settlement administration (): in Altai Krai *Settlement administrative okrug (): in Bryansk Oblast *Settlement council (): in the Republic of Bashkortostan and the Udmurt Republic; in Altai Krai; in Tambov Oblast *Settlement municipal formation (): in Leningrad Oblast *Settlement okrug (): in Krasnodar Krai; in Belgorod and Ulyanovsk Oblasts *Suburban settlement (): in Moscow and Omsk Oblasts *Urban settlement (): in the Chuvash Republic; in Amur, Rostov, Smolensk, Tver, and Voronezh Oblasts *Urban settlement (urban-type settlement) (): in Kostroma Oblast *Urban-type settlement (): in the Republic of Buryatia, the Chechen Republic, the Mari El Republic, and the Republic of Tatarstan; in Astrakhan, Kemerovo, Kirov, Murmansk, Nizhny Novgorod, Oryol, Sakhalin, Tula, Volgograd, and Vologda Oblasts *Urban-type settlement administrative territory (): in the Komi Republic *Urban-type settlement of district significance (): in Kaliningrad Oblast and Nenets Autonomous Okrug *Urban-type settlement (settlement council) (): in the Republic of Khakassia *Urban-type settlement under district jurisdiction (): in Kurgan Oblast *Urban-type settlement (urban settlement) (): in the Tuva Republic *Urban-type settlement with jurisdictional territory (): in Arkhangelsk Oblast *Work settlement (): in the Republic of Mordovia; in Krasnoyarsk Krai; in Belgorod, Chelyabinsk, Kursk, Moscow, Nizhny Novgorod, Novosibirsk, Omsk, Penza, Ryazan, and Yaroslavl Oblasts Ukraine=See also * Administrative divisions of Belarus * Administrative divisions of Georgia (country) * Administrative divisions of Ukraine * Subdivisions of Kyrgyzstan * Subdivisions of Russia References Category:Polish People's Republic Category:People's Republic of Bulgaria Category:Urban geography Category:Soviet phraseology Category:Administrative divisions of Russia ka:·Éì·Éê·Éë·Éê ","title":"Urban-type settlement"},{"id":"463456","text":"Hokusai is a town located in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan.

It is a majority Shia Arab district including Musayyib and Jurf Al Sakhr. The district capital is located about 70 kilometres (45 mi) south of Baghdad, near the Euphrates River. [Source: Liberation of Jurf Al Sakhar ] History In ancient times Alexandria stood halfway between Babylon (the place of Alexander's death) and Seleucia on the Tigris (the capital of the Seleucid Empire, very near to modern Baghdad). As of now, most of the town is made up of slums. Buildings are built from brick, mud, and sheet metal. The nearby city of Musayyib houses the largest power plant in Iraq, made by Russian engineers. The Hateen Munitions Complex located in and around Alexandria housed the majority of the munitions for the former regime. There are also apartments in Iskandariya, called the Hateen Apartments, which received their name from all the workers at the munitions plant living there. Saddam Hussein's nuclear programme During the late 1980s, Alexandria was the site of a major element of Saddam Hussein's programme to acquire nuclear weapons. The Al Qaqaa State Establishment, located in the town, is believed to have been put in charge of developing the non-nuclear components for a nuclear weapon. It was subsequently inspected by United Nations weapons inspectors and officials from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). In 1989, the British journalist Farzad Bazoft was arrested there after visiting Alexandria to check reports that an explosion at the Al Qaqaa plant had killed 7000 people. He was subsequently executed by the Iraqi authorities. The town is also the location of a major factory, the al-Quds General Company for Mechanical Industries. In 2001, the Iraqi government explored the possibility of establishing a joint Iraqi-Belarusian tractor factory on the site.

It fell quickly but was subsequently the scene of a number of lethal insurgent attacks against the occupying forces and the post-Saddam Iraqi security forces. On June 19, 2003, a soldier from the 804th Medical Brigade was killed when the military ambulance in which he was traveling was hit by a rocket propelled grenade near Alexandria. Another attack, on May 11, 2007, killed a soldier from the 18th Military Police Brigade. Three US Paratroopers from the Army's 82nd Airborne Division were killed by a roadside bomb on January 27, 2004 and another bombing on February 4 killed yet another soldier. Forward Operating Base Alexandria, or FOB Iskandariyah a U.S. Military installation was established in Alexandria in May 2003. On February 10, a car bomb outside a police station killed at least 45 Iraqis and wounded 150. No coalition forces were killed or injured, but commentators suggested that the attack was both a strike against pro-coalition Iraqi forces and an attempt to create conflict between Shia and Sunni Muslims. On March 25, 2016 a terrorist believed to be affiliated with Islamic State of Iraq blew himself up at a soccer game in this town. The incident happened during an award ceremony following the game. The blast reportedly killed at least 31 people and injured more than 70 others. The town's mayor was among the casualties. Video surfaced on the Internet which claimed to show the bombing.

It often reaches the alpine tree line in this area. The mature size is up to 35‚Äì40 m height, and 1.5 m trunk diameter. However, the height of the tree diminishes strongly near the upper forest limit and may even obtain shrub sizes. It is a member of the white pine group, Pinus subgenus Strobus, and like all members of that group, the leaves ('needles') are in fascicles (bundles) of five, with a deciduous sheath. They are 6‚Äì11 cm long. Its pine cones are mostly 8‚Äì16 cm long, occasionally up to 20 cm long, green at first, becoming yellow-brown when mature, with broad, flat to downcurved scales. The 6‚Äì7 mm long seeds have a 2 cm wing and can be wind-dispersed, but are also very often dispersed by spotted nutcrackers. Use Macedonian pine is one of the most valuable conifer species in the Balkan Peninsula. Its durable wood is highly valued in construction, furniture production, wood-carving and cooperage. The tree is also exceptionally good at adapting to severe mountain climate conditions, which makes it a valuable species for afforestation on high terrain for protection against erosion. The local population use P. peuce resin to cure wounds, pectoral, skin and stomach diseases, varicose veins and other illnesses. Macedonian pine is also a popular ornamental tree in parks and large gardens, giving reliable steady though not fast growth on a wide range of sites. It is very tolerant of severe winter cold, hardy down to at least -45 ¬∞C, and also of wind exposure. It is locally naturalised Punkaharju in eastern Finland.

It is a common resident breeder in parts of southern Africa. These insectivorous birds are usually found in forests or dense bush. They are aggressive and fearless birds, given their small size, at , and will attack much larger species if their nest or young are threatened. The male is mainly glossy black, although the wings are duller. The female is similar but less glossy. The bill is black and heavy, and the eye is red. This species is similar to the fork-tailed drongo, but is smaller, and the shorter tail lacks the deep fork which gives the latter species its name. The fork-tailed drongo is also typically found in more open habitat. The common square-tailed drongo has short legs and sits very upright whilst perched prominently, like a shrike. It flycatches or take prey from the ground. The call is a harsh '. Two to three eggs are laid in a cup nest in a fork high in a tree. Taxonomy The common square-tailed drongo was described by the Scottish zoologist Andrew Smith in 1834 from birds observed around Port Natal (now Durban) in South Africa. He coined the binomial name Edolius ludwigii. The specific epithet was chosen to honour the German botanist Baron von Ludwig who collected plants in South Africa between 1805 and 1847. It is now placed with the other drongos in the genus Dicrurus that was introduced by the French ornithologist Louis Pierre Vieillot in 1816. Based on the results of a molecular phylogenetic study published in 2018, the taxonomy of the square-tailed drongo complex was reorganised. Sharpe's drongo which had previously been treated as a subspecies of Dicrurus ludwigii was promoted to species rank becoming Dicrurus sharpei. But those birds previously in Dicrurus ludwigii sharpei occurring between Senegal and the Niger River were considered as a separate species, the western square-tailed drongo (Dicrurus occidentalis). The English name for Dicrurus ludwigii was changed from the \\"square-tailed drongo\\" to the \\"common square-tailed drongo\\".

Foreground: King Stanis≈Çaw August (left) enters St John's Cathedral, in Warsaw, where deputies will swear to uphold the Constitution. Background: the Royal Castle, where the Constitution has just been adopted. The Constitution of 3 May 1791 (; Belarusian: –ö–∞–Ω—Å—Ç—ã—Ç—É—Ü—ã—è 3 –º–∞—è, transcription: Kanstytucyja 3 maja; Balerusian Tara≈°kievica: –ö–∞–Ω—Å—Ç—ã—Ç—É—Ü—ã—è 3 —Ç—Ä–∞—û–Ω—è, transcription: Kanstytucyja 3 tra≈≠nia; ), formally titled the Governance Act (), was a constitution adopted by the Great Sejm (\\"Four-Year Sejm\\", meeting in 1788‚Äì92) for the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth, a dual monarchy comprising the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The Constitution was designed to correct the Commonwealth's political flaws. It had been preceded by a period of agitation for‚Äîand gradual introduction of‚Äîreforms, beginning with the Convocation Sejm of 1764 and the ensuing election that year of Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski, the Commonwealth's last king. The Constitution sought to implement a more effective constitutional monarchy, introduced political equality between townspeople and nobility, and placed the peasants under the government's protection, mitigating the worst abuses of serfdom. It banned pernicious parliamentary institutions such as the liberum veto, which had put the Sejm at the mercy of any single deputy, who could veto and thus undo all the legislation adopted by that Sejm. The Commonwealth's neighbours reacted with hostility to the adoption of the Constitution. King Frederick William II broke Prussia's alliance with the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. He joined with Catherine the Great's Imperial Russia and the Targowica Confederation of anti- reform Polish magnates to defeat the Commonwealth in the Polish‚ÄìRussian War of 1792. The 1791 Constitution was in force for less than 19 months. It was declared null and void by the Grodno Sejm that met in 1793, though the Sejm's legal power to do so was questionable. The Second and Third Partitions of Poland (1793, 1795) ultimately ended Poland's sovereign existence until the close of World War I in 1918. Over those 123 years, the 1791 Constitution helped keep alive Polish aspirations for the eventual restoration of the country's sovereignty. In the words of two of its principal authors, Ignacy Potocki and Hugo Ko≈Ç≈ÇƒÖtaj, the 1791 Constitution was \\"the last will and testament of the expiring Homeland.\\" The Constitution of 3 May 1791 combined a monarchic republic with a clear division of executive, legislative, and judiciary powers. It is generally considered Europe's first and the world's second, modern written national constitution, after the United States Constitution that had come into force in 1789.  Background  Polish constitutionalism can be traced to the 13th century, when government by consensus and representation was already well established in the young Polish state. The emergence of parliamentary bodies, the sejm and sejmiki, followed. By the 17th century, Poland's legal and political tradition was characterized as parliamentary institutions and a system of checks and balances on state power, which was itself limited by decentralization. The idea of a contractual state embodied in texts like the Henrician Articles and the Pacta conventa; the concept of individual liberties; and the notion that the monarch owed duties to his subjects. This system, which primarily benefited the Polish nobility (Szlachta), came to be known as the \\"nobles' democracy.\\"  End of Golden Age  The 1791 Constitution was a response to the increasingly perilous situation in the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth, which had been a major European power only a century earlier and was still the largest state on the continent. In the 1590s, at the peak of the nobles' democracy, King Sigismund III Vasa's court preacherthe Jesuit Piotr Skargahad condemned the weaknesses of the Commonwealth. In the same period, writers and philosophers such as Andrzej Frycz Modrzewski and Wawrzyniec Grzyma≈Ça Go≈õlicki, and the egzekucja praw (Execution-of-the-Laws) reform movement led by Jan Zamoyski had advocated political reforms. In 1656, Sigismund's son King John II Casimir Vasa made a solemn vow at the 'old' Lw√≥w Cathedral on behalf of the entire Republic of Poland, that he would free the Polish peasants \\"from the unjust burdens and oppression.\\" As he was struggling with the Sejm, in 1661 John Casimirwhose reign saw highly destructive wars and obstructionism by the nobilitycorrectly predicted that the Commonwealth was in danger of a partition by Russia, Brandenburg and Austria. Rejtan, by Matejko. In September 1773, Tadeusz Rejtan (lower right) had tried to prevent ratification of the First Partition of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth by barring other Sejm deputies from entering the Sejm chamber. As the Sejm failed to implement sufficient reforms, the state machinery became increasingly dysfunctional. A significant cause of the Commonwealth's downfall was the liberum veto (\\"free veto\\"), which, since 1652, had allowed any Sejm deputy to nullify all the legislation enacted by that Sejm. As a result, deputies bribed by magnates or foreign powersprimarily from the Russian Empire, the Kingdom of Prussia and Franceor deputies who believed they were living in an unprecedented \\"Golden Age\\" paralysed the Commonwealth's government for over a century. The threat of the liberum veto could only be overridden by the establishment of a \\"confederated sejm\\", which was immune to the liberum veto. Declaring that a sejm either constituted a \\"confederation\\" or belonged to one was a contrivance prominently used by foreign interests in the 18th century to force a legislative outcome. By the early 18th century, the magnates of Poland and Lithuania controlled the state, ensuring that no reforms that might weaken their privileged status (the \\"Golden Freedoms\\") would be enacted. The ineffective monarchs who were elected to the Commonwealth throne in the early 18th century, Augustus II the Strong and Augustus III of Poland of the House of Wettin, did not improve matters. The Wettins, used to the absolute rule practiced in their native Saxony, tried to govern through intimidation and the use of force, which led to a series of conflicts between their supporters and opponentsincluding another pretender to the Polish throne, King Stanis≈Çaw Leszczy≈Ñski. Those conflicts often took the form of confederationslegal rebellions against the king permitted under the Golden Freedomsincluding the Warsaw Confederation (1704), Sandomierz Confederation, Tarnogr√≥d Confederation, Dzik√≥w Confederation and the War of the Polish Succession. Only 8 out of 18 Sejm sessions during the reign of Augustus II (1694‚Äì1733) passed legislation. For 30 years during the reign of Augustus III, only one session was able to pass legislation. The government was near collapse, giving rise to the term \\"Polish anarchy\\", and the country was managed by provincial assemblies and magnates. Other reform attempts in the Wettin era were led by individuals such as Stanis≈Çaw Dunin-Karwicki, Stanis≈Çaw A. Szczuka, Kazimierz Karwowski and Micha≈Ç J√≥zef Massalski; these mostly proved to be futile.  Early reforms  King Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski, principal author of the Constitution of 3 May 1791. A year later, he acquiesced in its demise; this was seen by Constitution defenders as high treason, per the Constitution's Article VII and section six (sexto) of Article VIII, and per the Declaration of the Assembled Estates, of 5 May 1791. The Enlightenment greatly affected the thinking of influential Commonwealth circles during the reign (1764‚Äì95) of its last king, Stanis≈Çaw II August Poniatowski. The King was an \\"enlightened\\" Polish magnate who had been a deputy to several Sejms between 1750 and 1764 and had a deeper understanding of Polish politics than previous monarchs. The Convocation Sejm of 1764, which elected Poniatowski to the throne, was controlled by the reformist Czartoryski Familia and was backed by Russian military forces invited by the Czartoryskis. In exchange for passing decrees favorable to them, the Russians and Prussians let the confederated Convocation Sejm enact a number of reforms, including the weakening of the liberum veto and its no longer applying to treasury and economic matters. A more comprehensive reform package was presented by Andrzej Zamoyski, but opposition from Prussia, Russia, and the Polish nobility thwarted this ambitious program, which had proposed deciding all motions by majority vote. In part because his election had been imposed by Empress Catherine the Great, Poniatowski's political position was weak from the start. He proceeded with cautious reforms, such as the establishment of fiscal and military ministries and the introduction of a national customs tariff, which was soon abandoned due to opposition from Prussia's Frederick the Great. These measures had already been authorized by the Convocation Sejm; more legislative and executive improvements inspired by the Familia or the King were implemented during and after the 1764 Sejm. From his election, King Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski worked to develop an executive government council. In 1775 the Partition Sejm established a Permanent Council, after Russia's Catherine the Great concluded it would serve her purposes. The Commonwealth's magnates viewed reform with suspicion and neighboring powers, content with the deterioration of the Commonwealth, abhorred the thought of a resurgent and democratic power on their borders. With the Commonwealth Army reduced to around 16,000, it was easy for its neighbors to intervene directlythe Imperial Russian Army numbered 300,000 and the Prussian Army and Imperial Austrian Army had 200,000 each. Russia's Empress Catherine and Prussia's King Frederick II provoked a conflict between members of the Sejm and the King over civil rights for religious minorities, such as Protestants and Greek Orthodox whose positions, which were guaranteed equal with the Catholic majority by the Warsaw Confederation of 1573, had worsened considerably. Catherine and Frederick declared their support for the szlachta and their \\"liberties\\", and by October 1767 Russian troops had assembled outside Warsaw in support of the conservative Radom Confederation. The King and his adherents had little choice but to acquiesce to Russian demands. During the Repnin Sejm (named after the unofficially presiding Russian ambassador Nicholas Repnin) the King accepted the five \\"eternal and invariable principles\\" which Catherine had vowed to \\"protect for all time to come in the name of Poland's liberties\\": the election of kings, the right of liberum veto, the right to renounce allegiance to and raise rebellion against the king (rokosz), the szlachta exclusive right to hold office and land, and landowners' power over their peasants. Thus all the privileges (\\"Golden Freedoms\\") of the nobility that had made the Commonwealth ungovernable were guaranteed as unalterable in the Cardinal Laws. The Cardinal Laws and the rights of \\"religious dissenters\\" passed by the Repnin Sejm were personally guaranteed by Empress Catherine. By these acts of legislation, for the first time, Russia formally intervened in the Commonwealth's constitutional affairs. During the 1768 Sejm, Repnin showed his disregard for local resistance by arranging the abduction and imprisonment of Kajetan So≈Çtyk, J√≥zef A. Za≈Çuski, Wac≈Çaw Rzewuski and Seweryn Rzewuski, all vocal opponents of foreign domination and the recently proclaimed policies. The Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth had legally and practically become a protectorate of the Russian Empire. Nonetheless, several minor beneficial reforms were adopted, political rights of the religious minorities were restored and the need for more reforms was becoming increasingly recognized. (Four-Year) Sejm (1788‚Äì92) and Senate adopted the 3 May Constitution at Warsaw's Royal Castle. King Stanis≈Çaw August's acquiescence to the Russian intervention encountered some opposition. On 29 February 1768, several magnatesincluding J√≥zef Pu≈Çaski and his young son Kazimierz Pu≈Çaski (Casimir Pulaski)vowing to oppose Russian influence, declared Stanis≈Çaw August a lackey of Russia and Catherine, and formed a confederation at the town of Bar. The Bar Confederation focused on limiting the influence of foreigners in Commonwealth affairs, and being pro-Catholic was generally opposed to religious tolerance. It began a civil war to overthrow the King, but its irregular forces were overwhelmed by Russian intervention in 1772. The defeat of the Bar Confederation set the scene for the partition treaty of 5 August 1772, which was signed at Saint Petersburg by Russia, Prussia and Austria. The treaty divested the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth of about a third of its territory and populationover and 4 million people. The three powers justified their annexation, citing anarchy in the Commonwealth and its refusal to cooperate with its neighbors' efforts to restore order. King Stanis≈Çaw August yielded and on 19 April 1773, he called the Sejm into session. Only 102 of about 200 deputies attended what became known as the Partition Sejm. The rest were aware of the King's decision and refused. Despite protests from the deputy Tadeusz Rejtan and others, the treatylater known as the First Partition of Polandwas ratified. Royal Castle Senate Chamber, where the 3 May Constitution was adopted The first of the three successive 18th-century partitions of Commonwealth territory that would eventually remove Poland's sovereignty shocked the Commonwealth's inhabitants and made it clear to progressive minds that the Commonwealth must either reform or perish. In the thirty years before the Constitution, there was a rising interest among progressive thinkers in constitutional reform. Before the First Partition, a Polish noble, Micha≈Ç Wielhorski was sent to France by the Bar Confederation to ask the philosophes Gabriel Bonnot de Mably and Jean-Jacques Rousseau for their suggestions on a new constitution for a reformed Poland. Mably submitted his recommendations Du gouvernement et des lois en Pologne (The Government and Laws of Poland) in 1770‚Äì71, whereas Rousseau finished his Considerations on the Government of Poland in 1772 when the First Partition was already underway. Works advocating the need for reform and presenting specific solutions were published in the Commonwealth by Polish‚ÄìLithuanian thinkers: On an Effective Way of Councils or on the Conduct of Ordinary Sejms (1761‚Äì63), by Stanis≈Çaw Konarski, founder of the Collegium Nobilium; Political Thoughts on Civil Liberties (1775) and Patriotic Letters (1778‚Äì78), by J√≥zef Wybicki, author of the lyrics of the Polish National Anthem; (Anonymous Letters to Stanis≈Çaw Ma≈Çachowski (1788‚Äì89) and The Political Law of the Polish Nation (1790), by Hugo Ko≈Ç≈ÇƒÖtaj, head of the Ko≈Ç≈ÇƒÖtaj's Forge party; and Remarks on the Life of Jan Zamoyski (1787), by Stanis≈Çaw Staszic. Ignacy Krasicki's satires of the Great Sejm era were also seen as crucial to giving the constitution moral and political support. A new wave of reforms supported by progressive magnates such as the Czartoryski family and King Stanis≈Çaw August were introduced at the Partition Sejm. The most important included the 1773 establishment of the Commission of National Education (Komisja Edukacji Narodowej)the first ministry of education in the world. New schools were opened, uniform textbooks were printed, teachers received better education and poor students were provided with scholarships. The Commonwealth's military was to be modernized and funding to create a larger standing army was agreed. Economic and commercial reformsincluding some intended to cover the increased military budget previously shunned as unimportant by the szlachtawere introduced. A new executive assembly, the 36-strong Permanent Council comprising five ministries with limited legislative powers, was established, giving the Commonwealth a governing body in constant session between Sejms and therefore immune to their liberum veto disruptions. In 1776, the Sejm commissioned former chancellor Andrzej Zamoyski to draft a new legal code. By 1780, he and his collaborators had produced the Zamoyski Code (Zbi√≥r praw sƒÖdowych). It would have strengthened royal power, made all officials answerable to the Sejm, placed the clergy and their finances under state supervision, and deprived landless szlachta of many of their legal immunities. The Code would also have improved the situation of non-noblestownspeople and peasants. Zamoyski's progressive legal code, containing elements of constitutional reform, met with opposition from native conservative szlachta and foreign powers; the 1780 Sejm did not adopt it.  Constitution's adoption  An opportunity for reform occurred during the \\"Great Sejm\\"also called the \\"Four-Year Sejm\\"of 1788‚Äì92, which began on 6 October 1788 with 181 deputies. In accordance with the Constitution's preamble, from 1790 it met \\"in dual number\\" when 171 newly elected deputies joined the earlier-established Sejm. On its second day, the body became a confederated sejm to avoid the liberum veto. Concurrent world events appeared to have been opportune for the reformers. Russia and Austria were at war with the Ottoman Empire, and the Russians found themselves simultaneously fighting in the Russo-Swedish War, 1788‚Äì1790. A new alliance between the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth and Prussia seemed to provide security against Russian intervention, and King Stanis≈Çaw August drew closer to leaders of the reform-minded Patriotic Party. The Sejm passed few major reforms in its first two years, but the subsequent two years brought more substantial changes. The Sejm adopted the 1791 Free Royal Cities Act, which was formally incorporated into the final constitution. This act addressed a number of matters related to the cities, crucially expanding burghers' (i.e., townspeople's) rights, including electoral rights. While the Sejm comprised representatives of the nobility and clergy, the reformers were supported by the burghers, who in late 1789 organized in Warsaw a \\"Black Procession\\" demanding full political enfranchisement of the bourgeoisie. On 18 April 1791 the Sejmfearing that the burghers' protests, if ignored, could turn violent, as they had in France not long beforeadopted the Free Royal Cities Act. The new constitution was drafted by the King, with contributions from Ignacy Potocki, Hugo Ko≈Ç≈ÇƒÖtaj and others. The King is credited with writing the general provisions and Ko≈Ç≈ÇƒÖtaj with giving the document its final shape. Stanis≈Çaw August wanted the Commonwealth to become a constitutional monarchy similar to that of Great Britain, with a strong central government based on a strong monarch. Potocki wanted the Sejm to be the strongest branch of government. Ko≈Ç≈ÇƒÖtaj wanted a \\"gentle\\" revolution, carried out without violence, to enfranchise other social classes in addition to the nobility. The proposed reforms were opposed by the conservatives, including the Hetmans' Party. Threatened with violence by their opponents, the advocates of the draft began the debate on the Government Act two days early, while many opposing deputies were away on Easter recess. The debate and subsequent adoption of the Government Act was executed as a quasi-coup d'√©tat. No recall notices were sent to known opponents of reform, while many pro- reform deputies secretly returned early. The royal guard under the command of the King's nephew Prince J√≥zef Poniatowski were positioned about the Royal Castle, where the Sejm was gathered, to prevent opponents from disrupting the proceedings. On 3 May, the Sejm convened with only 182 members, about half its \\"dual\\" number. The bill was read and overwhelmingly adopted, to the enthusiasm of the crowds outside. A protest was submitted the next day by a small group of deputies, but on 5 May the matter was officially concluded and protests were invalidated by the Constitutional Deputation of the Sejm. It was the first time in the 18th century that a constitutional act had been passed in the Commonwealth without the involvement of foreign powers. Soon after, the Friends of the Constitution (Zgromadzenie Przyjaci√≥≈Ç Konstytucji RzƒÖdowej)which included many participants in the Great Sejmwas organised to defend the reforms already enacted and to promote further ones. It is now regarded as the first modern-style political party in Poland's history. The response to the new constitution was less enthusiastic in the provinces, where the Hetmans' Party enjoyed considerable influence. General support among the middle nobility was crucial and still very substantial; most of the provincial sejmiks deliberating in 1791 and early 1792 supported the constitution.  Features  3 May Constitution, printed in Warsaw, 1791 The Constitution of 3 May 1791 reflected Enlightenment influences, including Rousseau's concept of the social contract and Montesquieu's advocacy of a balance of powers among three branches of government‚Äîlegislative, executive, and judicial‚Äîand of a bicameral legislature. As stated in Article V of the 3 May 1791 Constitution, the government was to ensure that \\"the integrity of the states, civil liberty, and social order shall always remain in equilibrium.\\" Jacek Jƒôdruch writes that the liberality of the 3 May 1791 Constitution's provisions \\"fell somewhere below [that of] the French Constitution of 1791, above [that of Canada's] Constitutional Act of 1791, and left the [1794] General State Laws for the Prussian States far behind, but did not equal [that of] the American Constitution [that went into force in 1789].\\" King Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski was reported to have said that the 3 May 1791 Constitution was \\"founded principally on those of England and the United States of America, but avoiding the faults and errors of both, and adapted as much as possible to the local and particular circumstances of the country.\\" However, Polish historians report the Constitution as having been described as \\"based mainly on the United States Constitution, but minus the latter's flaws, and adapted to Poland's circumstances.\\" George Sanford writes that the Constitution of 3 May 1791 provided \\"a constitutional monarchy close to the English model of the time.\\" Article I acknowledged the Roman Catholic faith as the \\"dominant religion\\" but guaranteed tolerance and freedom to all religions. It was less progressive than the 16th-century Warsaw Confederation, and placed Poland clearly within the Catholic sphere of influence. Article II confirmed many old privileges of the nobility, stressing that all nobles were equal and should enjoy personal security and the right to property. Article III stipulated that the earlier Free Royal Cities Act (Miasta Nasze Kr√≥lewskie Wolne w Pa≈Ñstwach Rzeczypospolitej), of 18 (or 21) April 1791, was integral to the Constitution. Personal securityneminem captivabimus, the Polish version of habeas corpuswas extended to townspeople (including Jews). Townspeople also gained the right to acquire landed property and became eligible for military officers' commissions and public offices, such as reserved seats in the Sejm and seats in the executive commissions of the Treasury, Police, and Judiciary. Membership in the nobility (szlachta) was also made easier for burghers to acquire. With half a million burghers in the Commonwealth now substantially enfranchised, political power became more equally distributed. Little power was given to the less politically conscious or active classes, such as Jews and peasants. Article IV placed the Commonwealth's peasantry under the protection of the national lawa first step toward enfranchising the country's largest and most oppressed social class. Their low status compared to other classes was not eliminated, as the constitution did not abolish serfdom. The Second Partition and Ko≈õciuszko's Proclamation of Po≈Çaniec in 1794 would later begin to abolish serfdom. Article V stated that \\"all power in civil society [should be] derived from the will of the people.\\" The constitution referred to the country's \\"citizens,\\" which for the first time included townspeople and peasants. The document's preamble and 11 individual articles introduced the principle of popular sovereignty applied to the nobility and townspeople, and the separation of powers into legislative (a bicameral Sejm), executive (\\"the King and the Guardians,\\" the Guardians of the Laws being the newly established top governmental entity) and judicial branches. It advanced the democratization of the polity by limiting the excessive legal immunities and political prerogatives of landless nobility. Legislative power, as defined in Article VI, rested with the bicameral parliament (an elected Sejm and an appointed Senate) and the king. The Sejm met every two years, and when required by national emergency. Its lower chamberthe Chamber of Deputies (Izba Poselska)had 204 deputies (2 from each powiat, 68 each from the provinces of Greater Poland, Lesser Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania) and 21 plenipotentiaries from royal cities (7 from each province). The royal chancellery was to inform the sejmiks of the legislation it intended to propose in advance, so deputies could prepare for the discussions. The Sejm's upper chamberthe Chamber of Senators (Izba Senacka)had between 130 and 132 (sources vary) senators (voivodes, castellans, and bishops, as well as governments ministers without the right to vote). The king presided over the Senate and had one vote, which could be used to break ties. The king and all deputies had legislative initiative, and most mattersknown as general laws, and divided into constitutional, civil, criminal, and those for the institution of perpetual taxesrequired a simple majority, first from the lower chamber, then the upper. Specialized resolutions, including treaties of alliance, declarations of war and peace, ennoblements and increases in national debt, needed a majority of both chambers voting jointly. The Senate had a suspensive veto over laws that the Sejm passed, valid until the next Sejm session, when it could be overruled. Article VI recognized the Prawo o sejmikach, the act on regional assemblies (sejmiks) passed on 24 March 1791. By reducing the enfranchisement of the noble classes, this law introduced major changes to the electoral ordinance. Previously, all nobles had been eligible to vote in sejmiks, which de facto meant that many of the poorest, landless noblesknown as \\"clients\\" or \\"clientele\\" of local magnatesvoted as the magnates bade them. Now right to vote was tied to a property qualification: one had to own or lease land and pay taxes, or be closely related to somebody who did, to vote. 300,000 of 700,000 previously eligible nobles were thus disfranchised. Voting rights were restored to landowners in military service. They had lost these rights in 1775. Voting was limited to men aged at least 18. The eligible voters elected deputies to local powiats, or county sejmiks, which elected deputies to the General Sejm. Finally, Article VI explicitly abolished several institutional sources of government weakness and national anarchy, including the liberum veto, confederations and confederated sejms, and the excessive influence of sejmiks stemming from the previously binding nature of their instructions to their Sejm deputies. The confederations were declared \\"contrary to the spirit of this constitution, subversive of government and destructive of society.\\" Thus the new constitution strengthened the powers of the Sejm, moving the country towards a constitutional monarchy. Executive power, according to Article V and Article VII, was in the hands of \\"the King in his council,\\" a cabinet of ministers that was called the Guardians of the Laws (or Guard of the Laws, Stra≈º Praw). The ministries could not create or interpret laws, and all acts of the foreign ministry were provisional and subject to Sejm approval. The King presided over his council, which comprised the Roman Catholic Primate of Polandwho was also president of the Education Commissionand five ministers appointed by the King: a minister of police, a minister of the seal (internal affairs), a minister of foreign affairs, a minister belli (of war), and a minister of treasury. Council members also includedwithout a votethe Crown Prince, the Marshal of the Sejm, and two secretaries. This royal council descended from similar councils that had functioned since King Henry's Articles (1573), and from the recent Permanent Council. Acts of the King required the countersignature of the pertinent minister. A minister was required to countersign a law, unless all other ministers endorsed his objection to that law. In that case, the King could withdraw the law or press the issue by presenting it to parliament. The stipulation that the King, \\"doing nothing of himself, ... shall be answerable for nothing to the nation,\\" parallels the British constitutional principle that \\"The King can do no wrong.\\" (In both countries, the pertinent minister was responsible for the King's acts.) The ministers were responsible to the Sejm, which could dismiss them by a two-thirds vote of no confidence of both houses. Ministers could also be held accountable by the Sejm Court, where a simple-majority vote sufficed to impeach a minister. The King was the nation's commander-in-chief; there is no mention of hetmans (the previous highest- ranking military commanders). The King had the right to grant pardons, except in cases of treason. The royal council's decisions were implemented by commissions, whose members were elected by the Sejm. Lithuanian The Constitution changed the government from an elective to a hereditary monarchy. This provision was intended to reduce the destructive influence of foreign powers at each election. The royal dynasty was elective, and if one were to cease, a new family would be chosen by the nation. The king reigned by the \\"grace of God and the will of the Nation,\\" and \\"all authority derives from the will of the Nation.\\" The institution of pacta conventa was preserved. On Stanis≈Çaw August's death the Polish throne would become hereditary and pass to Frederick Augustus I of Saxony of the House of Wettin, which had provided the two kings before Stanis≈Çaw August. This provision was contingent upon Frederic Augustus' consent. He declined when Adam Czartoryski offered him the throne. Discussed in Article VIII, the judiciary was separated from the two other branches of the government, and was to be served by elective judges. Courts of first instance existed in each voivodeship and were in constant session, with judges elected by the regional sejmik assemblies. Appellate tribunals were established for the provinces, based on the reformed Crown Tribunal and Lithuanian Tribunal. The Sejm elected from its deputies the judges for the Sejm Court, a precursor to the modern State Tribunal of Poland. Referendary courts were established in each province to hear the cases of the peasantry. Municipal courts, described in the law on towns, complemented this system. Article IX covered procedures for regency, which should be taken up jointly by the council of the Guardians, headed by the Queen, or in her absence by the Primate. Article X stressed the importance of education of royal children and tasked the Commission of National Education with this responsibility. The last article of the constitution, Article XI, concerned the national standing army. Said army was defined as a \\"defensive force\\" dedicated \\"solely to the nation's defense.\\" The army was to be increased in strength to 100,000 men. To further enhance the Commonwealth's integration and security, the Constitution abolished the erstwhile union of Poland and Lithuania in favor of a unitary state. Its full establishment, supported by Stanis≈Çaw August and Ko≈ÇlƒÖtaj, was opposed by many Lithuanian deputies. As a compromise, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania received numerous privileges guaranteeing its continued existence. Related acts included the Declaration of the Assembled Estates (Deklaracja Stan√≥w Zgromadzonych) of 5 May 1791, confirming the Government Act adopted two days earlier, and the Mutual Pledge of the Two Nations (Zarƒôczenie Wzajemne Obojga Narod√≥w), i.e., of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, of 22 October 1791, affirming the unity and indivisibility of Poland and Lithuania within a single state and their equal representation in state-governing bodies. The Mutual Pledge strengthened the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian union while keeping many federal aspects of the state intact. English edition, London, 1791 The 3 May Constitution was translated into the Lithuanian language, marking a major change in the upper classes' thinking, and signalling efforts to modernize the State.\\"[T]he Constitution was translated into the Lithuanian language. The Constitution was the first state law to be issued in Lithuanian. This marked the start of the Lithuanian language's entry into the State Chancellery: documents of the Kosciuszko Uprising were issued [in Vilnius and elsewhere] in Lithuanian, and the need to use the Lithuanian language became clear among the Constitution's supporters.\\" Tomas Baranauskas: KƒÖ Lietuvai rei≈°kƒó Gegu≈æƒós 3-osios Konstitucija? \\"Vienalaikis Konstitucijos vertimas ƒØ lietuvi≈≥ kalbƒÖ yra reik≈°mingas m≈´s≈≥ istorijos faktas ‚Äì Gegu≈æƒós 3-osios Konstitucija buvo pirmasis valstybƒós ƒØstatymas, netrukus po jos priƒómimo i≈°verstas ƒØ lietuvi≈≥ kalbƒÖ.

The Constitution provided for potential amendments, which were to be addressed at an extraordinary Sejm to be held every 25 years. The Constitution remained to the last a work in progress. The Government Act was fleshed out in a number of laws passed in May and June 1791: on sejm courts (two acts of 13 May), the Guardians of the Laws (1 June), the national police commission (a ministry, 17 June), and municipal administration (24 June). The Constitution's co-author Hugo Ko≈Ç≈ÇƒÖtaj announced that work was underway on \\"an economic constitution ... guaranteeing all rights of property [and] securing protection and honor to all manner of labor ...\\" A third planned basic law was mentioned by Ko≈Ç≈ÇƒÖtaj: a \\"moral constitution,\\" most likely a Polish analog to the United States Bill of Rights and the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. The Constitution called for the preparation of a new civil and criminal code, tentatively called the Stanis≈Çaw August Code. The King also planned a reform improving the situation of the Jews.  Aftermath: war and final two Partitions  The constitutional formal procedures were performed for little over a year before being stopped by Russian armies allied with conservative Polish nobility in the Polish‚ÄìRussian War of 1792, also known as the War in Defense of the Constitution. With the wars between Turkey and Russia and Sweden and Russia having ended, Empress Catherine was furious over the adoption of the document, which she believed threatened Russian influence in Poland. Russia had viewed Poland as a de facto protectorate. \\"The worst possible news have arrived from Warsaw: the Polish king has become almost sovereign\\" was the reaction of one of Russia's chief foreign policy authors, Alexander Bezborodko, when he learned of the new constitution. The contacts of Polish reformers with the Revolutionary French National Assembly were seen by Poland's neighbors as evidence of a revolutionary conspiracy and a threat to the absolute monarchies. The Prussian statesman Ewald von Hertzberg expressed the fears of European conservatives: \\"The Poles have given the coup de gr√¢ce to the Prussian monarchy by voting a constitution\\", elaborating that a strong Commonwealth would likely demand return of the lands that Prussia had acquired in the First Partition. Magnates who had opposed the constitution draft from the start, Franciszek Ksawery Branicki, Stanis≈Çaw Szczƒôsny Potocki, Seweryn Rzewuski, and Szymon and J√≥zef Kossakowski, asked Tsarina Catherine to intervene and restore their privilegesthe Cardinal Laws abolished under the new statute. To that end these magnates formed the Targowica Confederation. The Confederation's proclamation, prepared in St. Petersburg in January 1792, criticized the constitution for contributing to \\"contagion of democratic ideas\\" following \\"the fatal examples set in Paris.\\" It asserted that \\"The parliament ... has broken all fundamental laws, swept away all liberties of the gentry and on the third of May 1791 turned into a revolution and a conspiracy.\\" The Confederates declared an intention to overcome this revolution. We \\"can do nothing but turn trustingly to Tsarina Catherine, a distinguished and fair empress, our neighboring friend and ally\\", who \\"respects the nation's need for well-being and always offers it a helping hand\\", they wrote. Russian armies entered Poland and Lithuania, starting the Polish‚ÄìRussian War of 1792. The Sejm voted to increase the army of the Commonwealth to 100,000 men, but owing to insufficient time and funds this number was never achieved and soon abandoned even as a goal. The Polish King and the reformers could field only a 37,000-man army, many of them untested recruits. This army, under the command of J√≥zef Poniatowski and Tadeusz Ko≈õciuszko, defeated or fought to a draw the Russians on several occasions, but in the end, a defeat loomed inevitable. Despite Polish requests, Prussia refused to honor its alliance obligations. Stanis≈Çaw August's attempts at negotiations with Russia proved futile. As the front lines kept shifting to the west and in July 1792 Warsaw was threatened with siege by the Russians, the King came to believe that victory was impossible against the numerically superior enemy, and that surrender was the only alternative to total defeat. Having received assurances from the Russian ambassador Yakov Bulgakov that no territorial changes will occur, the Guardians of the Laws cabinet voted 8:4 to surrender. On 24 July 1792, King Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski joined the Targowica Confederation, as the Empress had demanded. The Polish Army disintegrated. Many reform leaders, believing their cause was for now lost, went into self-imposed exile. Some hoped that Stanis≈Çaw August would be able to negotiate an acceptable compromise with the Russians, as he had done in the past. But the King had not saved the Commonwealth and neither had the Targowica Confederates, who governed the country for a short while. To their surprise, the Grodno Sejm, bribed or intimidated by the Russian troops, enacted the Second Partition of Poland. On 23 November 1793, it concluded its deliberations under duress, annulling the constitution and acceding to the Second Partition. Russia took , while Prussia took . The Commonwealth now comprised no more than . What was left of the Commonwealth was merely a small buffer state with a puppet king, and Russian garrisons keeping an eye on the reduced Polish army. For a year and a half, Polish patriots waited while planning an insurrection. On 24 March 1794 in Krak√≥w, Tadeusz Ko≈õciuszko declared what has come to be known as the Ko≈õciuszko Uprising. On 7 May, he issued the Proclamation of Po≈Çaniec (Uniwersa≈Ç Po≈Çaniecki), granting freedom to the peasants and ownership of land to all who fought in the insurrection. Revolutionary tribunals administered summary justice to those deemed traitors to the Commonwealth. After initial victories at the Battle of Rac≈Çawice (April 4), the capture of Warsaw (18 April) and the Wilno (22 April)the Uprising was crushed when the forces of Russia, Austria and Prussia joined in a military intervention. Historians consider the Uprising's defeat to have been a foregone conclusion in face of the superiority in numbers and resources of the three invading powers. The defeat of Ko≈õciuszko's forces led in 1795 to the third and final partition of the Commonwealth.  Legacy = Historic importance  Ruined chapel containing cornerstone for Temple of Divine Providence, laid 3 May 1792 by King Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski and his brother, the Catholic Primate of Poland Micha≈Ç Jerzy Poniatowski, to commemorate the Constitution of 3 May 1791. Work on Temple had only begun when Poland was invaded by Russian Imperial Army. Chapel is now within Warsaw University Botanical Garden. The Constitution of 3 May 1791 has been both idealized, and criticized for either not going far enough or being too radical. As its provisions remained in force for only 18 months and 3 weeks, its influence was, in any case, limited. However, for generations, the memory of the Constitutionrecognized by political scientists as a progressive document for its timehelped keep alive Polish aspirations for an independent and just society, and continued to inform the efforts of its authors' descendants. Bronis≈Çaw Dembi≈Ñski, a Polish constitutional scholar, wrote a century later that \\"The miracle of the Constitution did not save the state but did save the nation.\\" In Poland the Constitution is mythologized and viewed as a national symbol and as the culmination of the Enlightenment in Polish history and culture. In the words of two of its authors, Ignacy Potocki and Hugo Ko≈Ç≈ÇƒÖtaj, it was \\"the last will and testament of the expiring Homeland.\\" Since Poland's recovery of independence in 1918, the 3 May anniversary of the Constitution's adoption has been observed as the country's most important civil holiday. The 3 May Constitution was a milestone in the history of law and in the growth of democracy. The 18th-century Irish statesman Edmund Burke described it as \\"the noblest benefit received by any nation at any time ... Stanislas II has earned a place among the greatest kings and statesmen in history.\\" The 3 May Constitution was the first to follow the 1788 ratification of the United States Constitution. Poland and the United States, though geographically distant from each other, showed similar approaches to the designing of political systems. The 3 May Constitution has been called the second constitution in world history. Constitutional-law expert Albert Blaustein calls it the \\"world's second national constitution\\", and Bill Moyers writes that it was \\"Europe's first codified national constitution (and the second oldest in the world).\\" Historian Norman Davies calls it \\"the first constitution of its type in Europe.\\" The 3 May Constitution and the Great Sejm that adopted it have been the subjects of a large body of works by Polish scholars, starting with the still often cited 19th-century works of Walerian Kalinka and W≈Çadys≈Çaw Smole≈Ñski, and continued in the 20th century by Bogus≈Çaw Le≈õnodorski. However, there had been an even earlier constitution than the U.S. Constitution. It was the Corsican Constitution of 1755, the founding constitutional law of the short-lived Corsican Republic (1755-1769). The document's official name was Ustawa RzƒÖdowa (\\"Government Act\\"), where \\"government\\" referred to the political system. In the Commonwealth, the term \\"constitution\\" (Polish: konstytucja) had previously denoted all the legislation, of whatever character, that had been passed by a given Sejm.  Holiday  Medal commemorating the Constitution of 3 May 1791, issued that year 3 May was declared a Polish holiday (Constitution Day≈öwiƒôto Konstytucji 3 Maja) on 5 May 1791. The holiday was banned during the partitions of Poland but reinstated in April 1919 under the Second Polish Republicthe first holiday officially introduced in the newly independent country. It was again outlawed during World War II by both the Nazi and Soviet occupiers. It was celebrated in Polish cities in May 1945, although in a mostly spontaneous manner. The 1946 anti-communist demonstrations did not endear it to the Polish communists, and it competed for attention with the communist-endorsed May 1 Labor Day celebrations in the Polish People's Republic; this led to its \\"rebranding\\" as Democratic Party Day and removal from the list of national holidays by 1951. Until 1989, 3 May was a frequent occasion for anti-government and anti- communist protests. 3 May was restored as an official Polish holiday in April 1990 after the fall of communism. In 2007, 3 May was declared a Lithuanian national holiday. Polish-American pride has been celebrated on the same date, for instance in Chicago, where since 1982 Poles have marked it with festivities and the annual Polish Constitution Day Parade.

This three-nave Neo-Renaissance basilica with a semi-circular apse and two 67m high towers is dating since 1889 (building started in 1883). The church was designed by Gustav Meretta, the official architect of the Archbishop of Olomouc, and the interior by Max von Ferstel. The main nave is 14 m wide and 22 m high, the two side aisles are 7 m wide and 10 m high each. The seating capacity of the cathedral is 4,000 people. On May 30, 1996 Pope John Paul II established the Diocese of Ostrava- Opava, and soon after the basilica has been dignified into a cathedral. In 1998, a new neo-baroque organ has been installed. History On 23 May 1871 the city council spoke about the intention of building a new parish church, which would eventually replace the old parish church of St Wenceslas. The old church could not contain the increasing number of believers and failed to comply with official requirements for public buildings. After a fire inspection took place on 2 January 1882, the district marshal in M√≠stek decided to build a new church. Thus, at a council meeting on 5 October 1882 the agreements for the construction of a new parish church were done. Interior of the Cathedral The foundation stone was laid by Mayor Anton Lux and the Reverend Josef Spurn√Ω on October 4, 1883. AT that time church committees were competing in Moravia which was established under provincial laws dating from 1864 and 1874. It was the supervisory and executive bodies, which were often the purchaser of furniture projects and new churches, significantly encroached into their final form. Their arguments focused, in particular, on situations where the parish volume was small. The church of the Divine Saviour would serve 4 municipalities which, upon its construction, should contribute a proportionate financial amount. However these villages managed their own parish church and, therefore Ostravanians' contributions to the construction of the church were often the cause of discord. Other financial flow was rather paradoxical. The Archdiocese of Olomouc, who took patronage of the church, was obliged, by patronage law, to pay a third of construction costs, worth just under 33,000 florins. Contributions also flowed in from Jewish entrepreneurs, like Baron Rotschild and the Gutmannov√© brothers.

used for rotating electrical machines * IEC 60027-6: Control technology * IEC 60027-7: Physiological quantities and units A closely related international standard on quantities and units is ISO 31. The ISO 31 and IEC 60027 Standards are being revised by the two standardization organizations in collaboration. The revised harmonized standard is known as ISO/IEC 80000, Quantities and units. It supersedes both ISO 31 and part of IEC 60027.  IEC 60027-2  IEC 60027-2 Amendment 2, as published in January 1999, was the first international standard defining the binary prefixes, as proposed by International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) since 1996 (kibi- (Ki), mebi- (Mi), gibi- (Gi) and tebi- (Ti)) but extended them up to pebi (Pi) and exbi- (Ei).\\"These prefixes for binary multiples, which were developed by IEC Technical Committee (TC) 25, Quantities and units, and their letter symbols, with the strong support of the International Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM) and the IEEE, were adopted by the IEC as Amendment 2 to IEC International Standard IEC 60027-2: Letter symbols to be used in electrical technology ‚Äì Part 2: Telecommunications and electronics.\\" This didn't change in the second edition of the standard, published in 2000,IEC 60027-2 (2000-11) Ed. 2.0 but the third edition in 2005 finally added prefixes zebi- (Zi) and yobi- (Yi). The harmonized ISO/IEC IEC 80000-13:2008 standard supersedes subclauses 3.8 and 3.9 of IEC 60027-2:2005. The only significant change is the addition of explicit definitions for some quantities.

Its main campus is in Mosbach and it also maintains locations in Bad Mergentheim and Heilbronn. It was founded in 1980 as Berufsakademie Mosbach and became a member of the newly created DHBW in 2009. It has about 3000 students. Dual System A specific characteristic of the cooperative colleges is the tight integration of academic instruction and practical training. Students spend about half of their program at the college and the other half in a private company (such as a technology business or bank) or public institution. Theoretical training at the college and practical work at the company alternate in 3-month blocks. The companies select the students and offer them a salaried contract. At the end of the three-year program, students receive a Bachelor's degree; some also pursue Master's degrees.

As of 2006, the town had an estimated population of 16,765 and a density of 300.52 persons per km¬≤. The total area is 55.45 km¬≤, spanning 14 km east-west and 9 km north-south at its widest points. On March 23, 2009, Ninomiya was merged into the expanded city of Mo'oka. Ninomiya commonly means \\"the second shrine\\" of the province, but this town is named after an 18th-century hero, Ninomiya Sontoku. There is a museum dedicated to the town's namesake in the area of Ninomiya known as Monobe. The town of Ninomiya was formed in 1955 when the town of Kugeta (‰πÖ‰∏ãÁî∞) and the two villages of Monobe (Áâ©ÈÉ®) and Naganuma (Èï∑Ê≤º) merged to form a single administrative area. The train station (serving the Mooka Line) still bears the name of Kugeta. A popular tourist attraction is the local steam train which stops at Kugeta on its route to and from Shimodate (‰∏ãÈ§®) and Motegi (ËåÇÊú®). Ninomiya was the largest producer of strawberries in Japan, and many of the town's inhabitants are involved in the cultivation of this fruit.

He is particularly noted for leading educational psychologists to develop the comprehensive system of describing and assessing educational outcomes in the mid-1950s. He has influenced the practices and philosophies of educators around the world from the latter part of the twentieth century.  Early life and education  Bloom was born in Lansford, Pennsylvania, to an immigrant Jewish family. His parents fled a climate of discrimination in Russia. Bloom's father supported the family as a tailor. Bloom studied at Pennsylvania State College and was awarded his bachelor's and master's degree by 1935. He wished to study under Ralph Tyler, a progressive educator, so he enrolled in the doctoral program in education at the University of Chicago and assisted Tyler with the Eight-Year Study, which evaluated alternative methods of school assessment. Bloom earned his doctoral degree in 1942 and became a member of the University of Chicago's Board of Examiners.  Works  In 1956, Bloom edited the first volume of The Taxonomy of Educational Objectives: The Classification of Educational Goals, which classified learning objectives according to a rubric that has come to be known as Bloom's Taxonomy. It was one of the first attempts to systematically classify levels of cognitive functioning and gave structure to the otherwise amorphous mental processes of gifted students. Bloom's Taxonomy remains a foundation of the academic profession according to the 1981 survey, \\"Significant Writings That Have Influenced the Curriculum: 1906‚Äì81\\" by Harold G. Shane and the National Society for the Study of Education. Bloom's 2 Sigma Problem is also attributed to him. Aside from his work on educational objectives and outcomes, Bloom also directed a research team that evaluated and elucidated the process of developing exceptional talents in individuals, shedding light upon the phenomena of vocational eminence and the concept of greatness.

According to Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung, Johann Baptist Cramer began publishing piano pieces under the (sub-)title of \\"impromptu.\\" (AMZ, Mar. No II, 1815, col. 6), which seems to be the first recorded use of the term impromptu in this sense. Form usage Since the very concept of unpremeditated, spur-of-the-moment inspiration without studied care is at the heart of Romantic artistic theory, it did not take long before the first generation of Romantic composers took up the idea. Others were: * Fr√©d√©ric Chopin composed 4 Impromptus, including the famous Fantaisie-Impromptu. * Jan V√°clav Vo≈ô√≠≈°ek was the first one to compose impromptus published under that title, in 1822. * Franz Schubert published two sets of four Impromptus for piano op. 90 and 142 (1827). After his death 3 more unnamed piano compositions (Klavierst√ºcke) were sometimes named Impromptus. * Robert Schumann wrote some Impromptus, published as Op. 5. * Franz Liszt composed an Impromptu in F sharp (sometimes called Nocturne) and a piano piece named Valse-Impromptu. * Alexander Scriabin is known to have written at least nine impromptus for the piano in his early period. * Jean Sibelius composed six impromptus for piano op. 5 (1893) The impromptu genre remained popular all throughout the 19th century and were prominent throughout the romantic era. In the 20th century, there are also several examples of composers naming their compositions \\"Impromptu\\", such as: * Gabriel Faur√© composing six Impromptus between 1881 and 1913. * Richard Rodney Bennett composing five Impromptus for guitar in 1968 * Maurice Journeau composing six Impromptus between 1971 and 1974.Journeau's works * Donald Martino composing Fantasies and Impromptu in 1980. * Nikolai Kapustin composing four Impromptus between 1991 and 1997. * Lowell Liebermann composing Three Impromptus Op.68 in 2000 and Two Impromptus Op.131 in 2016. * Vince Mendoza's Epiphany, performed by the London Symphony Orchestra and published in 1999.

It is close to the modern town Lunel, between N√Æmes and Montpellier. Ambrussum is notable for its museum, its staging post on the Via Domitia, its bridge Pont Ambroix over the Vidourle, painted by Gustave Courbet, and for its oppidum (fortified village). Its history of settlement spanned 400 years. The whole site is still being excavated. A lower settlement prone to flooding was a staging post for travellers on the Via Domitia and provided stabling and accommodation and the full range of repair facilities that were needed by carts and the Imperial postal service. The higher settlement was based on a pre-Roman oppidum which was within a surrounding wall including 21 towers. The Romans re-modelled the oppidum, so there is evidence of a complete range of housing styles from the earliest one room dwellings to sophisticated courtyard houses on the second century AD. The Roman road, the Via Domitia, ran at the foot of the settlement, leading from it is a paved road with visible with traces of Roman chariot tracks. The Roman bridge was used until the Middle Ages but fell into disrepair, and only one complete arch remains. Location Ambrussum, or its alternative spelling of Ambrusium, is mentioned as a staging post (mutatio) on the Antonine Itinerary of AD 200, on pilgrims' guide on the route to the Holy Land of AD 333 and on the Peutinger map of 1520. All place it midway between Nimes (Nemausis) and Castelnau-le-Lez (Sextantio), about from each. The Via Domitia linked the Alps with the Pyrenees, and is the oldest Roman Road in Gaul, more specifically Gallia Narbonensis in France. Laid out by Cneius Domitius Ahenobarbus around 120 BC, it was to become part of the roads that linked Italy with Cadiz in Spain. At Ambussum the Via Domitia crosses the Vidourle, and the settlement provided a staging post on this road. Directly adjacent to the site, the modern A9 autoroute, the Languedocienne crosses the Vidourle and at this point there is the modern day equivalent of a mutatio, the Aire de service de Lunel. The site is reached through the village of Villetelle. The bridge is 20 m above sea level, and the highest point of the oppidum is 58 m. When in spate the Vidourle will rise by 8 m. From the highest point, the Oppidum de Nages is easily seen. Further one can see Mont Ventoux, Pic Saint-Loup, and the hills of the Cevennes including the Causse du Larzac and Mont Aigoual. History The site was first settled in 2,300 BC and the construction started on the oppidum around 300 BC. It was a settlement of Gauls. The Romans conquered the area in 120 BC. The paved road at the heart of the oppidum was laid around 100 BC. Between the oppidum and the river was a staging post (mutatio) on the Via Domitia. That, and the Pont Ambroix were constructed in around 30 BC. The flow patterns of the river changed around 10 BC; it became more aggressive and flooding became more frequent. The large houses on the south of the oppidum were built in AD 50. The whole oppidum was abandoned in AD 100, but parts of the lower settlement were still in use in AD 400, and the Pont Ambroix continued in use throughout the Middle Ages. It took a battering from the Vidourlades, or violent floods or spates on the Vidourle. During a spate, the water flow increases from a minimum of 3 m3/s to over 3000 m3/s. Floods were recorded on 8 October 1723. The floods of 18 November 1745 reduced the bridge from four arches to three. Further major floods occurred on 6 October 1812, 21 October 1891, and 21 September 1907. The floods of 7 September 1933 reduced the bridge from two arches to the one we see today. The site was abandoned when transit patterns changed, the Domitia became less important and the community relocated to Lunel-Viel, which better served a north‚Äìsouth transit. The site was returned to its natural state, and later to the cultivation of vines and olives. This protected the archaeological record. Site Ambrussum contains three archaeological sites of international importance: the Colline de Dev√®s which was first occupied in 2300 BC and settled as an oppidum between 300 BC and 100 AD; the Roman staging post on the Via Dolmitia which had hotels, a baths and industrial buildings; the Roman bridge, the Pont Ambroix. The bridge is a M√©rim√©e list National Monument No. PA00103057. The oppidum is a M√©rim√©e list National Monument No. PA00103760 Oppidum The ramparts Originally the Oppidum was the work of the Volcae Arecomici who started it in the fourth century BC. Nine square houses from the earliest period were recorded by √âmile Marignan, these were roofed with branches and reeds. A rectangular house from the third century has been excavated. This contained both rough earthenware pottery for cooking and a finer black glazed table ware. During the first century BC, the hill was terraced and the houses became narrower similar to those found at Nages. The hill was fortified in the late fourth century BC, the ramparts enclosed an area of . It was triangular in form but most of the eastern section was looted to be used in lime kilns. It consisted of a dry limestone wall. There were three gateways, one to the north, south and east. The western section of the wall, cleared in 1974, revealed 24 bastions. These were originally rectangular but were replaced in the mid-third century BC with rounded ones. Two of the towers were substantially higher; these were built as watch towers and for prestige. The ramparts were abandoned in the first century AD.Mus√©e de Ambrussum, Interpretation board (grey), 2011 After the Romans settled the area in 120 BC the hill was redeveloped, the residential areas were reorganised, and the road through the settlement from the east gate to the south gate was paved. The south gate was enlarged and a large square was cleared behind with a civil basilica, stones of which made their way in the second century AD to the staging post. The Via Dolmitia would have passed around the hill, but it has been speculated that it passed along this narrow road. The route of the Via often passes along roads with the name 'Route de la Monnaie', but as this originates from a translation of 'raised road' it merely shows that the road was using Roman construction techniques rather than that it formed part of the Via Dolmitia. The south gate does lead to a 'Route de la Monnaie', but the paved road in the oppidum has a gradient of 9% and is too narrow for carts to pass, although it would have been suitable for important visitors. The paved road at the east gate leads towards the bridge, but stops abruptly at a steep bank. It is thought that the river has undercut the bank at this point and removed all traces of the road. The north of the post-conquest oppidum is densely populated, but the houses there were of the domus style found throughout the Empire - courtyard dwellings where the slaves lived closest to the entrance and the family in the building opposite. To the south are some large courtyard homes built around AD 50. The whole oppidum was abandoned in AD 100\\\\. Staging post Taverns and Hotels to the south of the mutatio. The existence of a staging post for the Imperial mail is known of from written sources, and also that it was located by the Vidourle and as a consequence was continually being rebuilt. An embankment was built to protect the settlement from flooding. The Imperial staging post itself was a complex containing two courtyards and two buildings. In the south gallery, the walls were decorated with paintings and a purse containing 43 denarii has also been found there. This building would have been for Imperial messengers and travelling officials. It was renovated and possibly changed its use in the fourth century AD, at a time when the rest of the site had been abandoned. A separate inn has been excavated. It contained a courtyard for the animals and carts and five guest rooms. Adjacent was a building with a bread oven. The inn remained substantially unchanged from 30 BC to AD 125. Nearby, and closer to the water were two further inns, parts of which date from AD 200 to 250. The settlement was substantial enough to have a bathhouse. Although most of it is now beneath a modern road, the heater chamber remains. The praefurnia took the heated air to the underfloor heating, hot water to the calidarium and steam to the laconicum. There was also a blacksmith's courtyard house with a forge specialising in carriage building. This dates from AD 25 to 175. Excavations are still continuing; the land is privately owned and not accessible to the public. Pont Ambroix The remaining arch of the Pont Ambroix. The bridge was built across the Vidourle River with 11 arches. It was still usable in the Middle Ages, with all 11 arches intact, but a sketch by Anne Rulman in 1620 shows only four and then when painted by Gustave Courbet in 1857 only two arches were left. One of those was lost in the flooding of 1933, so only a single arch remains.Mus√©e de Ambrussum, Interpretation board (green), 2011 Excavation The Visitors' Centre designed by Michel Goroneskoul opened on 25 June 2011. The antiquity of the Pont Ambroix had never been disputed and it had been visited by M√©rim√©e, who included it in the first edition of his Historical Monuments of France in 1840. The adjacent hill, the Colline de Dev√®s, was not investigated until the 1960s however.Mus√©e de Ambrussum, Interpretation board (red), 2011 In 1964 Marc Fenouillet did a surface inspection in the vineyard at the base of the hill and found Roman era remains. In November 1967, the first archaeological test digging was begun on the hill itself by Jean-Luc Fiches and traces of the oppidum were found; a larger, volunteer dig was made the following July. In 1974, a path had been cleared around the ramparts and the oppidum was recognised and classified as an historic monument. A regular pattern of annual digs was established. The paved road was discovered in 1975. Between 1980 and 1985 further excavations established that the lower site, adjacent to the bridge, was a staging post on the Via Domitia. In 1984 the hill was donated to authorities in Lunel but the lower site remains in private ownership. There was a pause in the excavations between 1986 and 1992. Subsequently, the lower site became the focus of attention, along with the contours of the river. In 2009 the community of Lunel began the construction of a visitor centre and museum, although work was interrupted in May 2011 by an accidental fire that set the vegetation alight. Four water-carrying aircraft Canadairs were called in to help the firefighters sapeur-pompiers extinguish the fire. Fortuitously, the fire revealed more features of the oppidum. The museum designed by Michel Goroneskoul opened on 25 June 2011.

The Hats, who ruled Sweden from 1738 to 1765, advocated an alliance with France and an assertive foreign policy, especially towards Russia. During their tenure, they involved Sweden in two expensive and disastrous wars, in the 1740s and 1750s. Policy Count Arvid Horn, leader of the Caps, had governed Sweden since 1719. Following Sweden's defeat in the Great Northern War, he had reversed the traditional policy of Sweden by keeping France at a distance, drawing near to Great Britain, and making no significant effort to regain Sweden's lost Baltic empire. Those opposed to this peaceful policy derisively nicknamed his adherents \\"Night-caps\\", and these epithets became party badges when the estates met in 1738. The Hats routed the government, and Horn was compelled to retire after 33 years in high office. Now in power, the Hats aimed at restoring Sweden to her former position as a great power, and sought to renew the traditional alliance with France. France welcomed the rise of a Swedish government which would uphold French interests in northern Europe, and Versailles generously financed the Hat party for the next two generations. The first sign of weakness in the Hats' government came after the war with Russia, which ended in Swedish defeat. In the Riksdag, an inquiry into the conduct of the war was proposed. The Hats managed to avoid this prospect by obtaining precedence for the succession question. King Frederick I had no legitimate children, and it fell to the Riksdag to elect his successor. Negotiations were opened with the Russian empress, Elizabeth of Russia, who agreed to restore the greater part of Finland to Sweden if her heir's uncle, Adolph Frederick of Holstein, were elected successor to the Swedish crown. The Hats eagerly caught at the opportunity of recovering the grand duchy and their own prestige along with it. By the Treaty of √Öbo, on 7 May 1743, the terms of the empress were accepted and only a small part which lay beyond the Kymi river, often called Old Finland, was retained by Russia. In the 1750s, the Hats saw the utter collapse of their foreign system. At the instigation of France they entered the Seven Years' War in the Pomeranian theatre, and the result was ruinous. The French had not provided nearly enough money for a long war, and, after several years of unsuccessful fighting, the unhappy Hats made peace, withdrawing from a war which had cost the country 40,000 men. When the Riksdag met in 1760, the indignation against the Hat leaders was so violent that an impeachment seemed inevitable; but once more the superiority of their parliamentary tactics prevailed, and when, after a session of twenty months, the Riksdag was brought to a close by the mutual consent of both the exhausted factions, the Hat government was bolstered up for another four years. But the day of reckoning could not be postponed forever; and when the estates met in 1765 the Hats were comprehensively removed from power. The leader of the Caps, Ture Rudbeck, was elected marshal of the Diet over Frederick Axel von Fersen, the Hat candidate, by a large majority; and, out of the hundred seats in the secret committee, the Hats succeeded in getting only ten. The Hats returned briefly to power in the Riksdag of 1769, but were soon once again defeated by the Caps. Against a backdrop of Russian encroachment, King Gustav III carried out a coup d'etat in 1772 and moved towards an absolute monarchy. During the political upheavals of the ensuing decades, both Hats and Caps disappeared as political forces.

He was a firm opponent of materialism in science. He was a spiritual philosopher who defended the idea that religion and science are compatible at a time when the power of science was rising inexorably. His work is overshadowed in the English-speaking world by that of the more celebrated Henri Bergson. He was elected membership of the Academy of Moral and Political Sciences in 1898 and in 1912 to the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise. Biography √âmile Boutroux was born at Montrouge, now in the Hauts-de-Seine d√©partement, near Paris. He attended the lyc√©e Napol√©on (now lyc√©e Henri IV), and graduated in 1865 to the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure. He then continued his education at Heidelberg University between 1869‚Äì1870 where he was taught by Hermann von Helmholtz and encountered German philosophy. His first employment was the post of philosophy professor at the lyc√©e in Caen. In 1874 he published his book on which he based his doctoral thesis. The Contingency of the laws of the nature was an analysis of the implications of Kantian philosophy for science. Between 1874 and 1876 Boutroux taught at the Faculty of Letters at the University of Nancy and while there he fell in love with and married Aline Poincar√© the sister of the scientist and mathematician Henri Poincar√©. In 1880 his son, Pierre, was born. Pierre Boutroux was himself to become a distinguished mathematician and historian of science. In 1888 Boutroux was made professor of history of modern philosophy at the Sorbonne in Paris. He was elected a member of Academy of the Moral and Political Sciences in 1898 and in 1902 he became Director of the Thiers Foundation, a residency for France's brightest students.

Other ingredients like ground rice or cornflour are sometimes added to alter the texture. Modern recipes also often deviate from the original by splitting the sugar into equal parts granulated and icing sugar and many add a portion of salt.\\"Of edible substances: Friable, easily crumbled.\\" Oxford English Dictionary. Unlike many other biscuits and baked goods, shortbread does not contain any leavening, such as baking powder or baking soda. Shortbread is widely associated with Christmas and Hogmanay festivities in Scotland, and some Scottish brands are exported around the world. Name Shortbread is so named because of its crumbly texture (from an old meaning of the word \\"short,\\" as opposed to \\"long,\\" or stretchy). The cause of this texture is its high fat content, provided by the butter. The short or crumbly texture is a result of the fat inhibiting the formation of long protein (gluten) strands. The related word \\"shortening\\" refers to any fat that may be added to produce a \\"short\\" (crumbly) texture. Alternatively, the name may be derived from 'shorts', the bran and coarse part of meal.Chambers English Dictionary - 7th edition Shortbread is different from shortcake, though they are similar: shortcake can be made using vegetable fat instead of butter and usually has a chemical leavening agent such as baking powder, which gives it a different texture. Shortbread biscuits are often associated with normal egg-based biscuits, but they hold their shape under pressure, making them ideal for packed meals.  Shapes  Shortbread fingers Shortbread is traditionally formed into one of three shapes: one large circle, which is divided into segments as soon as it is taken out of the oven (petticoat tails, which may have been named from the French petits cot√©s, a pointed biscuit eaten with wine, or petites gastelles, the old French for little cakes. This term may also reference a petticoat's bottom); individual round biscuits (shortbread rounds); or a thick (¬æ\\" or 2 cm) oblong slab cut into fingers. The stiff dough retains its shape well during cooking. The biscuits are often patterned before cooking, usually with the tines of a fork or with a springerle-type mold. Shortbread is sometimes shaped into hearts and other shapes for special occasions. Varieties Cultural associations  Shortbread is generally associated with and originated in Scotland, but due to its popularity it is also made in the remainder of the United Kingdom, and similar biscuits are also made in Denmark, Ireland and Sweden. The Scottish version is the best-known, and is widely exported. Shortbread was chosen as the United Kingdom's representative for Caf√© Europe during the 2006 Austrian presidency of the European Union. Scottish chef John Quigley, of Glasgow's Red Onion, describes shortbread as \\"the jewel in the crown\\" of Scottish baking. An early variety of shortbread, using ginger, was reportedly eaten during sittings of the Parliament of Scotland, and therefore the variety was sometimes called \\"Parliament cake\\" or \\"Parlies\\" into the 19th century.The Oxford Companion to Food, Alan Davidson. Oxford University Press, 2014 The biscuits are likely to have been made and sold by the shop \\"Luckie Fykie\\" in Waverley, Edinburgh.  History  Shortbread originated in Scotland, with the first printed recipe, in 1736, from a Scotswoman named Mrs McLintock. Shortbread resulted from medieval biscuit bread, which was a twice-baked, enriched bread roll dusted with sugar and spices and hardened into a hard, dry, sweetened biscuit called a rusk. Eventually, yeast from the original rusk recipe was replaced by butter, which was becoming more of a staple in Britain and Ireland. Although shortbread was prepared during much of the 12th century, the refinement of shortbread is credited to Mary, Queen of Scots in the 16th century. This type of shortbread was baked, cut into triangular wedges, and flavored with caraway seeds. Shortbread was expensive and reserved as a luxury for special occasions such as Christmas, Hogmanay (Scottish New Year‚Äôs Eve), and weddings. In Shetland, it is traditional to break a decorated shortbread cake over the head of a new bride on the entrance of her new house.

The smell of conpoy is marine, pungent, and reminiscent of certain salt-cured meats. Its taste is rich in umami due to its high content of various free amino acids, such as glycine, alanine, and glutamic acid. It is also rich in nucleic acids such as inosinic acid, amino acid byproducts such as taurine, and minerals, such as calcium and zinc. Conpoy is produced by cooking raw scallops and then drying them. Terminology Conpoy is a loanword from the Cantonese pronunciation of ‰πæË≤ù, (), which literally means \\"dried shell(fish)\\". Usage Scallops for sale at a market. In Hong Kong, conpoy from two types of scallops are common. Conpoy made from Atrina pectinata or Gongyiu (Ê±üÁèß) from mainland China is small and milder in taste. Patinopecten yessoensis or Sinbui (ÊâáË≤ù), a sea scallop imported from Japan (hotategai, Â∏ÜÁ´ãË≤ù in Japanese), produces a conpoy that is stronger and richer in taste . As with many dried foods, conpoy was originally made as a way to preserve seafood in times of excess. In more recent times its use in cuisine has been elevated to gourmet status. Conpoy has a strong and distinctive flavor that can be easily identified when used in rice congee, stir fries, stews, and sauces. XO sauce, a seasoning used for frying vegetables or seafoods in Cantonese cuisine, contains significant quantities of conpoy.

Artists' books (or book arts) are works of art that utilize the form of the book. They are often published in small editions, though they are sometimes produced as one-of-a-kind objects. Overview Artists' books have employed a wide range of forms, including the traditional Codex form as well as less common forms like scrolls, fold-outs, concertinas or loose items contained in a box. Artists have been active in printing and book production for centuries, but the artist's book is primarily a late 20th-century form. Book forms were also created within earlier movements, such as Dada, Constructivism, Futurism, and Fluxus. Artists' books are made for a variety of reasons. An artist book is generally interactive, portable, movable and easily shared. Some artists books challenge the conventional book format and become sculptural objects. Artist books may be created in order to make art accessible to people outside of the formal contexts of galleries or museums. Early history Blake's hand painted frontispiece for Songs of Innocence and of Experience. This version of the frontispiece is from Copy Z currently held by the Library of Congress. Origins of the form: William Blake Whilst artists have been involved in the production of books in Europe since the early medieval period (such as the Book of Kells and the Tr√®s Riches Heures du Duc de Berry), most writers on the subject cite the English visionary artist and poet William Blake (1757‚Äì1827) as the earliest direct antecedent Cached copy retrieved April 2014. Books such as Songs of Innocence and of Experience were written, illustrated, printed, coloured and bound by Blake and his wife Catherine, and the merging of handwritten texts and images created intensely vivid, hermetic works without any obvious precedents. These works would set the tone for later artists' books, connecting self-publishing and self-distribution with the integration of text, image and form. All of these factors have remained key concepts in artists' books up to the present day. Avant-garde production 1909‚Äì1937 Zang Tumb Tumb, 1914, by Marinetti As Europe plunged headlong towards World War I, various groups of avant-garde artists across the continent started to focus on pamphlets, posters, manifestos and books. This was partially as a way to gain publicity within an increasing print-dominated world, but also as a strategy to bypass traditional gallery systems, disseminate ideas and to create affordable work that might (theoretically) be seen by people who would not otherwise enter art galleries. This move toward radicalism was exemplified by the Italian Futurists, and by Filippo Marinetti (1876‚Äì1944) in particular. The publication of the \\"Futurist Manifesto\\", 1909, on the front cover of the French daily newspaper Le Figaro was an audacious coup de th√©√¢tre that resulted in international notoriety.For an English translation Marinetti used the ensuing fame to tour Europe, kickstarting movements across the continent that all veered towards book-making and pamphleteering. In London, for instance, Marinetti's visit directly precipitated Wyndham Lewis' founding of the Vorticist movement, whose literary magazine BLAST is an early example of a modernist periodical, while David Bomberg's book Russian Ballet (1919), with its interspersing of a single carefully spaced text interspersed with abstract colour lithographs, is a landmark in the history of English language artists' books. With regards to the creation of Artists' books, the most influential offshoot of futurist principles, however, occurred in Russia. Marinetti visited in 1914, proselytizing on behalf of Futurist principles of speed, danger and cacophony.Although his visit didn't go particularly well, with key members of Cubo-Futurism feeling distinctly patronised by his pronouncements. See Collaborating on the paradigm of the future by Margarita Tupitsyn The Russian Avant-Garde Book, Rowell & Wye, MOMA, 2002, p11 Russian Futurism, 1910‚Äì1917 Transrational Boog, 1914, by Olga Rozanova Centred in Moscow, around the Gileia Group of Transrational (zaum) poets David and Nikolai Burliuk, Elena Guro, Vasili Kamenski and Velimir Khlebnikov, the Russian futurists created a sustained series of artists' books that challenged every assumption of orthodox book production. Whilst some of the books created by this group would be relatively straightforward typeset editions of poetry, many others played with form, structure, materials and content that still seems contemporary. Key works such as Worldbackwards (1912), by Khlebnikov and Kruchenykh, Natalia Goncharova, Larionov Rogovin and Tatlin, Transrational Boog (1915) by Aliagrov and Kruchenykh & Olga Rozanova and Universal War (1916) by Kruchenykh used hand-written text, integrated with expressive lithographs and collage elements, creating small editions with dramatic differences between individual copies. Other titles experimented with materials such as wallpaper, printing methods including carbon copying and hectographs, and binding methods including the random sequencing of pages, ensuring no two books would have the same contextual meaning.The Russian Avant-Garde Book, Rowell & Wye, MOMA, 2002 Russian futurism gradually evolved into Constructivism after the Russian Revolution, centred on the key figures of Malevich and Tatlin. Attempting to create a new proletarian art for a new communist epoch, constructivist books would also have a huge impact on other European avant-gardes, with design and text-based works such as El Lissitsky's For The Voice (1922) having a direct impact on groups inspired by or directly linked to communism. Dada in Zurich and Berlin, the Bauhaus in Weimar and De Stijl in the Netherlands all printed numerous books, periodicals and theoretical tracts within the newly emerging International Modernist style. Artist's books from this era include Kurt Schwitters and Kate Steinitz's book The Scarecrow (1925), and Theo van Doesburg's periodical De Stijl. Dada and Surrealism Dada was initially started at the Cabaret Voltaire, by a group of exiled artists in neutral Switzerland during World War I. Originally influenced by the sound poetry of Wassily Kandinsky, and the Blaue Reiter Almanac that Kandinsky had edited with Marc, artists' books, periodicals, manifestoes and absurdist theatre were central to each of Dada's main incarnations. Berlin Dada in particular, started by Richard Huelsenbeck after leaving Zurich in 1917, would publish a number of incendiary artists' books, such as George Grosz's The Face Of The Dominant Class (1921), a series of politically motivated satirical lithographs about the German bourgeoisie. Whilst concerned mainly with poetry and theory, Surrealism created a number of works that continued in the French tradition of the Livre d'Artiste, whilst simultaneously subverting it. Max Ernst's Une Semaine de Bont√© (1934), collaging found images from Victorian books, is a famous example, as is Marcel Duchamp's cover for Le Surr√©alisme' (1947) featuring a tactile three- dimensional pink breast made of rubber.Marcel Duchamp Studies Online, One important Russian writer/artist who created artist books was Alexei Remizov.Julia Friedman, Beyond Symbolism and Surrealism: Alexei Remizov's Synthetic Art, Northwestern University Press, 2010. Drawing on medieval Russian literature, he creatively combined dreams, reality, and pure whimsy in his artist books. After World War II; post-modernism and pop art=Regrouping the avant-garde After World War II, many artists in Europe attempted to rebuild links beyond nationalist boundaries, and used the artist's book as a way of experimenting with form, disseminating ideas and forging links with like-minded groups in other countries. After the war, a number of leading artists and poets started to explore the functions and forms of the book 'in a serious way'The Century of Artists' Books, Drucker, Granary Books, p12 Concrete poets in Brazil such as Augusto and Haroldo de Campos, Cobra artists in the Netherlands and Denmark and the French Lettrists all began to systematically deconstruct the book. A fine example of the latter is Isidore Isou's Le Grand D√©sordre, (1960), a work that challenges the viewer to reassemble the contents of an envelope back into a semblance of narrative. Two other examples of poet-artists whose work provided models for artists' books include Marcel Broodthaers and Ian Hamilton Finlay.The question of the relation between avant-garde poetry and artists' books is dealt with very well in the chapter entitled \\"Po√®tes ou artistes?\\" in Anne Moeglin-Delcroix, Esth√©tique du livre d‚Äôartiste, 1960‚Äì1980 (Paris: Jean Michel Place; Bilioth√®que nationale de France, 1997), 60‚Äì95. Yves Klein in France was similarly challenging Modernist integrity with a series of works such as Yves: Peintures (1954) and Dimanche (1960) which turned on issues of identity and duplicity.Yves Klein, Sidra Stich, Hayward Gallery, 1994 Other examples from this era include Guy Debord and Asger Jorn's two collaborations, Fin de Copenhague (1957) and M√©moires' (1959), two works of Psychogeography created from found magazines of Copenhagen and Paris respectively, collaged and then printed over in unrelated colours. Dieter Roth and Ed Ruscha Often credited with defining the modern artist's book,The Century of Artists' Books, Drucker, Granary Books, p73 Dieter Roth (1930‚Äì98) produced a series of works which systematically deconstructed the form of the book throughout the fifties and sixties. These disrupted the codex's authority by creating books with holes in (e.g. Picture Book, 1957), allowing the viewer to see more than one page at the same time. Roth was also the first artist to re-use found books- comic books, printer's end papers and newspapers (such as Daily Mirror, 1961,Dieter Roth, Books + Multiples, Dobke, Hansjorg Mayer 2004 and AC, 1964). Although originally produced in Iceland in extremely small editions, Roth's books would be produced in increasingly large runs, through numerous publishers in Europe and North America, and would ultimately be reprinted together by the German publisher Hansj√∂rg Mayer in the 1970s, making them more widely available in the last half-century than the work of any other comparable artist. Almost contemporaneously in the United States, Ed Ruscha (1937‚Äìpresent) printed his first book, Twentysix Gasoline Stations, in 1963 in an edition of 400, but had printed almost 4000 copies by the end of the decade. The book is directly related to American photographic travelogues, such as Robert Frank's The Americans' (1965), but deals with a banal journey on route 66 between Ruscha's home in Los Angeles and his parents' in Oklahoma. In one of the defining innovations of the genre, Ruscha chose to distribute the original edition in the gasoline stations that he'd photographed, thereby completely bypassing traditional means of dissemination within the artworld. Like Roth, Ruscha created a series of homogenous books throughout the sixties, including Every Building on the Sunset Strip, 1966, and Royal Road Test, 1967. A Swiss artist worth mentioning is Warja Honegger-Lavater, who created artists' books contemporaneously with Dieter Roth and Ed Ruscha. Fluxus and the Multiple Growing out of John Cage's Experimental Composition classes from 1957 to 1959 at the New School for Social Research, Fluxus was a loose collective of artists from North America and Europe that centred on George Maciunas (1931‚Äì78), who was born in Lithuania. Maciunas set up the AG Gallery in New York, 1961, with the intention of putting on events and selling books and multiples by artists he liked. The gallery closed within a year, apparently having failed to sell a single item.Mr Fluxus, Williams, Noel, Thames and Hudson, 1997 The collective survived, and featured an ever-changing roster of like-minded artists including George Brecht, Joseph Beuys, Davi Det Hompson, Daniel Spoerri, Yoko Ono, Emmett Williams and Nam June Paik. Artists' books (such as An Anthology of Chance Operations) and multiplesThe term Multiple had first been used by Daniel Spoerri to describe his Edition MAT' mass-produced sculptures in 1959 (as well as happenings), were central to Fluxus' ethos disdaining galleries and institutions, replacing them with \\"art in the community\\", and the definition of what was and wasn't a book became increasingly elastic throughout the decade as the two forms collided. Many of the Fluxus editions share characteristics with both; George Brecht's Water Yam (1963), for instance, involves a series of scores collected in a box, whilst similar scores are collected together in a bound book in Yoko Ono's Grapefruit (1964). Another famous example is Literature Sausage by Dieter Roth, one of many artists to be affiliated to fluxus at one or other point in its history; each one was made from a pulped book mixed with onions and spices and stuffed into sausage skin. Literally a book, but utterly unreadable. Litsa Spathi and Rund Jansen of the Fluxus Heidelberg Center in the Netherlands have an online archive of fluxus publications and fluxus webslinks. Conceptual art The artist's book proved central to the development of conceptual art. Lawrence Weiner, Bruce Nauman and Sol LeWitt in North America, Art & Language in the United Kingdom, Maurizio Nannucci in Italy, Jochen Gerz and Jean Le Gac in France and Jaroslaw Kozlowski in Poland all used the artist's book as a central part of their art practice. An early example, the exhibition January 5‚Äì31, 1969 organised in rented office space in New York City by Seth Siegelaub, featured nothing except a stack of artists' books, also called January 5‚Äì31, 1969 and featuring predominantly text-based work by Lawrence Weiner, Douglas Huebler, Joseph Kosuth, and Robert Barry. Sol LeWitt's Brick Wall, (1977), for instance, simply chronicled shadows as they passed across a brick wall, Maurizio Nannucci \\"M/40\\" with 92 typesetting pages (1967) and \\"Definizioni/Definitions\\" (1970), whilst Kozlowski's Reality (1972) took a section of Kant's Critique of Pure Reason, removing all of the text, leaving only the punctuation behind. Another example is the Einbetoniertes Buch, 1971 (book in concrete) by Wolf Vostell. Louise Odes Neaderland, the founder and Director of the non-profit group International Society of Copier Artists (I.S.C.A.) helped to establish electrostatic art as a legitimate art form, and to offer a means of distribution and exhibition to Xerox book Artists. Volume 1, #1 of The I.S.C.A. Quarterly was issued in April 1982 in a folio of 50 eight by eleven inch unbound prints in black and white or color Xerography. Each contributing artist's work of Xerox art was numbered in the Table of Contents and the corresponding number was stamped on the back of each artist's work. \\"The format changed over the years and eventually included an Annual Bookworks Edition, which contained a box of small handmade books from the I.S.C.A. contributors.\\" After the advent of home computers and printers made it easier for artists to do what the copy machine formerly did, Volume 21, #4 in June 2003 was the final issue. \\"The 21 years of The I.S.C.A. Quarterlies represented a visual record of artists‚Äô responses to timely social and political issues,\\" as well as to personal experiences. The complete I.S.C.A quarterly collection is housed and catalogued at the Jaffe Center for Book Arts at the Florida Atlantic University library. Proliferation and reintegration into the mainstream As the form has expanded, many of the original distinctive elements of artists' books have been lost, blurred or transgressed. Artists such as Cy Twombly, Anselm Kiefer and PINK de Thierry, with her series Encyclopaedia Arcadia,Perr√©e, Rob Cover to Cover ‚Äì The Artist's Book in Perspective - N.A.I. Publishers, Rotterdam 2002 routinely make unique, hand crafted books in a deliberate reaction to the small mass- produced editions of previous generations; Albert Oehlen, for instance, whilst still keeping artists' books central to his practice, has created a series of works that have more in common with Victorian sketchbooks. A return to the cheap mass-produced aesthetic has been evidenced since the early 90s, with artists such as Mark Pawson and Karen Reimer making cheap mass production central to their practice. Contemporary and post-conceptual artists also have made artist's books an important aspect of their practice, notably William Wegman, Bob Cobbing, Martin Kippenberger, Raymond Pettibon, Freddy Flores Knistoff and Suze Rotolo. Book artists in pop-up books and other three- dimensional one-of-a-kind books include Bruce Schnabel, Carol Barton, Hedi Kyle, Julie Chen, Ed Hutchins and Susan Joy Share. Many book artists working in traditional, as well as non-traditional, forms have taught and shared their art in workshops at centers such as the Center for Book Arts in New York City, and the Visual Arts Studio (VisArts), the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts Studio School, the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts Statewide Outreach Program, and the no longer extant Richmond Printmaking Workshop, all in Richmond, Virginia. Other institutions devoted to the art form include San Francisco Center for the Book, Visual Studies Workshop, and Women's Studio Workshop in Rosendale, New York. Critical reception In the early 1970s the artist's book began to be recognized as a distinct genre, and with this recognition came the beginnings of critical appreciation of and debate on the subject. Institutions devoted to the study and teaching of the form were founded (The Center for Book Arts in New York, for example); library and art museum collections began to create new rubrics with which to classify and catalog artists' books and also actively began to expand their fledgling collections; new collections were founded (such as Franklin Furnace in New York); and numerous group exhibitions of artist's books were organized in Europe and America (notably one at Moore College of Art and Design in Philadelphia in 1973, the catalog of which, according to Stefan Klima's Artists Books: A Critical Survey of the Literature, is the first place the term \\"Artist's Book\\" was used). Artists' books became a popular form for feminist artists beginning in the 1970s. The Women's Studio Workshop (NY) and the Women's Graphic Center at the Woman's Building (LA), founded by graphic designer, Sheila de Bretteville were centers where women artists could work and explore feminist themes. Bookstores specializing in artists' books were founded, usually by artists, including Ecart in 1968 (Geneva), Other Books and So in 1975 (Amsterdam), Art Metropole in 1974 (Toronto) and Printed Matter in New York (1976). All of these also had publishing programmes over the years, and the latter two are still active today. In the 1980s this consolidation of the field intensified, with an increasing number of practitioners, greater commercialization, and also the appearance of a number of critical publications devoted to the form. In 1983, for example, Cathy Courtney began a regular column for the London-based Art Monthly (Courtney contributed articles for 17 years, and this feature continues today with different contributors). The Library of Congress adopted the term artists books in 1980 in its list of established subjects, and maintains an active collection in its Rare Book and Special Collections Division. In the 1980s and 1990s, BA, MA and MFA programs in Book Art were founded, some notable examples of which are the MFA at Mills College in California, the MFA at The University of the Arts in Philadelphia, the MA at Camberwell College of Arts in London, and the BA at the College of Creative Studies at the University of California, Santa Barbara. The Journal of Artists' Books (JAB) was founded in 1994 to \\"raise the level of critical inquiry about artists' books.\\" In 1994, a National Book Art Exhibition, Art ex libris, was held at Artspace Gallery in Richmond, Virginia, and the Virginia Commission for the Arts awarded a technical assistance grant for videotaping the exhibition.(aka David E. Thompson). In 1995, excerpts from Art ex Libris: The National Book Art Invitational at Artspace video documentary were shown in the Frances and Armand Hammer Auditorium at the 4th Biannual Book Arts Fair sponsored by Pyramid Atlantic at the Corcoran Gallery of Art. In 1996, the Art ex Libris documentary was included in an auction at Swann Galleries to benefit the Center for Book Arts in New York City. Many of the books exhibited in Art ex Libris at Artspace Gallery and Art ex Machina at 1708 Gallery are now in the Sackner Archive of Concrete and Visual Poetry in Miami, Florida. In recent decades the artist's book has been developed, by way of the artists' record album concept pioneered by Laurie Anderson into new media forms including the artist's CD-ROM and the artist's DVD-ROM. Beginning in 2007, the Codex Foundation began its Book Fair and Symposium, a biennial 4-day event in the San Francisco Bay Area attended by collectors and producers of artist books as well as laypeople and academics interested in the medium. Critical issues and debate A number of issues around the artist's book have been vigorously debated. Some of the major themes under examination have been: # Definition of the artist's book: distinguishing between the terms \\"artist's book\\", \\"book art\\", \\"bookworks\\", \\"livre d'artiste\\", fine press books, etc. # Where the artist's book \\"should\\" be situated in relation to Craft and Fine Art traditions. # Where to put the apostrophe. # When is a magazine a book? Some examples of \\"artists' books\\" provided on this page (such as Theo van Doesburg's De Stijl) are magazines and not books at all.

Gamble House, is an iconic American Craftsman home in Pasadena, California, designed by the architectural firm Greene and Greene. Constructed in 1908‚Äì09 as a home for David B. Gamble of the Procter & Gamble company, it is today a National Historic Landmark, a California Historical Landmark, and open to the public for tours and events. Design View from the front porch Originally built as a winter residence for David and Mary Gamble, the three-story Gamble House is commonly described as America's Arts and Crafts masterpiece. Its style shows influence from traditional Japanese aesthetics and a certain California spaciousness born of available land and a permissive climate. The Arts and Crafts Movement in American Craftsman style architecture was focused on the use of natural materials, attention to detail, aesthetics, and craftsmanship. The house is located on a grassy knoll overlooking Pasadena's Arroyo Seco, a broad, seasonally dry river bed. Because of the Gambles‚Äô attraction to the environment, the Greenes designed the house to complement the rustic setting. The house's design reflected the Gambles' love of nature as flowers and trees were brought to the interior‚Äîcreating pictures in wood, metal, art glass, and semi-precious stone. The building itself appears enmeshed with the landscape, achieved by a blend of man-made materials such as brick and rough dash-coat stucco and natural materials such as granite river stones and creeping fig that grows up onto the foundations of the terrace and steps. Lighting fixture at the Gamble House The house displays a strong influence of Japanese architecture. The abstraction of clouds and mist as well as the other \\"oriental\\" characteristics applied to the house's doors, windows, screens, beams, chair, lanterns, and more were another way that the house showed its emphasis on nature as \\"forms found in nature are the inspiration for these patterns.\\" The three entry doors of the Gamble House Another way the Greenes showed off the Gamble House's emphasis on nature was through the \\"theme of three,\\" which was composed of three components that could be seen in every room. The theme of three grouped objects together, sometimes symmetrically arranged, but often not. The use of asymmetry alongside the classical balance reflects nature's welcoming of variety in proportions. Interiors Carved wood design elements in the Gamble House The rooms of the home were built using multiple kinds of woods. Teak, maple, oak, Port Orford cedar, and mahogany surfaces are placed in sequences to bring out contrasts of color, tone, and grain. Inlay in the custom furniture designed by the architects coordinates with the inlay in the tiled fireplace surrounds, and the expressed, interlocking joinery on the main staircase was left exposed. China cabinets in the Gamble House One of the wooden panels in the entry hall is actually a concealed door leading to the kitchen, and another panel opens to a coat closet. A rocking chair in the Gamble House The Greenes used an experienced team of local contractors who had worked together for them in Pasadena on several previous homes, including the Hall brothers, Peter and John, who were responsible for the high quality of the woodworking in the house and its furniture. The Gamble family crest, a crane and trailing rose, was integrated in part or whole in many locations around the house. The woods, the low and horizontal room shapes, and the natural light that filters through the art glass exterior windows coexist with a relatively traditional plan, in which most rooms are regularly shaped and organized around a central hall. Although the house is not as spatially adventurous as the contemporary works of Frank Lloyd Wright, or even of the earlier New England \\"Shingle style,\\" its mood is casual and its symmetries tend to be localized. Ceiling heights are different on the first (8'10\\") and second floors (8'8\\") and in the den (9'10\\") and the forms and scales of the spaces are constantly shifting, especially as one moves from the interior of the house to its second-floor semi-enclosed porches and its free-form terraces, front and rear. The third floor was planned as a billiard room but was used as an attic by the Gamble family. Rooms Sitting room in the Gamble House The living room was designed without any entry doors so that the room would be as open and inviting as possible. It also consisted of a spacious sitting room, which was decorated with five rugs that were designed by Charles Greene using watercolor. Across from the fireplace, there is a window the leads to the terrace, which overlooks the garden. The expansive window was designed to let light brighten the room during the late afternoon. At the far end of the room lie bookcases, a small games table, and a piano to offer entertainment and leisure. The piano was designed by the Greenes to blend into the paneling of the room. Dining table and chairs in the Gamble House On the west wing of the house, the dining room is surrounded by the terrace and the garden on three sides. According to Gamble House: Greene and Greene, by Edward R. Bosley, the room was designed to offer \\"nature to the indoors.\\" The entrance of the room is diagonal from the hall with two doors. The doors are decorated with cloud-designed glass panels. The transition from hall to room was designed to provide a sense of \\"anticipation and discovery\\". Exterior and gardens Outdoor lamp on the back porch Outdoor space was as important as the interior spaces. Exterior porches are found off three of the second-floor bedrooms and were used for sleeping or entertaining. The garden pond behind the Gamble House The main terrace is beyond the rear facade of the residence. It has patterned brick paving with planting areas, a large curvilinear pond, and garden walls made with distinctive clinker bricks and boulders. Paths made with large water-worn stones from the nearby Arroyo Seco are reminiscent of running brooks crossing the lawns. The overall landscape design and constructed garden elements are integrated with the architectural proportion and detailing. The triple front door and transom feature a Japanese black pine motif in plated (more than one layer) leaded art glass, highlighting the Asian influence that runs throughout the house. History Exterior view from the front lawn, showing southwest- facing front door and front gable One major feature of the Gamble House was to be distinct from many other houses nearby, such as the Neoclassical style Fenyes House (Robert Farquhar, 1906‚Äì07). Considering that many Greene and Greene projects have been altered to some degree and stripped of their original furnishings designed for them by the architects, this house has been well maintained throughout its exterior and interior. David and Mary Gamble lived in the house during the winter months until their deaths in 1923 and 1929, respectively. Mary's younger sister Julia lived in the house until her death in 1943. Cecil Huggins Gamble and his wife Louise Gibbs Gamble lived in the house beginning in 1946. They briefly considered selling it, until prospective buyers spoke of painting the interior woodwork white. In 1966, the Gamble family turned the house over to the city of Pasadena in a joint agreement with the University of Southern California (USC) School of Architecture. The Gamble House was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1977. and Today, two 5th-year USC architecture students live in the house full-time; the selected students change annually. The Gamble House was a target for criticism during the twentieth century. However, after the Second World War it received newfound popularity. It was included in a list of all- time top 10 houses in Los Angeles in a Los Angeles Times survey of experts in December 2008. The exterior of the house gained worldwide exposure as the home of Emmett \\"Doc\\" Brown in the 1985 movie Back to the Future. Featured on This Old House with then host Bob Vila in 1987.

Early life and work Blondlot was born in Nancy, France, and spent most of his early years there, teaching physics at the University of Nancy, being awarded three prestigious prizes of the Acad√©mie des Sciences for his experimental work on the consequences of Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism. In order to demonstrate that a Kerr cell responds to an applied electric field in a few tens of microseconds, Blondlot, in collaboration with Ernest-Adolphe Bichat, adapted the rotating-mirror method that L√©on Foucault had applied to measure the speed of light. He further developed the rotating mirror to measure the speed of electricity in a conductor, photographing the sparks emitted from two conductors, one 1.8 km longer than the other and measuring the relative displacement of their images. He thus established that the speed of electricity in a conductor is very close to that of light. In 1891, he made the first measurement of the speed of radio waves, by measuring the wavelength using Lecher lines., credited to K. D. Froome and L. Essen, \\"The Velocity of Light and Radio Waves\\", Academic Press, 1969, p.15 He used 13 different frequencies between 10 and 30 MHz and obtained an average value of 297,600 km/s, which is within 1% of the current value for the speed of light. This was an important confirmation of James Clerk Maxwell's theory that light was an electromagnetic wave like radio waves.  N Rays In 1903, Blondlot announced that he had discovered N rays, a new species of radiation. The \\"discovery\\" attracted much attention over the following year and many physicists worked, unsuccessfully, to replicate the effects. The French Academy of Sciences awarded the Prix Leconte (‚Ç£50,000) for 1904 to Blondlot, citing the totality of his work rather than the discovery of N-rays. American physicist Robert W. Wood, who had a reputation as a popular \\"debunker\\" of nonsense during the period, showed that the phenomena were purely subjective with no physical origin and by 1905, no one outside of Nancy believed in N rays; but Blondlot himself is reported to have still been convinced of their existence in 1926. The incident is now used as a cautionary tale among scientists on the dangers of error introduced by experimenter bias. Later years Little is known about Blondlot's later years. William Seabrook stated in his Wood biography Doctor Wood,Seabrook William: Doctor Wood, Modern Wizard of the Laboratory Harcourt Brace, New York 1941 that Blondlot went insane and died, supposedly as a result of the exposure of the N ray debacle: \\"This tragic exposure eventually led to Blondlot's madness and death.\\" Using an almost identical wording, this statement was repeated later by Martin Gardner: \\"Wood's exposure led to Blondlot's madness and death.\\"Martin Gardner, Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science (Popular Science); Dover Publications, 1957, However, Blondlot continued to work as a university professor in Nancy until his early retirement in 1910.E. Pierret, Bull. Acad. Soc. Lorraines Sci. 7: 240 (1968) He died at the age of 81; at the time of the N-ray affair, he was about 54‚Äì55 years old.

It includes the first material ever discovered to become superconducting above the boiling point of liquid nitrogen (77 K) at about 92 K. Many YBCO compounds have the general formula YBa2Cu3O7‚àíx (also known as Y123), although materials with other Y:Ba:Cu ratios exist, such as YBa2Cu4Oy (Y124) or Y2Ba4Cu7Oy (Y247). At present, there is no singularly recognised theory for high- temperature superconductivity. History In April 1986, Georg Bednorz and Karl M√ºller, working at IBM in Zurich, discovered that certain semiconducting oxides became superconducting at relatively high temperature, in particular, a lanthanum barium copper oxide becomes superconducting at 35 K. This oxide was an oxygen-deficient perovskite-related material that proved promising and stimulated the search for related compounds with higher superconducting transition temperatures. In 1987, Bednorz and M√ºller were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for this work. Following Bednorz and M√ºller's work, in 1987 Maw-Kuen Wu (at the University of Alabama in Huntsville) and Chu Ching-wu (at the University of Houston) and their graduate students Ashburn and Torng, discovered that YBCO has a superconducting transition critical temperature (Tc, which must not be confused with the Curie temperature) of 93 K. The first samples were Y1.2Ba0.8CuO4; but this was an average composition for two phases, a black and a green one. To identify the phases, Chu turned to Dave Mao and Robert Hazen at the Geophysical Laboratory in the Carnegie Institution of Washington. They found that the black one (which turned out to be the superconductor) had the composition YBa2Cu3O7‚àíŒ¥. The article reporting this material led to rapid discovery of several new high-temperature superconducting materials, ushering in a new era in material science and chemistry. YBCO was the first material found to become superconducting above 77 K, the boiling point of liquid nitrogen. All materials developed before 1986 became superconducting only at temperatures near the boiling points of liquid helium (Tb = 4.2 K) or liquid hydrogen (Tb = 20.3 K) ‚Äî the highest being Nb3Ge at 23 K. The significance of the discovery of YBCO is the much lower cost of the refrigerant used to cool the material to below the critical temperature. Synthesis Relatively pure YBCO was first synthesized by heating a mixture of the metal carbonates at temperatures between 1000 and 1300 K. :4 BaCO3 \\\\+ Y2(CO3)3 \\\\+ 6 CuCO3 \\\\+ (1/2‚àíx) O2 ‚Üí 2 YBa2Cu3O7‚àíx \\\\+ 13 CO2 Modern syntheses of YBCO use the corresponding oxides and nitrates. The superconducting properties of YBa2Cu3O7‚àíx are sensitive to the value of x, its oxygen content. Only those materials with 0 ‚â§ x ‚â§ 0.65 are superconducting below Tc, and when x ~ 0.07, the material superconducts at the highest temperature of 95 K, or in highest magnetic fields: 120 T for B perpendicular and 250 T for B parallel to the CuO2 planes. In addition to being sensitive to the stoichiometry of oxygen, the properties of YBCO are influenced by the crystallization methods used. Care must be taken to sinter YBCO. YBCO is a crystalline material, and the best superconductive properties are obtained when crystal grain boundaries are aligned by careful control of annealing and quenching temperature rates. Numerous other methods to synthesize YBCO have developed since its discovery by Wu and his co-workers, such as chemical vapor deposition (CVD), sol-gel, and aerosol methods. These alternative methods, however, still require careful sintering to produce a quality product. However, new possibilities have been opened since the discovery that trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), a source of fluorine, prevents the formation of the undesired barium carbonate (BaCO3). Routes such as CSD (chemical solution deposition) have opened a wide range of possibilities, particularly in the preparation of long YBCO tapes. This route lowers the temperature necessary to get the correct phase to around 700 ¬∞C. This, and the lack of dependence on vacuum, makes this method a very promising way to get scalable YBCO tapes. Structure Part of the lattice structure of yttrium barium copper oxide YBCO crystallizes in a defect perovskite structure consisting of layers. The boundary of each layer is defined by planes of square planar CuO4 units sharing 4 vertices. The planes can sometimes be slightly puckered. Perpendicular to these CuO4 planes are CuO2 ribbons sharing 2 vertices. The yttrium atoms are found between the CuO4 planes, while the barium atoms are found between the CuO2 ribbons and the CuO4 planes. This structural feature is illustrated in the figure to the right. Like many type-II superconductors, YBCO can exhibit flux pinning: lines of magnetic flux may be pinned in place in a crystal, with a force required to move a piece from a particular magnetic field configuration. A piece of YBCO placed above a magnetic track can thus levitate at a fixed height. Although YBa2Cu3O7 is a well-defined chemical compound with a specific structure and stoichiometry, materials with fewer than seven oxygen atoms per formula unit are non-stoichiometric compounds. The structure of these materials depends on the oxygen content. This non- stoichiometry is denoted by the x in the chemical formula YBa2Cu3O7‚àíx. When x = 1, the O(1) sites in the Cu(1) layer are vacant and the structure is tetragonal. The tetragonal form of YBCO is insulating and does not superconduct. Increasing the oxygen content slightly causes more of the O(1) sites to become occupied. For x < 0.65, Cu-O chains along the b axis of the crystal are formed. Elongation of the b axis changes the structure to orthorhombic, with lattice parameters of a = 3.82, b = 3.89, and c = 11.68 √Ö. Optimum superconducting properties occur when x ~ 0.07, i.e., almost all of the O(1) sites are occupied, with few vacancies. In experiments where other elements are substituted on the Cu and Ba sites, evidence has shown that conduction occurs in the Cu(2)O planes while the Cu(1)O(1) chains act as charge reservoirs, which provide carriers to the CuO planes. However, this model fails to address superconductivity in the homologue Pr123 (praseodymium instead of yttrium). This (conduction in the copper planes) confines conductivity to the a-b planes and a large anisotropy in transport properties is observed. Along the c axis, normal conductivity is 10 times smaller than in the a-b plane. For other cuprates in the same general class, the anisotropy is even greater and inter-plane transport is highly restricted. Furthermore, the superconducting length scales show similar anisotropy, in both penetration depth (Œªab ‚âà 150 nm, Œªc ‚âà 800 nm) and coherence length, (Œæab ‚âà 2 nm, Œæc ‚âà 0.4 nm). Although the coherence length in the a-b plane is 5 times greater than that along the c axis it is quite small compared to classic superconductors such as niobium (where Œæ ‚âà 40 nm). This modest coherence length means that the superconducting state is more susceptible to local disruptions from interfaces or defects on the order of a single unit cell, such as the boundary between twinned crystal domains. This sensitivity to small defects complicates fabricating devices with YBCO, and the material is also sensitive to degradation from humidity. Proposed applications TT√ú Many possible applications of this and related high temperature superconducting materials have been discussed. For example, superconducting materials are finding use as magnets in magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic levitation, and Josephson junctions. (The most used material for power cables and magnets is BSCCO.) YBCO has yet to be used in many applications involving superconductors for two primary reasons: *First, although single crystals of YBCO have a very high critical current density, polycrystals have a very low critical current density: only a small current can be passed while maintaining superconductivity. This problem is due to crystal grain boundaries in the material. When the grain boundary angle is greater than about 5¬∞, the supercurrent cannot cross the boundary. The grain boundary problem can be controlled to some extent by preparing thin films via CVD or by texturing the material to align the grain boundaries. *A second problem limiting the use of this material in technological applications is associated with processing of the material. Oxide materials such as this are brittle, and forming them into superconducting wires by any conventional process does not produce a useful superconductor. (Unlike BSCCO, the powder-in-tube process does not give good results with YBCO.) The most promising method developed to utilize this material involves deposition of YBCO on flexible metal tapes coated with buffering metal oxides. This is known as . Texture (crystal plane alignment) can be introduced into the metal tape (the RABiTS process) or a textured ceramic buffer layer can be deposited, with the aid of an ion beam, on an untextured alloy substrate (the IBAD process). Subsequent oxide layers prevent diffusion of the metal from the tape into the superconductor while transferring the template for texturing the superconducting layer. Novel variants on CVD, PVD, and solution deposition techniques are used to produce long lengths of the final YBCO layer at high rates. Companies pursuing these processes include American Superconductor, Superpower (a division of Furukawa Electric), Sumitomo, Fujikura, Nexans Superconductors, Commonwealth Fusion Systems, and European Advanced Superconductors. A much larger number of research institutes have also produced YBCO tape by these methods. The superconducting tape may be the key to a tokamak fusion reactor design that can achieve breakeven energy production.A small, modular, efficient fusion plant  MIT News. Newsoffice.mit.edu. Retrieved on 2015-12-09. YBCO is often categorized as a rare-earth barium copper oxide (REBCO).MIT takes a page from Tony Stark, edges closer to an ARC fusion reactor Surface modification Surface modification of materials has often led to new and improved properties. Corrosion inhibition, polymer adhesion and nucleation, preparation of organic superconductor/insulator/high-Tc superconductor trilayer structures, and the fabrication of metal/insulator/superconductor tunnel junctions have been developed using surface-modified YBCO. These molecular layered materials are synthesized using cyclic voltammetry. Thus far, YBCO layered with alkylamines, arylamines, and thiols have been produced with varying stability of the molecular layer. It has been proposed that amines act as Lewis bases and bind to Lewis acidic Cu surface sites in YBa2Cu3O7 to form stable coordination bonds. Hobbyist use Shortly after it was discovered, the U.K. Journal New Scientist published the \\"recipe\\" for synthesizing YBCO by Heidi Grant (daughter of author Paul Grant, and herself a high-school student at the time of publication) with tools and equipment available in a high- school science laboratory of the time in their 30 July 1987 edition. Thanks to this and other publications at the time, YBCO has become a popular high- temperature superconductor for use by hobbyists and in education, as the magnetic levitation effect can be easily demonstrated using liquid nitrogen as coolant.

In January 1840 Prince Mpande finally defeated King Dingane in the Battle of Maqongqe and was subsequently crowned as new king of the Zulu by his alliance partner Andries Pretorius. After these two battles, Dingane's prime minister and commander in both the Battle of Maqongqe and the Battle of Blood River, General Ndlela, was strangled to death by Dingane for high treason. General Ndlela had been the personal protector of Prince Mpande, who after the Battles of Blood River and Maqongqe, became king and founder of the Zulu.

The trekkers‚Äîcalled Voortrekkers after 1880Bailey (2003).‚Äîhad to defend themselves after the betrayal murder of chief Trekker leader Piet Retief and his entire entourage, and ten days later the Weenen/Bloukrans massacre where \\"not a soul was spared.\\"A.

Page 4 Dingane had agreed that, if Retief could recover approximately 700 head of cattle stolen from the Zulus by the Tlokwa, he would let them have land upon which to establish farms. On 6 February 1838, two days after the signing of a negotiated land settlement deal between Retief and Dingane at UmGungundlovu, written by Jan Gerritze Bantjes (1817-1887) which included Trekker access to Port Natal in which Britain had imperial interests, Dingane invited Retief and his party into his royal residence for a beer-drinking farewell. The accompanying request for the surrender of Trekker muskets at the entrance was taken as normal protocol when appearing before the king. While the Trekkers were being entertained by Dingane's dancing warriors/soldiers, Dingane suddenly accused the visiting party of witchcraft and ordered his men: \\"Bulalani abathakathi\\" (Kill the sorcerers...). Dingane's soldiers proceeded to impale all Retief's men. This form of death was excruciating in the least as it normally took a person 3 days to die- due to the infections caused to internal organs by the impalement, and lastly Retief was also killed, while leaving the Natal treaty in his handbag intact. Immediately after the UmGungundlovu massacre, Dingane sent out his impis (regiments) to attack several Trekker encampments at night time, killing an estimated 500 men, women, children, and servants, most notably at Blaukraans. Help arrived from farmers in the Cape Colony, and the Trekkers in Natal subsequently requested the pro-independence Andries Pretorius to leave the Cape Colony, in order to defend the Voortrekkers who had settled in Natal. After the Battle of Blood River, the Dingane-Retief treaty written by Jan Gerritze Bantjes was found on Retief's bodily remains, providing a driving force for an overt alliance against Dingane between Prince Mpande and Pretorius. Prelude=War strategies of the generals On 26 November 1838, Andries Pretorius (1798-1863) was appointed as Commander of 64 wagons and 464+ heavily armed Boer combatants directed against Dingane at UmGungundlovu with Jan Gerritze Bantjes (1817-1882) as his war secretary. By December 1838, Prince Mpande and 17,000 followers had already fled from Dingane, who was seeking to assassinate Mpande. In support of Prince Mpande as Dingane's replacement, Pretorius' strategy was to target Dingane only. To allow Prince Mpande to oust King Dingane through military might, Pretorius had first to weaken Dingane's personal military power base in UmGungundlovu. Dingane's royal residence at UmGungundlovu was naturally protected against attack by hilly and rocky terrain all around, as well as an access route via Italeni passing through a narrow gorge called a defile. Earlier on 9 April 1838, a Trekker horse commando without ox wagons, thereafter called the \\"Flight Commando\\", had unsuccessfully attempted to penetrate the UmGungundlovu defense at nearby Italeni valley, resulting in the loss of several Trekker lives. Trekker leader Hendrik Potgieter had abandoned all hope of engaging Dingane in UmGungundlovu after losing the battle of Italeni, and subsequently had migrated with his group out of Natal. To approach UmGungundlovu via the Italeni defile with ox wagons would force the wagons into an open column, instead of an enclosed laager as successfully employed defensively at Veglaer on 12 August 1838. The military commander during Dingane's attack on Veglaer was Ndlela kaSompisi. The highly experienced general Ndlela had served under Shaka, and was also prime minister and chief advisor under Dingane. Ndlela with his 10,000 troops had retreated from Veglaer, after three days and nights of fruitless attempts to penetrate the enclosed Trekker wagon laager. General Ndlela personally protected Prince Mpande from Dingane's repeated assassination plans. King Dingane desired to have his half brother Mpande, the only prince with children, eliminated as a threat to his throne. Prince Mpande was married to Msukilethe, a daughter of general Ndlela. General Ndlela, like Pretorius the promoter of Prince Mpande, was responsible for Dingane's UmGungundlovu defense during the Trekkers' second attack attempt under Pretorius in December 1838. Given general Ndlela's previous defense and attack experience at Italeni and Veglaer during April 1838 and August 1838 respectively, Ndlela's tactical options were limited. Proven UmGungundlovu defense tactics were to attack Trekker commandos in the rocky and hilly terrain on the narrowing access route at Italeni, thereby neutralising the advantages mounted riflemen had over spear-carrying foot soldiers. Ndlela had to let Pretorius come close to UmGungundlovu at Italeni and lure the Trekkers into attack. Ndlela was not to attack the Trekkers when they were in a defensive wagon laager position, especially not during the day. The problem for Pretorius was that he had somehow to find a way to make Dingane's soldiers attack him in a defensive laager position at a place of his choice, far away from UmGungundlovu and Italeni. On 6 December 1838, 10 days before the Battle of Blood River, Pretorius and his commando including Alexander Biggar as translator had a meeting with friendly Zulu chiefs at Danskraal, so named for the Zulu dancing that took place in the Zulu kraal that the Trekker commando visited. With the intelligence received at Danskraal, Pretorius became confident enough to propose a vow, which demanded the celebration, by the commando and their posterity, of the coming victory over Dingane. The covenant included that a church would be built in honour of God, should the commando be successful and reach UmGungundlovu alive in order to diminish the power of Dingane. Building a church in Trekker emigrant context was symbol for establishing a settled state. After the meeting with friendly Zulu chiefs at Danskraal, Pretorius let the commando relax and do their washing for a few days at Wasbank till 9 December 1838. From Wasbank they slowly and daily moved closer to the site of the Battle of Blood River, practising laager defence tactics every evening for a week long. Then, by halting his advance towards UmGungundlovu on 15 December 1838, 40 km before reaching the defile at Italeni, Pretorius had eliminated the Italeni terrain trap. Battle On Saturday, 15 December 1838, after the Trekker wagons crossed the Buffalo River 10km SW of the actual battle site and still from their target UmGungundlovu via the risky Italeni access route, an advance scouting party including Pretorius got news of a large Zulu force in rugged terrain to the east trying to lure the Boers into a trap as had been the case in April the same year with fatal consequences. While Cilliers wanted to ride out and attack, Pretorius declined the opportunity to engage Dingane's soldiers away from their base as had been the trap at Italeni valley. Instead, Pretorius decided on a fortified laager on the terrain of his own choosing in the hope that general Ndlela would attack Pretorius on his terms rather than the other way around. As the site for the defensive wagon laager, Pretorius chose a defensible position close to a vertical 8m descent into a deep hippo pool in the Ncombe River providing excellent protection on two sides. The wide-open area to the front of the laager provided absolutely no cover for an attacking force. The battle was set with the laager protected on two flanks. As usual, the ox-wagons were drawn into the typical protective enclosure or laager. Movable wooden barriers and ladders which could be quickly opened for cavalry were fastened between the wagon wheels to prevent intruders, with two smoothbore, short barrel artillery pieces positioned at the corners. Andries Pretorius had brought a 6-pound naval carronade with him from the Cape, mounted on a gun carriage improvised from a wagon axle, and named Grietjie. The other ordnance piece is unknown in the original, but the reproduction depicts a 4-pound smoothbore cannon by then obsolete in most European armies. Both were used to fire devastating grapeshot. As evening approached a thick mist settled over the wagon site above which the sky was clear. According to Afrikaner traditions, the Zulu were afraid to attack at the night due to superstitions and the eerie glow of lamps which the Boers hung on sjamboks [whip-stocks] around the laager. Whether or not there is any truth in this, historian S.P. Mackenzie has speculated that the Zulu held back until what they perceived as the necessary numbers had arrived. Some of the Zulus only arrived near sunrise by following the tracks of the wagons. Due to some recent heavy rains the Ncombe River was swollen making crossing the river difficult. During the night of 15 December, six Zulu regiments, an estimated 20,000 (or more) Zulu soldiers led by Dambuza (Nzobo), crossed the Ncome River and started massing around the encampment, while the elite forces of senior general Ndlela did not cross the river, thereby splitting the army in two. On 16 December, dawn broke on a clear day, revealing that \\"all of Zululand sat there\\", according to one Trekker eyewitness. General Ndlela and his crack troops, the Black and White Shields, remained on the other side of the river, observing Dambuza's men at the laager from a safe position across the hippo pool. According to the South African Department of Art and Culture: > In ceremonies that lasted about three days, izinyanga zempi, specialist war > doctors, prepared izinteleze medicines which made warriors invincible in the > face of their opponents. This could partly help explain why Dambuza's forces were sitting on the ground close to the wagon laager when the Trekkers first saw them. An artist's impression of the Battle of Blood River. Dambuza's regiments repeatedly stormed the laager but could not break through. The attackers were hindered by a change introduced during Shaka's rule that replaced most of the longer throwing spears with short stabbing spears. In close combat the stabbing spear provided obvious advantages over its longer cousin. A Zulu eyewitness said that their first charge was mown down like grass by the Boer muskets. As Bantjes wrote in his journal: With the power of their firearms and with their ox wagons in a laager formation and some excellent tactics, the Boers fought off the Zulu. Buckshot was used to maximise casualties. Mackenzie claims that 200 indigenous servants looked after the horses and cattle and helped load muskets, but no definite proof or witness of servants helping to reload is available. Writing in the popular Afrikaans magazine, Die Huisgenoot, a Dr. D.J. Kotze said that this group consisted of 59 \\"non-white\\" helpers and three English settlers with their black \\"followers\\". After two hours and four waves of attack, with the intermittent lulls providing crucial reloading and resting opportunities for the Trekkers, Pretorius ordered a group of horsemen to leave the encampment and engage the Zulu in order to induce the disintegration of their formations. The Zulu withstood the charge for some time, but rapid losses led them to scatter. The Trekkers pursued their fleeing enemies and hunted them down for three hours. Cilliers noted later that \\"we left the Kafirs lying on the ground as thick almost as pumpkins upon the field that has borne a plentiful crop.\\" Bantjes recorded that about 3,000 dead Zulu had been counted, and three Trekkers were wounded. During the chase, Pretorius was wounded in his left hand by an assegaai (Zulu spear). Of the 3,000 dead Zulu soldiers, two were princes, leaving Ndlela's favourite Prince Mpande as frontrunner in the subsequent battle for the Zulu crown. Four days after the Battle of Blood River, the Trekker commando arrived at King Dingane's great kraal UmGungundlovu (near present-day Eshowe), only to find it deserted and in ashes. The bones of Retief and his men were found and buried, where a memorial stands today. Up to this day 16 December is a public holiday in South Africa; before 1994 it was known as \\"the Day of the Vow\\", \\"the Day of the Covenant\\" and \\"Dingaan's Day\\"; but today it is \\"the Day of Reconciliation\\". Aftermath The conflict between Dingane and the Trekkers continued for one more year after the Battle of Blood River. The idea of a decisive victory may have been planted in Pretorius' mind by a Zulu prisoner, who said that most of Dingane's warriors had either been killed or fled. The same prisoner led some of the Trekker party into a trap at the White Umfolozi River, eleven days after the battle at Ncome River. This time the Zulu were victorious. Only when Dingane's brother, Mpande, openly joined the Trekker side with his sizeable army, was Dingane finally defeated in January 1840. Following the Battle of Maqongqe in January 1840, the forces of Mpande did not wait for Pretorius' cavalry to arrive, and they attacked the remaining regiments of Dingane, who were again under the command of General Ndlela. Ndlela strayed from normal fighting tactics against Mpande, sending in his regiments to fight one at a time, instead of together in ox horn formation. Maquongqe Dingane had to flee Natal completely, but before he did so, he had Ndlela slowly strangled by cow hide for high treason, on the grounds that he had fought for Mpande, with the same disastrous result for Dingane as at Ncome-Blood River. Dambusa, Dingane's other general, had already been executed by Mpande and Pretorius when he fell into their hands before the battle. Pretorius approved and attended the crowning of Zulu King Mpande in Pietermaritzburg. They agreed on the Tugela River as the border between Zululand and the Republic of Natalia. Legacy Popular Afrikaner interpretations of the Battle of Blood River (bolstered by sympathetic historians such as George Theal) played a central role in fostering Afrikaner nationalism . They believe that the battle demonstrated God's intervention and hence their divine right to exist as an independent people. This is stated in the official guidebook of the Voortrekker Monument (unveiled during the centenary celebrations of the Great Trek on 16 December 1949) that Afrikaners were a nation of heroes exemplifies the conclusions drawn from such events. From the Day of the Vow, Afrikaners consider the site and the commemoration of the day as sacred. Historian S.P. Mackenzie doubts the reported number of Zulu deaths. He compares Zulu casualties at Ncome to battles at Italeni, Isandlwana, and Rorke's Drift. Mackenzie acknowledges that the casualty count was not impossible. Yet, in a similar victory on 15 October 1836 by Trekkers under Hendrik Potgieter over some 9,000 Matabele, the latter suffered only 350 casualties. In 1879, 600 British soldiers with breech- loading rifles caused 2,000 Zulu casualties, perhaps 1,000 killedIan Knight,Isandlwana 1879: The Great Zulu Victory, Osprey, 2002, , p.86. Knight's estimate of Zulu casualties is more in keeping with those suffered by the Zulu at Kambula where a British column forms an excellent defensive position with a wagon lager, six 7 pounder artillery pieces and 2,000 soldiers and inflicts 800 (counted bodies)-1,000 killed on the Zulu. over three hours before being overrun.

System-wide software often uses configuration files stored in \`/etc\`, while user applications often use a \\"dotfile\\" ‚Äì a file or directory in the home directory prefixed with a period, which in Unix hides the file or directory from casual listing. Some configuration files run a set of commands upon startup. A common convention is for such files to have \\"\`rc\`\\" in their name, typically using the name of the program then an \\"\`(.)rc\`\\" suffix e.g. \\"\`.xinitrc\`\\", \\"\`.vimrc\`\\", \\"\`.bashrc\`\\", \\"\`xsane.rc\`\\". See run commands for further details. By contrast, IBM's AIX uses an Object Data Manager (ODM) database to store much of its system settings. MS-DOS MS-DOS itself primarily relied on just one configuration file, \`CONFIG.SYS\`. This was a plain text file with simple key-value pairs (e.g. \`DEVICEHIGH=C:\\\\DOS\\\\ANSI.SYS\`) until MS-DOS 6, which introduced an INI-file style format. There was also a standard plain text batch file named \`AUTOEXEC.BAT\` that ran a series of commands on boot. Both these files were retained up to Windows 98SE, which still ran on top of MS-DOS. An example CONFIG.SYS for MS-DOS 5: DOS=HIGH,UMB DEVICE=C:\\\\DOS\\\\HIMEM.SYS DEVICE=C:\\\\DOS\\\\EMM386.EXE RAM DEVICEHIGH=C:\\\\DOS\\\\ANSI.SYS FILES=30 SHELL=C:\\\\DOS\\\\COMMAND.COM C:\\\\DOS /E:512 /P DOS applications used a wide variety of individual configuration files, most of them binary, proprietary and undocumented - and there were no common conventions or formats. Microsoft Windows The REGEDIT application being used to edit Windows Registry data The early Microsoft Windows family of operating systems heavily utilized plain-text INI files (from \\"initialization\\"). These served as the primary mechanism to configure the operating system and application features.Microsoft: Windows NT Workstation Resource Kit. The APIs to read and write from these still exist in Windows, but after 1993, Microsoft began to steer developers away from using INI files and toward storing settings in the Windows Registry, a hierarchical database to store configuration settings, which was introduced that year with Windows NT. macOS The Property List is the standard configuration file format in macOS (as well as in iOS, NeXTSTEP, GNUstep and Cocoa applications). It uses the filename extension \`.plist\`. IBM OS/2 IBM's OS/2 uses a binary format, also with a .INI suffix, but this differs from the Windows versions. It contains a list of lists of untyped key-value pairs.The OS/2 INI Files by James J. Weinkam. Two files control system-wide settings: OS2.INI and OS2SYS.INI. Application developers can choose whether to use them or to create a specific file for their applications. Serialization formats A number of general-purpose serialization formats exist that can represent complex data structures in an easily stored format, and these are often used as a basis for configuration files, particularly in open-source and platform-neutral software applications and libraries. The specifications describing these formats are routinely made available to the public, thus increasing the availability of parsers and emitters across programming languages.

Composed of units of the Royal Air Force and South African Air Force under the Mediterranean Allied Air Forces command, it was active from 7 June 1944 until 15 July 1945. Air Vice Marshal William Elliot and then George Mills, both RAF officers, were its Air Officer Commanding (AOC). The BAF operated mainly over Yugoslavia, supporting the Partisans against Germany and its allies, but occasionally supporting the Greek and Albanian resistance movements also. History Hurricane Mark IV, KZ188 ?C?, of No. 6 Squadron RAF being refuelled, amid other aircraft of the Squadron, on a dispersal at Prkos, Yugoslavia. The formation was based at Bari in Italy, and formed on 7 June 1944 from AHQ 'G' Force, to simplify command arrangements for the air support of Special Operations Executive-operations in the Balkans, i.e. across the Adriatic and in the Aegean and Ionian seas. The Desert Air Force had been responsible for those operations, but its prime job was the support of the troops of the Commonwealth Eighth Army which was fighting its way up through Italy, thus making operations over the Balkans a distraction. The Balkan Air Force was a subordinate to Mediterranean Allied Air Forces, the overall allied air formation in the Mediterranean.

The BAF mainly supported the operations of the Partisans, led by Josip Broz Tito, against German forces in Yugoslavia, but also provided support to Greek and Albanian resistance organisations. It transported supplies to the Partisans, evacuated wounded, dropped agents to help them, and provided air support in their operations against German troops.

Between May 1944 and the spring of 1945, some 50,000 wounded and sick partisans and civilians were evacuated from Yugoslavia to Italy through the Balkan Air Force. The Balkan Air Force was a multinational unit, with 15 types of aircraft and men from eight nations: Greece, co-belligerent Italy, Poland, South Africa, Yugoslavia, the UK, USA and USSR (a transport squadron). Between its inception and May 1945 the BAF flew 38,340 sorties, dropped 6,650 tons of bombs, delivered 16,440 tons of supplies and flew 2,500 individuals into Yugoslavia and 19,000 (mostly wounded) out.The Oxford Companion to World War II page 79 Towards the end of its existence, it operated a small number of units from Yugoslav soil to harass the retreating Germans. However, disagreements with Tito (particularly the arrest of members of the Special Boat Squadron on 13 April 1945, although they were quickly released) meant that all British ground forces were withdrawn, although BAF aircraft operating from Zadar continued to support the Partisan offensive. Between 19 March and 3 May they flew 2,727 sorties, attacking the German withdrawal route from Sarajevo to Zagreb and supporting the Fourth Yugoslav Army advancing from Bihaƒá to Rijeka.The Oxford Companion to World War II page 80 The Balkan Air Force was disbanded on 15 July 1945.

Usually falling in February or early March on the Gregorian calendar, it marks the final day of the traditional Chinese New Year celebrations. As early as the Western Han Dynasty (206 BCE-CE 25), it had become a festival with great significance. During the Lantern Festival, children go out at night carrying paper lanterns and solve riddles on the lanterns (). In ancient times, the lanterns were fairly simple, and only the emperor and noblemen had large ornate ones. In modern times, lanterns have been embellished with many complex designs. For example, lanterns are now often made in the shape of animals. The lanterns can symbolize the people letting go of their past selves and getting new ones, which they will let go of the next year. The lanterns are almost always red to symbolize good fortune. The festival acts as an Uposatha day on the Chinese calendar. It should not be confused with the Mid-Autumn Festival; which is sometimes also known as the \\"Lantern Festival\\" in locations such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore. Lantern Festival's have also become popular in Western countries, such as the Water Lantern Festival held in multiple locations in the United States.Water Lantern Festival In London, the Magical Lantern Festival is held annually. Origin legends There are several beliefs about the origin of the Lantern Festival. However, its roots trace back more than 2000 years ago and is popularly linked to the reign of Emperor Ming of Han at the time when Buddhism was growing in China. Emperor Ming was an advocate of Buddhism and noticed Buddhist monks would light lanterns in temples on the fifteenth day of the first lunar month. As a result, Emperor Ming ordered all households, temples and the imperial palace to light lanterns on that evening. From there it developed into a folk custom. Another likely origin is the celebration of \\"the declining darkness of winter\\" and community's ability to \\"move about at night with human-made light,\\" namely, lanterns. During the Han Dynasty, the festival was connected to Ti Yin, the deity of the North Star. Red lanterns, often seen during the festivities in China Taiwan Lantern Festival There is one legend that states that it was a time to worship Taiyi, the God of Heaven in ancient times. The belief was that the God of Heaven controlled the destiny of the human world. He had sixteen dragons at his beck and call and he decided when to inflict drought, storms, famine or pestilence upon human beings. Beginning with Qin Shi Huang, the first emperor of China, who named China, all the emperors ordered splendid ceremonies each year. The emperor would ask Taiyi to bring favorable weather and good health to him and his people. Wudi of the Han Dynasty directed special attention to this event. In 104 BCE, he proclaimed it to be one of the most important celebrations and the ceremony would last throughout the night. Another legend associates the Lantern Festival with Taoism. Tianguan is the Taoist god responsible for good fortune. His birthday falls on the fifteenth day of the first lunar month. It is said that Tianguan likes all types of entertainment, so followers prepare various kinds of activities during which they pray for good fortune. Another legend associates the Lantern Festival with an ancient warrior name Lan Moon, who led a rebellion against the tyrannical king in ancient China. He was killed in the storming of the city and the successful rebels commemorated the festival in his name. Yet another common legend dealing with the origins of the Lantern Festival speaks of a beautiful crane that flew down to earth from heaven. After it landed on earth it was hunted and killed by some villagers. This angered the Jade Emperor in heaven because the crane was his favorite. So, he planned a storm of fire to destroy the village on the fifteenth lunar day. The Jade Emperor's daughter warned the inhabitants of her father‚Äôs plan to destroy their village. The village was in turmoil because nobody knew how they could escape their imminent destruction. However, a wise man from another village suggested that every family should hang red lanterns around their houses, set up bonfires on the streets, and explode firecrackers on the fourteenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth lunar days. This would give the village the appearance of being on fire to the Jade Emperor. On the fifteenth lunar day, troops sent down from heaven whose mission was to destroy the village saw that the village was already ablaze, and returned to heaven to report to the Jade Emperor. Satisfied, the Jade Emperor decided not to burn down the village. From that day on, people celebrate the anniversary on the fifteenth lunar day every year by carrying lanterns on the streets and exploding firecrackers and fireworks. Another legend about the origins of Lantern Festival involves a maid named Yuan-Xiao. In the Han Dynasty, Dongfang Shuo was a favorite adviser of the emperor. One winter day, he went to the garden and heard a little girl crying and getting ready to jump into a well to commit suicide. Shuo stopped her and asked why. She said she was Yuan-Xiao, a maid in the emperor's palace and that she never had a chance to see her family since she started working there. If she could not have the chance to show her filial piety in this life, she would rather die. Shuo promised to find a way to reunite her with her family. Shuo left the palace and set up a fortune-telling stall on the street. Due to his reputation, many people asked for their fortunes to be told but everyone got the same prediction - a calamitous fire on the fifteenth lunar day. The rumor spread quickly. Everyone was worried about the future and asked Shuo for help. Shuo said that on the thirteenth lunar day, the God of Fire would send a fairy in red riding a black horse to burn down the city. When people saw the fairy they should ask for her mercy. On that day, Yuan-Xiao pretended to be the red fairy. When people asked for her help, she said that she had a copy of a decree from the God of Fire that should be taken to the emperor. After she left, people went to the palace to show the emperor the decree which stated that the capital city would burn down on the fifteenth. The emperor asked Yangshuo for advice. Yangshuo said that the God of Fire liked to eat tangyuan (sweet dumplings). Yuan-Xiao should cook tangyuan on the fifteenth lunar day and the emperor should order every house to prepare tangyuan to worship the God of Fire at the same time. Also, every house in the city should hang red lantern and explode fire crackers. Lastly, everyone in the palace and people outside the city should carry their lanterns on the street to watch the lantern decorations and fireworks. The Jade Emperor would be deceived and everyone would avoid the disastrous fire. The emperor happily followed the plan. Lanterns were everywhere in the capital city on the night of the fifteenth lunar day and people were walking on the street and there were noisy firecrackers. It looked as if the entire city was on fire. Yuan- Xiao's parents went into the palace to watch the lantern decorations and were reunited with their daughter. The emperor decreed that people should do the same thing every year. Since Yuan-Xiao cooked the best tangyuan, people called the day Yuan-Xiao Festival. For each Festival celebrated, a switch in the Chinese Zodiac takes place. If this year is the year of the Pig, the next will be the year of the Rat. Names in different countries In Malaysia and Indonesia, it is commonly known by its Hokkien name: \\"Chap Goh Meh\\" (; T√¢i- l√¥: TsaÃçp-g≈ço-m√™) meaning \\"15th night\\". In Japan, the Lantern Festival is commonly known as \\"Â∞èÊ≠£Êúà\\" („Åì„Åó„Çá„ÅÜ„Åå„Å§). In Korea, the festival is known by several names, including \\"Ï†ïÏõîÎåÄÎßåÏõî\\", \\"Ï†ïÏõîÎåÄÎ≥¥Î¶Ñ\\", \\"ÏÉÅÏõê\\", \\"ÏõêÏÜå\\", \\"ÏõêÏÑù\\" and \\"Ïò§Í∏∞Ïùº\\". In Vietnam, the festival is known by several names, such as \\"R·∫±m Th√°ng Gi√™ng\\", \\"T·∫øt Nguy√™n Ti√™u\\" or \\"T√™t Th∆∞·ª£ng Nguy√™n\\". Finding love In the early days, young people were chaperoned in the streets in hopes of finding love. Matchmakers acted busily in hopes of pairing couples. The brightest lanterns were symbolic of good luck and hope. As time has passed, the festival no longer has such implications in most of Mainland China, Taiwan, or Hong Kong. Tangyuan or Yuanxiao Eaten during the Lantern Festival, tangyuan 'ÊπØÂúì' (Southern China, Taiwan and Southeast Asia) or yuanxiao 'ÂÖÉÂÆµ' (Northern China) is a glutinous rice ball typically filled with sweet red bean paste, sesame paste, or peanut butter. Actually, tangyuan is different from yuanxiao due to different manual making and filling processes. However, they are very similar in shape and taste, so most people do not distinguish them for convenience and consider them as the same thing. The Chinese people believe that the round shape of the balls and the bowls in which they are served symbolize family togetherness, and that eating tangyuan or yuanxiao may bring the family harmony, happiness and luck in the new year.

By the beginning of the Tang Dynasty in the seventh century, the lantern displays would last three days. The emperor also lifted the curfew, allowing the people to enjoy the festive lanterns day and night. It is not difficult to find Chinese poems which describe this happy scene. In the Song Dynasty, the festival was celebrated for five days and the activities began to spread to many of the big cities in China. Colorful glass and even jade were used to make lanterns, with figures from folk tales painted on the lanterns. However, the largest Lantern Festival celebration took place in the early part of the 15th century. The festivities continued for ten days. Emperor Chengzu had the downtown area set aside as a center for displaying the lanterns. Even today, there is a place in Beijing called Dengshikou. In Chinese, deng means lantern and shi is market. The area became a market where lanterns were sold during the day. In the evening, the local people would go there to see the beautiful lighted lanterns on display. Today, the displaying of lanterns is still a major event on the fifteenth day of the first lunar month throughout China. Chengdu in southwest China's Sichuan Province, for example, holds a lantern fair each year in Culture Park. During the Lantern Festival, the park is a virtual ocean of lanterns. Many new designs attract large numbers of visitors. The most eye-catching lantern is the Dragon Pole. This is a lantern in the shape of a golden dragon, spiraling up a 38-meter-high pole, spewing fireworks from its mouth. Cities such as Hangzhou and Shanghai have adopted electric and neon lanterns, which can often be seen beside their traditional paper or wooden counterparts. Another popular activity at this festival is guessing lantern riddles (which became part of the festival during the Tang Dynasty).Richard C. Rudolph, 'Notes on the Riddle in China' ,California Folklore Quarterly, 1.1 (Jan. 1942), pp. 65-82 (pp. 75-79). These often contain messages of good fortune, family reunion, abundant harvest, prosperity and love. Just like the pumpkin carved into jack-o'-lantern for Halloween in the western world, Asian parents sometime teach their children to carve empty the inner tubing of Oriental radish /mooli/ daikon into a Cai-Tou-Lantern () for the Festival. Festivities Lion dance (ËàûÁçÖ), walk on stilts (Ë∏©È´òËπ∫), riddle games (ÁåúÁáàË¨é), dragon dance (ËÄçÈæçÁáà) are very popular during lantern festival.

These stories serve as modern cautionary tales to children and parents and repeat two themes that are common in urban legends: danger to children and contamination of food. No cases of strangers killing or permanently injuring children this way have been proven. Commonly, the story appears in the media when a young child dies suddenly after Halloween. Medical investigations into the actual cause of death have always shown that these children did not die from eating candy given to them by strangers. However, in rare cases, adult family members have spread this story in an effort to cover up murder or accidental deaths. In other incidents, a child who has been told about poisoned candy places a dangerous object or substance in a pile of candy and pretends that it was the work of a stranger. This behavior is called the copycat effect. Folklorists, scholars, and law enforcement experts say that the story that strangers put poison into candy and give that candy to trick-or-treating children has been \\"thoroughly debunked\\". Worries that candy from strangers might be poisoned has led to the rise of alternative events to trick-or-treating, such as events held at Christian churches, police and fire stations, community centers, and retail stores.  History  Claims that candy was poisoned or adulterated gained general credence during the Industrial Revolution, when food production moved out of the home or local area, where it was made in familiar ways by known and trusted people, to strangers using unknown ingredients and unfamiliar machines and processes. Some doctors publicly claimed that they were treating children poisoned by candy every day. If a child became ill, and had eaten candy, the candy was widely assumed to be the cause. However, no cases of illness or death were ever substantiated. In the 1890s and 1900s, the US Bureau of Chemistry and other state agencies tested hundreds of kinds of candy and found no evidence of poisons or adulteration. These tests revealed that inexpensive glucose (from corn syrup) was in common use for cheap candies, that some candies contained trace amounts of copper from uncoated copper cooking pans, and that coal tar dyes were being used for coloring, but there was no evidence of the many types of poison, industrial waste, garbage, or other adulterants alleged to be present. Eventually, the claims that children were being sickened by candy were put down to indigestion due to overeating, or to other causes, including food poisoning due to improper cooking, hygiene, or storage of meat and other foods.  Social causes  The prevalence and persistence of these myths during the 1960s and 1970s, a time of social upheaval, greater racial integration, and improved status for women, reflected societal questions about who was trustworthy. Because society was struggling with questions about whether to trust neighbors in newly integrated neighborhoods, or young women who were publicly rejecting the subservient, motherhood-focused roles previously assigned to women, these stories about unidentifiable neighbors allegedly harming random, innocent children during an event intended to bring happiness to these children caught and retained the public imagination in a way that accurate stories about a judgmental neighbor, an abusive parent, or an adult carelessly leaving harmful chemicals where children can reach them, wouldn't have. An academic view sees this as an example of a rumor panic, with halloween developing as a carnival-like folk institution ‚Äì meant to release social tensions ‚Äì losing its functionality as neighborhoods themselves break down (for various reasons).  Effects  automobile trunk at a trunk-or-treat event at St. John Lutheran Church and Early Learning Center in Darien, Illinois Due to their fears, parents and communities restricted trick-or-treating and developed alternative \\"safe\\" events, such as trunk-or-treat events held at Christian churches. This collective fear also served as the impetus for the \\"safe\\" trick-or-treating offered by many local malls. This story also promoted the sale of individually wrapped, brand-name candies and discouraged people from giving homemade treats to children.  Candy-tampering myth = Development of the modern candy- tampering myth  Several events in the late 20th century fostered the modern-day candy tampering myth. In 1959, a California dentist, William Shyne, gave candy-coated laxative pills to trick-or-treaters. He was charged with outrage of public decency and unlawful dispensing of drugs. In 1964, a disgruntled Long Island, New York woman gave out packages of inedible objects to children who she believed were too old to be trick-or-treating. The packages contained items such as steel wool, dog biscuits, and ant buttons (which were clearly labeled with the word \\"poison\\"). Though nobody was injured, she was prosecuted and pleaded guilty to endangering children. The same year saw media reports of lye-filled bubble gum being handed out in Detroit and rat poison being given in Philadelphia, although these media reports were never substantiated to be actual events. Another notable milestone in the spread of the candy tampering myths was an article published in The New York Times in 1970. This article claimed that \\"Those Halloween goodies that children collect this weekend on their rounds of 'trick or treating' may bring them more horror than happiness\\", and provided specific examples of potential tamperings. Reports and copycat incidents peaked shortly after the Chicago Tylenol murders, which were first reported one month before Halloween in 1982. This incident involved a murderer who added poison to a few bottles of over-the-counter medication after the medication had been delivered to stores. In 2019, the Massachusetts Cannabis Control Commission warned that \\"parents should be on the lookout for products that are unsafe for kids after they trick-or-treat.\\"  Debunking the myths  Joel Best, a sociologist at the University of Delaware, specializes in the scholarly study of candy- tampering legends. He collected newspaper reports from 1958 to 1983 in search of evidence of candy tampering. Fewer than 90 instances might have qualified as actual candy tampering. In none of the cases does he attribute the events to \\"random attempts to harm children\\" at the Halloween holiday. Instead, most cases were attempts by adults to gain financial compensation or, far more commonly, by children to get attention. Best found five child deaths that were initially thought by local authorities to be caused by homicidal strangers, but none of those were sustained by investigation. Fabrications by children are particularly common. Children sometimes copy or act out the stories about tampered candy that they overhear, by adding pins to or pouring household cleaners on their own candy and then reporting the now-unsafe candy to their parents. In these incidents, the children have not been harmed; they know that the dangerous item is present and that it would be unsafe to eat the candy. Far more prevalent during the same period were reports of vandalism, racist incidents, or children being injured in pedestrian‚Äìvehicle collisions on Halloween.  Misattributed poisoning deaths  The deaths of five children were initially blamed on stranger poisoning. However, none of these claims were sustained upon investigation. * In 1970, Kevin Toston, a 5-year-old boy from the Detroit area, found and ate heroin his uncle had stashed. The boy died following a four-day coma. The family attempted to protect the uncle by claiming the drug had been sprinkled in the child's Halloween candy.Carroll, Aaron & Rachel Vreeman (2009). Don't Swallow Your Gum!: Myths, Half-Truths, and Outright Lies about Your Body and Health. Macmillan. p. 146. . * In 1978, Patrick Wiederhold, a two-year-old boy from Flint, Michigan died after eating Halloween candy. However, toxicology tests found no evidence of poison and the death was determined to be due to natural causes. Revised 2008 and 2011. * In 1990, Ariel Katz, a seven-year-old girl in Santa Monica, California, died while trick-or-treating. Early press reports blamed poisoned candy, despite her parents telling the police that she had previously been diagnosed with a serious medical condition, an enlarged heart, which was the actual cause of death. * In 2001, a four-year-old girl in Vancouver, British Columbia died after eating some Halloween candy. However, there was no evidence of poisoned candy, and she actually died of a streptococcus infection. In a 1974 case, an 8-year-old boy from Deer Park, Texas, died after eating a cyanide-laced package of Pixy Stix. A subsequent police investigation eventually determined that the poisoned candy had been planted in his trick-or-treat pile by the boy's father, Ronald Clark O'Bryan, who also gave out poisoned candy to other children in an attempt to cover up the murder, though no other children consumed the poisoned treats. The murderer, who had wanted to claim life insurance money, was executed in 1984. In this case, the distribution of poisoned candy is true, but no children other than the intended victim were harmed.  Media and the myth  Despite these claims of poisoned candy being eventually proved false, the news media promoted the story continuously throughout the 1980s, with local news stations featuring frequent coverage. During this time cases of poisoning were repeatedly reported based on unsubstantiated claims or before a full investigation could be completed and often never followed up on. This one-sided coverage contributed to the overall panic and caused rival media outlets to issue reports of candy tampering as well. However, Joel Best says that the spread of the myth cannot be blamed solely on the media, and that it must have been transmitted via word of mouth as well. By 1985, the media had driven the hysteria about candy poisonings to such a point that an ABC News/Washington Post poll that found 60% of parents feared that their children would be injured or killed because of Halloween candy sabotage. Advice columnists entered the fray during the 1980s and 1990s with both Ask Ann Landers and Dear Abby warning parents of the horrors of candy tampering: > \\"In recent years, there have been reports of people with twisted minds > putting razor blades and poison in taffy apples and Halloween candy. It is > no longer safe to let your child eat treats that come from strangers.\\" ‚ÄìAnn > Landers in 1995 > \\"Somebody's child will become violently ill or die after eating poisoned > candy or an apple containing a razor blade.\\" ‚ÄìDear Abby in 1983  Genuine candy tampering cases  Almost all tampering cases ‚Äì at a rate of one or two per year ‚Äì involve a friend or family member, usually as a prank. Almost all of those involved sharp objects, rather than poisoning. Three- quarters of them resulted in no injuries, and the rest resulted in only minor injuries. No child has ever been killed by eating a Halloween candy from a stranger. Some marijuana edible candy is intentionally manufactured to appear similar to regular candy but is easily distinguished from commercially available regular candy. Concerns have been raised that small children may easily confuse the two. St. Louis DEA claimed to have found marijuana edibles distributed on Halloween in 2017 but did not and has not presented a case.

It is long (1 chain) and wide. The surface is flat and is normally covered with extremely short grass, but can be completely dry or dusty soil with barely any grass or, in some circumstances (that are rarely seen in high level cricket), made from an artificial material. Over the course of a cricket match, the pitch is not repaired or altered other than in special circumstances - meaning that it will change condition. Any grass on the pitch in the game's first over, for example, may have disappeared by the twentieth over due to wear. As almost all deliveries bowled will bounce off the pitch towards the batsmen (the only exception would be a, usually accidental, full toss), the state and type of a cricket pitch can significantly affect the outcome of a match. For example, a dusty, very dry, pitch will favour spin bowling because the ball will grip more on a dusty pitch - giving the team with the superior spin bowlers a significant advantage in the match. The state of the pitch is so important to the outcome of a cricket match that teams can be fined or docked points if they produce a poor pitch that is deemed unfit for normal play, or seen to be a danger to batsmen by the ball behaving erratically when pitching on it, and players can face disciplinary action if they are seen to be deliberately damaging or altering the pitch in ways that are not allowed by the Laws of Cricket. Because of this, coaches, players, commentators and pundits will make much of how the pitch is \\"behaving\\" during a cricket match, especially in a match that takes place over many days, where the condition of the pitch will significantly change over time, such as in a first class match or a test match. They will also place a high level of importance on the coin toss that determines who bats first with regards to the pitch's condition. For example, a captain who choses to bowl first on a pitch that is \\"flat\\" and turns out to be easy to bat on, may subsequently be considered to have made an error. In amateur matches in some parts of the world, artificial pitches are sometimes used. These can be a slab of concrete overlaid with a coir mat or artificial turf. Sometimes dirt is put over the coir mat to provide an authentic feeling pitch. Artificial pitches are rare in professional cricket, being used only when exhibition matches are played in regions where cricket is not a common sport. The pitch has specific markings delineating the creases, as specified by the Laws of Cricket. The word wicket often occurs in reference to the pitch. Although technically incorrect according to the Laws of Cricket (Law 6 covers the pitch and Law 8 the wickets, distinguishing between them), cricket players, followers, and commentators persist in the usage, with context eliminating any possible ambiguity. Track or deck are other synonyms for pitch. The rectangular central area of the cricket field ‚Äì the space used for pitches ‚Äì is known as the square. Cricket pitches are usually oriented as close to the north-south direction as practical, because the low afternoon sun would be dangerous for a batsman facing due west.  Uses of the pitch  The pitch is used for: * Bowling (cricket): Bowlers can bowl the ball by throwing it and making it bounce on the ground of the pitch. * Batting (cricket): Batsmen may occasionally move around the pitch (particularly their crease (cricket) in an effort to make contact with the ball. They may also make small marks on the pitch to indicate where they will stand, and while batting, they sometimes swing the bat in such a way that it hits some of the dirt in the pitch in the air. * Running (cricket): The two batsmen may run along the sides of the pitch, between its ends, to score runs (cricket). * Fielding (cricket): Occasionally fielders (often the bowler) may run on the pitch to run out a batsman. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho0fNxo07fk&t;=57s At any given moment, one end of the pitch will be the striker's end, while the other end is the non-striker's end. After each over, the ends swap. During the game, the bowler bowls from the nonstriker's end to the striker at the other end. Protected area A wicket consists of three stumps that are placed into the ground and topped with two bails. The protected area or danger area is the central portion of the pitch ‚Äì a rectangle running down the middle of the pitch, two feet wide, and beginning five feet from each popping crease. Under the Laws of Cricket, a bowler must avoid running on this area during his follow-through after delivering the ball. The pitch is protected to preserve fairness in the game; the ball normally bounces on the pitch within this region, and if it is scuffed or damaged by the bowler's footmarks it can give an unfair advantage to the bowling side. These areas can be exploited by the bowlers to change the outcome of the match. If a bowler runs on the protected area, an umpire will issue a warning to the bowler and to his team captain. The umpire issues a second and final warning if the bowler transgresses again. On the third offence, the umpire will eject the bowler from the attack and the bowler may not bowl again for the remainder of the innings. The rule does not prevent the bowler or any other fielder from running on the protected area in an effort to field the ball; it applies only to the uninterrupted follow- through. State of the pitch bowler's end. The bowler runs in past one side of the wicket at the bowler's end, either 'over' the wicket or 'round' the wicket A natural pitch with grass longer or more moist than usual is described as a green pitch, green top, or green seamer. This favours the bowler over the batsman as the ball can be made to behave erratically on longer or wet grass. Most club and social cricket is played on pitches that professional cricketers would call green. A sticky wicket ‚Äì a pitch that has become wet and is subsequently drying out, often rapidly in hot sun ‚Äì causes the ball to behave erratically, particularly for the slower or spin bowlers. However, modern pitches are generally protected from rain and dew before and during games so a sticky pitch is rarely seen in first-class cricket. The phrase, however, has retained currency and extended beyond cricket to mean any difficult situation. As a match progresses, the pitch dries out. The Laws of Cricket bar watering the pitch during a match. As it dries out, initially batting becomes easier as any moisture disappears. Over the course of a four or five-day match, however, the pitch begins to crack, then crumble and become dusty. This kind of pitch is colloquially known as a 'dust bowl' or 'minefield'. This again favours bowlers, particularly spin bowlers who can obtain large amounts of traction on the surface and make the ball spin a long way. The relative deterioration and spin-friendliness of a pitch are often referred to by mentioning the number of days it has (or appears to have been) played on. Turner: A pitch which produces prodigious turn. When it produces a great deal of spin, it can be called a \\"square\\", \\"raging\\", or \\"rank\\" turner. This change in the relative difficulties of batting and bowling as the state of the pitch changes during a match is one of the primary strategic considerations that the captain of the team that wins the coin toss will take into account when deciding which team will bat first and can accordingly finalise his decisions. Pitch condition Pitches in different parts of the world have different characteristics. The nature of the pitch plays an important role in the actual game: it may have a significant influence on team selection and other aspects. As the pitch deteriorates throughout a match, this can also have considerable influence on the success or failure of a team's bowling or batting efforts. Pitch safety Certain conditions, as set out by the ICC, must be met to ensure that a pitch is fit and safe to play on. If the pitch is found to excessively favour one side, or if other conditions cause it to be dangerous, the match may, after agreement between the captains and the umpires, be abandoned and possibly rescheduled. Preparation and maintenance of the playing area Law 9 of the Laws of Cricket sets out rules covering the preparation and maintenance of the playing area. Uncovered pitches Cricket was initially played on uncovered pitches. Uncovered pitches began to be phased out in the 1960s. =Covering the pitch= The pitch is said to be covered when the groundsmen have placed covers on it to protect it against rain or dew. The use or non-use of covers significantly affects the way the ball comes off the pitch, making the matter potentially controversial. Law 11 of the Laws of Cricket provides that during the match the pitch shall not be completely covered unless provided otherwise by regulations or by agreement before the toss. When possible, the bowlers' run ups are covered in inclement weather to keep them dry. If the pitch is covered overnight, the covers are removed in the morning at the earliest possible moment on each day that play is expected to take place. If covers are used during the day as protection from inclement weather or if inclement weather delays the removal of overnight covers, they are removed as soon as conditions allow. Excess water can be removed from a pitch or the outfield using a machine called a water hog. Rolling the pitch During the match, the captain of the batting side may request the rolling of the pitch for a period of not more than 7 minutes before the start of each innings (other than the first innings of the match) and before the start of each subsequent day's play. In addition, if, after the toss and before the first innings of the match, the start is delayed, the captain of the batting side may request to have the pitch rolled for not more than 7 minutes, unless the umpires together agree that the delay has had no significant effect on the state of the pitch. Once the game has begun, rolling may not take place other than in these circumstances. If there is more than one roller available, the captain of the batting side shall have the choice. Detailed rules exist to make sure that, where possible, rolling takes place without delaying the game but the game is delayed if necessary to allow the batting captain to have up to 7 minutes rolling if he so wishes. Rolling the pitch can take a long time but will be very effective once done. Rolling of the pitch is crucial to whether it is better for a batsman or a bowler. For the 2010 County Championship season, the heavy roller was banned from use during a County Championship match. The belief was that the heavy roller was helping to make pitches flat, and therefore producing too many drawn games. Sweeping Before a pitch is rolled it is first swept to avoid any possible damage caused by rolling in debris. The pitch is also cleared of any debris at all intervals for meals, between innings and at the beginning of each day. The only exception to this is that the umpires do not allow sweeping to take place where they consider it may be detrimental to the surface of the pitch. Mowing Groundsmen mow the pitch on each day of a match on which play is expected to take place. Once a game has begun, mowings take place under the supervision of the umpires. Footholes and footholds The umpires are required to make sure that bowlers' and batsmen's footholes are cleaned out and dried whenever necessary to facilitate play. In matches of more than one day's duration, if necessary, the footholes made by the bowler in his delivery stride may be returfed or covered with quick-setting fillings to make them safe and secure. Players may also secure their footholes using sawdust provided that the pitch is not damaged or they do not do so in a way that is unfair to the other team. Research England is the hub for considerable research in the preparation of cricket pitches, with Cranfield University working with the ECB and The Institute of Groundsmanship (IOG). Practising on the field The rules do not allow players to practise bowling or batting on the pitch, or on the area parallel and immediately adjacent to the pitch, at any time on any day of the match. Practice on a day of a match on any other part of the cricket square may take place only before the start of play or after the close of play on that day and must cease 30 minutes before the scheduled start of play or if detrimental to the surface of the square. Typically players do practise on the field of play, but not on the cricket square, during the game. Also bowlers sometimes practise run ups during the game. However, no practice or trial run- up is permitted on the field of play during play if it could result in a waste of time. The rules concerning practice on the field are covered principally by Law 26 of the Laws of Cricket. Drop-in pitches A drop-in pitch is a pitch that is prepared away from the ground or venue in which it is used, and \\"dropped\\" into place for a match to take place. This allows multi-purpose venues to host other sports and events with more versatility than a dedicated cricket ground would allow.Gollapudi, Nagraj: \\"Pitch drops in at Darwin\\", CricInfo Australia, July 17, 2003. They were first developed by WACA curator John Maley for use in the World Series Cricket matches, set up in the 1970s by Australian businessman Kerry Packer. Drop-in pitches became necessary for the World Series as they had to play in dual purpose venues operating outside of the cricket establishment.Pringle, Derek: \\"Packer's gamble left lasting legacy\\", The Daily Telegraph, December 28, 2005. Along with other revolutions during the series including the white ball, floodlights, helmets, and coloured clothing, drop-in pitches were designed to also make games more interesting. They would start off bowler friendly seaming and spinning with uneven bounce for the first two days of a game. After that they became extremely easy for batting meaning high targets were chaseable on the fourth and fifth days, although there would still be something in the pitch for the bowlers. In 2005, the Brisbane Cricket Ground (the \\"Gabba\\") rejected the use of a drop-in pitch, despite requests from the ground's other users, the Brisbane Lions AFL team. Although drop-in pitches are regularly used in the Melbourne Cricket Ground and in New Zealand, Queensland Cricket stated that Brisbane's weather and the difference in performance meant they preferred to prepare the ground in the traditional way.\\"Queensland reject drop-in pitch for Gabba\\", CricInfo Australia, August 22, 2005. Plans to use drop-in pitches in baseball parks in the United States have met with problems due to strict rules about transporting soil over state lines. It has been found that the best soil types for drop-in pitches are not located in the same states which have been targeted by cricketing authorities ‚Äì New York, California and Florida.\\"Stillborn in the USA\\", Cricinfo Australia, January 23, 2007 Related usages The word pitch also refers to the bouncing of the ball, usually on the pitch. In this context, the ball is said to pitch before it reaches the batsman. Where the ball pitches can be qualified as pitched short (bouncing nearer the bowler), pitched up (nearer the batsman), or pitched on a length (somewhere in between). Unlike in baseball, the word pitch does not refer to the act of propelling the ball towards the batsman in cricket. In cricket this is referred to as bowling. This action is also referred to as a delivery. Other sports In baseball, some baseball fields used to have a dirt path between the pitcher's mound and the batter's box, similar to the pitch.

It is longer than a vessel element and has no perforation plates. Tracheids are elongated cells in the xylem of vascular plants that serve in the transport of water and mineral salts. Tracheids are one of two types of tracheary elements, vessel elements being the other. Tracheids, unlike vessel elements, do not have perforation plates. All tracheary elements develop a thick lignified cell wall, and at maturity the protoplast has broken down and disappeared. The presence of tracheary elements is the defining characteristic of vascular plants to differentiate them from non-vascular plants. The two major functions that tracheids may fulfill are contributing to the transport system and providing structural support. The secondary walls have thickenings in various forms‚Äîas annular rings; as continuous helices (called helical or spiral); as a network (called reticulate); as transverse nets (called scalariform); or, as extensive thickenings except in the region of pits (called pitted). Tracheids provide most of the structural support in softwoods, where they are the major cell type. Because tracheids have a much higher surface to volume ratio compared to vessel elements, they serve to hold water against gravity (by adhesion) when transpiration is not occurring. This is likely one mechanism that helps plants prevent air embolisms. The term \\"tracheid\\" was introduced by Carl Sanio in 1863, originally as Tracheide, in German.

Stumping or being stumped is a method of dismissing a batsman. The umpire calling stumps means the play is over for the day. Part of the wicket A wicket consists of three stumps that are inserted into the ground, and topped with two bails. The stumps are three vertical posts which support two bails. The stumps and bails are usually made of wood, most commonly ash, and together form a wicket at each end of the pitch. The overall width of each wicket is 9 inches (22.9 cm). Each stump is 28 inches (71.1 cm) tall with maximum and minimum diameters of 1 inches (3.81 cm) and 1 inches (3.49 cm). They have a spike at one end for inserting into the ground, and the other end has a U-shaped 'through groove' to provide a resting place for the bails. In junior cricket the items have lesser dimensions. Each stump is referred to by a specific name: * Off stump is the stump on the off side of the wicket (the same side as the batsman's bat). * Middle stump is the centre stump, the middle of the three stumps. * Leg stump is the stump on the on side of the wicket (the same side as the batsman's legs). These names are relative to the batsman, so a right-handed batsman's leg stump becomes the off stump when a left-handed player is batting. Modern innovations In modern professional play, the stumps are often branded with a sponsor's logo. Although they are too far away from spectators to be seen, such logos are visible on television coverage. =Stump cam= For professional matches, often one or more of the stumps is hollow and contains a small television camera. This is aligned vertically, but can view through a small window on the side of the stump via a mirror. The so-called stump-cam gives a unique view of play for action replays, particularly when a batsman is bowled. =Zing Bails (light-up stumps)= A recent innovation are stumps and bails embedded with red LEDs, which flash when they are completely dislodged. Invented by an Australian engineer and trademarked as \\"Zing Bails\\", they were designed to aid both umpires with run-out or stumping decisions as well as provide distinctive images to television coverage during day-night matches. LED stumps were first used at the 2014 ICC World Twenty20, and have since become commonplace in major white-ball matches like ODIs or franchise T20 leagues. They have also been used in day/night Test matches. Manner of dismissing a batsmanEnd of the day's play Stumps is also used as a term to mean the end of a day's play, e.g. \\"The umpires called stumps\\" means that the umpires have declared play over for the day. At the end of a session, i.e. before lunch or tea, the umpires will remove the bails; at the end of the day's play, the umpires will also remove the stumps.

Wrigley Jr. Company, known as the Wrigley Company, is an American chewing gum (Wrigley's gum) company, based in the Global Innovation Center (GIC) in Goose Island, Chicago, Illinois. It is wholly owned by Mars, Incorporated, and along with Mars chocolate bars and other candy products, makes up Mars Wrigley Confectionery. It is the largest manufacturer and marketer of chewing gum in the world. The company currently sells its products in more than 180 countries and districts, maintains operations in over 50 countries, and has 21 production facilities in 14 countries including the United States, Mexico, Spain, the United Kingdom, France, Czechia, Colombia, Poland, Russia, China, India, Japan, Kenya, Taiwan, Australia, and New Zealand.  History  The company was founded on April 1, 1891, by William Wrigley Jr. Wrigley's announced the closure of its Santa Cruz, California manufacturing plant in April 1996. The plant had been built in 1955. The 385,000-square-foot manufacturing facility was put on the market in October 1996 for US$11.3 million, or about $30 a square foot. In 2005, Wrigley purchased Life Savers and Altoids from Kraft Foods for US$1.5 billion.\\"Heritage Timeline\\", Wrigley Company. Retrieved on September 25, 2012. On January 23, 2007, Wrigley signed a purchase agreement to acquire an 80% initial interest in A. Korkunov for $300 million with the remaining 20% to be acquired over time. On April 28, 2008, Mars announced that it would acquire Wrigley for approximately $23 billion. Financing for the transaction was provided by Berkshire Hathaway, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan; Berkshire Hathaway held a minority equity investment in Wrigley until October 2016. The Wrigley Building on Michigan Avenue, one of Chicago's best-known landmarks on the Magnificent Mile, was originally the company's global headquarters until 2011, when it was sold to an investor group that included Zeller Realty Group as well as Groupon co-founders Eric Lefkofsky and Brad Keywell. The company has been headquartered in the GIC since 2012. In 2016, Mars announced that Wrigley would be merged with its chocolate segment to form a new subsidiary, Mars Wrigley Confectionery. The new company will maintain global offices in Chicago, while moving its U.S. offices to New Jersey, in Hackettstown and Newark, respectively. Corporate leadership=1891‚Äì1932: William Wrigley Jr. In 1891, 29-year-old William Wrigley Jr. (1861‚Äì1932) came to Chicago from Philadelphia with $32 and the idea to start a business selling Wrigley's Scouring Soap. Wrigley offered premiums as an incentive to buy his soap, such as baking powder. Later in his career, he switched to the baking powder business, in which he began offering two packages of chewing gum for each purchase of a can of baking powder. The popular premium, chewing gum, began to seem more promising. Wrigley also became the majority owner of the Chicago Cubs in 1921. 1932‚Äì1961: Philip K. Wrigley After the death of William Wrigley Jr., his son Philip K. Wrigley (1894‚Äì1977) assumed his father's position as CEO of the Wrigley Company. Wrigley is most well known for his unusual move to support US troops and protect the reputation of the Wrigley brand during World War II, in which he dedicated the entire output of Wrigley's Spearmint, Doublemint, and Juicy Fruit to the US Armed Forces. Wrigley launched the \\"Remember this Wrapper\\" ad campaign to keep the Wrigley brands on the minds of the customers during times of wartime rationing. Wrigley's P.K. brand was named after P.K. Wrigley.http://www.wrigley.com/aunz/contact-us/product-faq.aspx 1961‚Äì1999: William Wrigley III In 1961, Philip K. Wrigley handed control to his son, William Wrigley III (1933‚Äì1999). Wrigley led a strategic global expansion through the establishment of Wrigley facilities in nine new countries. On June 26, 1974, a Marsh Supermarket in Troy, Ohio installed the first bar code scanning equipment. The first product to be scanned using a Universal Product Code (UPC) bar code was a 10-pack of Wrigley's Juicy Fruit gum.Bellis, Mary. \\"Bar Codes\\", Inventors, About.com Guide, September 26, 2012. (This pack of gum is now on display at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History.) In 1984, Wrigley introduced a new gum, Extra, which followed the new trend of sugar-free gums in the US. Wrigley also assumed control of the Chicago Cubs after his father's death in 1977, and sold the team to the Chicago Tribune in 1981. 1999‚Äì2006: William Wrigley IV William \\"Beau\\" Wrigley IV (1963‚Äì), following the death of Wrigley III (his father), led the sugar-free gum campaign across Europe, Australia, Spain, India, and China. In 2005, Kraft Foods sold the Life Savers and Altoids businesses to Wrigley in exchange for $1.5 billion as part of a reorganization plan.Warner, Melanie. \\"Kraft Foods Will Sell Altoids and Life Savers to Wrigley\\", The New York Times, November 16, 2004. accessed September 26, 2012. Wrigley led the establishment of the Wrigley Science Institute (WSI) in 2006 to study the oral health benefits of gum chewing. The WSI investigates the effects of gum chewing on weight management, stress relief, concentration, and oral health. 2006‚Äì2008: William Perez On October 23, 2006, William D. Perez (1948‚Äì) succeeded Bill Wrigley as CEO. He was the first person outside the Wrigley family to head the company. In 2007, the company debuted 5 Gum in the US. The 5 Gum brand was marketed using cinematic TV commercials portraying \\"How it feels like to chew 5 Gum\\". Perez led the efforts of improving slimmer packaging (Slim Pack) with flavor improvements across both Extra and Wrigley brands. 2008‚Äì2011: Dushan \\"Duke\\" Petrovich Dushan Petrovich (1954‚Äì) succeeded Perez almost immediately after Mars, Incorporated's 2008 purchase of Wrigley. In 2009, Wrigley's Global Innovation Center received the LEED Gold Certification through Wrigley's commitment to global sustainability. In the 2010 Olympic Games in Vancouver, British Columbia, Wrigley was the Official Confectionery Supplier of the games, in which the company sported Olympic- themed packs and products. 2011‚Äì2017: Martin Radvan Martin Radvan became the president of the Wrigley Company after Petrovich.

Before starting work on the album, the band toured with Full Cycle DJs Krust and Die (in fact, their band with Roni Size, Reprazent, won the Mercury Prize in 1997 and thus put the kibosh on a notion to have them produce). As such, the disc is marked by a deep drum and bass influence and by a scattershot approach to production: Tchad Blake (the band's own Ruby Vroom, Latin Playboys, Sheryl Crow), Pat Dillett (They Might Be Giants, Doveman, Mary J. Blige), and British drum and bass DJ Optical (Goldie, Grooverider, Ed Rush). Artist Jim Woodring (Frank) drew the cartoon \\"monkey-bear\\" on the disc's cover. The chorus of the song \\"$300\\" is a sample of a Chris Rock joke; singer Mike Doughty heard the joke which is backmasked on Rock's Roll with the New. Curious, Doughty recorded it into his ASR-10 sampler with the intention of simply reversing it and seeing what the joke was, and wrote the song around what he found there. The song was used in the House episode \\"The Softer Side\\" in 2009. Without crediting it, Steinberg borrowed the bassline for the song \\"Maybe I'll Come Down\\" from the melody of the Jake Holmes song \\"Dazed and Confused,\\" which was covered by Led Zeppelin. The disc contained their biggest hit single, \\"Circles\\". Tchad Blake, who produced the tune, hated it, and told them it would be a mistake to release it. Cartoon Network gave it a music video in which a Flintstones cartoon was synched to the song as part of their Groovies interstitial. The music video featured Fred, Barney and other Hanna-Barbera characters walking in front of the same repeating background. The video for the song \\"Rolling\\" was also produced, which was synced with a scene from a Betty Boop cartoon. The song was used in the 2004 remake of Walking Tall.

The fielding team's players can hit the wicket with the ball in a number of ways to get a batsman out. ** The wicket is guarded by a batsman who, with his bat (and sometimes with his pads, but see the laws on LBW, leg before wicket), attempts to prevent the ball from hitting the wicket (if it does, he is bowled out) and to score runs where possible. * Through metonymic usage, the dismissal of a batsman is known as the taking of a wicket, * The cricket pitch itself is sometimes referred to (incorrectly, according to the Laws of Cricket) as the wicket. History The origin of the word is from wicket gate, a small gate. Originally, cricket wickets had only two stumps and one bail and looked like a gate, much like the wicket used in the North American game of wicket (sport). The third (middle) stump was introduced in 1775, after Lumpy Stevens bowled three successive deliveries to John Small that went straight through the two stumps rather than hitting them. Stumps and bails stumps, upright wooden poles that are hammered into the ground, topped with two wooden crosspieces, known as the bails. The size and shape of the wicket has changed several times during the last 300 years; its dimensions and placing is now determined by Law 8 in the Laws of Cricket, thus: * Law 8: The wickets. The wicket consists of three wooden stumps that are tall. The stumps are placed along the batting crease with equal distances between each stump. They are positioned so they are wide. Two wooden bails are placed in shallow grooves on top of the stumps. The bails must not project more than above the stumps, and must, for cricket, be long. There are also specified lengths for the barrel and spigots of the bail. There are different specifications for the wickets and bails for junior cricket. The umpires may dispense with the bails if conditions are unfit (e.g., if it is windy they might fall off by themselves). Further details on the specifications of the wickets are contained in Appendix D to the laws. Putting down a wicket The wicket can be thought of as the target of the fielding team, as the bowler (cricket) and fielders alike can dismiss the batter by hitting the wicket, and in particular, can prevent run-scoring (off a ball that has not reached the boundary) by managing or threatening to run out batters. For a batsman to be dismissed by being bowled, run out, stumped or hit wicket, his wicket needs to be put down. This generally occurs when a fielder throws the ball at the wicket, or hits it with ball in hand. What this means is defined by Law 29. A wicket is put down if: * A bail is completely removed from the top of the stumps * A stump is struck out of the grounds by the ball, the striker's bat, the striker's person (or by any part of his clothing or equipment becoming detached from his person), a fielder (with his hand or arm, and provided that the ball is held in the hand or hands so used, or in the hand of the arm so used). * A 2010 amendment to the Laws clarified the rare circumstance where a bat breaks during the course of a shot and the detached debris breaks the wicket; the wicket has been put down in this circumstance. The wicket is also put down if a fielder pulls a stump out of the ground in the same manner. Bill O'Reilly hits the stumps but does not dislodge the bail, Sydney, 1932. The wicket was not put down, and so the batsman (Herbert Sutcliffe) was not out. Special situations: *If one bail is off, removing the remaining bail or striking or pulling any of the three stumps out of the ground is sufficient to put the wicket down. A fielder may remake the wicket, if necessary, to put it down to have an opportunity of running out a batsman. *If however both bails are off, a fielder must remove one of the three stumps out of the ground with the ball, or pull it out of the ground with a hand or arm, provided that the ball is held in the hand or hands so used, or in the hand of the arm so used. If the umpires have agreed to dispense with bails, because, for example, it is too windy for the bails to remain on the stumps, the decision as to whether the wicket has been put down is one for the umpire concerned to decide. After a decision to play without bails, the wicket has been put down if the umpire concerned is satisfied that the wicket has been struck by the ball, by the striker's bat, person, or items of his clothing or equipment separated from his person as described above, or by a fielder with the hand holding the ball or with the arm of the hand holding the ball. Modern innovations As per the ICC Playing Conditions, when using the LED wickets, \\"the moment at which the wicket has been put down [...] shall be deemed to be the first frame in which the LED lights are illuminated and subsequent frames show the bail permanently removed from the top of the stumps.\\"https://icc-static- files.s3.amazonaws.com/ICC/document/2020/02/18/50c52297-70b0-4c12-9a8e-e9068cfe0c71/ICC- Men-s-ODI-Playing-Conditions-2019.pdf The manufacturer is reviewing the LED wicket's performance after a number of international cricketers criticized the Zing bails during the 2019 Cricket World Cup. Dismissal of a batsman A scoreboard showing the total runs scored and wickets lost The dismissal of a batsman is known as the taking of a wicket. The batsman is said to have lost his wicket, the batting side is said to have lost a wicket, the fielding side to have taken a wicket, and the bowler is also said to have taken his (i.e. the batsman's) wicket, if the dismissal is one of the types for which the bowler receives credit. This language is used even if the dismissal did not actually involve the stumps and bails in any way, for example, a catch. Though note that the other four of the five most common methods of dismissal (bowled, LBW, run out, and stumped) involve the stumps and bails being put down (in the case of LBW, theoretically). The word wicket has this meaning in the following contexts: Scoring A team's score is described in terms of the total number of runs scored and the total number of wickets lost. Bowling analyses The number of wickets taken is a primary measure of an individual bowler's ability, and a key part of a bowling analysis. Batting partnerships The sequence of time over which two particular batsmen bat together, a partnership, is referred to as a specifically numbered wicket when discriminating it from other partnerships in the innings. This can be thought of as saying \\"this was the number of runs scored while this team had lost [n-1] wickets and had yet to lose their nth wicket.\\" *The first wicket partnership is from the start of the innings until the team loses its first wicket, i.e. one of the first two batsmen is dismissed. * The second wicket partnership is from when the third batsman starts batting until the team loses its second wicket, i.e. the time from when they have lost one wicket until the time they have lost a second wicket, which happens when a second batsman is dismissed. * etc... * The tenth wicket or last wicket partnership is from when the eleventh (last) batsman starts batting until the team loses its tenth (last) wicket, i.e. a tenth (last) batsman is dismissed. Winning by number of wickets A team can win a match by a certain number of wickets. This means that they were batting last, and reached the winning target with a certain number of batsmen still not dismissed. For example, if the side scored the required number of runs to win with only three batsmen dismissed, they are said to have won by seven wickets (as a team's innings ends when ten batsmen are dismissed). The pitch The word wicket is also sometimes used to refer to the cricket pitch itself. According to the Laws of Cricket, this usage is incorrect, but it is in common usage and commonly understood by cricket followers. The term sticky wicket refers to a situation in which the pitch has become damp, typically due to rain or high humidity. This makes the path of the ball more unpredictable thus making the job of defending the stumps that much more difficult. The full phrase is thought to have originally been \\"to bat on a sticky wicket.\\" Such pitches were commonplace at all levels of the game (i.e. up to Test match level) until the late 1950s. In other sports The arches used in croquet and roque are sometimes referred to as wickets, especially in American English. These arches descend from the ancestral game of ground billiards (which may also be related to cricket), and were formerly called the hoop, arch or port. The port remained a prominent feature of indoor table billiards until well into the 18th century. In baseball, the strike zone is similar to the wicket, in that a batter who fails to hit a ball that is going towards the strike zone is at risk of being out.

In the 1980s, it was regarded as the best newspaper in mainland China with a circulation of 5 million a day. Its present circulation is estimated to be nearly one million in 40 countries and regions.\\"A brief introduction to China Youth Daily,\\" China Youth Online It has been operated by the Communist Youth League since 1951. As of October 2006, the Party leader is Mr Wang Hong You; Publisher is Xu Wenxin; the current Editor-in-Chief is Chen Xiaochuan (). He replaces outgoing editor Li Erliang (). Background The China Youth Daily was established in 1951, six years before the Chinese Socialist Youth League decided to change its name to Communist Youth League of China (CYL). As the mission of CYL, at the present stage, is to unite and lead the young people in the country, hoping to transfuse new blood into the CPC, and recruit young personnel for the political party. China Youth Daily also tries to bring news, ideas, and information into nationwide circulation, following the CYL principles. Thus, China Youth Daily has helped the CPC, enabling them to project their voice to a wider public in China. In another perspective, the newspaper's content is, to some extent, regulated by the CPC. Although China youth Daily is run by the CYL, it is also the first for profit newspaper in China. The profit enables the paper to support itself, and the paper welcomes individuals as well as companies to advertise in the paper. Freezing Point (ÂÜ∞ÁÇπ pinyin: Bing di«én), a four-page weekly supplement of China Youth Daily was temporarily shut down by the Chinese government in early 2006, due to an anti-censorship letter posted by columnist Li Datong. According to the Washington Post, government censors accused the section of \\"'viciously attacking the socialist system' and condemned a recent article in it that criticized the history textbooks used in Chinese middle schools.\\" Pressure from retired high-level party officials and senior scholars forced the government to allow publication again, but without its former editor and top investigative reporter, according to the New York Times. Management The administrative structure of the China Youth Daily is divided into two parts. The top of the hierarchy includes the president and the chief editor. Below them are the vice president, the vice chief editor, and the secretary. But like all other papers with a CPC background, China Youth Daily is ultimately directed by the Propaganda Department of the CPC. Although this does not mean that the Propaganda Department often influences the direction and the content of the paper, it is authorized and has the right to do so. Apart from the central hierarchy, there are six other departments which help the daily running of the paper. They include the office, editorial board, management department, business developmental department, human resources department, and the party office. Under the editorial board, management department and business developmental department, many branches handle the daily work. Most of the employees, including journalists working for the paper, are members of the Communist Party, graduated from important Chinese universities. Editorial stance The editor has said that \\"they must stand in the same stance with the State\\" on the issue of internal migration in China. \\"Media summary- China,\\" Marketing The paper has a circulation of nearly 1,000,000 copies a day. As it is an integrated nationwide newspaper which targets the young generation in China, it covers political, social, and economic news which particularly concerns both the youth of the country and the CPC. The China Youth Daily has the goal of attracting a primary readership among professionals between the age of 21 to 48. To maintain its goal, the paper has established an online version in 2000, the China Youth Online (CYOL). During approximately 3 years of existence, CYOL has generated 31 different channels to increase diversity to different users. Both the China Youth Daily and CYOL are now offering more than the hardcore political ideas, social, and economic news; the website now includes news for public examinations, overseas study opportunities, career planning, fashion, entertainment, etc. As it is the first for-profit governmental newspaper in China, it welcomes advertisements from individuals, local and foreign companies. Readership According to research conducted by China Youth Daily and CYOL, most readers of the newspaper and online users are between the ages of 18 to 48. The majority of readers are of the age of 19-25 (50%) and 26-35 (32%). Around 75% of the readers are male and only around 25% of them are female. Most readers attain a tertiary education background and more than 60% of them have an income of 1000RMB or less. Although the paper is circulated nationwide, it gains more popularity in the east (31%), the central part (18%) and the north (16%) comparatively to the other regions of China. According to the Asia Leadership Fellow Program, \\"China Youth Daily (CYD) is one of the most influential newspapers in contemporary China with a circulation of 800,000 (readership, which is much more, is not officially recorded). A market research report by China Statistical Bureau ranks CYD in third place on the reading rate among the national daily papers.\\" Websites The Chinese version of China Youth Daily Online has been established since 2000. As mentioned before, websites are established for different reasons and needs; for example, to attract and maintain readership and to make it more accessible to foreign users. China Youth Online 250px China Youth Online is China's first independently operated central government news media website which has started its operation since 15 February 2000. The portal is targeted towards the youth community in Mainland China. It offers the online version of China Youth Daily and distributes content, souvenirs, books, and magazines published by China Youth Daily. Like China Youth Daily, CYOL basically channels for education, people, military, networks, life, and service information. During early 2004, China Youth Daily together with CYOL have a daily circulation of 2 million in China, CYOL has successfully created new readership and profit since its establishment. Subsidiary newspapers and magazines A number of newspapers and magazines are produced under the leadership of China Youth Daily. These subsidiary newspapers and magazines are designed to suit the taste of special readers and provide topical and targeted news. Elite Reference A weekly newspaper, set up in 1984, which focuses on international news. The former editors-in-chief were: *Liang Ping and Zhang Shuangwu (2004‚Äì2005), and *Wang Yao (2005‚Äì2006).

However, some Biblical scholars view this as an eponymous metaphor providing an aetiology of the connectedness of the tribe to others in the Israelite confederation. Name Two different etymologies for the name of Issachar have been proposed based on the text of the Torah, which some textual scholars attribute to different sources‚Äîone to the Yahwist and the other to the Elohist. The first derives it from ish sakar, meaning man of hire, in reference to Leah's hire of Jacob's sexual favours for the price of some mandrakes.Genesis 30:16 The second derives it from yesh sakar, meaning there is a reward, in reference to Leah's opinion that the birth of Issachar was a divine reward for giving her handmaid Zilpah to Jacob as a concubine.Genesis 30:18 Scholars suspect the former explanation to be the more likely name for a tribe, though some scholars have proposed a third etymology‚Äîthat it derives from ish Sokar, meaning man of Sokar, in reference to the tribe's perhaps originally worshipping Sokar, an Egyptian deity.Jewish Encyclopedia The second consonant of Yissachar was originally the shin of ish, creating the pronunciation Yish-sakar. The third consonant is the sin of sakar or sakir. The shin has merged into the sin, creating the pronunciation Yisaschar. Some customs pronounce both the second and third consonants as sin and read the name as Yissas‚Äôchar, either on all or some occasions. Historical theories In the Biblical account, Leah's status as the first wife of Jacob is regarded by biblical scholars as indicating that the authors saw the tribe of Issachar as being one of the original Israelite groups; however, this may have been the result of a scribal error, as the names of Issachar and Naphtali appear to have changed places elsewhere in the text, and the birth narrative of Issachar and Naphtali is regarded by textual scholars as having been spliced together from its sources in a manner which has highly corrupted the narrative.Richard Elliott Friedman, Who wrote the bible?Peake's commentary on the Bible A number of scholars think that the tribe of Issachar actually originated as the Shekelesh group of Sea PeoplesYigael Yadin And Dan, Why Did He Remain in ShipsSandars, N.K. The Sea Peoples. Warriors of the ancient Mediterranean, 1250-1150 BC. Thames & Hudson,1978 \\\\- the name Shekelesh can be decomposed as men of the Shekel in Hebrew, a meaning synonymous with man of hire (ish sakar); scholars believe that the memory of such non-Israelite origin would have led to the Torah's authors having given Issachar a handmaiden as a matriarch. Rabbinical interpretations In classical rabbinical literature, it is stated that Issachar was born on the fourth of Av, and lived 122 years. According to the midrashic Book of Jasher, Issachar married Aridah, the younger daughter of Jobab, a son of Joktan; the Torah states that Issachar had four sons, who were born in Canaan and migrated with him to Egypt,Genesis 46:13 with their descendants remaining there until the Exodus.book of Exodus The midrashic Book of Jasher portrays Issachar as somewhat pragmatic, due to his strong effort in being more learned, less involved with other matters which led him to such actions like taking a feeble part in military campaigns involving his brothers, and generally residing in strongly fortified cities and, depending on his brother Zebulun's financial support in return for a share in the spiritual reward he gains. The Talmud argues that Issachar's description in the Blessing of Jacob - Issachar is a strong ass lying down between two burdens: and he saw that settled life was good, and the land was pleasant; and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant unto tributeGenesis 49:14-15 \\\\- is a reference to the religious scholarship of the tribe of Issachar, though scholars feel that it may more simply be a literal interpretation of Issachar's name.Jewish Encyclopedia, Tribe of Issachar In Islam Some Muslim genealogists link Shuayb to Abraham through both Sarah and Keturah by making Shuayb's genealogy to be Shuayb b. Isaachar b. Midian b. Abraham. In popular culture A minor Jewish character in Voltaire's Candide goes by the name \\"Don Issachar\\". A song by the Mighty Mighty Bosstones' album Don't Know How to Party is called \\"Issachar\\". Isaachar is a character in Andrew Lloyd Webber's Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat.

In her two years as Minister, she set up the Public Health Agency of Canada, appointed the first Chief Public Health Officer for Canada, and established the Public Health Network. She was chair of the Canada-Israel Friendship Group from 1999 to 2003 and is a member of Liberal Parliamentarians for Israel. In the 2006 election, Bennett defeated two main challengers who were both touted as star candidates, Peter Kent of the Conservatives and Paul Summerville of the New Democratic Party. Bennett was re-elected, but lost her cabinet position as the Liberals were defeated. She became only the third opposition MP in the history of St. Paul's. The riding had once been a noted bellwether, but swung heavily to the Liberals along with most other central Toronto ridings. She announced on April 24, 2006 that she would pursue the leadership of the party. On September 15, 2006, she withdrew from the leadership race and threw her support behind former Ontario Premier Bob Rae. In the 39th Parliament, Bennett was the Official Opposition critic for social development, social economy, seniors, persons with disabilities, and public health. She was re-elected in 2008. In the 40th Parliament, Bennett was the Official Opposition critic for health. She was re- elected in 2011. In the 41st Parliament, Bennett was the Liberal critic for Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Aboriginal Affairs, Northern Development, and the Canadian Northern Economic Development Agency. On November 4, 2015, Bennett was appointed the Minister of Indigenous and Northern Affairs in the present Cabinet, headed by Justin Trudeau. She is the fifth most senior member of Justin Trudeau's cabinet. Personal life She is married to Canadian film producer Peter O'Brian. They have two sons.

The company was founded in 1929, and produced motorcars licensed from the British Austin Motor Company from 1930 through 1934, when it filed for bankruptcy. In 1935 the company was reorganized under the name American Bantam. Production resumed in 1937 and continued through 1941, including the first prototype of what later became the Jeep. History American Austin Car Company was founded in 1929, in Butler, Pennsylvania, in premises that had belonged to the Standard Steel Car Company. Their intention was to assemble and sell in the United States a version of the Austin 7 car, called American Austin. After some initial success the Great Depression set in, and sales fell off to the point that production was suspended. In 1934 the company filed for bankruptcy. The automobile was designed in the hopes of creating a market for small-car enthusiasts in the United States. The cars had inline-four engines, enabling the car to return , and travel per fill of oil.Old Car Advertising Retrieved 12 September 2013 It was capable of in high gear.Old Car Advertising Retrieved 12 September 2013 Styling resembled small Chevrolets, with Stutz- and Marmon-style horizontal hood louvres. The bodies were designed by Alexis de Sakhnoffsky and made by the Hayes Body Company of Detroit. The coupe was billed as a sedan, and sold for $445, slightly less than a Ford V8 roadster. The Great Depression made the cheaper secondhand cars more appealing, so sales dropped off. More than 8,000 cars were sold during the company's first (and best) year of sales, but sales fell off to the point that production was suspended in 1932. It restarted in 1934 with bodies now made in-house, but stopped again between 1935 and 1937. About 20,000 cars were produced. Beginning in the 1960s, the car gained a following with hot rodders, as well as among drag racers. The wheelbase made it attractive, even compared to the Anglia. 1939 American Bantam American Bantam In 1935, Roy Evans, a former salesman for Austin, bought out the bankrupt company, which was reorganized under the name American Bantam. The formal connection with UK Austin was severed, though a relationship was maintained. A series of changes were made to the American Austin car design, including a modified engine and an exterior sheetmetal designed by Alexis de Sakhnoffsky. Production was resumed in 1937, and continued through 1941. Despite a wide range of Bantam body styles, ranging from light trucks to woodie station wagons, only about 6,000 Bantams of all types were produced. American Bantam's 1938 model was the inspiration for Donald Duck's car which was first seen in Don Donald (1937). Bantam pre-production WWII jeep The jeep prototypes and pre-production ‚Äì end of the company U.S. Army Signal Corps photo may have inspired the \\"Flying Jeep\\" poster, the 'Leaping Lena' nickname, etc. American Bantam is credited with the design of the first World War II jeep, by Karl Probst and Harold Crist, and built 2,675 of their pre-production designs, ca. 1941. More than half of the initial production went to the British Army, and some to the Soviet Union. Some of the motors and chassis were imported from Toledo, Ohio; the original bodies were made at the American Bantam Car factory in Butler, Pennsylvania. The Bantam company produced the most fuel-efficient engine and first prototype under the original US government tender specifications and was awarded the first contract, but because Willys Overland used a more powerful engine. However, because elements favorable to Ford within the Quartermaster Corps claimed that Bantam lacked production capacity to produce the vehicle on the scale needed by the United States Department of War, the awarding of ongoing contracts was reopened. Eventually the U.S. Army gave the BRC (Bantam Reconnaissance Car) 40 designs to Willys-Overland and awarded the bulk of orders to Willys and Ford, while Bantam went on to produce jeep trailers (T-3). After jeep production stopped, Bantam made two-wheel trailers for them. This continued until the company was taken over by American Rolling Mills in 1956.

Three slips and a wicket-keeper (to the right). They are some distance from the batter due to the pace of the bowler. In cricket, a slip fielder (collectively, a slip cordon or the slips) is placed behind the batter on the off side of the field. They are placed with the aim of catching an edged ball which is beyond the wicket-keeper's reach. Many teams employ two or three slips (numbered from the slip fielder closest to the wicket-keeper: first slip, second slip, etc.). A floating slip is sometimes employed, usually in limited over games, who patrols an area in the slip cordon that would ordinarily be occupied by more than one fielder. The slip cordon's distance from the batter increases with the pace of the bowler; generally they will be marginally further away from the batter than the wicket-keeper is. Because of the resulting geometry, spin bowlers generally have fewer slips in the cordon than a fast bowler would in an equivalent game situation. As fielding in the slips requires quick reflexes and sure hands, usually the most adept catchers in the team will make up the slip cordon. Most slip fielders are top order batters. Specialist slip fielders are sometimes called \\"slippers\\". The term slips is also used to refer to the area of the field where the slip cordon stands, or nth slip used specifically to refer to one slip fielder's position‚Äîe.g., a ball may be described as being edged through third slip if it goes where a third slip would otherwise have been. Famous slip fielders With the most catches in test cricket, former Indian captain Rahul Dravid is considered one the greatest slip fielders of all time. Mark Waugh would probably be considered the best of all time, with other brilliant exponents of the craft including Brian Lara, Sunil Gavaskar, Shane Warne, Michael Clarke, Sir Garfield Sobers, Bobby Simpson, Ian Chappell, Jacques Kallis, Brian McMillan, Mark Taylor, Ricky Ponting, VVS Laxman , Mahela Jayawardene, Stephen Fleming, Younis Khan and Matthew Hayden. Gully Fielding positions for a right-handed batter, showing slips, gully and leg slip. The gully fielder is an extension of the line of slips and fields almost square to the batter; gully is also the name given to that area of the field. A fielder standing at gully would be standing on the imaginary straight line that extends from the on-side corner of batter's popping crease to middle stump towards the slip cordon. The position of gully was invented in the 1880s by Arthur Jones, who later became England captain, at Bedford Modern School in Bedford. It was quickly adopted by EHD Sewell at Bedford School and then gained in popularity thereafter. Off theory Enticing the batter to edge and hit a catch to the wicket-keeper or slips is the standard wicket-taking tactic in off theory. To do so, the bowler tries to make the ball deviate off its expected line away from the batter's body on the off-side. Outswingers or leg cutters, or the standard leg spinner are delivery types that have this effect. Unsurprisingly, bowlers bowling these deliveries effectively generally have larger slip cordons than those who are not. On occasion, four or five slips are called for. England used seven slips in the first Test against West Indies in Jamaica in 2004; Australia went further and used the maximum of nine slips against Zimbabwe's lower order batters in a One Day International in 2001 (the two non-slips fieldsmen in this example were the wicket-keeper and the bowler). Leg slip A fielder in the equivalent position on the on side of the wicket-keeper is known as a leg slip; this is considerably less common than the off-side slip, and for a team to employ more than one leg slip is highly unusual. It is illegal, under Law 41.5, to have more than two fielders in the area between square leg and long stop, to prevent the fielding team from making use of bodyline tactics. Writing in The Cricketers of My Time (1833), John Nyren of Hambledon hints at the origin of the word \\"slips\\" when he describes the function of a long stop as a fielder who is required to cover many slips from the bat, both to the leg and the off-side.

As members of the family Ocypodidae, fiddler crabs are most closely related to the ghost crabs of the genus Ocypode. This entire group is composed of small crabs ‚Äì the largest being slightly over two inches (5 cm) across. Fiddler crabs are found along sea beaches and brackish inter-tidal mud flats, lagoons and swamps. Fiddler crabs are most well known for their sexually dimorphic claws; the males‚Äô major claw is much larger than the minor claw while the females‚Äô claws are both the same size.Levinton, J. S., Judge, M. L., and Kurdziel, J. P., 1995, Functional differences between the major and minor claws of fiddler crabs (Uca, family Ocypodidae, order Decapoda, Subphylum Crustacea): A result of selection or developmental constraint?: Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology, v. 193, p. 147-160. Like all crabs, fiddler crabs shed their shells as they grow. If they have lost legs or claws during their present growth cycle, a new one will be present when they molt. If the large fiddle claw is lost, males will develop one on the opposite side after their next molt. Newly molted crabs are very vulnerable because of their soft shells. They are reclusive and hide until the new shell hardens. Fiddler crabs exhibit a constant circadian rhythm in a controlled laboratory setting that mimics the ebb and flow of the tides. The crabs turn dark in the day and light in the dark. Ecology Found in mangroves, in salt marshes, and on sandy or muddy beaches of West Africa, the Western Atlantic, the Eastern Pacific, Indo-Pacific and Algarve region of Portugal, fiddler crabs are easily recognized by their distinctively asymmetric claws. Male lemon-yellow clawed fiddler crab (Uca perplexa), waving Fiddler crabs communicate by a sequence of waves and gestures; males have an oversized claw or chela; used in clashes of ritualised combat of courtship over a female and signal their intentions between conspecifics. The movement of the smaller claw from ground to mouth during feeding explains the crabs' common name; it looks as if the animal were playing the larger claw like a fiddle. The crab's smaller claw picks up a chunk of sediment from the ground and brings it to the mouth, where its contents are sifted through (making the crab a detritivore). After anything edible is salvaged, be it algae, microbes, fungus, or other decaying detritus, the sediment is replaced in the form of a little ball. The presence of these sediment balls near the entrance to a burrow is a good indication of its occupation. Some experts believe that the feeding habits of fiddler crabs play a vital role in the preservation of wetland environments; by sifting through the sands, they aerate the substrate and prevent anaerobic conditions. Life cycle General anatomy of a fiddler crab Fiddler crabs live rather brief lives of no more than two years (up to three years in captivity). Male fiddler crabs use the major claw to perform a waving display as a form of female courtship.Pope, D. S., 2000, Testing function of fiddler crab claw waving by manipulating social context: Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, v. 47, p. 432-437. Females choose their mate based on claw size and also quality of the waving display.Perez, D. M., Rosenberg, M. S., and Pie, M. R., 2012, The evolution of waving displays in fiddler crabs (Uca spp., Crustacea: Ocypodidae): Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, v. 106, p. 307-315. In many fiddler crab species, the female occupies the burrow of their mate while she lays her clutch of eggs. Research shows that the male major claw size is also correlated with burrow width; the width of the burrow influences incubation temperature.Reaney, L. T., and Backwell, P. R. Y., 2007, Temporal constraints and female preference for burrow width in the fiddler crab, Uca mjoebergi: Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, v. 61, p. 1515-1521. Therefore, the female will choose a male mate whose claw size indicates the best burrow environment for her clutch of eggs. The waving display is also thought to indicate to females the overall healthiness of the male; a more vigorous display is more difficult to do and thus requires the male to be in prime health condition, which suggests that the male will help produce viable offspring.Matsumasa, M., Murai, M., and Christy, J. H., 2013, A low-cost sexual ornament reliably signals male condition in the fiddler crab Uca beebei: Animal Behaviour, v. 85, p. 1335-1341. Male versus male competition also occurs as fighting with the major claws.Callander, S., Kahn, A. T., Maricic, T., Jennions, M. D., and Backwell, P. R. Y., 2013, Weapons or mating signals? Claw shape and mate choice in a fiddler crab: Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, v. 67, p. 1163-1167. If a male loses his larger claw, the smaller one will begin to grow larger and the lost claw will regenerate into a new (small) claw. For at least some species of fiddler crabs, however, the small claw remains small, while the larger claw regenerates over a period of several molts, being about half its former size after the first molt. The female fiddler carries her eggs in a mass on the underside of her body. She remains in her burrow during a two-week gestation period, after which she ventures out to release her eggs into the receding tide. The larvae remain planktonic for a further two weeks. Fiddler crabs such as Uca mjoebergi have been shown to bluff about their fighting ability. Upon regrowing a lost claw, a crab will occasionally regrow a weaker claw that nevertheless intimidates crabs with smaller but stronger claws. This is an example of dishonest signalling. The dual functionality of the major claw of fiddler crabs has presented an evolutionary conundrum in that the claw mechanics best suited for fighting do not match up with the mechanics best suited for a waving display.Swanson, B. O., George, M. N., Anderson, S. P., and Christy, J. H., 2013, Evolutionary variation in the mechanics of fiddler crab claws: Bmc Evolutionary Biology, v. 13.

Analyzing the determinants of health of a population and the threats it faces is the basis for public health. The public can be as small as a handful of people or as large as a village or an entire city; in the case of a pandemic it may encompass several continents. The concept of health takes into account physical, psychological, and social well- being. As such, according to the World Health Organization, it is not merely the absence of disease or infirmity and more recently, a resource for everyday living.Frequently asked questions from the \\"Preamble to the Constitution of the World Health Organization\\" as adopted by the International Health Conference, 1946 Public health is an interdisciplinary field. For example, epidemiology, biostatistics, social sciences and management of health services are all relevant. Other important sub-fields include environmental health, community health, behavioral health, health economics, public policy, mental health, health education, occupational safety, disability, gender issues in health, and sexual and reproductive health. Public health aims to improve the quality of life through prevention and treatment of disease, including mental health. This is done through the surveillance of cases and health indicators, and through the promotion of healthy behaviors. Common public health initiatives include promotion of hand-washing and breastfeeding, delivery of vaccinations, suicide prevention, smoking cessation, obesity education, increasing healthcare accessibility and distribution of condoms to control the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. Modern public health practice requires multidisciplinary teams of public health workers and professionals. Teams might include epidemiologists, biostatisticians, physician assistants, public health nurses, midwives, medical microbiologists, economists, sociologists, geneticists, data managers, environmental health officers (public health inspectors), bioethicists, gender experts, sexual and reproductive health specialists, physicians, and even veterinarians. Like in other nations, access to health care and public health initiatives are difficult challenges in developing countries. Public health infrastructures are still forming in those countries. Background Community health workers The focus of a public health intervention is to prevent and mitigate diseases, injuries and other health conditions through surveillance of cases and the promotion of healthy behaviors, communities and environments. Many diseases are preventable through simple, nonmedical methods. For example, research has shown that the simple act of handwashing with soap can prevent the spread of many contagious diseases.Global Public-Private Partnership for Handwashing with Soap. Handwashing research , accessed 19 April 2011. In other cases, treating a disease or controlling a pathogen can be vital to preventing its spread to others, either during an outbreak of infectious disease or through contamination of food or water supplies. Public health communications programs, vaccination programs and distribution of condoms are examples of common preventive public health measures. Measures such as these have contributed greatly to the health of populations and increases in life expectancy. Public health plays an important role in disease prevention efforts in both the developing world and in developed countries through local health systems and non-governmental organizations. The World Health Organization (WHO) is the international agency that coordinates and acts on global public health issues. Most countries have their own governmental public health agency, often called the ministry of health, with responsibility for domestic health issues. In the United States, state and local health departments are on the front line of public health initiatives. In addition to their national duties, the United States Public Health Service (PHS), led by the Surgeon General of the United States, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, headquartered in Atlanta, are also involved with international health activities. In Canada, the Public Health Agency of Canada is the national agency responsible for public health, emergency preparedness and response, and infectious and chronic disease control and prevention. The Public health system in India is managed by the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare of the government of India with state-owned health care facilities.  Current practice = Public health programs  Most governments recognize the importance of public health programs in reducing the incidence of disease, disability, and the effects of aging and other physical and mental health conditions. However, public health generally receives significantly less government funding compared with medicine. Although the collaboration of local health and government agencies is considered best practice to improve public health, the pieces of evidence available to support this is limited. Public health programs providing vaccinations have made progress in promoting health, including the eradication of smallpox, a disease that plagued humanity for thousands of years. Global Smallpox Eradication Program reading the news that smallpox had been globally eradicated, 1980 The World Health Organization (WHO) identifies core functions of public health programs including:World Health Organization. The role of WHO in public health, accessed 19 April 2011. * providing leadership on matters critical to health and engaging in partnerships where joint action is needed; * shaping a research agenda and stimulating the generation, translation and dissemination of valuable knowledge; * setting norms and standards and promoting and monitoring their implementation; * articulating ethical and evidence-based policy options; * monitoring the health situation and assessing health trends. In particular, public health surveillance programs can:World Health Organization. Public health surveillance, accessed 19 April 2011. * serve as an early warning system for impending public health emergencies; * document the impact of an intervention, or track progress towards specified goals; and * monitor and clarify the epidemiology of health problems, allow priorities to be set, and inform health policy and strategies. * diagnose, investigate, and monitor health problems and health hazards of the community Public health surveillance has led to the identification and prioritization of many public health issues facing the world today, including HIV/AIDS, diabetes, waterborne diseases, zoonotic diseases, and antibiotic resistance leading to the reemergence of infectious diseases such as tuberculosis. Antibiotic resistance, also known as drug resistance, was the theme of World Health Day 2011. Although the prioritization of pressing public health issues is important, Laurie Garrett argues that there are following consequences. When foreign aid is funneled into disease-specific programs, the importance of public health in general is disregarded. This public health problem of stove piping is thought to create a lack of funds to combat other existing diseases in a given country. For example, the WHO reports that at least 220 million people worldwide suffer from diabetes. Its incidence is increasing rapidly, and it is projected that the number of diabetes deaths will double by the year 2030.World Health Organization. Diabetes Fact Sheet N¬∞312, January 2011. Accessed 19 April 2011. In a June 2010 editorial in the medical journal The Lancet, the authors opined that \\"The fact that type 2 diabetes, a largely preventable disorder, has reached epidemic proportion is a public health humiliation.\\" The risk of type 2 diabetes is closely linked with the growing problem of obesity. The WHO's latest estimates as of June 2016 highlighted that globally approximately 1.9 billion adults were overweight in 2014, and 41 million children under the age of five were overweight in 2014.World Health Organization. Obesity and overweight Fact sheet N¬∞311, Updated June 2016. Accessed 19 April 2011. The United States is the leading country with 30.6% of its population being obese. Mexico follows behind with 24.2% and the United Kingdom with 23%. Once considered a problem in high-income countries, it is now on the rise in low- income countries, especially in urban settings. Many public health programs are increasingly dedicating attention and resources to the issue of obesity, with objectives to address the underlying causes including healthy diet and physical exercise. Some programs and policies associated with public health promotion and prevention can be controversial. One such example is programs focusing on the prevention of HIV transmission through safe sex campaigns and needle-exchange programs. Another is the control of tobacco smoking. Changing smoking behavior requires long-term strategies, unlike the fight against communicable diseases, which usually takes a shorter period for effects to be observed. Many nations have implemented major initiatives to cut smoking, such as increased taxation and bans on smoking in some or all public places. Supporters argue by presenting evidence that smoking is one of the major killers, and that therefore governments have a duty to reduce the death rate, both through limiting passive (second-hand) smoking and by providing fewer opportunities for people to smoke. Opponents say that this undermines individual freedom and personal responsibility, and worry that the state may be encouraged to remove more and more choice in the name of better population health overall. Simultaneously, while communicable diseases have historically ranged uppermost as a global health priority, non-communicable diseases and the underlying behavior-related risk factors have been at the bottom. This is changing, however, as illustrated by the United Nations hosting its first General Assembly Special Summit on the issue of non-communicable diseases in September 2011.United Nations. Press Conference on General Assembly Decision to Convene Summit in September 2011 on Non-Communicable Diseases. New York, 13 May 2010. Many health problems are due to maladaptive personal behaviors. From an evolutionary psychology perspective, over consumption of novel substances that are harmful is due to the activation of an evolved reward system for substances such as drugs, tobacco, alcohol, refined salt, fat, and carbohydrates. New technologies such as modern transportation also cause reduced physical activity. Research has found that behavior is more effectively changed by taking evolutionary motivations into consideration instead of only presenting information about health effects. The marketing industry has long known the importance of associating products with high status and attractiveness to others. Films are increasingly being recognized as a public health tool. In fact, film festivals and competitions have been established to specifically promote films about health. Conversely, it has been argued that emphasizing the harmful and undesirable effects of tobacco smoking on other persons and imposing smoking bans in public places have been particularly effective in reducing tobacco smoking.Valerie Curtis and Robert Aunger. \\"Motivational mismatch: evolved motives as the source of‚Äîand solution to‚Äîglobal public health problems\\". In Applications in health care As well as seeking to improve population health through the implementation of specific population-level interventions, public health contributes to medical care by identifying and assessing population needs for health care services, including: * Assessing current services and evaluating whether they are meeting the objectives of the health care system * Ascertaining requirements as expressed by health professionals, the public and other stakeholders * Identifying the most appropriate interventions * Considering the effect on resources for proposed interventions and assessing their cost-effectiveness * Supporting decision making in health care and planning health services including any necessary changes. * Informing, educating, and empowering people about health issues Implementing effective improvement strategies To improve public health, one important strategy is to promote modern medicine and scientific neutrality to drive the public health policy and campaign, which is recommended by Armanda Sol√≥rzano, through a case study of the Rockefeller Foundation's hookworm campaign in Mexico in the 1920s. Soloranza argues that public health policy can't concern only politics or economics. Political concerns can lead government officials to hide the real numbers of people affected by disease in their regions, such as upcoming elections. Therefore, scientific neutrality in making public health policy is critical; it can ensure treatment needs are met regardless of political and economic conditions. The history of public health care shows the global effort to improve health care for all. However, in modern-day medicine, real, measurable change has not been clearly seen, and critics argue that this lack of improvement is due to ineffective methods that are being implemented. As argued by Paul E. Farmer, structural interventions could possibly have a large impact, and yet there are numerous problems as to why this strategy has yet to be incorporated into the health system. One of the main reasons that he suggests could be the fact that physicians are not properly trained to carry out structural interventions, meaning that the ground level health care professionals cannot implement these improvements. While structural interventions can not be the only area for improvement, the lack of coordination between socioeconomic factors and health care for the poor could be counterproductive, and end up causing greater inequity between the health care services received by the rich and by the poor. Unless health care is no longer treated as a commodity, global public health will ultimately not be achieved. This being the case, without changing the way in which health care is delivered to those who have less access to it, the universal goal of public health care cannot be achieved. Another reason why measurable changes may not be noticed in public health is because agencies themselves may not be measuring their programs' efficacy. Perrault et al. analyzed over 4,000 published objectives from Community Health Improvement Plans (CHIPs) of 280 local accredited and non-accredited public health agencies in the U.S., and found that the majority of objectives ‚Äì around two-thirds ‚Äì were focused on achieving agency outputs (e.g., developing communication plans, installing sidewalks, disseminating data to the community). Approximately one-third focused on seeking measurable changes in the populations they serve (i.e., changing people's knowledge, attitudes, behaviors). What this research showcases is that if agencies are only focused on accomplishing tasks (i.e., outputs) and do not have a focus on measuring actual changes in their populations with the activities they perform, it should not be surprising when measurable changes are not reported. Perrault et al. advocate for public health agencies to work with those in the discipline of Health Communication to craft objectives that are measurable outcomes, and to assist agencies in developing tools and methods to be able to track more proximal changes in their target populations (e.g., knowledge and attitude shifts) that may be influenced by the activities the agencies are performing.  Public Health 2.0  Welfare, Public Health and Family Policy Area of the Flemish Government 2018 Public Health 2.0 is a movement within public health that aims to make the field more accessible to the general public and more user-driven. The term is used in three senses. In the first sense, \\"Public Health 2.0\\" is similar to \\"Health 2.0\\" and describes the ways in which traditional public health practitioners and institutions are reaching out (or could reach out) to the public through social media and health blogs. In the second sense, \\"Public Health 2.0\\" describes public health research that uses data gathered from social networking sites, search engine queries, cell phones, or other technologies. A recent example is the proposal of statistical framework that utilizes online user-generated content (from social media or search engine queries) to estimate the impact of an influenza vaccination campaign in the UK. In the third sense, \\"Public Health 2.0\\" is used to describe public health activities that are completely user-driven. An example is the collection and sharing of information about environmental radiation levels after the March 2011 tsunami in Japan. In all cases, Public Health 2.0 draws on ideas from Web 2.0, such as crowdsourcing, information sharing, and user-centered design. While many individual healthcare providers have started making their own personal contributions to \\"Public Health 2.0\\" through personal blogs, social profiles, and websites, other larger organizations, such as the American Heart Association (AHA) and United Medical Education (UME), have a larger team of employees centered around online driven health education, research, and training. These private organizations recognize the need for free and easy to access health materials often building libraries of educational articles. Developing countries Emergency response team in Burma after Cyclone Nargis in 2008 There is a significant disparity in access to health care and public health initiatives between developed countries and developing countries, as well as within developing countries. In developing countries, public health infrastructures are still forming. There may not be enough trained health workers, monetary resources or, in some cases, sufficient knowledge to provide even a basic level of medical care and disease prevention. As a result, a large majority of disease and mortality in developing countries results from and contributes to extreme poverty. For example, many African governments spend less than US$10 per person per year on health care, while, in the United States, the federal government spent approximately US$4,500 per capita in 2000. However, expenditures on health care should not be confused with spending on public health. Public health measures may not generally be considered \\"health care\\" in the strictest sense. For example, mandating the use of seat belts in cars can save countless lives and contribute to the health of a population, but typically money spent enforcing this rule would not count as money spent on health care. Large parts of the world remained plagued by largely preventable or treatable infectious diseases. In addition to this however, many developing countries are also experiencing an epidemiological shift and polarization in which populations are now experiencing more of the effects of chronic diseases as life expectancy increases, the poorer communities being heavily affected by both chronic and infectious diseases. Another major public health concern in the developing world is poor maternal and child health, exacerbated by malnutrition and poverty. The WHO reports that a lack of exclusive breastfeeding during the first six months of life contributes to over a million avoidable child deaths each year. Intermittent preventive therapy aimed at treating and preventing malaria episodes among pregnant women and young children is one public health measure in endemic countries. Since the 1980s, the growing field of population health has broadened the focus of public health from individual behaviors and risk factors to population-level issues such as inequality, poverty, and education. Modern public health is often concerned with addressing determinants of health across a population. There is a recognition that health is affected by many factors including region of residence, genetics, income, educational status and social relationships; these are known as \\"social determinants of health\\". The upstream drivers such as environment, education, employment, income, food security, housing, social inclusion and many others effect the distribution of health between and within populations and are often shaped by policy. A social gradient in health runs through society. The poorest generally suffer the worst health, but even the middle classes will generally have worse health outcomes than those of a higher social level. The new public health advocates for population-based policies that improve health in an equitable manner.  Health aid in developing countries  Health aid to developing countries is an important source of public health funding for many developing countries. Health aid to developing countries has shown a significant increase after World War II as concerns over the spread of disease as a result of globalization increased and the HIV/AIDS epidemic in sub- Saharan Africa surfaced. From 1990 to 2010, total health aid from developed countries increased from 5.5 billion to 26.87 billion with wealthy countries continuously donating billions of dollars every year with the goal of improving population health. Some efforts, however, receive a significantly larger proportion of funds such as HIV which received an increase in funds of over $6 billion between 2000 and 2010 which was more than twice the increase seen in any other sector during those years. Health aid has seen an expansion through multiple channels including private philanthropy, non-governmental organizations, private foundations such as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, bilateral donors, and multilateral donors such as the World Bank or UNICEF. The result has been a sharp rise in uncoordinated and fragmented funding of an ever-increasing number of initiatives and projects. To promote better strategic cooperation and coordination between partners, particularly among bilateral development agencies and funding organizations, the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) spearheaded the establishment of ESSENCE,https://www.who.int/tdr/partnerships/essence/en/ an initiative to facilitate dialogue between donors/funders, allowing them to identify synergies. ESSENCE brings together a wide range of funding agencies to coordinate funding efforts. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted how global health security is reliant on all countries around the world, including low- and middle-income countries, having strong health systems and at least a minimum of health research capacities. In an article 2020 in Annals of Global Health,Kilmarx PH, Maitin T, Adam T, Akuffo H, Aslanyan G, Cheetham M, Corr√™a- Oliveira R, Kay S, Khelef N, Kunaratnam Y, Kupfer L, Olesen OF. A Mechanism for Reviewing Investments in Health Research Capacity Strengthening in Low- and Middle-Income Countries. Annals of Global Health. 2020; 86(1): 92, 1‚Äì4. DOI: https://doi.org/10.5334/aogh.2941 the ESSENCE group outlined a mechanism for review of investment in health research capacity building in low- and middle-income countries. The review mechanism will give funders of research for health the information to identify the gaps in capacity that exist in low- and middle-income countries and the opportunity to work together to address those disparities. The overall goal is increased, coordinated support of research on national health priorities as well as improved pandemic preparedness in LMICs, and, eventually, fewer countries with very limited health research capacity. In 2009 health aid from the OECD amounted to $12.47 billion which amounted to 11.4% of its total bilateral aid. In 2009, Multilateral donors were found to spend 15.3% of their total aid on bettering public healthcare. = International health aid debates = Debates exist questioning the efficacy of international health aid. Supporters of aid claim that health aid from wealthy countries is necessary in order for developing countries to escape the poverty trap. Opponents of health aid claim that international health aid actually disrupts developing countries' course of development, causes dependence on aid, and in many cases the aid fails to reach its recipients. For example, recently, health aid was funneled towards initiatives such as financing new technologies like antiretroviral medication, insecticide-treated mosquito nets, and new vaccines. The positive impacts of these initiatives can be seen in the eradication of smallpox and polio; however, critics claim that misuse or misplacement of funds may cause many of these efforts to never come into achievement. Economic modeling based on the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation and the World Health Organization has shown a link between international health aid in developing countries and a reduction in adult mortality rates. However, a 2014‚Äì2016 study suggests that a potential confounding variable for this outcome is the possibility that aid was directed at countries once they were already on track for improvement. That same study, however, also suggests that 1 billion dollars in health aid was associated with 364,000 fewer deaths occurring between ages 0 and 5 in 2011.  Sustainable development goals for 2030  To address current and future challenges in addressing health issues in the world, the United Nations have developed the Sustainable Development Goals building off the Millennium Development Goals of 2000 to be completed by 2030. These goals in their entirety encompass the entire spectrum of development across nations, however Goals 1‚Äì6 directly address health disparities, primarily in developing countries. These six goals address key issues in Global Public Health, Poverty, Hunger and Food security, Health, Education, Gender equality and women's empowerment, and water and sanitation. Public health officials can use these goals to set their own agenda and plan for smaller scale initiatives for their organizations. These goals hope to lessen the burden of disease and inequality faced by developing countries and lead to a healthier future. The links between the various sustainable development goals and public health are numerous and well established: * Living below the poverty line is attributed to poorer health outcomes and can be even worse for persons living in developing countries where extreme poverty is more common. A child born into poverty is twice as likely to die before the age of five compared to a child from a wealthier family. * The detrimental effects of hunger and malnutrition that can arise from systemic challenges with food security are enormous. The World Health Organization estimates that 12.9 percent of the population in developing countries is undernourished. * Health challenges in the developing world are enormous, with \\"only half of the women in developing nations receiving the recommended amount of healthcare they need. * Educational equity has yet to be reached in the world. Public health efforts are impeded by this, as a lack of education can lead to poorer health outcomes. This is shown by children of mothers who have no education having a lower survival rate compared to children born to mothers with primary or greater levels of education. Cultural differences in the role of women vary by country, many gender inequalities are found in developing nations. Combating these inequalities has shown to also lead to a better public health outcome. * In studies done by the World Bank on populations in developing countries, it was found that when women had more control over household resources, the children benefit through better access to food, healthcare, and education. * Basic sanitation resources and access to clean sources of water are a basic human right. However, 1.8 billion people globally use a source of drinking water that is contaminated by feces, and 2.4 billion people lack access to basic sanitation facilities like toilets or pit latrines. A lack of these resources is what causes approximately 1000 children a day to die from diarrheal diseases that could have been prevented from better water and sanitation infrastructure.  U.S. initiatives  The U.S. Global Health Initiative was created in 2009 by President Obama in an attempt to have a more holistic, comprehensive approach to improving global health as opposed to previous, disease-specific interventions. The Global Health Initiative is a six-year plan, \\"to develop a comprehensive U.S. government strategy for global health, building on the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) to combat HIV as well as U.S. efforts to address tuberculosis (TB) and malaria, and augmenting the focus on other global health priorities, including neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), maternal, newborn and child health (MNCH), family planning and reproductive health (FP/RH), nutrition, and health systems strengthening (HSS)\\". The GHI programs are being implemented in more than 80 countries around the world and works closely with the United States Agency for International Development, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the United States Deputy Secretary of State. There are seven core principles: #Women, girls, and gender equality #Strategic coordination and integration #Strengthen and leverage key multilaterals and other partners #Country- ownership #Sustainability through Health Systems #Improve metrics, monitoring, and evaluation #Promote research and innovation The aid effectiveness agenda is a useful tool for measuring the impact of these large scale programs such as The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI) which have been successful in achieving rapid and visible results. The Global Fund claims that its efforts have provided antiretroviral treatment for over three million people worldwide. GAVI claims that its vaccination programs have prevented over 5 million deaths since it began in 2000. Education and training Education and training of public health professionals is available throughout the world in Schools of Public Health, Medical Schools, Veterinary Schools, Schools of Nursing, and Schools of Public Affairs. The training typically requires a university degree with a focus on core disciplines of biostatistics, epidemiology, health services administration, health policy, health education, behavioral science, gender issues, sexual and reproductive health, public health nutrition, and environmental and occupational health.Public Health Agency of Canada. Canadian Public Health Workforce Core Competencies, accessed 19 April 2011. In the global context, the field of public health education has evolved enormously in recent decades, supported by institutions such as the World Health Organization and the World Bank, among others. Operational structures are formulated by strategic principles, with educational and career pathways guided by competency frameworks, all requiring modulation according to local, national and global realities. It is critically important for the health of populations that nations assess their public health human resource needs and develop their ability to deliver this capacity, and not depend on other countries to supply it. Schools of public health: a US perspective In the United States, the Welch-Rose Report of 1915 reprinted in has been viewed as the basis for the critical movement in the history of the institutional schism between public health and medicine because it led to the establishment of schools of public health supported by the Rockefeller Foundation. The report was authored by William Welch, founding dean of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, and Wickliffe Rose of the Rockefeller Foundation. The report focused more on research than practical education. Some have blamed the Rockefeller Foundation's 1916 decision to support the establishment of schools of public health for creating the schism between public health and medicine and legitimizing the rift between medicine's laboratory investigation of the mechanisms of disease and public health's nonclinical concern with environmental and social influences on health and wellness. Even though schools of public health had already been established in Canada, Europe and North Africa, the United States had still maintained the traditional system of housing faculties of public health within their medical institutions. A $25,000 donation from businessman Samuel Zemurray instituted the School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine at Tulane University in 1912 conferring its first doctor of public health degree in 1914. The Yale School of Public Health was founded by Charles-Edward Avory Winslow in 1915. The Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health became an independent, degree-granting institution for research and training in public health, and the largest public health training facility in the United States,The World Book Encyclopedia, 1994, p. 135.Education of the Physician: International Dimensions.

Board on Health Care Services. Washington, DC: National Academy Press, p. 53. when it was founded in 1916. By 1922, schools of public health were established at Columbia and Harvard on the Hopkins model. By 1999 there were twenty nine schools of public health in the US, enrolling around fifteen thousand students. Over the years, the types of students and training provided have also changed. In the beginning, students who enrolled in public health schools typically had already obtained a medical degree; public health school training was largely a second degree for medical professionals. However, in 1978, 69% of American students enrolled in public health schools had only a bachelor's degree. Degrees in public health Schools of public health offer a variety of degrees which generally fall into two categories: professional or academic. The two major postgraduate degrees are the Master of Public Health (MPH) or the Master of Science in Public Health (MSPH). Doctoral studies in this field include Doctor of Public Health (DrPH) and Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in a subspecialty of greater Public Health disciplines. DrPH is regarded as a professional degree and PhD as more of an academic degree. Professional degrees are oriented towards practice in public health settings. The Master of Public Health, Doctor of Public Health, Doctor of Health Science (DHSc/DHS) and the Master of Health Care Administration are examples of degrees which are geared towards people who want careers as practitioners of public health in health departments, managed care and community-based organizations, hospitals and consulting firms, among others. Master of Public Health degrees broadly fall into two categories, those that put more emphasis on an understanding of epidemiology and statistics as the scientific basis of public health practice and those that include a more wide range of methodologies. A Master of Science of Public Health is similar to an MPH but is considered an academic degree (as opposed to a professional degree) and places more emphasis on scientific methods and research. The same distinction can be made between the DrPH and the DHSc. The DrPH is considered a professional degree and the DHSc is an academic degree. Academic degrees are more oriented towards those with interests in the scientific basis of public health and preventive medicine who wish to pursue careers in research, university teaching in graduate programs, policy analysis and development, and other high-level public health positions. Examples of academic degrees are the Master of Science, Doctor of Philosophy, Doctor of Science (ScD), and Doctor of Health Science (DHSc). The doctoral programs are distinct from the MPH and other professional programs by the addition of advanced coursework and the nature and scope of a dissertation research project. In the United States, the Association of Schools of Public HealthAssociation of Schools of Public Health represents Council on Education for Public Health (CEPH) accredited schools of public health. Delta Omega is the honor society for graduate studies in public health. The society was founded in 1924 at the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health. Currently, there are approximately 68 chapters throughout the United States and Puerto Rico.Delta Omega website (primary source) History=Early history the Black Death; 1346-1353) intensified urban responses to disaster on the basis of earlier practices.

Biblioth√®que royale de Belgique, MS 13076-77, f. 24v.alt= From the beginnings of human civilization, communities promoted health and fought disease at the population level. Definitions of health as well as methods to pursue it differed according to the medical, religious and natural-philosophical ideas groups held, the resources they had, and the changing circumstances in which they lived. Yet few early societies displayed the hygienic stagnation or even apathy often attributed to them. The latter reputation is mainly based on the absence of present-day bioindicators, especially immunological and statistical tools developed in light of the germ theory of disease transmission. Public health was born neither in Europe nor as a response to the Industrial Revolution. Preventive health interventions are attested almost anywhere historical communities have left their mark. In Southeast Asia, for instance, Ayurvedic medicine and subsequently Buddhism fostered occupational, dietary and sexual regimens that promised balanced bodies, lives and communities, a notion strongly present in Traditional Chinese Medicine as well.Leung, Angela Ki Che. ‚ÄúHygi√®ne et sant√© publique dans la Chine pr√©-moderne.‚Äù In Les hygienists. Enjeux, mod√®les et practiques. Edited by Patrice Bourdelais, 343-71 (Paris: Belin, 2001) Among the Mayans, Aztecs and other early civilizations in the Americas, population centers pursued hygienic programs, including by holding medicinal herbal markets. And among Aboriginal Australians, techniques for preserving and protecting water and food sources, micro-zoning to reduce pollution and fire risks, and screens to protect people against flies were common, even in temporary camps. Western European, Byzantine and Islamicate civilizations, which generally adopted a Hippocratic, Galenic or humoral medical system, fostered preventive programs as well. These were developed on the basis of evaluating the quality of local climates, including topography, wind conditions and exposure to the sun, and the properties and availability of water and food, for both humans and nonhuman animals. Diverse authors of medical, architectural, engineering and military manuals explained how to apply such theories to groups of different origins and under different circumstances.McVaugh, Michael R. ‚ÄúArnald of Villanova‚Äôs Regimen Almarie (Regimen Castra Sequentium) and Medieval Military Medicine.‚Äù Viator 23 (1992): 201-14 This was crucial, since under Galenism bodily constitutions were thought to be heavily shaped by their material environments, so their balance required specific regimens as they traveled during different seasons and between climate zones.L.J.

Edited by William V. Harris, 126-46 (Leiden: Brill, 2016) In Christian monasteries across the Eastern Mediterranean and western Europe since at least the fifth century CE, monks and nuns pursued strict but balanced regimens, including nutritious diets, developed explicitly to extend their lives. And royal, princely and papal courts, which were often mobile as well, likewise adapted their behavior to suit environmental conditions in the sites they occupied. They could also choose sites they considered salubrious for their members and sometimes had them modified.Agostino Paravicini Bagliani, ‚ÄòLa Mobilit√† della Curia romana nel Secolo XIII: Riflessi locali‚Äô, in Societ√† e Istituzioni dell‚ÄôItalia comunale: l‚ÄôEsempio di Perugia (Secoli XII-XIV), 2 vols.

In numerous sites the upkeep of infrastructures, including roads, canals and marketplaces, as well as zoning policies, were introduced explicitly to preserve residents‚Äô health.

Such measures relied in turn on better transportation and communication networks, through which news on human and animal disease was efficiently spread. Modern public health The 18th century saw rapid growth in voluntary hospitals in England. The latter part of the century brought the establishment of the basic pattern of improvements in public health over the next two centuries: a social evil was identified, private philanthropists brought attention to it, and changing public opinion led to government action. 1802 caricature of Edward Jenner vaccinating patients who feared it would make them sprout cowlike appendages The practice of vaccination became prevalent in the 1800s, following the pioneering work of Edward Jenner in treating smallpox. James Lind's discovery of the causes of scurvy amongst sailors and its mitigation via the introduction of fruit on lengthy voyages was published in 1754 and led to the adoption of this idea by the Royal Navy.Vale, Brian. \\"The Conquest of Scurvy in the Royal Navy 1793‚Äì1800: A Challenge to Current Orthodoxy\\". The Mariners' Mirror, volume 94, number 2, May 2008, pp. 160‚Äì175. Efforts were also made to promulgate health matters to the broader public; in 1752 the British physician Sir John Pringle published Observations on the Diseases of the Army in Camp and Garrison, in which he advocated for the importance of adequate ventilation in the military barracks and the provision of latrines for the soldiers. With the onset of the Industrial Revolution, living standards amongst the working population began to worsen, with cramped and unsanitary urban conditions. In the first four decades of the 19th century alone, London's population doubled and even greater growth rates were recorded in the new industrial towns, such as Leeds and Manchester. This rapid urbanisation exacerbated the spread of disease in the large conurbations that built up around the workhouses and factories. These settlements were cramped and primitive with no organized sanitation. Disease was inevitable and its incubation in these areas was encouraged by the poor lifestyle of the inhabitants. Unavailable housing led to the rapid growth of slums and the per capita death rate began to rise alarmingly, almost doubling in Birmingham and Liverpool. Thomas Malthus warned of the dangers of overpopulation in 1798. His ideas, as well as those of Jeremy Bentham, became very influential in government circles in the early years of the 19th century. =Public health legislation= Sir Edwin Chadwick was a pivotal influence on the early public health campaign. The first attempts at sanitary reform and the establishment of public health institutions were made in the 1840s. Thomas Southwood Smith, physician at the London Fever Hospital, began to write papers on the importance of public health, and was one of the first physicians brought in to give evidence before the Poor Law Commission in the 1830s, along with Neil Arnott and James Phillips Kay. Smith advised the government on the importance of quarantine and sanitary improvement for limiting the spread of infectious diseases such as cholera and yellow fever. The Poor Law Commission reported in 1838 that \\"the expenditures necessary to the adoption and maintenance of measures of prevention would ultimately amount to less than the cost of the disease now constantly engendered\\". It recommended the implementation of large scale government engineering projects to alleviate the conditions that allowed for the propagation of disease. The Health of Towns Association was formed at Exeter Hall London on 11 December 1844, and vigorously campaigned for the development of public health in the United Kingdom. Its formation followed the 1843 establishment of the Health of Towns Commission, chaired by Sir Edwin Chadwick, which produced a series of reports on poor and insanitary conditions in British cities. These national and local movements led to the Public Health Act, finally passed in 1848. It aimed to improve the sanitary condition of towns and populous places in England and Wales by placing the supply of water, sewerage, drainage, cleansing and paving under a single local body with the General Board of Health as a central authority. The Act was passed by the Liberal government of Lord John Russell, in response to the urging of Edwin Chadwick. Chadwick's seminal report on The Sanitary Condition of the Labouring Population was published in 1842 and was followed up with a supplementary report a year later. Full text at Internet Archive (archive.org) Vaccination for various diseases was made compulsory in the United Kingdom in 1851, and by 1871 legislation required a comprehensive system of registration run by appointed vaccination officers. Further interventions were made by a series of subsequent Public Health Acts, notably the 1875 Act. Reforms included latrinization, the building of sewers, the regular collection of garbage followed by incineration or disposal in a landfill, the provision of clean water and the draining of standing water to prevent the breeding of mosquitoes. The Infectious Disease (Notification) Act 1889 mandated the reporting of infectious diseases to the local sanitary authority, which could then pursue measures such as the removal of the patient to hospital and the disinfection of homes and properties. In the United States, the first public health organization based on a state health department and local boards of health was founded in New York City in 1866.United States Public Health Service, Municipal Health Department Practice for the Year 1923 (Public Health Bulletin # 164, July 1926), pp. 348, 357, 364 =Epidemiology= John Snow's dot map, showing the clusters of cholera cases in the London epidemic of 1854 The science of epidemiology was founded by John Snow's identification of a polluted public water well as the source of an 1854 cholera outbreak in London. Dr. Snow believed in the germ theory of disease as opposed to the prevailing miasma theory. He first publicized his theory in an essay, On the Mode of Communication of Cholera, in 1849, followed by a more detailed treatise in 1855 incorporating the results of his investigation of the role of the water supply in the Soho epidemic of 1854. By talking to local residents (with the help of Reverend Henry Whitehead), he identified the source of the outbreak as the public water pump on Broad Street (now Broadwick Street). Although Snow's chemical and microscope examination of a water sample from the Broad Street pump did not conclusively prove its danger, his studies of the pattern of the disease were convincing enough to persuade the local council to disable the well pump by removing its handle.Vinten-Johansen, Peter, et al. (2003). Cholera, Chloroform, and the Science of Medicine: A Life of John Snow. Oxford University Press. Snow later used a dot map to illustrate the cluster of cholera cases around the pump. He also used statistics to illustrate the connection between the quality of the water source and cholera cases. He showed that the Southwark and Vauxhall Waterworks Company was taking water from sewage-polluted sections of the Thames and delivering the water to homes, leading to an increased incidence of cholera. Snow's study was a major event in the history of public health and geography. It is regarded as the founding event of the science of epidemiology.Johnson, Steven (2006).

Riverhead Books. =Disease control= Paul-Louis Simond injecting a plague vaccine in Karachi, 1898 With the pioneering work in bacteriology of French chemist Louis Pasteur and German scientist Robert Koch, methods for isolating the bacteria responsible for a given disease and vaccines for remedy were developed at the turn of the 20th century. British physician Ronald Ross identified the mosquito as the carrier of malaria and laid the foundations for combating the disease. Joseph Lister revolutionized surgery by the introduction of antiseptic surgery to eliminate infection. French epidemiologist Paul-Louis Simond proved that plague was carried by fleas on the back of rats,Edward Marriott (1966) in \\"Plague. A Story of Science, Rivalry and the Scourge That Won't Go Away\\" and Cuban scientist Carlos J. Finlay and U.S. Americans Walter Reed and James Carroll demonstrated that mosquitoes carry the virus responsible for yellow fever.Ronn F.

Brazilian scientist Carlos Chagas identified a tropical disease and its vector.Pineo, \\"Public Health\\", p. 481. With onset of the epidemiological transition and as the prevalence of infectious diseases decreased through the 20th century, public health began to put more focus on chronic diseases such as cancer and heart disease. Previous efforts in many developed countries had already led to dramatic reductions in the infant mortality rate using preventive methods. In Britain, the infant mortality rate fell from over 15% in 1870 to 7% by 1930.  Country examples France= France 1871‚Äì1914 followed well behind Bismarckian Germany, as well as Great Britain, in developing the welfare state including public health. Tuberculosis was the most dreaded disease of the day, especially striking young people in their 20s. Germany set up vigorous measures of public hygiene and public sanatoria, but France let private physicians handle the problem, which left it with a much higher death rate.Allan Mitchell, The Divided Path: The German Influence on Social Reform in France After 1870 (1991) pp 252‚Äì75 excerpt The French medical profession jealously guarded its prerogatives, and public health activists were not as well organized or as influential as in Germany, Britain or the United States.Martha L. Hildreth, Doctors, Bureaucrats & Public Health in France, 1888‚Äì1902 (1987)Alisa Klaus, Every Child a Lion: The Origins of Maternal & Infant Health Policy in the United States & France, 1890‚Äì1920 (1993). For example, there was a long battle over a public health law which began in the 1880s as a campaign to reorganize the nation's health services, to require the registration of infectious diseases, to mandate quarantines, and to improve the deficient health and housing legislation of 1850. However the reformers met opposition from bureaucrats, politicians, and physicians. Because it was so threatening to so many interests, the proposal was debated and postponed for 20 years before becoming law in 1902. Success finally came when the government realized that contagious diseases had a national security impact in weakening military recruits, and keeping the population growth rate well below Germany's.Ann- Louise Shapiro, \\"Private Rights, Public Interest, and Professional Jurisdiction: The French Public Health Law of 1902.\\" Bulletin of the History of Medicine 54.1 (1980): 4+ =United States= The seal of the United States Public Health Service Modern public health began developing in the 19th century, as a response to advances in science that led to the understanding of, the source and spread of disease. As the knowledge of contagious diseases increased, means to control them and prevent infection were soon developed. Once it became understood that these strategies would require community-wide participation, disease control began being viewed as a public responsibility. Various organizations and agencies were then created to implement these disease preventing strategies. Most of the Public health activity in the United States took place at the municipal level before the mid-20th century. There was some activity at the national and state level as well.John Duffy, The sanitarians: a history of American public health (1992). In the administration of the second president of the United States John Adams, the Congress authorized the creation of hospitals for mariners. As the U.S. expanded, the scope of the governmental health agency expanded. In the United States, public health worker Sara Josephine Baker, M.D. established many programs to help the poor in New York City keep their infants healthy, leading teams of nurses into the crowded neighborhoods of Hell's Kitchen and teaching mothers how to dress, feed, and bathe their babies. Another key pioneer of public health in the U.S. was Lillian Wald, who founded the Henry Street Settlement house in New York. The Visiting Nurse Service of New York was a significant organization for bringing health care to the urban poor. Dramatic increases in average life span in the late 19th century and 20th century, is widely credited to public health achievements, such as vaccination programs and control of many infectious diseases including polio, diphtheria, yellow fever and smallpox; effective health and safety policies such as road traffic safety and occupational safety; improved family planning; tobacco control measures; and programs designed to decrease non-communicable diseases by acting on known risk factors such as a person's background, lifestyle and environment. Another major public health improvement was the decline in the \\"urban penalty\\" brought about by improvements in sanitation. These improvements included chlorination of drinking water, filtration and sewage treatment which led to the decline in deaths caused by infectious waterborne diseases such as cholera and intestinal diseases. The federal Office of Indian Affairs (OIA) operated a large-scale field nursing program. Field nurses targeted native women for health education, emphasizing personal hygiene and infant care and nutrition. =Mexico= Logo for the Mexican Social Security Institute, a governmental agency dealing with public health Public health issues were important for the Spanish Empire during the colonial era. Epidemic disease was the main factor in the decline of indigenous populations in the era immediately following the sixteenth-century conquest era and was a problem during the colonial era. The Spanish crown took steps in eighteenth-century Mexico to bring in regulations to make populations healthier.Donald Cooper, Epidemic Disease in Mexico City, 1761‚Äì1813: An Administrative, Social, and Medical History. Austin: University of Texas Press 1965.

Even during the Mexican Revolution (1910‚Äì20), public health was an important concern, with a text on hygiene published in 1916. During the Mexican Revolution, feminist and trained nurse Elena Arizmendi Mejia founded the Neutral White Cross, treating wounded soldiers no matter for what faction they fought. In the post-revolutionary period after 1920, improved public health was a revolutionary goal of the Mexican government.Katherine Elaine Bliss, \\"The Science of Redemption: Syphilis, Sexual Promiscuity, and Reformism in Revolutionary Mexico City\\" Hispanic American Historical Review 79:1 1999, pp. 1‚Äì40.Ernesto Ar√©chiga C√≥rdoba, \\"Educaci√≥n, propaganda o 'Dictadura sanitaria'.

Lanham: Lexington Books 2015. Concern about disease conditions and social impediments to the improvement of Mexicans' health were important in the formation of the Mexican Society for Eugenics. The movement flourished from the 1920s to the 1940s.Alexandra Minna Stern, \\"Responsible Mother and Normal Children: Eugenics, Nationalism, and Welfare in Post-revolutionary Mexico, 1920‚Äì1940.\\" Journal of Historical Sociology vol. 12, no. 4, December 1999, pp. 369‚Äì397. Mexico was not alone in Latin America or the world in promoting eugenics.Nancy Leys Stepan, The Hour of Eugenics: Race, Gender, and Nation in Latin America. Ithaca: Cornell University Press 1991.

The Mexican Social Security Institute was established in 1943, during the administration of President Manuel Avila Camacho to deal with public health, pensions, and social security. =Cuba= Since the 1959 Cuban Revolution the Cuban government has devoted extensive resources to the improvement of health conditions for its entire population via universal access to health care. Infant mortality has plummeted.Pineo, \\"Public Health\\", p. 483. Cuban medical internationalism as a policy has seen the Cuban government sent doctors as a form of aid and export to countries in need in Latin America, especially Venezuela, as well as Oceania and Africa countries. =Colombia and Bolivia= Public health was important elsewhere in Latin America in consolidating state power and integrating marginalized populations into the nation-state. In Colombia, public health was a means for creating and implementing ideas of citizenship.Hanni Jalil, \\"Curing a Sick Nation: Public Health and Citizenship in Colombia, 1930‚Äì1940.\\" PhD dissertation, University of California, Santa Barbara 2015. In Bolivia, a similar push came after their 1952 revolution.Nicole Pacino, \\"Prescription for a Nation: Public Health in Post-Revolutionary Bolivia, 1952‚Äì1964.\\" PhD dissertation, University of California, Santa Barbara 2013. = Ghana = Though curable and preventive, malaria remains a huge public health problem and is the third leading cause of death in Ghana. In the absence of a vaccine, mosquito control, or access to anti-malaria medication, public health methods become the main strategy for reducing the prevalence and severity of malaria. These methods include reducing breeding sites, screening doors and windows, insecticide sprays, prompt treatment following infection, and usage of insecticide treated mosquito nets. Distribution and sale of insecticide-treated mosquito nets is a common, cost-effective anti-malaria public health intervention; however, barriers to use exist including cost, household and family organization, access to resources, and social and behavioral determinants which have not only been shown to affect malaria prevalence rates but also mosquito net use.

In cricket, an over consists of six consecutive legal deliveries bowled from one end of a cricket pitch to the player batting at the other end, almost always by a single bowler. A maiden over is an over in which no runs are scored that count against the bowler (so leg byes and byes may be scored as they are not counted against the bowler). A wicket maiden is a maiden over in which a wicket is also taken. Similarly, double and triple wicket maidens are when two and three wickets are taken in a maiden over. After six deliveries the umpire calls 'over'; the fielding team switches ends, and a different bowler is selected to bowl from the opposite end. The captain of the fielding team decides which bowler will bowl any given over, and no bowler may bowl two overs in succession. Overview Although this has not always been so, with overs of four and eight balls used in the past, currently an over must consist of six legal deliveries. If the bowler bowls a wide or a no-ball, that illegal delivery is not counted towards the six-ball tally, and another delivery will need to be bowled in its place. In the event that a bowler is injured, or is sent out of the attack by the umpire (for disciplinary reasons, such as bowling beamers), during the middle of an over, a teammate completes any remaining deliveries with adding six runs to the opposite team. Because a bowler may not bowl consecutive overs, the general tactic is for the captain to appoint two bowlers to alternate overs from opposite ends. When one bowler tires or becomes ineffective, the captain will replace that bowler with another. The period of time during which a bowler bowls every alternate over is known as a spell. In limited overs cricket matches, bowlers are generally restricted in the total number of overs they may bowl in a match. The general rule is that no bowler can bowl more than 20% of the total overs per innings; thus, in a 50-over match each bowler can bowl a maximum of 10 overs. In Test and first-class cricket, there is no limit to the number of overs in a team's innings, nor is there any limit to how many may be bowled by a single bowler. In these matches, there is a requirement to bowl a minimum of 90 overs in a day's play, to ensure a good spectacle, and to prevent the fielding team from wasting time for tactical reasons. Number of overs in each format of cricket There is only one innings per team in these formats: *One Day International: 50 overs per innings *T20 cricket: 20 overs per innings *T10 cricket: 10 overs per innings Tactical considerations=Tactical considerations in bowling overs The over is a fundamental consideration in the tactical planning of the fielding side. Since a single bowler has only six legal balls to bowl before they must hand the ball to another bowler, the bowler typically plans to use those six balls to set up a pattern of play designed to get a batting player out. For example, they may bowl the first few balls with the same line, length, or spin. The bowler intends to tempt the batting player into scoring runs by providing balls that are relatively easy to hit. If the batting player takes the bait, the bowler can then follow up with a variation designed to hit the wicket, or a ball that is intended to induce a mistake from a batting player who is still in aggressive run-scoring mode, which will result in the batting player being caught out. Cricket imposes penalties if a team bowls its overs at a very slow over rate, such as fines, loss of competition points, and match bans. If a team is proceeding slowly, some captains will choose to use slow/spin bowlers. Such bowlers have a shorter run up so they complete their overs more quickly. Often this means choosing an inferior strategy by employing a less skilful bowler to avoid penalties that are perceived to be greater, such as being banned or losing points. Bowling a maiden over in ODI and T20 forms of cricket is quite rare and difficult, as the batting players seek to maximise their scoring opportunities. Tactical considerations in batting If the two batting players are not similar, tactical considerations may affect their play. If one batting player is stronger than the other, they may attempt to engineer their scoring so that the stronger batting player faces the bowling more often. This is known as farming the strike. It may take the form of the stronger batting player trying to score an even number of runs on early balls in the over and an odd number on the last ball; the weaker batting player will attempt the reverse, and the bowler will try to disrupt this pattern. If one batting player is right-handed and the other left-handed, they may try to score odd numbers of runs to disrupt the bowling pattern and tire the fielders by making them reposition themselves frequently. Historical number of balls per over in Test cricket Since 1979/80, all Test cricket has been played with six balls per over. However, overs in Test cricket originally had four balls per over, and there have been varying numbers of balls per over around the world up to 1979/80, generally the same as the number of balls per over in force in other first-class cricket in that country.Cricket: A History of its Growth and Development throughout the World. Rowland Bowen. Eyre & Spottiswoode (1970). v. Index entry \\"Overs\\", p409 Prior to the Laws of Cricket (1980 Code), law 17.1 (Number of balls [in the over]) did not explicitly specify the number of balls to be bowled in an over, but merely stated that the number of balls should be agreed by the two captains prior to the toss. In practice, the number of balls was usually stipulated in the playing regulations governing the match being played. Although six was the usual number of balls, it was not always the case. From the 1980 code onwards, law 17.1 was amended to read, \\"The ball shall be bowled from each end alternately in overs of 6 balls\\".

Corporate strategy During its production run, the Essex was considered a small car and was affordably priced. The Essex is generally credited with starting a trend away from open touring cars design toward enclosed passenger compartments. The Originally, the Essex was to be a product of the \\"Essex Motor Company,\\" which was a wholly-owned entity of Hudson. Essex enjoyed immediate popularity following its 1919 introduction. Essex Motors went so far as to lease the Studebaker auto factory in Detroit for the production of the car. More than 1.13 million Essex automobiles were sold by the time the Essex name was retired in 1932 and replaced by the Terraplane. That year the Essex Motor Company was dissolved and the cars officially became a product of Hudson. Essex cars Essex cars were designed to be moderately priced cars which would be affordable to the average family. Proving durable, their capabilities were checked upon and confirmed by AAA and the United States Post Office. In 1919, an Essex completed a 50-hour, endurance test in Cincinnati, Ohio, at an average speed of . The early Essex cars also captured many hill climb records. In a special Essex race car, Glen Shultz won the 1923 Pikes Peak Hill Climb. It had a wheelbase. Initially, Essex marketed a line of touring cars (open four-door cars with canvas tops), which was the most popular body style of cars in production at the time. While Essex added an enclosed sedan in 1920, it was the introduction of the 1922 closed coach, priced at $1,495 (US$ in dollars ), $300 above that of the touring car. By 1925, the coach was priced below the touring car. While Henry Ford is credited with inventing the affordable car, it was Essex that made the enclosed car affordable. In 1928, the big news was the use of four-wheel mechanical brakes. Essex boasted \\"piano hinge doors\\" which were exceptionally strong. An advertisement shows a man fully supported by an open door to demonstrate the strength of the hinge. 1926 Specs * Wheelbase = * Length = * Turning Radius = * Road Clearance = * Brakes = drums By 1929, the Essex was third in U.S. sales, behind Ford and Chevrolet. Essex sales remained strong into 1931 before sales began to trend downward. For 1932 a redesigned Essex debuted and was named the Essex-Terraplane, a play on the word aeroplane. For 1934 the Essex name was dropped and the car was marketed as the Terraplane.

It is also called Rocky Mountain white pine. A limber pine in Eagle Cap Wilderness, Oregon has been documented as over 2000 years old, and another one was confirmed at 1140 years old. Another candidate for the oldest limber pine was identified in 2006 near the Alta Ski Area in Utah; called \\"Twister\\", the tree was confirmed to be at least 1700 years old and thought to be even older.  Distribution  The largest part of the limber pine's range is in the Rocky Mountains, from southwest Alberta and southeastern British Columbia south through Colorado and New Mexico into the northern states of Mexico. It is also found through the Great Basin states of Nevada and Utah, in the eastern Sierra Nevada and White Mountains of Northern California, and in the San Bernardino and San Gabriel Mountains of the Transverse Ranges in Southern California. Continuing south the species is found in the San Jacinto Mountains, Santa Rosa Mountains, and Hot Springs Mountain of the Peninsular Ranges. There are small disjunct populations in eastern Washington and Oregon, in western North Dakota and Nebraska, and in the Black Hills of South Dakota. It is found at a wide range of altitudes depending on the latitude, from . In the northern half of its range, it grows in the montane zone near the lower tree line; in the middle of its range between the 45th and 40th parallels, it grows on windswept sites in the montane and subalpine zones; and in the southern part of its range, it grows mainly at high elevations in the subalpine zone near the upper tree line.  Description  Its pliant branches gives it the common name \\"limber\\" and specific epithet flexilis. Its long needles are a dark, blueish green, its bark is heavily creased and dark grey. Its pale wood is lightweight and soft. Pinus flexilis is typically a high-elevation pine, often marking the tree line either on its own, or with whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis), either of the bristlecone pines, or lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta). In favourable conditions, it makes a tree to , rarely tall. However, on exposed treeline sites, mature trees are much smaller, reaching heights of only . In steeply- sloping, rocky, and windswept terrain in the Rocky Mountains of southern Alberta, limber pine is even more stunted, occurring in old stands where mature trees are consistently less than in height. One of the world's oldest living Limber Pine trees grows on the banks of the upper North Saskatchewan River at Whirlpool Point in Alberta. Recent measurements give a maximum girth of 185\\". In 1986 a core sample 10 cm was retrieved by two researchers who counted 400 rings. Extrapolating his data gives an age close to 3000 years.  Ecology  Limber pine cone from San Jacinto Mountains, Peninsular Ranges Pinus flexilis is an important source of food for several species, including red squirrels and Clark's nutcrackers. American black bears may raid squirrel caches for limber pine nuts. Squirrels, Northern flickers, and mountain bluebirds often nest in the trees. There is some evidence that P. flexilis has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria that inhabit the needles.  Related species  Pinus flexilis is a member of the white pine group, Pinus subgenus Strobus, and like all members of that group, the leaves ('needles') are in fascicles (bundles) of five, with a deciduous sheath. This distinguishes it from the lodgepole pine, with two needles per fascicle, and the bristlecone pines, which share five needles per fascicle but have a semi- persistent sheath. Male cones of a limber pine, eastern Sierra Nevada, California  Pinus albicaulis  Distinguishing limber pine from the related whitebark pine (P. albicaulis), also a white pine, is very much more difficult, and can only easily be done by the cones. In limber pine, the cones are long where the species overlap, green when immature, and open to release the seeds; the scales are not fragile. In whitebark pine, the cones are long, dark purple when immature, and do not open on drying, but are fragile and are pulled apart by birds (see below) to release the seeds. A useful clue is that whitebark pines almost never have intact old cones lying under them, whereas limber pines usually do.  Pinus monticola  In the absence of cones, limber pine can also be hard to tell from Western white pine (P. monticola) where they occur together in the northern Rockies and the Sierra Nevada east slope. The most useful clue here is that limber pine needles are entire (smooth when rubbed gently in both directions), whereas Western white pine needles are finely serrated (feeling rough when rubbed gently from tip to base). Limber pine needles are also usually shorter, long, while western white pine needles are , though the ranges overlap.  Diseases  Limber pine is susceptible to white pine blister rust, caused by Cronartium ribicola, a fungus that was introduced accidentally from Europe. Limber pine mortality is high in many areas throughout its range, except Arizona, where it has not yet been found. However, there is little hope of controlling the blister rust in existing trees. Research is under way, locating and breeding from the occasional naturally resistant limber pines, and by studying the resistance mechanisms of the European and Asian white pines (e.g. Swiss pine, Macedonian pine), which are strongly resistant to the disease.  Cultivation  The popular cultivar P. flexilis 'Vanderwolf's Pyramid' is widely available as an ornamental tree for gardens. 'Vanderwolf's Pyramid' derives from P. reflexa, though it is usually listed in nursery catalogs under P. flexilis. The Southwestern white pine is popular as a windbreak tree or an ornamental tree due to its drought tolerance. It is also grown as a Christmas tree, liked for the soft needles but with stiffer branches than an Eastern white pine. Uses The large seeds are edible, and consumed by birds and mammals, especially squirrels.

Isshin-Ry≈´ karate is largely a synthesis of Shorin-ry≈´ karate, Goj≈´-ry≈´ karate, and kobud≈ç. The name means, literally, \\"one heart method\\" (as in \\"wholehearted\\" or \\"complete\\"). In 1989 there were 336 branches of Isshin-ry≈´ throughout the world (as recorded by the IWKA), most of which were concentrated in the United States.  Kata  The system is summarized in its kata, and the specific techniques used to punch (vertical fist) and kick (snapping kicks) presented as upper and lower 'charts', most of which are thrown from natural stances and body posture. In many of the various forms of the system, sixteen kata (eight empty-hand, three bo, two sai, a bo-bo kumite kata, a bo-sai kumite kata and one tuifa kata) are agreed upon as composing Isshin-ryu. These kata include original developments of the Master, and inherited kata from the parent styles.  Empty-Hand Kata  Seisan = Tatsuo Shimabuku learned Seisan from his primary instructor, Chotoku Kyan. Previous to Kyan's instruction, the Seisan form was a staple of local traditions. This kata is sometimes the first introduced to students after the First and Second Charts of basics have been learned. This is in contrast to other Shorin systems where this kata is learned after other fundamental kata. The Goj≈´-ry≈´ curriculum includes a related version of Seisan, but Isshin-ry≈´ Seisan was learned from Kyan, not Miyagi. = Seiunchin (Âà∂ÂºïÊà¶) = The Seiunchin kata was brought into Isshin-ry≈´ from Shimabuku's studies with the Goj≈´-ry≈´ founder, Chojun Miyagi. It is theorized by some Isshin-ryu researchers that this kata is an original composed by Miyagi, based on his experiences in Fuzhou, China. However, since this kata was also taught by Miyagi's teacher, Kanryo Higaonna (1853-1915), and is included in other naha- te descended styles such as Shito-ryu, it is more likely that it was Higaonna who brought the kata back to Okinawa after his earlier studies in Fuzhou. The kata focuses on the stance \\"shiko-dachi\\" (sometimes referred to as \\"seiunchin- dachi\\"), a low horse stance at which the knees are bent at obtuse angles and the feet are angled away from the direction the body is facing at forty-five degree angles. The kata is broken into segments, each utilizing a specific breathing and muscle-tensing method. The kata has no obvious kicks, but one section contains hints of a rising knee strike. = Naihanchi („Éä„Ç§„Éè„É≥„ÉÅ) = Naihanchi [Shodan] comes to Isshin Ryu from studies with both Chotoku Kyan and Choki Motobu (a cousin of Kyan). It is also considered one of the staples of Ryukyu Ti, and is prevalent in most forms of Karate. The Isshin Ryu version is influenced heavily by the kumite of Motobu, with the exception of the turned- in toes (Motobu preferred the horse-riding stance with the toes in a neutral position). The kata is also noted for its use of the \\"Nami Gaeshi\\", the returning wave kick. The kick has many different potentials for application, including the sweeping or redirecting of a low kick, a kick or knee to the inside of an opponent's thigh, knee, tibia, and ankle. It also has the movement training potential for the basics of the sequential summation of movement. Some interpret the move as a low \\"yoko-geri\\" (side kick) from naihanchi-dachi to the opponent's farthest ankle, inside-calf, or knee, and returning the kick to the body around the opponent's nearest leg across one's body to the hip and back down to naihanchi-stance. A popular interpretation of the kata concerns its position: the entire sequence of moves in the kata is to be executed as if one is standing up against a wall and one's opponents are to his left, right, and straight ahead. It is because of this that the kata is usually taught with the back straight and the heels and back placed firmly either on a straight edge such as a board or a wall, or on top of a long piece of tape. The main stance of naihanchi is a slight variant from the Isshin Ryu stance \\"kiba-dachi\\", in which both feet are shoulder-width apart facing forward. \\"Naihanchi-dachi,\\" as it's called, takes kiba-dachi and turns the balls of the feet (area of foot just behind the toes) and turns them inward and accentuates the continuous bend at the knees Isshin Ryu Karateka are taught from initiation. =Wans≈´ („ÉØ„É≥„Ç∑„É•„Éº)= Also coming from Kyan, Wansh≈´ (also known as Wansu) has several iterations on the island of Ryukyu. Popular history has the kata coming from a Chinese political visitor who, during his duties, taught his fighting method in the open. Isshin Ryu's version of this form is unique for its inclusion of two side kicks - techniques seen in the system previously only in the Chart Two exercises. Current research hints at this change being made by Shimabuku Tatsuo himself. For technical content, the form tends to focus on the slipping and in-close evasion and redirection of attack. It also contains a unique movement often described as a fireman's carry throw, or dump. Because of this, many schools nickname this kata \\"the dumping form\\". Also, depending on the lineage, Wansu is one of two kata in Isshin Ryu which use the \\"zenkutsu dachi\\", the longer front stance seen in other forms of karate. = Chinto = As with most of the kata in Isshin Ryu, Chinto comes from the teaching of Kyan. The kata differs from others in that its embusen is a line placed on a 30 degree angle. The footwork is indicative of a slipping, deflecting, and a whipping, relaxed body motion. Some karate instructors consider the previously learned forms of the system, Naihanchi and Wansu, to be preparatory and basic training forms, culminating in the kata Chinto. =Kusanku („ÇØ„Éº„Ç∑„É£„É≥„ÇØ)= Of the eight weaponless kata in Isshin-Ryu, five come from the teaching of Chotoku Kyan. Kusanku is one of these. Kusanku is often referred to as a \\"night-fighting\\" kata, or a form which teaches fighting at night. In reality, the kata is set up in such a manner as to allow continual study of application potential from basic standing grappling and close striking in the beginning, to more aggressive and proactive techniques near the end. Its techniques may be utilized in places with low levels of light but is not exclusively a night fighting form. Depending on the lineage, Kusanku is the second of two kata which contain the zenkutsu-dachi in Isshin-Ryu. = Sunsu = This kata was designed by the founder of Isshin-Ryu, Shimabuku Tatsuo, in approximately 1947. It incorporates several movements from other kata in the Isshin-Ryu syllabus, as well as from kata from other instructors, in addition to techniques and concepts Shimabuku favored. It was used as a dojo kata and as a personal project of the founder, prior to the founding of Isshin Ryu in 1956. Sunsu is the only kata that is only in Isshin Ryu. It takes sequences from the other katas in Isshin Ryu. The Okinawa Prefecture Karate Kobudo Rengokai has recognized Sunsu as a kata of Okinawa. This represents an acceptance of Isshin-Ryu as a traditional Ryukyu martial art. =Sanchin (‰∏âÊà¶)= Coming from Miyagi Chojun, Sanchin has its origins in the Goj≈´-ry≈´ system. Along with Seiunchin, this is one of two Goj≈´-ry≈´ katas in Isshin-ry≈´. Previous to the instruction of Miyagi, the kata was practiced with open hands, turns, and natural breathing methods. With the founding of Goj≈´-ry≈´, this form was practiced with closed fists (a more traditional method on Okinawa), no turns, and a controlled, almost hard inhalation and exhalation. Touted primarily for its physical training aspects, Sanchin also contains many applicable martial techniques. Shimabuku also thought very highly of the form, saying once, \\"Sanchin is for health. Without health, how can one have karate?\\"  B≈ç Kata  Tokumine no Kun (sometimes referred to as Tokumeni no Kun)= This b≈ç form comes to the Isshin Ryu system from Shimabuku's time with Ch≈çtoku Kyan. Kyan is to have learned the form either from Tokumine himself, or from Tokumine's landlord after the aforementioned had passed on. Shimabuku Tatsuo also commented that this was his favorite kata. Different isshin -ryu schools spell the name differently by changing the \\"e\\" and the \\"i\\". Research thus far has shown that the kata was named after someone (Shitsunen Tokumine). However, at this time, no genealogical findings have been found for the spelling \\"Tokumine\\" while several are noted for \\"Tokumeni\\". (Incorrect. The kanji and the katakana on the 1966 film of Tatsuo Shimabuku clearing shows it is TOKU MINE (pronounced Toe-koo-mee-nei)). The spelling changes, and pronunciation conflicts, may have indeed come from the 1966 film of Tatsuo Shimabuku and which is readily viewable on YouTube at the time of this update. At timeline 12:38 there is a sign indicating the name of this staff kata. It is not written in kanji (the preferred method when writing a native Japanese name). It is written in both Romaji (romanized spelling for Japanese writing) and in Katakana (a simplified form of Kanji also used for foreign words and non- Japanese names). The Romaji is shown as \\"TOKOMENI\\" (noting the \\"KO\\" on the sign and the common replacement as \\"KU\\" throughout most Isshin-Ryu schools). Yet the Katakana below it was not consistent with how the romanized spelling should have been done. It should have been written in Romaji as \\"TOKUMINE\\". The first katakana is definitely \\"TO\\", the second \\"KU\\", the third \\"MI\\", the fourth is not clear but reasonably \\"NE\\" and together \\"TOKUMINE\\". = Urashi no Kun (sometimes referred to as Urasoe no Kun) = The form Urashi no Kun was taught to Shimabuku by his kobud≈ç instructor, Shinken Taira. Taira is the founder of the Ry≈´ky≈´ Kobud≈ç Hozon Shinkokai, whose goal is the preservation of Okinawa's weapons forms. = Shishi no Kun (sometimes referred to as Sueyoshi no Kun) = Shimabuku learned this form from Shinken Taira who learned it from Kenwa Mabuni. The kata itself uses the bo in a horizontal manner, different from other cudgel traditions.  Sai Kata  Kusanku Sai = This form is a product of Shimabuku's own research into the art of kobud≈ç, the coverall for Okinawa's weapons studies. The kata was built as an introduction to Sai practice, with the weapon movements replacing the empty- hand applications. The form is taught one of two ways: with or without kicks. Initially, the kata was taught with kicks as it is a karate-based kata. Later, after 1960, the kicks were removed because Shimabuku wished to emphasize the weapon more so. = Chatan Yara no Sai\\\\ Sai kata in the Isshin Ryu system, coming from Shimabuku's instruction with Shinken Taira. = Chatan Yara is taught as the second Sai kata in the Isshin Ryu system, coming from Shimabuku's instruction with Shinken Taira. The form focuses on the development of the \\"sequential summation of movement\\", which is the scientific term for full-body whipping motion. This is exemplified by the emphasis on whipping strikes, which make up a vast majority of the offensive movements in the form. = Kyan no Sai = This form comes either from Shimabuku's studies of Sai methodology with Kyan, his primary karate instructor, or was possibly a form taught in its entirety. Shimabuku was teaching this kata in 1951 but by 1959 he had dropped in favor of Kusanku.  Tonfa Kata  Hama Higa no Tuifa = This form is from Shimabuku's studies with Shinken Taira. It is the only Tonfa kata in the Isshinryu system. Shimabuku always referred to the weapon, and thus the kata also, as tuifa. The kata bears many similarities to the Uechi Ry≈´ empty-hand form \\"Seisan\\", and actually contains an entire section from the form, albeit performed with weapons in-hand. It also has several postures seen in other kobud≈ç kata, the most notable posture being \\"Crane on a Rock\\". Whether this is from the encyclopedic kobud≈ç of Taira, or was a part of Hama Higa to begin with is not historically verifiable. Some Isshin-Ryu schools teach the kata in a different order. However, Shimabuku Tatsuo taught the kata in the above order.  Other curriculum = Upper body basics  Developed by Tatsuo Shimabuku and one of his Okinawan students Eiko Kaneshi, the first chart (though some first- generation students learned this chart after the lower-body chart) of basic techniques is unique to the Isshin Ryu system. Though the technical content and number of techniques varies by lineage, the first Chart One was simply a collection of 15 upper-body dominant techniques Shimabuku felt were necessary for proper development.  Lower Body Basics  Developed at the same time as the first chart, the second set of techniques are, largely, the basic kicking techniques of the Isshin Ryu system. As with the first chart, the number of techniques, as well as actual technical content, vary by lineage. The initial chart contained eight kicking techniques and six stretching and calisthenic exercises. A ninth kick was added to the chart in the late 1960s.  Kote-kitai  Kote-kitai is the Okinawan term for arm conditioning. Karada-kitai is the term for body conditioning with ashi-kitai for the feet, fukubu-kitai for the stomach, etc. It is not unique to Isshin Ryu, and is also used by other Okinawan styles such as Uechi-ryu. Makiwara (Â∑ªËóÅ) As with the Kotekitai, the makiwara is a rather universal tool in Okinawan martial arts. It is made from an immovable punching post constructed of wood or some firm material, wrapped in straw or other soft padding. The Makiwara is used primarily in the development of the striking surfaces utilized in karate. Unlike a hanging bag, timing, cadence, and footwork are rarely utilized with this implement, instead using it almost solely as a resistance training aide. Striking of the makiwara tends to develop the muscles around the joints, strengthening them for the sometimes awkward or unorthodox strikes found in the various types of Ryukyu martial arts. The most common strikes used are straight punches using various hand formations and single, two, and three finger strikes. Kumite (ÁµÑÊâã) Kumite is the practice of free-sparring, that is, sparring in a non-set pattern. Shimabuku was one of the first, if not the first, Okinawan instructors to institute free-sparring using full Kendo armor to allow for full-contact training while minimizing the risk of injury. Current equipment makes free-sparring much easier and safer, allow for a more involved and effective karate training method. Shimabuku also taught a series of 45 self-defense techniques, some devised from movements from the Isshin-ryu kata, some derived from kata that he did not include in the Isshin-ryu curriculum (presumbably Gojushiho, Passai, and Ananku), and some derived from techniques that Shimabuku favored. Collectively, these techniques were listed in the dojo simply as Kumite, but some Isshin-ryu groups call them Shimabuku Tatsuo no Kumite (Â≥∂Ë¢ãÈæçÂ§´„ÅÆÁµÑÊâã).  History = Tatsuo Shimabuku  (1908‚Äì1975) was born Shinkichi Shimabuku on September 19, 1908 in Gushikawa village, Okinawa.Clarke, Christopher M. Okinawan Karate: A History of Styles and Masters, Volume 2: Fujian Antecedents, Naha-te, Goju-ryu, and Other Styles. Huntingtown, MD: Clarke's Canyon Press, 2012. p. 251 While \\"The four most widely recognized of Tatsuo Shimabuku's instructors are Chotoku Kyan, Choki Motobu, Chojun Miyagi, and Taira Shinken,\\"Rosenbaum, Michael. Okinawa's Complete Karate System: Isshin-ryu. Boston: YMAA Publication Center, 2001. p. 54 his training history remains controversial, with one review finding his karate career \\"riddled with historical inaccuracies, flaws, and unlikely scenarios.\\" This review itself has been challenged by Andy Sloane, who claims to be a primary source for the article. Shimabuku began training under Shinko Ganeko (Okinawan: Ganiku), his maternal uncle. Ganeko later sent Shimabuku to study karate from Chotoku Kyan.Bishop, Mark. Okinawan Karate: Teachers, Styles, and Secret Techniques. Second edition. Tokyo: Tuttle Publishing, 1999. p. 84 Kyan served as Shimabuku's principal instructor and seems to have been the most influential of Shimabuku's teachers in shaping the Isshin-ryu style.Okinawan Karate Kobudo Graph. \\"Shuri-Style Lineage Chart.\\" Naha, Okinawa: Okinawa Prefecture Board of Education, 1995. The Classical Fighting Arts article questions this, noting that Eizo Shimabuku claimed that he and his brother Tatsuo were his students when they were young, then rhetorically asks why Eizo subsequently sent a senior student from their Isshin ryu dojo to learn Kyan's distinctive forms. Nevertheless, the Shuri-Style Lineage Chart of the Okinawa Prefecture Board of Education lists Kyan as Shimabuku's teacher. As Donnelly, author of several books on Isshin-ryu karate, suggests in reference to this chart, \\"This is an indication that the Okinawan Kobudo Association only recognizes his [Shimabuku's] Shorin-Ryu lineage and doesn't feel that his time in Goju-Ryu is adequate to maintain that lineage. ... This is not to suggest that Master Shimabuku didn't study Goju-Ryu, but that his study was not of a significant amount of time to be listed under that system.\\"Donnelly, Norbert. The Isshinryu System, first edition. Waterford, MI: Norbert Donnelly, 1999. pp. 8-9 Chotoku Kyan would be his most influential instructor (and after whom he initially named his style Chan Mi Te, with Migwa being a reference to Chotoku Kyan's nickname stemming from his wearing of glasses and his small eyes). Bishop claimed he studied under Choki Motobu during the early 1940s in Naha; however, since Shimabuku was only present in Okinawa between 1941‚Äì42 and Motubu died in 1944, the \\"Classical Fighting Arts\\" article deems it \\"difficult to understand\\" how he could have trained with Motobu \\"in any meaningful way.\\" Bishop further cites Shimabuku having studied for various lengths of time with Chojun Miyagi, Choki Motobu, and Taira Shinken. The \\"Classical Fighting Arts\\" article claims that local sources list Shimabuku training for two months with Chojun Miyagi. Shimabuku opened his first dojo in Konbu village and began teaching in late 1947 after being repatriated from Kyushu. Around this time, he adopted the name Tatsuo, or Dragon Man. He taught in Tairagawa village and also in Koza City before deciding to teach in his house in about 1948. On January 15, 1956, he held a meeting and announced that he was naming his new style of karate Isshin-ryu. Shimabuku's number one student, Eiko Kaneshi, was at the meeting and asked Shimabuku, \\"Why such a funny name?\\" Tatsuo replied, \\"Because all things begin with one.\\" At the age of 50 (c. 1959) Shimabuku began studying kobud≈ç, the art of traditional Okinawan weapons, under Shinken Taira. Kobud≈ç weapons included were the sai, bo, and tonfa. He incorporated the kobud≈ç that he had learned from Kyan and Taira into the Isshin-ryu system.  Megami  Isshinryu No Megami (\\"Goddess of Isshinryu\\"), , or for short, is the symbol of Isshin-ryu. It is represented on the Isshin-ryu crest and is often displayed on the front wall of the dojo next to a picture of Tatsuo Shimabuku. As an emblem for Isshin-ry≈´ Tatsuo Shimabuku chose a half-sea-snake half-woman deity whom he had seen in a vision. She represents the strength of the snake and the quiet character of a woman, thus expressing the essence of the style. Based on the ryuzu kannon (Chief Dragon deity of Japanese Buddhism), Originally the Isshin- ryu emblem was called Isshin-ryu No Megami, which means 'Goddess of Isshinryu.' Some American Isshin-ryu karateka also call it Mizu Gami (Ê∞¥Á•û), translating to \\"Water Goddess.\\" Eiko Kaneshi, Tatsuo's right-hand-man, who was a Shinto priest, was asked if it was Mizu Gami. He said it has nothing to do with water. Isshin-ryu no Megami, or Megami for short, is correct. This is coroborated by Marien Jumelet who asked Shinsho Shimabuku and Kensho Tokumura what was the correct name. Classical Fighting Arts contends that this misunderstanding results from \\"erroneous information that appeared in a 1969 edition of Action Karate Magazine.\\" The Isshin-ryu patch is rich with cross- linked symbolism where certain features could and do have three or more intended meanings behind them. Between factions exist variations of the patch, the portrait of the Isshin-ryu no Megami, and the symbols contained therein. The image represented at right is just one of the many versions of the Isshin- ryu no Megami. The ovular shape of the patch represents the characteristic vertical fist of Isshin-Ryu. The border of the patch is always a warm color‚Äîusually orange or yellow‚Äîand represents a ring of fire that appeared in Shimabuku's vision. The Megami is allegedly a mother protecting her child; she is gentle like a mother, but fierce and threatening towards enemies who may harm her child. In this simplified version of the Isshin-ryu no Megami, one important symbol is left out; in the traditional patch depicts the goddess with a raised right fist and a lowered open palm. Her hands represent a well- known saying among karateka: \\"fierce in battle and gentle in life.\\" The small dragon above the goddess is a sea dragon of Oriental mythology, which was born at the bottom of the sea, but transformed by ascending to the heavens. The dragon is thought to represent Master Shimabuku. The rough seas and grey background depict a terrible typhoon, which represents the uncertainty of the future, and how trouble may arise spontaneously at any time. In relation to that, her calm face indicates that one must remain level-headed and calm in the face of adversity. Finally, the three stars at the top of the patch represent the three main teachers of Shimabuku (not including his weapons teacher). Each of these core symbols are depicted in each patch, regardless of how different they may seem to the untrained eye.  Notable Karateka of Shimabuku  United States Marines of the Third Marine Division (1955-1975) = * Harold G. Long (1930-1998) became one of the most influential of Shimabuku's students, forming the International Isshin-Ryu Karate Association. He ended his career having earned the rank of Ju-Dan, and with a space in the Isshin-Ryu Hall of Fame. He is the patriarch of the Long- lineage of Isshin-Ryu. * Donald Hugh Nagle (1938-1999) and Long represented American Isshin-Ryu karate on an international stage after Shimabuku's death in 1975. He ended his career having earned the rank of Ju-Dan, and with a space in the Isshin-Ryu Hall of Fame. He is the patriarch of the Nagle-lineage * Steve Armstrong (not to be confused with Steve Armstrong) (1931-2006) also taught Isshin-Ryu to American students, but fell ill sometime after having been awarded eighth-degree black belt. He is the patriarch of the Armstrong- lineage, Robert Edwards is the current leader of the Armstrong lineage, and Deshaun D.

I. K. K. A. Isshinkan Isshin Ryu Karate Kobudo Association. Chile.  Features  Isshin-Ryu employs a vertical punch with the fingers tucked in and the thumb on top of the fist. Advantages vary with opinion, but it is usually taught that the thumb placement increases the stability of the wrist when punching, and that a vertical punch strikes with the same force at any range instead of at maximum extension as with a corkscrew style punch. Another advantage is that when punching, the thumb will not get caught on an object as opposed to having the thumb sticking up or out. In Isshin-Ryu it is believed that the vertical punch is faster than the cork- screw punch: three vertical hand punches can be generated in the time of two cork-screw punches. Isshin-Ryu arm blocks are performed today with the muscle at the intended contact point as opposed to other styles that block with the bone. By using the two bones and the muscle to form a block, less stress is created against the defender's arm, increasing the ability to absorb a strike. The original arm blocks were taught with palm up, wrist bent, to form a trapping motion as well as to block and/or strike with the radius bone. Beginners in Isshin-ryu are taught to use their forearms to block in order to strengthen their forearms while working toward becoming a black belt. When one attains a black belt in Isshin-ryu they understand the purpose for the block is to use the knuckles on the inside of an attacker's arm where are the soft tissue is emphasizing a hard strike to soft tissue. Therefore, there really are no blocks in Isshin-ryu. Isshin-Ryu kicks are primarily a \\"snapping\\" motion, as opposed to placing primary emphasis on thrusting and follow- through. Furthermore, traditional Isshin-Ryu kicks are aimed almost entirely to the legs or groin‚Äînothing above the belt. Competition kicks are aimed above the belt; however, these are largely meant to show one‚Äôs flexibility and balance and not intended for practical use.

It is the capital of Lidzbark County. Lidzbark Warmi≈Ñski was once the capital of Warmia and formerly its largest town. Lidzbark itself was a religious and cultural center, for which it was known as the Pearl of Warmia. For a long period of time it was under the control of the Warmian Bishops and it was also a major economic center, only resigning its importance to the nearby city of Braniewo. The Warmian Bishop's Castle is considered to be a great artistic and historical value in the world and has been recognised as a Historic Monument by the Polish government.  History  View of the Old Town on the ≈Åyna River and Collegiate Church The town was originally an settlement of Old Prussians known as Lecbarg until being conquered in 1240 by the Teutonic Knights, who named it Heilsberg. In 1306 it became the seat for the Bishopric of Warmia, and remained the Prince-Bishop's seat for 500 years. In 1309 the settlement received town privileges. In the 1350s the Castle of Warmian Bishops was built, and it was expanded in the following centuries, becoming one of the most significant and remarkable historic monuments of Warmia, which nowadays houses a museum and is listed as a Historic Monument of Poland. In 1440 the town joined the anti-Teutonic Prussian Confederation, upon the request of which in 1454 Polish King Casimir IV Jagiellon incorporated the region and town to the Kingdom of Poland.Karol G√≥rski, ZwiƒÖzek Pruski i poddanie siƒô Prus Polsce: zbi√≥r tekst√≥w ≈∫r√≥d≈Çowych, Instytut Zachodni, Pozna≈Ñ, 1949, p. XXXVII, 54 (in Polish) This caused the Polish‚ÄìTeutonic Thirteen Years' War, as a result of which in the Second Peace of Thorn (1466) the Teutonic Order ended its claim to the area and recognized it as part of Poland.G√≥rski, p. 99 It was the capital of the Prince-Bishopric of Warmia in the Polish province of Royal Prussia in the larger Greater Poland Province of the Polish Crown. Nicolaus Copernicus first visited the town at the turn of 1495 and 1496, and then lived at the castle from 1503. It is believed he wrote part of his De revolutionibus orbium coelestium there. In the winter of 1703‚Äì04 the town was the residence of King Charles XII of Sweden during the Great Northern War. In the mid-18th century a manuscript of the Gesta principum Polonorum, the oldest medieval Polish chronicle was discovered in the castle by Prince-Bishop Adam Stanis≈Çaw Grabowski, by whose decision it was then published in print for the first time. The town was annexed with the rest of the region by the Kingdom of Prussia in the First Partition of Poland in 1772. The town ceased to be the capital of the Prince-Bishopric of Warmia, which was disestablished, however it remained the seat of the last Prince-Bishop Ignacy Krasicki until 1795, and afterwards the town lost its cultural significance, which it has not regained since. In 1807 a battle took place near the town between the French under Joachim Murat and Nicolas Jean de Dieu Soult and the Russians and Prussians under Levin August, count von Bennigsen. From 1933 to 1945 it was the site of the large German government radio station Transmitter Heilsberg. The town was heavily damaged after its conquest by the Soviet Red Army during World War II in 1945. As part of territorial changes demanded by the Soviet Union at the Potsdam Conference, the town became once again part of Poland, and was gradually resettled by Poles, many of them from the parts of eastern Poland annexed by the Soviet Union.

It was a prominent corporation and industry leader using the single-letter symbol B on the New York Stock Exchange. It operated both passenger and freight services on its rail rapid transit, elevated and subway network, making it unique among the 3 companies which built and operated subway lines in New York City. It became insolvent in 1919 and was restructured and released from bankruptcy as the Brooklyn‚ÄìManhattan Transit Corporation in 1923. Consolidation The BRT was incorporated January 18, 1896, and took over the bankrupt Long Island Traction Company in early February acquiring the Brooklyn Heights Railroad and the lessee of the Brooklyn City Rail Road. It then acquired the Brooklyn, Queens County and Suburban Railroad leased on July 1, 1898. The BRT took over the property of a number of surface railroads, the earliest of which, the Brooklyn, Bath and Coney Island Railroad or West End Line, opened for passenger service on October 9, 1863 between Fifth Avenue at 36th Street at the then border of Brooklyn City and Bath Beach in the Town of Gravesend, New York. A short piece of surface route of this railroad, near Coney Island Creek, is the oldest existing piece of rapid transit right-of-way in New York City, and in the U.S., having opened on June 8, 1864. Initially the surface and elevated railroad lines ran on steam power. Between 1893 and 1900 the lines were converted to electricity operation. An exception was the service on the Brooklyn Bridge. Trains were operated by cables from 1883 to 1896, when they were converted to electric power\\"Early Rapid Transit in Brooklyn, 1818 to 1900\\", nyc subways.com Routes in 1897 By 1900, it had acquired virtually all of the rapid transit and streetcar operations in its target area: *Sea Beach Railway, acquired in November 1897 and leased to the BHRR *Sea View Railroad (Coney Island Elevated), acquired in November 1897 and leased to the BHRR *Nassau Electric Railroad (lessee of the Atlantic Avenue Railroad, Brooklyn, Bath and West End Railroad, Coney Island and Gravesend Railway, and South Brooklyn Railway), acquired in November 1898 and leased to the BHRR in April 1899 *Brooklyn Elevated Railroad, acquired in March 1899 and leased to the BHRR in April 1899 *Brooklyn and Brighton Beach Railroad (Brighton Beach Line), acquired in March 1899 *Kings County Elevated Railroad (Fulton Street Line), acquired in November 1899 and merged into the Brooklyn Union Elevated on May 24, 1900 *Prospect Park and Coney Island Railroad (Culver Line), leased to the BHRR on June 18, 1899 Only the Coney Island and Brooklyn Railroad and the short Van Brunt Street and Erie Basin Railroad remained independent; the former was acquired in 1913 or 1914.1914 Moody's Manual: Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company Expansion BRT opened its first short subway segment, consisting only of an underground terminal at the foot of the Williamsburg Bridge at Delancey and Essex Streets in Manhattan on June 16, 1908. This line was extended under Delancey Street and Centre Street to a new five-platform complex at Chambers Street beneath the Manhattan Municipal Building at the foot of the Brooklyn Bridge on August 4, 1913. In addition to BRT trains, Long Island Railroad (LIRR) commuter trains also used the new Chambers Street station from its opening until 1917. The elevated railroads were operated by a new corporation, the New York Consolidated Railroad. In 1913, the BRT, through another subsidiary, the New York Municipal Railway, signed the Dual Contracts with the government of New York City, to construct and operate new subways and other rapid transit lines to be built or improved under these contracts. Almost all subsequent BRT lines were built as part of the contracts. The BRT opened its first Brooklyn subway under Fourth Avenue on June 22, 1915, running over the Manhattan Bridge to a junction with the aforementioned Nassau Street Line at Canal Street. The BRT opened the first segment of its Manhattan main line subway, the Broadway Line, as far as 14th Street‚ÄìUnion Square on September 4, 1917. The Broadway Line was completed in 1920. The BRT's only crosstown Manhattan line, the Canarsie Line, opened in 1924. During the beginning of the BRT's existence, the LIRR was a competitor of the BRT for passengers in Brooklyn and Queens. Despite competing with nearby lines, the BRT and its predecessors also hosted LIRR passenger trains via track sharing agreements and interchanged freight with them. LIRR Passenger service to the BRT's Brooklyn Bridge terminal began after an agreement in 1895, utilizing BRT elevated lines. LIRR passenger service to downtown Manhattan via the BRT subway and Williamsburg Bridge began with the opening of the Chambers Street Station. Both LIRR and BRT motorman were represented by the same union. Today, BRT successor MTA New York City Transit still receives freight deliveries from LIRR freight successor the New York & Atlantic Railroad in Sunset Park and at Linden Yard. Demise and legacy World War I and the attendant massive inflation associated with the war put New York transit operators in a difficult position, since their contracts with the City required a five-cent fare be charged, while inflation made the real value of the fare less than three cents in constant currency value. On November 1, 1918, the Malbone Street wreck, the second worst rapid transit train wreck to occur in the United States, occurred on the BRT's Franklin Avenue/Brighton Beach line, killing at least 93 people. This further destabilized the financially struggling company, and the BRT filed bankruptcy on December 31, 1918. In 1923 the BRT was restructured and released from bankruptcy as the Brooklyn‚ÄìManhattan Transit Corporation (BMT). Some of the former elevated system of the BRT, dating to 1885, remains in use today. The largest section is the part of today's BMT Jamaica Line running above Fulton Street from the Alabama Avenue station to a small section turning north after the Crescent Street station. Most of the other surviving structures were either built new or rehabilitated between 1915 and 1922 as part of the Dual Contracts. One piece of structure ‚Äì the elevated portion of the Franklin Avenue Shuttle, built in 1896 and 1905 ‚Äì was extensively rebuilt in 1999. Several BRT-era equipment have been preserved. This includes nine BU cars and five AB Standard cars, all which were also operated by the BMT upon the company's creation in 1923.

It is now used as the official service song of the Slovenian Armed Forces. Lyrics and music It tells about a boy who goes to defend his homeland, meaning him more than his mother or sweetheart. As such, it is a patriotic recruiting poem. It was the first Slovene literature to be translated into English. The lyrics were written originally by Simon Jenko and then improved collaboratively by him and his cousin Davorin Jenko who also wrote the music. The poem was first publicly sung with great success in front of a large Slavic audience on 22 October 1860, and was first published in () on 1 December 1860. In 1863, it was renamed by Radoslav Razlag to . In 1885, it became the first poem in Slovene to have been translated into English, under the title \\"With Slava's Banner, Forward!\\" The translators were Andrej Jurtela, the first lecturer of Slavic languages at the University of Oxford, and English journalist Alfred Lloyd Hardy, who had a keen interest in music and in Slavic culture. He arranged the melody by Davorin Jenko for piano, wrote an interlinear translation and published it lithographed as an independent publication. The poem was originally titled \\"Naprej\\" (\\"Forward\\") and set to music in an inn in Vienna's Prater by Davorin Jenko, who was in anger over the German snub of the Slovene, on 16 May 1860. History=Part of the national anthem of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia After the formation of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes, the first and the last stanza of the poem were included into the Yugoslav national anthem as its third part, in a medley including the Serb ethnic anthem \\"\\" and the Croatian song \\"\\".

With the establishment of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia in 1946, the royal Yugoslav anthem was replaced by \\"Hey, Slavs\\". The first post-war constitution of the People's Republic of Slovenia and the constitution, adopted in 1963, did not specify a regional anthem. \\"Naprej, zastava slave\\" was used at official public events and on state holidays since the beginning of the 1970s. In spring 1987, it was replaced by \\"\\". Because it calls to the defence of the homeland, it was since 1992 played during ceremonial events and oathtaking ceremonies in the Slovenian Territorial Defence in line with the draft Rules on Service in the Territorial Defence, adopted on 15 April 1992.

Best known for writing solo guitar music, he also composed an opera (at the age of 19), three symphonies, guitar duos, piano music, songs, a Mass, and at least two successful ballets: Cinderella, which received over one hundred performances, and Hercule et Omphale. Partly because Sor was himself such a guitar virtuoso‚Äîcontemporaries considered him to be the best in the world‚Äîhe made a point of writing didactic music for players of that instrument of all levels. His Twelve Studies Op. 6, the Twelve Studies Op. 29, the (24) Progressive Lessons Op. 31, and the (24) Very Easy Exercises Op. 35 have been widely played for two hundred years and are regularly reprinted. On the other hand, some of Sor's music, not least his popular Introduction and Variations on Mozart's \\"Das klinget so herrlich\\" Op. 9, is fiendishly difficult. Unlike modern classical guitar players, Sor used the smaller, slimmer \\"Baroque\\" and \\"Romantic\\" guitars predating today's familiar Torres instrument. He used the ring finger of his plucking hand and eschewed the use of nails on that hand.  Variance of name  As Sor's works were published in various countries, his name was translated, leading to variances in its spelling.

Revista de arte, geograf√≠a e historia N√∫m. 9 2007 pp. 223-250 although in most of his manuscript and printed musical works he appears as Fernando Sor or Ferdinand Sor, and only in some cases does his surname appear as Sors.Biblioteca Nacional de Espa√±a, m√∫sica impresa, Sor, Fernando (1778-1839) Sor was descended from a long line of career soldiers and intended to continue that legacy, but was distracted from this when his father introduced him to Italian opera. He fell in love with music and abandoned his military ambitions. Along with opera, Sor's father also introduced him to the guitar. Musician and his Family, French oil painting (Biblioth√®que Marmottan, Boulogne-Billancourt, Paris) At a young age, Sor's parents wouldn't give his musical abilities too much special attention, for fear it would distract from his Latin studies. Therefore, the young Sor (still not 11 years old) began to write songs to words in Latin to impress his parents. He even invented his own system for notating music, as he had not yet received formal training. When he reached the age of 11 or 12, the head of the Barcelona Cathedral took notice of young Sor's talent, and he was enrolled in the school there. Not long after, his father died, leaving his mother without the funds to continue his education at the Cathedral. However, at around the same time Joseph Arredondo, the new abbot of Santa Maria de Montserrat, the famous monastery, heard of his talent, and provided funds for him to attend the choir school located at the monastery. Sor reveals in writings, mainly from the last ten years of his life, that he was greatly attached to this place, and had fond, nostalgic memories of his childhood there. But his mother began to see that Sor was becoming greatly distracted from his \\"chosen\\" path in the military or administration and, following the advice of friends, took him out of the monastery and placed him in military school for four years. It was not a terrible turn of events, as he had much free time to play and compose music in the army as well.Wolf Moser, \\"Fernando Sor: The Life and Works of a Reluctant Guitarist, part one\\" from Classical Guitar Magazine, November 2007. In 1808, when Napoleon Bonaparte invaded Spain, Sor began to write nationalistic music for the guitar, often accompanied by patriotic lyrics. Sor was even part of traveling military bands that would play protest music on the streets. He was also promoted to captain in C√≥rdoba and may have fought battles against the French at this time. After the defeat of the Spanish army, however, Sor accepted an administrative post in the occupying government. Here he was to be officially labeled an afrancesado along with the other Spaniards who abandoned their defense of Spain to embrace the French Revolutionary ideas. After the Spanish repelled the French in 1813, Sor and other afrancesados left Spain for fear of retribution. He went to Paris, never to return to his home country again. Paris, London, and Moscow Montmartre Cemetery, Paris Having abandoned his family's ideal of a military or administrative post, Sor could finally give music a serious try in France. He gained renown at first as a virtuoso guitarist and composer for the instrument. When he attempted composing operas, however, he was rejected by the French. His Op. 7 was a large and strange piece, notated in three clefs, and no guitarist at the time could play it. Since France was no longer supportive of his music, Sor decided to try his talents elsewhere. In 1815, he went to London to attempt to build a stronger music career there. Again, he gained considerable fame as a guitarist and gave guitar and voice lessons. Since ballet in London was more popular than opera, Sor decided to try his hand at this new genre of music. He had considerable success this time, especially with his ballet Cendrillon. By 1823, once he had acquired a level of fame in London, Sor again wandered away, this time with the ballerina F√©licit√© Hullen to Moscow in her quest to become a prima ballerina. Not much is known about his time there, however, despite the exaggeration about his romantic and professional life.Matanya Ophee: \\"Fernando Sor and the Russians\\", in: Soundboard Magazine. After three years in Moscow, he traveled around Europe giving concerts and getting into music circles everywhere he went. In 1827, partly due to his advancing age, he settled down and decided to live out the rest of his life back in Paris. It was during this retirement that he composed the majority of his guitar works. He had to comply with the demands of the public, though, and most guitarists wanted technically simple, nice-sounding pieces. It was in these last ten or so years of his life that his writings reveal his bitterness towards how his publications were being received by the public. For example, Op. 43 is entitled Mes Ennuis (\\"My Annoyances\\"), and six of his ballets are dedicated to \\"whoever wants them\\". These and other caustic remarks did not help his sales in the least. The foreword to Op. 45 goes even further than sarcasm: \\"Let's see if that's that. Six short and easy pieces in stages, which aim to lead to what has generally been agreed are difficulties. Composed and dedicated to the person with the least patience, by Fernando Sor. Opus 45.\\"Wolf Moser: \\"Fernando Sor: The Life and Works of a Reluctant Guitarist\\", part 2, in: Classical Guitar Magazine, December 2007. His last work was a mass in honour of his daughter, who died in 1837. The event sent the already-sickly Sor into serious depression, and he died in 1839, of tongue and throat cancer.Cecilia Ruiz de R√≠os, Nicaraguan historian Quotations Fran√ßois-Joseph F√©tis has called him \\"le Beethoven de la guitare\\" , though he has also remarked that Sor had failed to produce a good tone on one occasion. Works The original cover of Sor's Variations on a Theme of Mozart, Op. 9, published in Paris in 1821 Music One of Sor's popular compositions is his Introduction and Variations on a Theme by Mozart, Op. 9. It is based on the melody for \\"Das klinget so herrlich, das klinget so sch√∂n!\\" from The Magic Flute, composed in 1791.The article has been removed in 2014 Didactic music Sor was a prolific and, in his time, quite popular composer. There was a great demand for him to compose material that was approachable by less accomplished players. The resulting body of instructional studies he produced is not only noteworthy for its value to students of the guitar, but for its inherent musicality. Much of this work is organized in several opus numbers (in increasing order of difficulty): Op. 60 (25 lessons), Op. 44 (24 lessons), Op. 35 (24 exercises), Op. 31 (24 lessons), Op. 6 (12 studies) and Op. 29 (12 studies). Didactic manual Sor's M√©thode pour la Guitare was first published in Paris in 1830 and translated into English by A Merrick in 1832 under the title Method for the Spanish Guitar. The original cover of Sor's M√©thode pour la Guitare, published in Paris in 1830. Instruments used by Sor Sor undoubtedly played guitars by Pierre Ren√© Lac√¥te, mentioning: \\"M. Lacote, a French maker, the only person who, besides his talents, has proved to me that he possesses the quality of not being inflexible to reasoning\\". *Some guitars of Lac√¥te show Sor's signature: \\"Fernando Sor, the Catalan guitarist living in Paris has signed a number of guitars by Ren√© Lac√¥te ‚Äì examples now survive in the Edinburgh University Collection of Historic Musical Instruments, cat. no. 2521; and in private ownership (exhibited at the Londen Early Music Instrument Makers Exhibition, 1991). Sor also lent his name to the instruments of Louis Panormo of London. However, in neither case is the instrument known, then or now, as a 'Sor model'.\\"Innovation and the Development of the Modern Six-String Guitar by Darryl Martin (The Galpin Society Journal, vol. 51 (Jul. 1998)). A guitar of Lac√¥te that was signed by Sor is displayed at the Metropolitan Museum of Art: 1. In his method, Sor mentions: > \\"[...] if I wanted an instrument, I would procure it from M. Joseph Martinez > of Malaga, or from M. Lacote [...] > The guitars to which I have always given the preference are those of Alonzo > of Madrid, Pag√®s and Benediz of Cadiz, Joseph and Manuel Martinez of Malaga, > or Rada, successor and scholar of the latter, and those of M. Lacote of > Paris. I do not say that others do not exist; but never having tried them, I > cannot decide on that which I have no knowledge.\\" In his method, he also mentions that \\"J. Panormo\\" of London and \\"Mr. Schroeder of Petersburgh\\", made some guitars under his direction; but it is curious that he mentions them only in regard to his own guitar design ideas, which are today partly critically viewed. Guitars made according to Sor's design have not yet been located. Andr√©s Segovia selected a set of twenty studies, each emphasizing a particular aspect of technique; these studies are now some of the best known works of Fernando Sor.

They released two records as SS Decontrol and then formally changed their name to SSD. As SSD they released two more records with a very heavy metal influenced sound. However the group is often simply referred to, including all its periods, as SSD. History Formed by songwriter/guitarist Al Barile (then a machinist at the General Electric plant in Lynn, Massachusetts and a student at Northeastern University), SSD started performing at smaller venues throughout the Greater Boston metropolitan area, like Gallery East, in the summer of 1981. The band quickly gained notoriety within the local music scene for intense, charged performances and the provocative antics of their core group of followers, the Boston Crew.Cogan, Mike (2006) Encyclopedia of Punk Music and Culture, Greenwood Press, , p. 216 The original lineup was Al Barile on guitar, Springa (David Spring) on vocals, Jaime Sciarappa on bass and Chris Foley on drums.True, Chris \\"SSD Biography\\", Allmusic, retrieved July 19, 2011 They released their debut LP The Kids Will Have Their Say on their own X-Claim label in 1982. Ian MacKaye of Minor Threat was a friend and supporter and his Dischord label's logo appeared on the back cover. In 1983 they added second guitarist Francois Levesque and released the EP Get It Away, widely regarded as their best record, and one that helped define Boston's straight-edge scene.McCaleb, Ian & Robbins, Ira \\"SS Decontrol/SSD\\", Trouser Press, retrieved July 19, 2011 The X-Claim pressings of it and The Kids Will Have Their Say are both highly collectable. Like many hardcore bands in the mid-1980s, particularly in the Boston area, SSD began heading in a heavy metal direction. In 1984 they signed to the Boston label Modern Method and released the How We Rock EP, which was rooted in the hardcore sound but exhibited overt heavy metal characteristics, such as a relatively high number of lengthy guitar solos. After signing to Homestead they released the Break It Up LP in 1985. It had both feet planted in the metal genre, leaving behind all trappings of punk and hardcore. SSD broke up in November that year. Barile went on to form Gage, Sciarappa joined Slapshot, and Springa went on to join Razorcaine and Die Blitzkinder.

It is typically a high- elevation pine growing mixed with other conifers (a montane forest). Description Pinus strobiformis, a member of the white pine group, Pinus subgenus Strobus, is a straight, slender tree growing to 30 m tall and 1 m in diameter. The bark is smooth and silvery-gray on young trees, aging to furrowed and red-brown or dark gray-brown. The branches are spreading and ascending. Twigs are slender, pale red-brown, aging to smooth gray or gray- brown. Buds are ellipsoid, red-brown, and resinous. Leaves (needles) are five per bundle (fascicle), sometimes four, spreading to ascending-upcurved, 4‚Äì9 cm long (rarely 10), 0.6-1.0 mm in diameter, straight, slightly twisted, pliant, dark green to blue-green, and persist 3‚Äì5 years. The upper surface ('adaxial' - facing toward the stem of the plant) is conspicuously whitened by narrow stomatal lines. The lower surfaces ('abaxial' - facing away from the stem of the plant) are without evident stomatal lines. The margins are sharp, razorlike and entire to finely serrulate, apex narrowly acute to short- subulate. Each fascicle has a deciduous sheath 1.5-2.0 cm long which is shed early. The cones are very large, 16‚Äì50 cm long and 9‚Äì11 cm broad, and have scales with a very characteristic prolonged and often recurved or S-shaped apex. The seeds are large, and with a very short wing; they are dispersed mainly by birds, particularly the Mexican jay. It is a very drought tolerant tree but greater populations grow on moist and cool places living in association with Pinus hartwegii and Pinus rudis. Distribution The tree can natively be found in mountainous areas in Arizona, southwest Colorado, New Mexico, and western Texas. Most of the native pines are in Mexico, in the Sierra Madre Occidental mountains of northern Mexico, from a short distance south of the US‚ÄìMexico border south through Chihuahua and Durango to Jalisco. The pine rarely appears in pure strands, but grows along with other native conifers, such as limber pine, ponderosa pine, blue spruce, aspen, white fir, Douglas fir, and Engelmann spruce. Uses The southwestern white pine can be grown as a Christmas tree, windbreak tree, or an ornamental tree. It is popular as a replacement in drier areas for the eastern white pine. It can be used in cabinet making, but it is poor as a lumber tree. The seeds were used as a food by Native Americans in the present day southwestern United States.

A sequel to Automated Mathematician, it consists of heuristics, i.e. rules of thumb, including heuristics describing how to use and change its own heuristics. Lenat was frustrated by Automated Mathematician's constraint to a single domain and so developed Eurisko; his frustration with the effort of encoding domain knowledge for Eurisko led to Lenat's subsequent (and, , continuing) development of Cyc. Lenat envisions ultimately coupling the Cyc knowledgebase with the Eurisko discovery engine.  History  Development commenced at Carnegie Mellon in 1976 and continued at Stanford University in 1978 when Lenat returned to teach. \\"For the first five years, nothing good came out of it\\", Lenat said. But when the implementation was changed to a frame language based representation he called RLL (Representation Language Language), heuristic creation and modification became much simpler. Eurisko was then applied to a number of domains with surprising success, including VLSI chip design. Lenat and Eurisko gained notoriety by submitting the winning fleet (a large number of stationary, lightly-armored ships with many small weapons) to the United States Traveller TCS national championship in 1981, forcing extensive changes to the game's rules. However, Eurisko won again in 1982 when the program discovered that the rules permitted the program to destroy its own ships, permitting it to continue to use much the same strategy. Tournament officials announced that if Eurisko won another championship the competition would be abolished; Lenat retired Eurisko from the game. The Traveller TCS wins brought Lenat to the attention of DARPA, which has funded much of his subsequent work. In popular culture In the first-season The X-Files episode \\"Ghost in the Machine\\", Eurisko is the name of a fictional software company responsible for the episode's \\"monster of the week\\", facilities management software known as \\"Central Operating System\\", or \\"COS\\". COS (described in the episode as an \\"adaptive network\\") is shown to be capable of learning when its designer arrives at Eurisko headquarters and is surprised to find that COS has given itself the ability to speak. The designer is forced to create a virus to destroy COS after COS commits a series of murders in an apparent effort to prevent its own destruction. Lenat is mentioned and Eurisko is discussed at the end of Richard Feynman's Computer Heuristics Lecture as part of the Idiosyncratic Thinking Workshop Series.https://youtube.com/watch?v=EKWGGDXe5MA&t;=1h8m38s Lenat and Eurisko are mentioned in the 2019 James Rollins novel Crucible that deals with artificial intelligence and artificial general intelligence.

BK channels are voltage-gated potassium channels that conduct large amounts of potassium ions (K+) across the cell membrane, hence their name, big potassium. These channels can be activated (opened) by either electrical means, or by increasing Ca2+ concentrations in the cell.Miller, C. (2000). Genome Biology, 1(4), reviews0004.1. https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/gb-2000-1-4-reviews0004Yuan, P., Leonetti, M., Pico, A., Hsiung, Y., & MacKinnon, R. (2010). Structure of the Human BK Channel Ca2+-Activation Apparatus at 3.0 A Resolution. Science, 329(5988), 182-186. https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1190414 BK channels help regulate physiological processes, such as circadian behavioral rhythms and neuronal excitability. BK channels are also involved in many processes in the body, as it is a ubiquitous channel. They have a tetrameric structure that is composed of a transmembrane domain, voltage sensing domain, potassium channel domain, and a cytoplasmic C-terminal domain, with many X-ray structures for reference. Their function is to repolarize the membrane potential by allowing for potassium to flow outward, in response to a depolarization or increase in calcium levels.  Structure  Structurally, BK channels are homologous to voltage- and ligand-gated potassium channels, having a voltage sensor and pore as the membrane-spanning domain and a cytosolic domain for the binding of intracellular calcium and magnesium. Each monomer of the channel-forming alpha subunit is the product of the KCNMA1 gene (also known as Slo1). The Slo1 subunit has three main structural domains, each with a distinct function: the voltage sensing domain (VSD) senses membrane potential across the membrane, the cytosolic domain (senses calcium concentration, Ca¬≤‚Å∫ ions), and the pore-gate domain (PGD) which opens and closes to regulate potassium permeation. The activation gate resides in the PGD, which is located at either the cytosolic side of S6 or the selectivity filter (selectivity is the preference of a channel to conduct a specific ion). The Voltage sensing domain and pore-gated domain are collectively referred as the membrane-spanning domains and are formed by transmembrane segments S1-S4 and S5-S6, respectively. Within the S4 helix contains a series of positively charged residues which serve as the primary voltage sensor. BK channels are quite similar to voltage gated K‚Å∫ channels, however, in BK channels only one positively charged residue (Arg213) is involved in voltage sensing across the membrane. Also unique to BK channels is an additional S0 segment, this segment is required for Œ≤ subunit modulation. and voltage sensitivity. The Cytosolic domain is composed of two RCK (regulator of potassium conductance) domains, RCK1 and RCK2. These domains contain two high affinity Ca¬≤‚Å∫ binding sites: one in the RCK1 domain and the other in a region termed the Ca¬≤‚Å∫ bowl that consists of a series of Aspartic acid (Asp) residues that are located in the RCK2 domain. The Mg¬≤‚Å∫ binding site is located between the VSD and the cytosolic domain, which is formed by: Asp residues within the S0-S1 loop, Asparagine residues in the cytosolic end of S2, and Glutamine residues in RCK1. In forming the Mg¬≤‚Å∫ binding site, two residues come from the RCK1 of one Slo1 subunit and the other two residues come from the VSD of the neighboring subunit. In order for these residues to coordinate the Mg¬≤‚Å∫ ion, the VSD and cytosolic domain from neighboring subunits must be in close proximity. Modulatory beta subunits (encoded by KCNMB1, KCNMB2, KCNMB3, or KCNMB4) can associate with the tetrameric channel. There are four types of Œ≤ subunits (Œ≤1-4), each of which have different expression patterns that modify the gating properties of the BK channel. The Œ≤1 subunit is primarily responsible for smooth muscle cell expression, both Œ≤2 and Œ≤3 subunits are neuronally expressed, while Œ≤4 is expressed within the brain. The VSD associates with the PGD via three major interactions: #Physical connection between the VSD and PGD through the S4-S5 linker. #Interactions between the S4-S5 linker and the cytosolic side of S6. #Interactions between S4 and S5 of a neighboring subunit.  Regulation  BK channels are associated and modulated by a wide variety of intra- and extracellular factors, such as auxiliary subunits (Œ≤, Œ≥), Slobs (slo binding protein), phosphorylation, membrane voltage, chemical ligands (Ca¬≤‚Å∫, Mg¬≤‚Å∫), PKC, The BK Œ±-subunits assemble 1:1 with four different auxiliary types of Œ≤-subunits (Œ≤1, Œ≤2, Œ≤3 or Œ≤4). Trafficking to and expression of BK channels in the plasma membrane has been found to be regulated by distinct splicing motifs located within the intracellular C-terminal RCK domains. In particular a splice variant that excluded these motifs prevented cell surface expression of BK channels and suggests that such a mechanism impacts physiology and pathophysiology. BK channels in the vascular system are modulated by agents naturally produced in the body, such as angiotensin II (Ang II), high glucose or arachidonic acid (AA) which is modulated in diabetes by oxidative stress (ROS). A weaker voltage sensitivity allows BK channels to function in a wide range of membrane potentials. This ensures that the channel can properly perform its physiological function. Inhibition of BK channel activity by phosphorylation of S695 by protein kinase C (PKC) is dependent on the phosphorylation of S1151 in C terminus of channel alpha-subunit. Only one of these phosphorylations in the tetrameric structure needs to occur for inhibition to be successful. Protein phosphatase 1 counteracts phosphorylation of S695. PKC decreases channel opening probability by shortening the channel open time and prolonging the closed state of the channel. PKC does not affect the single-channel conductance, voltage dependence, or the calcium sensitivity of BK channels.  Activation mechanism  BK channels are synergistically activated through the binding of calcium and magnesium ions, but can also be activated via voltage dependence. Ca¬≤‚Å∫ - dependent activation occurs when intracellular Ca¬≤‚Å∫ binds to two high affinity binding sites: one located in the C-terminus of the RCK2 domain (Ca¬≤‚Å∫ bowl), and the other located in the RCK1 domain. The binding site within the RCK1 domain has somewhat of a lower affinity for calcium than the Ca¬≤‚Å∫ bowl, but is responsible for a larger portion of the Ca¬≤‚Å∫ sensitivity. Voltage and calcium activate BK channels using two parallel mechanisms, with the voltage sensors and the Ca¬≤‚Å∫ bindings sites coupling to the activation gate independently, except for a weak interaction between the two mechanisms. The Ca¬≤‚Å∫ bowl accelerates activation kinetics at low Ca¬≤‚Å∫ concentrations while RCK1 site influences both activation and deactivation kinetics. One mechanism model was originally proposed by Monod, Wyman, and Changeux, known as the MWC model. The MWC model for BK channels explains that a conformational change of the activation gate in channel opening is accompanied by a conformational change to the Ca¬≤‚Å∫ binding site, which increases the affinity of Ca¬≤‚Å∫ binding. Magnesium-dependent activation of BK channels activates via a low-affinity metal binding site that is independent from Ca¬≤‚Å∫-dependent activation. The Mg¬≤‚Å∫ sensor activates BK channels by shifting the activation voltage to a more negative range. Mg¬≤‚Å∫ activates the channel only when the voltage sensor domain stays in the activated state. The cytosolic tail domain (CTD) is a chemical sensor that has multiple binding sites for different ligands. The CTD activates the BK channel when bound with intracellular Mg¬≤‚Å∫ to allow for interaction with the voltage sensor domain (VSD). Magnesium is predominantly coordinated by six oxygen atoms from the side chains of oxygen-containing residues, main chain carbonyl groups in proteins, or water molecules. D99 at the C-terminus of the S0-S1 loop and N172 in the S2-S3 loop contain side chain oxygens in the voltage sensor domain that are essential for Mg¬≤‚Å∫ binding. Much like the Ca¬≤‚Å∫-dependent activation model, Mg¬≤‚Å∫-dependent activation can also be described by an allosteric MCW gating model. While calcium activates the channel largely independent of the voltage sensor, magnesium activates the channel by channel by an electrostatic interaction with the voltage sensor. This is also known as the Nudging model, in which Magnesium activates the channel by pushing the voltage sensor via electrostatic interactions and involves the interactions among side chains in different structural domains. Energy provided by voltage, Ca¬≤‚Å∫, and Mg¬≤‚Å∫ binding will propagate to the activation gate of BK channels to initiate ion conduction through the pore.  Effects on the neuron, organ, body as a whole =Cellular level BK channels help regulate both the firing of neurons and neurotransmitter release. This modulation of synaptic transmission and electrical discharge at the cellular level is due to BK channel expression in conjunction with other potassium-calcium channels. The opening of these channels causes a drive towards the potassium equilibrium potential and thus play a role in speeding up the repolarization of action potentials. This would effectively allow for more rapid stimulation. There is also a role played in shaping the general repolarization of cells, and thus after hyperpolarization (AHP) of action potentials. The role that BK channels have in the fast phase of AHP has been studied extensively in the hippocampus. It can also play a role in inhibiting the release of neurotransmitters. There are many BK channels in Purkinje cells in the cerebellum, thus highlighting their role in motor coordination and function. Furthermore, BK channels play a role in modulating the activity of dendrites as well as astrocytes and microglia. They not only play a role in the CNS (central nervous system) but also in smooth muscle contractions, the secretion of endocrine cells, and the proliferation of cells. Various Œ≥ subunits during early brain development are involved in neuronal excitability and in non-excitable cells they often are responsible as a driving force of calcium. Therefore, these subunits can be targets for therapeutic treatments as BK channel activators. There is further evidence that inhibiting BK channels would prevent the efflux of potassium and thus reduce the usage of ATP, in effect allowing for neuronal survival in low oxygen environments. BK channels can also function as a neuronal protectant in terms such as limiting calcium entry into the cells through methionine oxidation. Organ level BK channels also play a role in hearing. This was found when the BK …ë-subunit was knocked out in mice and progressive loss of cochlear hair cells, and thus hearing loss, was observed. BK channels are not only involved in hearing, but also circadian rhythms. Slo binding proteins (Slobs) can modulate BK channels as a function of circadian rhythms in neurons. BK channels are expressed in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), which is characterized to influence the pathophysiology of sleep. BK channel openers can also have a protective effect on the cardiovascular system. At a low concentration of calcium BK channels have a greater impact on vascular tone. Furthermore, the signaling system of BK channels in the cardiovascular system have an influence on the functioning of coronary blood flow. One of the functions of the Œ≤ subunit in the brain includes inhibition of the BK channels, allowing for the slowing of channel properties as well as the ability to aid in prevention of seizures in the temporal lobe. Bodily function level Mutations of BK channels, resulting in a lower amount of expression in mRNA, is more common in people who are mentally challenged (via hypofunction ), schizophrenic or autistic. Moreover, increased repolarization caused by BK channel mutations may lead to dependency of alcohol initiation of dyskinesias, epilepsy or paroxysmal movement disorders. Not only are BK channels important in many cellular processes in the adult it also is crucial for proper nutrition supply to a developing fetus. Thus, estrogen can cause an increase in the density of BK channels in the uterus. However, increased expression of BK channels have been found in tumor cells, and this could influence future cancer therapy, discussed more in the pharmacology section. BK channels are ubiquitous throughout the body and thus have a large and vast impact on the body as a whole and at a more cellular level, as discussed.  Pharmacology =Potential issues Several issues arise when there is a deficit in BK channels. Consequences of the malfunctioning BK channel can affect the functioning of a person in many ways, some more life threatening than others. BK channels can be activated by exogenous pollutants and endogenous gasotransmitters carbon monoxide, nitric oxide, and hydrogen sulphide. Mutations in the proteins involved with BK channels or genes encoding BK channels are involved in many diseases. A malfunction of BK channels can proliferate in many disorders such as: epilepsy, cancer, diabetes, asthma, and hypertension. Specifically, Œ≤1 defect can increase blood pressure and hydrosaline retention in the kidney. Both loss of function and gain of function mutations have been found to be involved in disorders such as epilepsy and chronic pain. Furthermore, increases in BK channel activation, through gain-of-function mutants and amplification, has links to epilepsy and cancer. Moreover, BK channels play a role in tumors as well as cancers. In certain cancers gBK, a variant ion channel called glioma BK channel, can be found. It is known that BK channels do in some way influence the division of cells during replication, which when unregulated can lead to cancers and tumors. Moreover, an aspect studied includes the migration of cancer cells and the role in which BK channels can facilitate this migration, though much is still unknown. Another reason why BK channel understanding is important involves its role in organ transplant surgery. This is due to the activation of BK channels influencing repolarization of the resting membrane potential. Thus, understanding is crucial for safety in effective transplantation. Current developments BK channels can be used as pharmacological targets for the treatment of several medical disorders including stroke and overactive bladder. There have been attempts to develop synthetic molecules targeting BK channels, however their efforts have proven largely ineffective thus far. For instance, BMS-204352, a molecule developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb, failed to improve clinical outcome in stroke patients compared to placebo. However, there have been some success from the agonist to BKCa channels, BMS-204352, in treating deficits observed in Fmr1 knockout mice, a model of Fragile X syndrome. BK channels also function as a blocker in ischemia and are a focus in investigating its use as a therapy for stroke. Future directions There are many applications for therapeutic strategies involving BK channels. There has been research displaying that a blockage of BK channels results in an increase in neurotransmitter release, effectively indicating future therapeutic possibilities in cognition enhancement, improved memory, and relieving depression. A behavioral response to alcohol is also modulated by BK channels, therefore further understanding of this relationship can aid treatment in patients who are alcoholics. Oxidative stress on BK channels can lead to the negative impairments of lowering blood pressure through cardiovascular relaxation have on both aging and disease. Thus, the signaling system can be involved in treating hypertension and atherosclerosis through targeting of the …ë subunit to prevent these detrimental effects. Furthermore, the known role that BK channels can play in cancer and tumors is limited. Thus, there is not a lot of current knowledge regarding specific aspects of BK channels that can influence tumors and cancers. Further study is crucial, as this could lead to immense development in treatments for those suffering from cancer and tumors. It is known that epilepsies are due to over- excitability of neurons, which BK channels have a large impact on controlling hyperexcitability. Therefore, understanding could influence the treatment of epilepsy. Overall, BK channels are a target for future pharmacological agents that can be used for benevolent treatments of disease.

Biography  Robert Desnos was born in Paris on 4 July 1900, the son of a licensed dealer in game and poultry at the Halles market. Desnos attended commercial college, and started work as a clerk. He also worked as an amanuensis for journalist Jean de Bonnefon. After that he worked as a literary columnist for the newspaper Paris-Soir. The first poems by Desnos to appear in print were published in 1917 in La Tribune des Jeunes (Platform for Youth) and in 1919 in the avant-garde review Le Trait d'union (Hyphen), and also the same year in the Dadaist magazine Litt√©rature. In 1922 he published his first book, a collection of surrealistic aphorisms, with the title Rrose S√©lavy (based upon the name (pseudonym) of the popular French artist Marcel Duchamp). In 1919 he met the poet Benjamin P√©ret, who introduced him to the Paris Dada group and Andr√© Breton, with whom he soon became friends. While working as a literary columnist for Paris-Soir, Desnos was an active member of the Surrealist group and developed a particular talent for automatic writing. He, together with writers such as Louis Aragon and Paul √âluard, would form the literary vanguard of surrealism. Andr√© Breton included two photographs of Desnos sleeping in his surrealist novel Nadja. Although he was praised by Breton in his 1924 Manifeste du Surr√©alisme for being the movement's \\"prophet\\", Desnos disagreed with Surrealism's involvement in communist politics, which caused a rift between him and Breton. Desnos continued work as a columnist. In 1926 he composed The Night of Loveless Nights, a lyric poem dealing with solitude curiously written in classic quatrains, which makes it more like Baudelaire than Breton. Desnos fell in love with Yvonne George, a singer whose obsessed fans made his love impossible. He wrote several poems for her, as well as the erotic surrealist novel La libert√© ou l'amour! (1927). Critic Ray Keenoy describes La libert√© ou l'amour! as \\"literary and lyrical in its outpourings of sexual delirium\\". By 1929 Breton definitively condemned Desnos, who in turn joined Georges Bataille and Documents, as one of the authors to sign Un Cadavre (A Corpse) attacking \\"le b≈ìuf Breton\\" (Breton the ox or Breton the oaf). He wrote articles on \\"Modern Imagery\\", \\"Avant-garde Cinema\\" (1929, issue 7), \\"Pygmalion and the Sphinx\\" (1930, issue 1), and Sergei Eisenstein, the Soviet filmmaker, on his film titled The General Line (1930, issue 4). His career in radio began in 1932 with a show dedicated to Fant√¥mas. During that time, he became friends with Picasso, Hemingway, Artaud and John Dos Passos; published many critical reviews on jazz and cinema; and became increasingly involved in politics. He wrote for many periodicals, including Litt√©rature, La R√©volution surr√©aliste and Vari√©t√©s. Besides his numerous collections of poems, he published three novels, Deuil pour deuil (1924), La Libert√© ou l'amour! (1927) and Le vin est tir√© (1943); a play, La Place de l'√©toile (1928; revised 1944); and a film script, L'√âtoile de mer (1928), which was directed by Man Ray that same year. Resistance and deportation During World War II, Desnos was an active member of the French R√©sistance network R√©seau AGIR, under the direction of Michel Hollard, often publishing under pseudonyms. For R√©seau Agir, Desnos provided information collected during his job at the journal Aujourd'hui and made false identity papers, and was arrested by the Gestapo on 22 February 1944. He was first deported to the German concentration camps of Auschwitz in occupied Poland, then Buchenwald, Flossenburg in Germany and finally to Terez√≠n (Theresienstadt) in occupied Czechoslovakia in 1945. Desnos died in Mal√° pevnost, which was an inner part of Terez√≠n used only for political prisoners, from typhoid, a month after the camp's liberation. There is a moving anecdote about Desnos's last days after the liberation while being tended to by a young Czech medical student, Josef Stuna, who recognised him thanks to reading Breton's Nadja. Susan Griffin relates a story, previously recounted slightly differently in an article by her that appears in Gonz√°lez Yuen, that exemplifies Desnos' surrealist mindset; his capacity to envisage solutions that defy conventional logic: The legend of \\"The Last Poem\\" A so-called \\"Last Poem\\" (Dernier po√®me) has been published numerous times; it was even set to music by Francis Poulenc in 1956. However, this poem never existed. The belief in its existence started after a misunderstanding. A Czech newspaper Svobodn√© noviny (Free Newspaper) published his obituary which ended with the sentence \\"In a strange, tragic way his verses have fulfilled\\" followed by a quote from Desnos' poem I Dreamt About You So Much translated by a Czech poet Jind≈ôich Ho≈ôej≈°√≠ and printed in six lines. When re-published in France in Les Lettres Fran√ßaises, the sentence was translated in a completely wrong way: \\"A strange and tragic fate gave a concrete meaning to a poem, the only one found with him and dedicated probably to his spouse\\" followed by an erroneous translation of the aforementioned verses (furthermore, the translation excluded the last line of the Czech translation). Due to this the legend of \\"The Last Poem\\" survived well into the 1970s. It was thanks to a Czech translator Adolf Kroupa and his two well- founded articles in Les Lettres Fran√ßaises (June 1960, August 1970) that this false belief in the poem started to cease to exist. Desnos was married to Youki Desnos, formerly Lucie Badoud, nicknamed \\"Youki\\" (\\"snow\\") by her lover Tsuguharu Foujita before she left him for Desnos. Desnos wrote several poems about her. One of his most famous poems is \\"Letter to Youki\\", written after his arrest. He is buried at the Montparnasse cemetery in Paris. Legacy Desnos' poetry has been set to music by a number of composers, including Witold Lutos≈Çawski with Les Espaces du sommeil (1975) and Chantefleurs et Chantefables (1991), Francis Poulenc (Dernier po√®me, 1956) and Henri Dutilleux with Le Temps l'Horloge (2007). Carolyn Forch√© has translated his poetry and names Desnos as a significant influence on her own work. In 1974, at the urging of Robert Desnos' widow, Joan Mir√≥ published an \\"illustrated book\\" with text from Robert Desnos titled Les p√©nalit√©s de l'enfer ou les nouvelles H√©brides (The Penalties of Hell or The New Hebrides), Maeght Editeur, Paris, 1974. It was a set of 25 lithographs, five in black, and the others in colors. In 2006, the book was displayed in \\"Joan Mir√≥, Illustrated Books\\" at the Vero Beach Museum of Art. One critic said it is \\"an especially powerful set, not only for the rich imagery but also for the story behind the book's creation. The lithographs are long, narrow verticals, and while they feature Mir√≥'s familiar shapes, there's an unusual emphasis on texture.\\" The critic continued, \\"I was instantly attracted to these four prints, to an emotional lushness, that's in contrast with the cool surfaces of so much of Mir√≥'s work. Their poignancy is even greater, I think, when you read how they came to be. The artist met and became friends with Desnos, perhaps the most beloved and influential surrealist writer, in 1925, and before long, they made plans to collaborate on a livre d'artist. Those plans were put on hold because of the Spanish civil war and World War II. Desnos' bold criticism of the latter led to his imprisonment in Theresienstadt, and he died at age 45 shortly after his release in 1945. Nearly three decades later, at the suggestion of Desnos' widow, Mir√≥ set out to illustrate the poet's manuscript. It was his first work in prose, which was written in Morocco in 1922 but remained unpublished until this posthumous collaboration.\\" A reading of \\"Relation d'un R√™ve\\" (Description of a Dream) recorded by Desnos for radio broadcast in 1938 can be heard on the audiobook CD Surrealism Reviewed, issued in 2002.

Webster's New World College Dictionary. ; Modern Turkish: Sancak, ) were administrative divisions of the Ottoman Empire. Sanjak, and the variant spellings sandjak, sanjaq and sinjaq, are English or French transliterations of the Turkish word sancak, meaning \\"district\\", \\"banner\\" or \\"flag\\".Dictionary.com - Sanjak entry Sanjaks were also called by the Arabic word for banner or flag: liwa. Ottoman provinces (eyalets, later vilayets) were divided into sanjaks (also called livas) governed by sanjakbeys (also called Mutesarriff) and were further subdivided into timars (fiefs held by timariots), kadiluks (the area of responsibility of a judge, or Kadƒ±) and zeamets (also ziam; larger timars). The unofficial, geo-political region of Sand≈æak in Serbia and Montenegro derives its name from the former Ottoman Sanjak of Novi Pazar. Names Liwa or liwƒÅ‚Äô () is an Arabic word interchangeable with the Turkish sanjak. After the fall of the Ottoman Empire in the early 20th century, the term liwa was used in the Arab countries formerly under Ottoman rule. It was gradually replaced by other terms like qadaa and mintaqah, and is now defunct. It is used occasionally in Syria to refer to the Hatay Province, ceded by the French mandate of Syria to Turkey in 1939, at which time the area was known as Liwa' Iskenderun. Ottoman Empire=History The first sanjaks appear to have been created by Orhan circa 1340 or earlier. These were Sultan-√∂y√ºg√º (later Sultan-√∂n√º), Hudavendigar-eli, Koca-eli and Karasi-eli. The districts which made up an eyalet were known as sanjaks, each under the command of a sanjak-bey. The number of sanjaks in each eyalet varied considerably. In 1609, Ayn Ali noted that Rumelia Eyalet had 24 sanjaks, but that six of these in the Peloponnesos had been detached to form the separate Morea Eyalet. Anatolia had 14 sanjaks and the Damascus Eyalet had 11. There were, in addition, several eyalets where there was no formal division into sanjaks. These, in Ayn Ali's list were Basra and part of the Baghdad, Al-Hasa, Egypt, Tripoli, Tunis and Algiers. He adds to the list Yemen, with the note that ‚Äòat the moment the Imams have usurped control‚Äô. These eyalets were, however, exceptional: the typical pattern was the eyalet subdivided into sanjaks. By the 16th century, these presented a rational administrative pattern of territories, based usually around the town or settlement from which the sanjak took its name, and with a population of perhaps 100,000. However, this had not always been the case. It seems more likely that before the mid-15th century, the most important factor in determining the pattern of sanjaks was the existence of former lordships and principalities, and of areas where marcher lords had acquired territories for themselves and their followers. Some sanjaks in fact preserved the names of the dynasties that had ruled there before the Ottoman conquest. In 1609, Ayn Ali made a note on their formal status. In listing the sanjaks in the Diyarbekir Eyalet, he notes that it had ten ‚ÄòOttoman districts‚Äô and, in addition, eight ‚Äòdistricts of the Kurdish lords‚Äô. In these cases, when a lord died, the governorship did not go to an outsider, but to his son. In other respects, however, they resembled normal Ottoman sanjaks, in that the revenues were registered and allocated to fief holders who went to war under their lord. In addition, however, Ayn Ali noted that there were five ‚Äòsovereign sanjaks‚Äô, which their lords disposed of ‚Äòas private property‚Äô, and which were outside the system of provincial government. Ayn Ali records similar independent or semi-independent districts in the √áƒ±ldƒ±r Eyalet in north- eastern Turkey and, most famously, in the Van Eyalet where the Khans of Bitlis ruled independently until the 19th century. There were other areas, too, which enjoyed autonomy or semi-autonomy. In the second half of the 16th century, Kilis came under the hereditary governorship of the Janbulad family, while Adana remained under the rule of the pre-Ottoman dynasty of Ramazanoghlu. In Lebanon, Ayn Ali refers to the Druze chieftains with the note: ‚Äòthere are non- Muslim lords in the mountains.‚Äô There were other autonomous enclaves in the Empire, whether or not they received formal recognition as sanjaks but, by the 16th century, these were exceptional. In the 1840s, the boundaries of sanjaks were redrawn to establish equal units of comparable population and wealth. Each of these sanjaks was headed by a muhassil. Government Most of the sanjaks throughout the Empire were under the rule of non-hereditary appointees, who had no permanent family of territorial connections with the area. The Sanjak was governed just as a Vilayet on a smaller scale. The Mutesarrif was appointed by Imperial decree, and represented the Vali, corresponding with the Government through him, except in some special circumstances where the Sanjak was independent, in which case the Mutesarrif corresponded directly with the Ministry of the Interior.A handbook of Asia Minor Published 1919 by Naval staff, Intelligence dept. in London.

It was created in 1490 for Herbert Herries with remainder to his heir general. On the death of his grandson, William, 3rd Lord Herries of Terregles, the male line failed. He was succeeded by his daughter Agnes, who married Sir John Maxwell, second son of Robert Maxwell, fifth Lord Maxwell. Their great-grandson, the 7th Lord Herries of Terregles, succeeded as third Earl of Nithsdale in 1667 on the death of his kinsman the second Earl. The earldom had been created in 1620 for Robert Maxwell, ninth Lord Maxwell. The third Earl's grandson, the fifth Earl, took part in the Jacobite rising of 1715. He was attainted in 1716, his peerages forfeited and sentenced to death. However, he managed to make a celebrated escape from the Tower of London by changing clothes with his wife's maid the day before his execution. His granddaughter Winifred married William Haggerston-Constable, second son of Sir Carnaby Haggerston, 3rd Bart, of Haggerston Castle, Northumberland (see Constable-Maxwell-Scott baronets). Their son Marmaduke assumed the surname of Constable-Maxwell. In 1848 his son William Constable-Maxwell and the descendants of the fifth Earl of Nithsdale were restored by Act of Parliament and in 1858 William Constable-Maxwell succeeded as 10th Lord Herries of Terregles. He was succeeded in 1876 by his son, Marmaduke Constable-Maxwell (married 1875 the Hon. Angela Fitzalan- Howard, daughter of the first Baron Howard of Glossop) as 11th Lord Herries of Terregles, who served as Lord Lieutenant of the East Riding of Yorkshire from 1880 and Lord Lieutenant of Kirkcudbrightshire from 1885 until 1908 ‚Äì he was created, in 1884, Baron Herries of Carleverock Castle in the County of Dumfries and of Everingham in the East Riding of the County of York, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. This title became extinct upon his death in 1908, as he had no sons. He was succeeded in the Lordship by his daughter, the 12th Lady Herries of Terregles, who married her first cousin once removed Henry Fitzalan-Howard, 15th Duke of Norfolk. On her death in 1945 the title was inherited by her only son Bernard Fitzalan-Howard, 16th Duke of Norfolk, who became the 13th Lord Herries of Terregles. When he died in 1975 the dukedom passed to his second cousin once removed, the 17th Duke, while he was succeeded in the Lordship by the eldest of his four daughters, the 14th holder of the title. In 1985 Lady Herries of Terregles married the cricketer Colin Cowdrey, created a Life Peer as Baron Cowdrey of Tonbridge in 1997. Lady Herries died in 2014 when her sister, Lady Mary Mumford DCVO, heiress of the line, succeeded her as the 15th Lady Herries of Terregles. Following her death in 2017 the current and 16th holder of the title is her younger sister Jane Kerr, Marchioness of Lothian, wife of Conservative politician Michael Kerr, 13th Marquess of Lothian.

It attempts to investigate various news, issues, and scandals, aiming to reveal the social problems and the insufficiencies of state policies. Its Chinese title, Xinwen Diaocha, means \\"News Investigations\\". Together with Oriental Horizon (), Focus Report ()and Tell It Like It Is () News Probe shares the similar reputation in documentary television programmes in China. Mission=General mission of CCTV News Programs *Authority () *Reality () *Richness () *Liveliness () Additional mission of News Probe *Reporting the happening history and finding out the news in the news () *Encourage viewers to develop their own understanding of China problems *Cultivate new generation of China being more sensitive and critical to diverse problems and dilemma *Allow the audience to acquire a global horizon while viewing different issues in relation to other countries *Initiate reform for societal progress Development The maiden broadcast of 'Oriental Horizon'() on May 1, 1993 signified the start of the broadcast of commentary programme on current affairs. One year later, on April 1, 1994, a similar programme Focus Report(), which means a talk show on the hottest topics, was broadcast. At the prime time of 9p.m. on May 17, 1996, the first episode of News Probe-- \\"Hongzhi Ban\\"() was broadcast. The programme 'News Probe' is produced as a result of the ongoing development of such kind of programme. The founders of 'News Probe' expected this programme to report in a much detailed, in-depth, objective, systematic and authoritative way. During the past developmental years, the production team found a position for the program. News Probe is thus aired as an investigative documentary, not only a commentary one. The reason of setting up this position is due to the vast competitions from other news programmes in CCTV. Focus Report () provides detailed and universal description for different news events while 'Oriental Horizon'() is good at rousing audiences' emotion during news reporting. Besides, the broadcasting time of News Probe is beyond all these news programs. Therefore, what News Probe can do is to provide innovative reporting methods so as to raise audiences' interests. As a result, an investigative reporting style was developed. At the earlier stage of the program, the criteria on choosing the program topic are known as the slogan of \\"Sanxing\\" (), which means whether the topic is worth reporting, editing into program and investigating. However, in most cases, the three criteria are separately considered and only part of them are fulfilled. Afterwards, four methods of choosing a topic have been developed, known as the investigation on the theme, consensus, event and the inside skinny. Being an investigative documentary, the News Probe raised the slogan of \\"hunting the truth\\", which consists of 2 layers of meaning. Firstly, to uncover the inside skinny which is concealed by some people or organizations, and those secret incidents which harm the public interest. News Probe thus also includes some reports involving wrongdoings by governmental departments, such as corruption in the Chinese Police. Secondly, News Probe also aimed at providing deep discussion on the complex problems that being investigated. The production crew does not aim at generating any conclusion for each episode. Instead, it allows the audience to make their own judgements after viewing the programs. Since News Probe has been developed into an investigative documentary, it has its own characteristics: *The reporters of News Probe must cultivate a sense of investigation *The core part of the program is the process of investigation but not only the description of the event *The investigation process is initiated by the suspension of reporters on certain events, and it ends when the suspension is proved. To cut it short, the performance of the reporters during the investigation process determines the quality of the investigative documentary, therefore, reporters should be able to apply different methods depended on different situations in order to carry out a good programme . Reporters of the programme must also reach several criteria of the production crew. They must be: *rational in order to investigate the events in objective manners; *able to exchange ideas and examine issues at the same time; *able to look into issues in audiences point of view; *fair to all the parties involved in the events and should be unbiased to certain parties; and *able to raise questions towards every parts of the events Reporting style News Probe based on the framework of investigative reporting. (refer to the second publication of News Probe: ) Through continuously questioning and criticizing a range of social issues, News Probe has developed a unique style and focused on lesser known aspects of China and the affairs of China in connection with other countries. Examples of issues explored include the proliferation of AIDS and SARS in China, the greenhouse effect, pollution in China and Germany (which is an episode in 1997), via interviewing the people involved and raising questions. Investigation in each episode is initiated by reporters' suspicion towards the events. The reporters then start the investigation together with the production crew. Apart from reporters' own finding of the stories, members of the general public can also come forward with information through contacting the production crew directly, via the use of mail, news hotline and email. Apart from interviewing the involved parties, the crews of News Probe also investigate issues by different methods, such as consulting powerful institutions (for example, they have consulted India Wildlife Conservation Society, Wildlife Protection Organization, India Wildlife Trade Association, International Convention on the Trading of Endangered species and Asia Wild Life Trade Research Committees in the episode of \\"The death of Tibetan antalope\\") and people, referring to reference books and studying the issue‚Äôs history. These empirical methods enable News Probe to investigate issues in an objective and unbiased manner. Each episode draws a conclusion from the evidence collected and the investigatory work done by the reporters and the crew. Basic composition of an episode *Narration: Process of the incidents and the truth *Figure description: Experience of the main characters and description on his/her disposition *Investigation: Internal and external reasons Production Mechanism The production crew of the program includes the following posts (in hieratical order): #Chief Producer #Secretary #Producer #Director #Reporter #Cameraman #Recorder #Post-production #Coordinator Chief Producer is responsible for the broadcast of the program, including the content of the program and the administrative work. Producer is responsible for the production of each episode and is accountable to Chief Producer. The production of each episode follows the sequence stated below: #Selection of topic #Declaration of topic selected #Investigation #Recording of the investigation process #Post-production #Screening of the episode #Broadcast of the episode #Evaluation Topic criteria The production team has several criteria when choosing a suitable topic for each episode, including: *it must be a story long enough to produce a 45-minute programme (cut into 30-minute in 1999) *it must have special characteristics which can reflect some social changes *it must be able to raise public concern *there must be a truth behind the story *it must be an exclusive discovery, including the story and the angle of view of the reporter *it must be the first hand materials and not be reported by other news programs Broadcasting time { border=1 cel ---------------------------------------- !

Example episode Name: Pay for innocent() The government prosecuted a businessman, called Chan Yuen-Ho, over bribes. After his three-year imprisonment, the government released him because of lack of evidence. News Probe resolved to find out the inside story of the case. After interviewing the involved people, they found that the government prosecuted Chan Yuen-Ho because Chan was inobedient in taking advice and orders from the government. He rejected the government's advice of stopping external investment in his company. Chan was insistent on his innocence and appealed to the high court continuously. He was released after three years of prison life. However, his company went bankrupt during these three years. Evaluation on the example News Probe has been a pioneer, providing a rare voice to investigate the actions of the Chinese government. It has courage to interview the involved officials by asking to- the-point questions and let audience know the actions of the China government. It has allowed formerly voiceless persons to speak, and their Web site has allowed viewers to have their opinion heard. In this case, it gives a valuable opportunity for Chan Yuen-Ho to fight for the just response from the government.

Lord Balfour of Burleigh, in the County of Kinross, is a title in the Peerage of Scotland. It was created in 1607 for Sir Michael Balfour. He was succeeded by his daughter, Margaret, his only child. She married Robert Arnot, who assumed the surname of Balfour and sat as Lord Balfour of Burleigh in the Scottish Parliament in right of his wife. Their son, the third Lord, fought with the Covenanters at the Battle of Drumclog. His grandson, the fifth Lord, was tried and convicted of the murder of schoolmaster Henry Stenhouse at Inverkeithing in 1709. He was sentenced to death in 1710 but escaped to freedom by dressing in his sister's clothes. He was primarily known as Master of Burleigh, the title for the heir to the peerage, as he never took his seat in Parliament when his father died in 1713. He took part in the Jacobite rebellion in 1715 and was attainted for his role. He died childless in 1757. The lordship had been created by charter, a copy of which exists only in the family archives. The original charter did not specify right of succession. Robert Bruce (1795‚Äì1864), MP for Clackmannanshire, asserted his right to sit in the House of Lords as Lord Balfour of Burleigh and Lord Kilwinning. However, Walter Francis Balfour of Fernie, a male-line descendant of the second Lord, opposed Balfour on the grounds that he was the proper heir as heir male of the body. Robert Bruce died in 1864 before the case was decided, but his wife continued the case on behalf of their underage son, Alexander Hugh Bruce. On 21 July 1868, the House of Lords ruled in favour of the Bruces, determining that the original lordship was created with the remainder to heirs general (as evidenced by it being inherited by the original lord's daughter). On 19 March 1869, the attainder was reversed by Act of Parliament. Alexander Hugh Bruce, the 6th Lord Balfour of Burleigh, was the great-great-grandson of Hon. Mary Balfour (d. 1758), daughter of the fourth Lord, and her husband Brigadier-General Alexander Bruce. Since 1869, the lordship has been held by the Bruce family. Lord Balfour of Burleigh was a Conservative politician and sat in the House of Lords as a Scottish Representative Peer from 1876 to 1921 and was Secretary of State for Scotland between 1895 and 1903. His second son, the seventh Lord, was a Scottish Representative Peer from 1922 to 1963. , the title is held by his granddaughter, the ninth Lady, who succeeded his father in that year. Another member of the Balfour family was James Balfour, 1st Baron Balfour of Glenawley (in the Peerage of Ireland). He was the younger brother of the first Lord Balfour of Burleigh. The family seat now is Brucefield House, near Clackmannan. The original family seat was Burleigh Castle, near Kinross, which is now in ruins.

Along with the Pechora River to the east, it drains most of Northwest Russia into the Arctic Ocean. It should not be confused with Western Dvina. The principal tributaries of the Northern Dvina are the Vychegda (right), the Vaga (left), and the Pinega (right).  Etymology  According to the Max Vasmer's Etymological Dictionary, the name of the river has been taken from the Western Dvina. The toponym Dvina does not stem from a Uralic language; however, its origin is unclear. Possibly it is an Indo-European word which used to mean river or stream. In the Komi language, the river is called –í—ãÃÅ–Ω–≤–∞ / V√Ωnva from vyn \\"power\\" and va \\"water, river\\" hence \\"powerful river\\".  Physical geography = River basin  The length of the Northern Dvina is . Together with its major tributary, the Sukhona, it is long ‚Äì about as long as the Rhine in central and western Europe. The area of its basin is ‚Äì about the size of the western state of Montana in the United States. The river basin of the Northern Dvina include the major parts of the Vologda and the Arkhangelsk Oblasts, as well as areas in the western part of the Komi Republic and in the northern part of the Kirov Oblast, and minor areas in the north of Yaroslavl and Kostroma Oblasts. The cities of Arkhangelsk and Vologda, as well as many smaller towns, many of those of significant historical importance such as Veliky Ustyug, Totma, Solvychegodsk, and Kholmogory, are located in the river basin of the Northern Dvina. The Northern Dvina basin is roughly T-shaped. The -long Sukhona River flows east and joins the basin of the west-flowing Vychegda ( long). The combined river flows northwest into the White Sea, which it joins near the city of Arkhangelsk. Looking more closely, the Sukhona flows east and meets the north-flowing Yug River at Veliky Ustyug. The combined stream, now called the Northern Dvina, flows north about 60 km and receives the west-flowing Vychegda at Kotlas and then turns northwest to flow into the White Sea. The Sukhona-Vychegda was an important east‚Äìwest transportation route while the Northern Dvina-Yug was a north‚Äìsouth route. The upper Sukhona is now connected by the Northern Dvina Canal to the Volga‚ÄìBaltic Waterway, which links Petersburg to Moscow. River course The Sukhona flows east, eventually north-east, joins the north-flowing Yug at Veliky Ustyug and acquires the name 'Northern Dvina'. The P157 highway connects Kostroma with Kotlas via Nikolsk and Veliky Ustyug. North of Veliky Ustyg, the highway runs on the left bank of the Northern Dvina. The river flows about north crossing from the Vologda Oblast into the Arkhangelsk Oblast, where in the city of Kotlas it receives the west-flowing Vychegda River which rises in the northern Ural Mountains. Since at the confluence the length of the Vychegda is greater than that of the Northern Dvina, the river between the source and the confluence with the Vychegda is sometimes known as the Lesser Northern Dvina (). Shortly downstream from the confluence, the Northern Dvina is crossed by the railway connecting Konosha with Kotlas and Vorkuta. The Northern Dvina turns northwest and receives a number of smaller rivers such as the Uftyuga and the Nizhnyaya Toyma, both from the northeast. Near the urban settlement of Bereznik, the Vaga comes in from the south. At this point, the M8 highway which runs from Moscow through Vologda to Arkhangelsk, also enters the region. The Yomtsa or Yemtsa joins from the southeast, with the P1 highway (from Kargopol) running parallel. The Pinega, formerly an important river route, joins from the east. Near the mouth of the Pinega, the river splits into several channels, among which is the ancient selo of Kholmogory southeast of Arkhangelsk. The branches rejoin and pass the modern logging town of Novodvinsk. Downstream from Novodvinsk, the delta begins. In the upstream part of the delta, the great port of Arkhangelsk is located. It gradually replaced Kholmogory as the chief city of the region. On the southwest side of the delta is the naval base of Severodvinsk, the second-largest city in the region. The delta ends in the Dvina Bay of the White Sea. The river flows through Velikoustyugsky District of the Vologda Oblast and through Kotlassky, Krasnsoborky, Verkhnetoyemsky, Vinogradovsky, Kholmogorsky, and Primorsky districts of the Arkhangelsk Oblast. All administrative centers of these districts are located at the banks of the Northern Dvina, as they developed when the river was the major transportation route of the region.  Navigation and canals  View from Arkhangelsk, Russia In summer the entire length of the river is navigable and is heavily used for timber rafting. The Northern Dvina Canal connects it with the Volga‚ÄìBaltic Waterway. In the 19th century, a short-lived Northern Ekaterininsky Canal, now abandoned, connected the Northern Dvina basin with the Kama basin as well. In 1926‚Äì28 a canal connecting the Pinega, one of the major tributaries of the Northern Dvina, with the Kuloy, was constructed, however, currently the canal is pretty much neglected. Heavy commercial passenger navigation has largely disappeared and only local passenger lines remain. The passenger line connecting Kotlas and Arkhangelsk has been out of operation since 2005.  History  The Northern Dvina at the city of Kotlas. The picture is taken from the railway bridge; in front, there is the highway bridge The area was originally populated by Finno- Ugric peoples and then colonized by the Novgorod Republic. The only exception was Veliky Ustyug, which was part of Vladimir-Suzdal Principality. The rest of the Northern Dvina basin was controlled by Novgorod. Veliky Ustyug has been first mentioned in the chronicles in 1207, Shenkursk ‚Äî in 1229, Solvychegodsk was founded in the 14th century. In the 13th century the Novgorod merchants already reached the White Sea. The area was initially attractive because of fur trading. The main waterway from Novgorod into the Northern Dvina was along the Volga and its tributary, the Sheksna, along the Slavyanka River into Lake Nikolskoye, then the boats were taken by land to Lake Blagoveshchenskoye, from there downstream along the Porozovitsa River into Lake Kubenskoye and further to the Sukhona and the Northern Dvina. From the Northern Dvina, there were a number of ways into the basin of the Mezen (from where the merchants could get to the basin of the Pechora and the Ob). One was upstream the Vychegda and the Yarenga, and by land into the Vashka. Another one was upstream the Vychegda, the Vym, the Yelva, then by land to the Irva and to the Mezen. Two further options included going upstream the Pinega and then by land to the Kuloy and to the Mezen, or using the Pukshenga and the Pokshenga to get to the Pinega, and then from the Yozhuga taking boats by land to the Zyryanskaya Yezhuga and the Vashka. From the Vychegda, the merchants also could get directly to the river basin of the Pechora via either the Cherya and the Izhma, or the Mylva. From the 14th century, Kholmogory was the main trading harbor on the Northern Dvina, but in the 17th century it lost this distinction to Arkhangelsk (even though the seat of the Kholmogory and Vaga Eparchy, from 1732 known as Kholmogory and Archangelogorod Eparchy, which had jurisdiction over all Northern Russia including the Solovetsky Monastery, was located in Kholmogory until 1762. Until the 1700s, Arkhangelsk was the main trading harbour for the sea trade of Russia and western Europe, and the Northern Dvina was the main trading route connecting the central Russia with Arkhangelsk. Peter the Great drastically changed the situation, by founding Saint-Petersburg in 1703, thus opening the way for the Baltic Sea trade, and by constructing the highway between Saint-Petersburg and Arkhangelsk via Kargopol. The river quickly lost its role as the leading trading route, which was accelerated by the construction of the railway between Vologda and Arkhangelsk between 1894 and 1897. The Northern Dvina was scene of several battles during the Russian Civil War, many involving the Entente interventionist army as part of their North Russia Campaign. A special Northern Dvina Flotilla existed during the Civil War.

It is a business simulation game, presented in an isometric view in 2D with graphics by Simon Foster, in which the player acts as an entrepreneur in control of a transport company, and can compete against rival companies to make as much profit as possible by transporting passengers and various goods by road, rail, sea and air. Transport Tycoon Deluxe is an expanded and improved version of the original game, released in 1995. A version for Android and iOS was released on 3 October 2013 using assets from the sequel, Chris Sawyer's Locomotion. A fan-made game engine recreation OpenTTD is also available. Gameplay To start building a transport empire, the player must construct transport routes, consisting of stations near industries or towns, and in the case of trains or road vehicles, near physical routes. One transport route can utilize several different forms of transport, e.g. truck‚Üíship‚Üítrain. The player's company and the individual stations each have ratings that depend largely on their efficiency at moving goods from one stations to the other. A station with high ratings may attract more goods. The game begins in 1930, and ends in 2030. The player starts out by borrowing money to finance construction of transport facilities, and is charged interest until the loan is repaid. As the user plays the game and earns revenues, they have the choice of expanding service along existing routes, or expanding their transportation network. The game features a progression of technology: in any particular year of the game generally only contemporary types of technology are available. For example, railroad signals which allow more than one train to use a section of track are initially semaphores. Later, they are replaced by red and green traffic-light signals. Similarly, in the beginning there are only steam engines, but later diesel and electric engines are introduced. In the game year 1999, monorails become available. These require a separate track system from railroads. If the player remains in business until 2030, the game announces that they have won, allows them to post their name on the \\"hall of fame\\" and then continues. At this point, the year stays 2030 and never goes any higher, although the game can continue indefinitely. Playing the entire 100-year campaign takes about 40 hours. The game allows the player to save at any time, and multiple saves of a particular game at any point are possible. Vehicles in the game must be constructed at corresponding depots, which must be connected to the road or rail networks. Towns and cities have their own road networks, but extra roads may be needed to connect them to other towns, or to various resources. Chart illustrating flow of commodities between industries and towns in Transport Tycoon, and Temperate scenarios in Transport Tycoon Deluxe. The player earns revenue by picking up resources or passengers at a certain station, and delivering them to another station where there is a demand for them. Demand is determined by the area which surrounds the station; for example stations close to towns will demand passengers. The revenues will depend on the delivery time, distance, and quantity delivered. The influence of these factors on revenue varies according to the type of goods being delivered. For example, mail will rapidly fall in value, meaning that it can only be delivered profitably over short distances, or over long distances very fast. On the other hand, coal loses value very slowly, so it can be transported in bulk over long distances whilst remaining profitable. At times, subsidies are offered to the first company to move a particular resource from one place to another. This encourages the player to create a larger more complex transport network, rather than focusing on previously profitable routes. The game features a system of Local Authority. Each city has a rating for every transport company based on the impact of their transport network. When the rating falls too low, the player will no longer be able to demolish buildings or construct new stations. The rating depends on, among others, the level of service and the deforestation caused by the company. In the course of a game cities develop and expand according to various economic factors, and new industries (demand) or other resource sites (supply) may appear. Some natural resources may also eventually be exhausted and industries without adequate transport service may shut down. Also, new models of vehicles are introduced and eventually come to replace older models. At introduction such a new model will likely have improved characteristics, but may suffer from reliability issues.  Music  The music in Transport Tycoon are original compositions by John Broomhall. It features old-style blues and jazz tunes including parts of Herbie Hancock's Cantaloupe Island. Reception A reviewer for Next Generation gave the DOS version four out of five stars, commenting, \\"The best economic sim since Civilization, Microprose's new Transport Tycoon has all the features of Sid Meier's Railroad Tycoon mixed with the look and ease of Maxis' SimCity 2000 and a host of new features ... that give the game a feel that is all its own.\\" He further lauded the game for its graphics, \\"pleasant\\" music, sound effects, addictive play, and realistic simulation of the growth of cities and towns. Next Generation reviewed the Transport Tycoon Scenario, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \\"A solid upgrade for a great game.\\" Related titles A \\"World Editor\\" expansion pack was also released for the original Transport Tycoon, but was overshadowed by the Deluxe version released shortly afterward. It featured an alternative, Martian set of graphics, which did not appear in TTD. Transport Tycoon Deluxe Transport Tycoon Deluxe is an expanded and improved version of the original game. The primary difference between the games is how signals operate. The original Transport Tycoon allows only bi-directional signals, which allow trains to pass in either direction. The deluxe version introduced uni-directional signals, that only allow a train to pass in a single direction. The change in gameplay from this alteration to signals is significant, as the old bi- directional signals would allow a train to travel in both directions. This is similar in concept to having a single lane street that would allow traffic from either end. Unsurprisingly, it was possible for two trains to try to travel in opposing directions towards each other on the same run of track. While this would not result in crashes on a properly signaled route, it required either the building of extra track to allow the trains to pass each other, or the building of a great many tracks in parallel to avoid the problem in the first place. The new uni-directional signals allowed one-way tracks to be built, which gives the player much greater control over how the railway network could be run. This allowed for efficient routes to be built, and prevented trains from trying to travel the \\"wrong way\\" down a section of track. By incorporating both uni-directional and bi-directional signals, effective switching yards, junctions, and other useful designs could be built. It also unlocked the ability to build continental-length railroad systems by incorporating one-way rails in both directions and the ability to merge other rails with the main one. This is a highly used strategy because it allows for intercontinental transport of goods which results in high return rates for the player. The deluxe version also expanded the game to provide tropical, Arctic, and toy-town environments, as well as the classic temperate environment. The new environments came with different industries and challenges. For example, towns in the Arctic environment would not grow without regular deliveries of food, and those in the tropical environment also need access to fresh water. The main game runs over the course of a century, from 1950 to 2050. Due to trademark issues with using names of real vehicles in the original Transport Tycoon, the default names were replaced with fictional ones in Transport Tycoon Deluxe. Players however are allowed to rename their vehicles and stations as they please, which can be useful for identifying individual services in a network. Players are also able to rename towns, which provides for a more personalized game play.  Chris Sawyer's Locomotion  After the success of Transport Tycoon Deluxe, Chris Sawyer turned his attention towards a sequel, but during development he changed his mind and produced RollerCoaster Tycoon, which turned out to be a runaway hit. After RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 was done, work on the third version was left to another development team, and Sawyer returned to work on a Transport Tycoon sequel, Chris Sawyer's Locomotion. It was released in September 2004 and was described by Sawyer as the \\"spiritual successor to Transport Tycoon\\". It received poor reviews and was deemed a commercial failure on release, but sales through the digital rereleases are unknown. Regardless, there is an active Locomotion community that continues to produce modifications. iOS and Android version On 15 July 2013, Sawyer's 31X Ltd and Origin8 Technologies announced that they were working on a mobile version of Transport Tycoon. Sawyer was originally focusing on funding for the game, but ended up overseeing the design and helped with the debugging.Chris Sawyer on his reentry back into video games The game was released for iOS and Android on 3 October 2013.'Transport Tycoon' Releasing on iOS and Android October 3rd by Jared Nelson (013-09-19) The game is single player and uses graphics from Chris Sawyer's Locomotion.

It was created in 1647 for Sir John Hamilton, 2nd Baronet, with remainder to his heirs male. History This branch of the prominent Hamilton family descends from John Hamilton (d. c. 1550), the illegitimate son of James Hamilton, 1st Lord Hamilton, by Janet Calderwood, and half-brother of James Hamilton, 1st Earl of Arran (from whom the Dukes of Hamilton descend; for earlier history of the Hamilton family see this title). In 1512 John's birth was legitimized. His grandson, James Hamilton, notably served as Sheriff of Perthshire. In 1634 he was created a baronet, of Broomhill, in the Baronetage of Nova Scotia. He was succeeded by his son, the aforementioned second Baronet, who was elevated to the peerage in 1647. The following year he was a member of the Scottish army in England that attempted to rescue King Charles I, and fought at the Battle of Preston. As Lord Belhaven and Stenton had no male heirs, he surrendered the lordship to the Crown in 1675 and received a new patent with remainder to his kinsman John Hamilton of Pressmannan, the husband of his granddaughter Margaret, and in failure of that line to his heirs whatsoever. On his death in 1679 the baronetcy became extinct while he was succeeded in the lordship according to the new patent by John Hamilton of Pressmannan, the second Lord. He was the great-great-great-grandson of John Hamilton, brother of Claud Hamilton, grandfather of the first Lord. On his death the title passed to his son, the third Lord. He sat in the House of Lords as a Scottish Representative Peer from 1715 to 1721. The latter year he was appointed Governor of Barbados but drowned on the journey out. By Anne, daughter of Andrew Bruce, Merchant of Edinburgh he had four sons (1st. John, 2nd. Andrew, 3rd. James, 4th, Robert and a daughter Margaret). His eldest son John Hamilton succeeded to his father's title, becoming 4th Baron Belhaven and Stenton, and died unmarried on 28 August 1764. His next brother Andrew having died unmarried in 1736, the title was inherited by the 3rd son James Hamilton, who became 5th Baron of Belhaven and Stenton. On James's death in 1777, the line of the second Lord failed since Robert Hamilton, the youngest of the 3rd Baron's sons, had died in 1743. There now arose controversy as to the succession of the title. In 1777 it was incorrectly assumed by Captain William Hamilton, the great-great- great-great-grandson of John Hamilton of Coltness, younger son of John Hamilton of Udston, whose other son James Hamilton was the grandfather of the second Lord, and whose grandfather John Hamilton was the brother of the aforementioned Claude Hamilton, grandfather of the first Lord Belhaven and Stenton. William voted at the Election of Scottish Peers in 1790. However, it was resolved by the Committee for Privileges of the House of Lords in 1793 that this vote was not valid. The title was instead determined in favour of William Hamilton, the seventh Lord. He was the son of Robert Hamilton of Wishaw (who was adjudged de jure sixth Lord), grandson of Robert Hamilton, \\"Younger of Wishaw\\", son of Robert Hamilton, 3rd of Wishaw, son of William Hamilton, 1st of Wishaw, son of John Hamilton of Udston, grandson of John Hamilton, brother of the aforesaid Claude Hamilton, grandfather of the first Lord. The seventh Lord was succeeded by his son, the eighth Lord. He was a Scottish Representative Peer from 1819 to 1831 and also served as Lord Lieutenant of Lanarkshire. In 1831 he was created Baron Hamilton of Wishaw, in the County of Lanark, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, which gave him an automatic seat in the House of Lords. However, this title became extinct on his death in 1868 while the lordship became dormant. In 1875, the House of Lords decided that the rightful successor was James Hamilton, the ninth Lord. He was the son of Archibald Hamilton, grandson of James Hamilton, younger son of the aforesaid Robert Hamilton, Younger of Wishaw. Lord Belhaven and Stenton notably served as Lord-Lieutenant of Lanarkshire. He had seven daughters but no sons and on his death the title was claimed by his kinsman Alexander Charles Hamilton, the tenth Lord. He was the son of William John Hamilton (Member of Parliament for Newport, Isle of Wight), son of William Richard Hamilton (Permanent Under-Secretary at the Foreign Office), son of the Venerable Anthony Hamilton (Archdeacon of Colchester), son of Alexander Hamilton, younger son of the aforementioned William Hamilton, 3rd of Wishaw. In 1894 his claim was admitted by the House of Lords. He later served as a Scottish Representative Peer from 1900 to 1920. He was succeeded by his nephew, the eleventh Lord. He was an officer in the Indian Army and also sat in the House of Lords as a Scottish Representative Peer between 1922 and 1945. In 1934 he assumed the additional surname of Udny. However, none of the subsequent Lords have held this surname. the title is held by his grandson, the thirteenth Lord, who succeeded his father in 1961. Coat of arms The heraldic blazon for the coat of arms of the lordship is: Quarterly: 1st and 4th, gules, a mullet argent between three cinquefoils ermine (for Hamilton of Udston); 2nd and 3rd, gules, a man's heart proper shadowed or between three cinquefoils ermine (for Hamilton of Raploch); all within a bordure argent.

It was created in 1445 for Sir Lawrence Abernethy. The title remained in the Abernethy family until the death in 1669 of his descendant the tenth Lady Saltoun. She was succeeded by her cousin Alexander Fraser, the eleventh Lord. He was the son of Alexander Fraser and Margaret Abernethy, daughter of the seventh Lord Saltoun. The title has remained in the Frasers of Philorth family ever since. The seventeenth Lord was a Lieutenant-General in the Army and sat in the House of Lords as a Scottish Representative Peer from 1807 to 1853. His nephew, the eighteenth Lord, was a Scottish Representative Peer from 1859 to 1866. His son, the nineteenth Lord, and grandson, the twentieth Lord, were also Scottish Representative Peers, between 1890 and 1933 and 1935 and 1963, respectively. Since 1979, the title has been held by the latter's daughter, the 21st Lady Saltoun.

Although all bowlers must bat and quite a few batsmen do bowl occasionally, most players are skilled in only one of the two disciplines and are considered specialists. Some wicket-keepers have the skills of a specialist batsman and have been referred to as all-rounders, but the term wicketkeeper-batsman is more commonly applied to them,https://www.sportskeeda.com/cricket/ms-dhoni-best-all-rounder-praise- kohli even if they are substitute wicketkeepers who also bowl. Definition There is no precise qualification for a player to be considered an all-rounder and use of the term tends to be subjective. The generally accepted criterion is that a \\"genuine all-rounder\\" is someone whose batting or bowling skills, considered alone, would be good enough to win him/her a place in the team. Another definition of a \\"genuine all-rounder\\" is a player who can through both batting and bowling (though not necessarily both in the same match), consistently \\"win matches for the team\\" (i.e., propel his/her team to victory by an outstanding individual performance). By either definition, a genuine all-rounder is quite rare and extremely valuable to a team, effectively operating as two players. Confusion sometimes arises when a specialist bowler performs well with the bat. For example, West Indies pace bowler Malcolm Marshall achieved ten scores of 50 or above in 107 Test innings between 1978 and 1991, but had a batting average of less than 19. He would be termed a \\"useful lower-order batsman\\", or indeed \\"a bowler who bats a bit\\". Equally, a specialist batsman/woman may be termed a \\"useful change bowler\\" and a good example of this is Australian Allan Border, who in a Test match against the West Indies in Sydney in January 1989 took 11 wickets for 96 runs (7/46 in the first innings and 4/50 in the second) as the conditions suited his occasionally used left-arm spin.http://www.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63499.html One of the main constraints to becoming a recognised all-rounder is that batsmen/women and bowlers \\"peak\\" at different ages. Batsmen/women tend to reach their peak in their late twenties after their technique has matured through experience. Conversely, fast bowlers often peak in their early to mid twenties at the height of their physical prowess. Other bowlers, mostly spinners but also fast bowlers who can \\"swing\\" the ball, are most effective in their later careers. In 2013, Ali Bacher used statistical analysis to argue that there had only been 42 genuine all-rounders in the history of Test cricket. He rated Garry Sobers as the best, followed by Jacques Kallis.Celebrating South Africa's two- in-ones, Firdose Moonda, ESPNcricinfo, 10 September 2013 Categorisation by use of statistics One commonly used statistical rule of thumb is that a player's batting average (the higher the better) should be greater than his/her bowling average (the lower the better). In Test cricket, only two players i.e., Garfield Sobers and Jacques Kallis, have batting averages that are 20 greater than their bowling averages over their entire careers. However, some other players have achieved such a differential over significant parts of their careers, such as Imran Khan. Wally Hammond and Doug Walters managed differences of 20.7 and 19.2, respectively, between their batting and bowling averages, however, they were generally regarded as occasional bowlers who could break partnerships rather than genuine all-rounders. In overall first- class cricket, there are several players with significantly higher batting averages. Statistically, few can challenge Frank Woolley who had a batting average of 40.77 and a bowling average of 19.87. Woolley took over 2000 wickets in his career, scored more runs than anyone except Jack Hobbs and is the only non-wicketkeeper to have taken more than 1000 catches.CricInfo ‚Äì career batting recordsCricInfo ‚Äì career bowling recordsCricInfo ‚Äì career fielding records Many all-rounders are better at bowling than batting or vice versa. Very few are equally good at both and hardly any have been outstanding at both. Thus the terms \\"bowling all-rounder\\" and \\"batting all-rounder\\" have come into use. For example, Richard Hadlee had an excellent bowling average of 22.29 in Tests and a passable (yet unspectacular) batting average of 27.16, leading him to be termed a \\"bowling all-rounder\\". Meanwhile, a player like Jacques Kallis (batting average of 55.37 and bowling average of 32.65 in Tests) is known as a \\"batting all- rounder\\".http://www.dnaindia.com/sport/1875797/report-imran-khan-greatest-all- rounder-of-my-era-sir-richard-hadlee Also, batting all-rounders may not bowl much due to injury concerns (e.g. Corey Anderson, Angelo Mathews), or their batting skills are far better than their bowling to begin with (e.g. Kane Williamson, Steve Smith) to the point they revert to being known as a batsman. Notable all-round feats * V. E. Walker of Middlesex, playing for All- England versus Surrey at The Oval on 21, 22 & 23 July 1859, took all ten wickets in the Surrey first innings and followed this by scoring 108 in the England second innings, having been the not out batsman in the first (20*). He took a further four wickets in Surrey's second innings. All-England won by 392 runs. * On 15 August 1862, E. M. Grace carried his bat through the entire MCC innings, scoring 192 not out of a total of 344. Then, bowling underarm, he took all 10 wickets in the Kent first innings for 69 runs. However, this is not an official record as it was a 12-a-side game (though one of the Kent batsmen was injured). * The first player to perform the double of 1000 runs and 100 wickets in an English season was W. G. Grace in 1873. He scored 2139 runs at 71.30 and took 106 wickets at 12.94. Grace completed eight doubles to 1886 and it was not until 1882 that another player (C. T. Studd) accomplished the feat.Webber, p.180. * In the 1906 English cricket season, George Herbert Hirst achieved the unique feat of scoring over 2000 runs and taking over 200 wickets. He scored 2385 runs including six centuries at 45.86 with a highest score of 169.CricketArchive He took 208 wickets at 16.50 with a best analysis of 7/18.CricketArchive In the same season, Hirst achieved another unique feat when he scored a century in both innings and took five wickets in both innings of the same match. Playing for Yorkshire versus Somerset at Bath, Hirst scored 111 and 117 not out, and took 6/70 and 5/45.Webber, p.184.CricketArchive ‚Äì match scorecard. Retrieved 26 November 2008. * George Giffen (1886, 1893 and 1896) and Warwick Armstrong (1905, 1909 and 1921) achieved the double in an English season three times, the most by members of touring teams.Webber, p.180-181. * Alan Davidson was the first player to take ten wickets and score one hundred runs in a Test match. Playing for Australia against West Indies at Brisbane in 1960‚Äì61, he took 5/135 and 6/87, and scored 44 and 80 in what became the first Tied Test. He was playing throughout with a broken finger. * Twenty-three players, on a total of 32 occasions, have taken five wickets in an innings and scored a century in the same Test match. Ian Botham achieved this feat five times, while Jacques Kallis, Garfield Sobers, Mushtaq Mohammed, Shakib Al Hasan and Ravichandran Ashwin have all done so twice. * Ian Botham, Imran Khan and Shakib Al Hasan are only three players who have achieved the feat of scoring a century and take 10 wickets in a Test match. * In 2013, Bangladesh's Sohag Gazi became the first, and so far only, player to score a century and take hat-trick in same Test match. *Kapil Dev is the only player to score 5000 runs and take 400 wickets in Test cricket. He is also the youngest player to score 1000 runs and reach the 100, 200 and 300 wicket mark in Test cricket. * Viv Richards, Paul Collingwood and Rohan Mustafa are the only players to have taken a 5-wicket haul and scored a hundred in the same One-Day International. Fourteen more players have taken a 5-wicket haul and scored a half century in the same game. Shahid Afridi is the only player to achieve this feat thrice in his career and Yuvraj Singh & Shakib Al Hasan the only cricketers to do so in a World Cup match. * Jacques Kallis, Shahid Afridi and Shakib Al Hasan are only three all-rounders in the history of international cricket to reach 10,000 runs and take 500 wickets across all three formats. * In 2015, Shakib Al Hasan of Bangladesh became the first, and so far only, cricketer in history to be ranked the No.1 all-rounder by ICC in its Player Rankings in all three formats of the game (Test, ODI and Twenty20).

Her writing career has been distinguished by family saga-type novels which describe the lives of related characters for long periods of time. Her later books have also become known for their religious and philosophical themes. Early life Born Susan Elizabeth Sturt in Leatherhead, Surrey, England, she was the daughter of a stockbroker, and went to school at Sutton High School. An only child whose father was killed during the Second World War, she has described her childhood as a happy one. She obtained a degree in law from King's College London in 1961. In 1964, she emigrated to the United States, where she worked as a secretary in New York City. She married Joseph Howatch (1935‚Äì2011),Social Security Death Index a sculptor and writer, that year and began her career as a writer, finding success almost immediately with her intricately detailed gothic novels. A daughter was born to the couple in 1971. Upon separating from her husband in 1975, Howatch returned to the UK, then moved to the Republic of Ireland in 1976 before returning to the UK permanently in 1980.The International Who's Who of Women, 3rd edition. London: Europa Publications, 2002. After her latter return to England, Howatch found herself \\"rich, successful, and living exactly where I wanted to live,\\" but feeling a spiritual emptiness which she ascribed to \\"trying to hold my divided self together\\" and questioning her life and what she should do with it. She had settled in Salisbury out of love for the beauty of the town, but found herself increasingly drawn to Salisbury Cathedral; eventually she began to study Anglican Christianity in earnest. (Quotations from contemporary Anglican writers, such as Glyn Simon, Bishop of Llandaff (1958‚Äì1970), often appear as chapter headings). She experienced a spiritual epiphany, and concluded that she should continue to write novels, but to \\"set forth my discoveries in the light of faith, no matter how feeble and inadequate my beginner's faith was.\\"Myers, Doris T. \\"Forgiven Sinners: Susan Howatch's Church Novels\\". Anglican Theological Review, Winter 1998. This personal turning point culminated in Howatch's most successful and popular works, the Starbridge series. Earlier novels and sagas Her first novel was The Dark Shore (1965). She published several other \\"gothic\\" novels before she published the first of her family sagas Penmarric (1971), which details the fortunes and disputes of the Penmar family in Cornwall during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. An important theme of the story is how the mansion of Penmarric becomes controlled by various branches of the family. The family fortune was made in the Cornish tin mining industry, which is discussed throughout each one of the six parts, each with a different character as narrator. As is made clear by the chapter headings, the fortunes of the family closely parallel the Plantagenet family, including Henry II of England and Eleanor of Aquitaine, with the mansion representing the throne. It was adapted into a tv-series with the same name in 1979. Howatch wrote the novel at her kitchen table in New Jersey. Publisher Michael Korda wrote, \\"It is a frequently stated basic belief of book publishing that somewhere in the country at any given moment some unknown woman is writing a major best-seller (usually referred to as 'the next Gone with the Wind') at her kitchen table while looking after her baby, but this was the first time I had experienced the phenomenom in real life. Susan Howatch had written her massive novel with one hand on the cradle and the other doing the typing, but, like most authors who succeed, she had never doubted that her book would be a bestseller.\\" Korda asserted that, while reading the drafts, he noticed similarities to the Plantagenets and asked Howatch if that was the case. She replied that Shakespeare had borrowed most of his plots from other sources and asked Korda if he thought anyone would notice, he said. Howatch followed a similar theme in her vast saga, The Wheel of Fortune, where the story of the Godwin family of Oxmoon in Gower, South Wales, is in fact a re-creation in a modern form of the story of the Plantagenet family of Edward III of England, the modern characters being created from those of his eldest son Edward of Woodstock (The Black Prince) and his wife Joan of Kent, John of Gaunt and his mistress, later wife, Katherine Swynford, Richard II (son of Edward of Woodstock), Henry IV (son of John of Gaunt) and Henry IV's eldest son King Henry V. Again the mansion represents the throne. She also wrote three other family sagas, Cashelmara, which focuses on the family of Edward I (Edward de Salis), his son, Edward II (Patrick de Salis) and others; and The Rich Are Different followed by its sequel, The Sins of the Fathers, both of which combine to tell the story, in America' s financial industry, of Julius Caesar, Cleopatra, Mark Antony, and Octavian. The Starbridge series This series of six books sets out to describe the history of the Church of England through the twentieth century. Each of the six books is self-contained, and each is narrated by a different character. However, the main protagonist of each book also appears in the other books, allowing the author to present the same incidents from different viewpoints. The action of all six books centres around the fictional Anglican diocese of Starbridge, which is supposedly in the west of England, and also features the Fordite monks, a fictional Anglican monastic order. The cathedral and ecclesiastical hierarchy at Starbridge are based on the real-life Salisbury. The first three books of the series (Glittering Images, Glamorous Powers, Ultimate Prizes) begin in the 1930s, and continue through the Second World War II. The second three (Scandalous Risks, Mystical Paths, Absolute Truths) take place in the 1960s. Glittering Images is narrated by the Reverend Dr. Charles Ashworth, a Cambridge academic who undergoes something of a spiritual and nervous breakdown after being sent by the Archbishop of Canterbury to secretly investigate possible sexual transgressions in the household of the Bishop of Starbridge. Ashworth is helped to recover, and to realize the source of his problems, by Father Jonathan Darrow, the widowed abbot of Grantchester Abbey of the Fordite Monks. Glamorous Powers follows the story of Jonathan Darrow himself as he leaves the Fordite Order at age sixty following a powerful vision. He then must deal with the problems of his adult children, address the question of a new intimate relationship, and search for a new ministry. His particular crisis surrounds the use and misuse of his charismatic powers of healing, and his unsettling mystical visions, or \\"showings\\". Ultimate Prizes takes place during World War II. It is narrated by Neville Aysgarth, a young and ambitious Archdeacon of Starbridge from a lower- middle-class background in the north of England. After being widowed and marrying again, he too undergoes something of a breakdown but is rescued by Jonathan Darrow. Scandalous Risks follows Aysgarth to a Canonry of Westminster Abbey and back to Starbridge, where he becomes Dean of the Cathedral and Ashworth becomes Bishop. It is narrated by Venetia Flaxton, a young aristocrat who risks great scandal by beginning a relationship with the married Aysgarth, her father's best friend. The relationships, and Aysgarth's family, closely echo the relationship of H. H. Asquith and Venetia Stanley. Mystical Paths follows Nicholas Darrow, son of Jonathan, as he narrowly avoids going off the rails prior to his ordination while investigating the mysterious disappearance of Christian Aysgarth, eldest son of Dean Aysgarth. Absolute Truths comes full circle and is narrated by a much older but still troubled Charles Ashworth, thirty one years after we originally encountered him in the first of the books.  The St. Benet's trilogy  The St. Benet's trilogy takes place in the London of the 1980s and 1990s. Again, it illustrates the changes which took place in the Anglican Church in those years and brings back many of the characters in the Starbridge series. However, while the Church is still at the heart of the books, there is an increased emphasis on characters who are not members of the clergy. Like the six preceding books, each in the trilogy is written in the first person by a different narrator. A Question of Integrity (given the title The Wonder Worker in the United States), picks up the story of Nicholas Darrow twenty years after the last of the Starbridge novels. Nick is now rector of a church in the City of London, where he runs a centre for the ministry of healing. His own life is greatly affected by events taking place at the centre, especially after he meets Alice Fletcher, an insecure new worker there, and is forced to reassess his beliefs and commitments as a result. The High Flyer narrates the story of a City lawyer, Carter Graham, who \\"has it all\\". Her outwardly successful life, complete with highly compensated career and suitable marriage, undergoes profound changes after harrowing events smacking of the occult begin to occur, which reveal that things are not what they seem. Finally, The Heartbreaker follows the life of Gavin Blake, a charismatic prostitute specializing in powerful, influential male clients, who finds himself at the centre of a criminal empire and must fight to save his life. Meanwhile, both Graham and Darrow must deal with their own weaknesses in trying to help Gavin. Later life According to her publisher Michael Korda, Howatch was never comfortable with publishing popular fiction and that it didn't satisfy her intellectual and moral needs. He cites this as a reason for her shift away from popular fiction to more serious fiction. For Korda, she became the only best-selling novelist to walk away from her own success or to leave her publisher because \\"he had sold too many copies of her books.\\" Howatch has used some of the profits from her novels to found an academic post with the title 'Starbridge Lecturer in Natural Science and Theology' in the Faculty of Divinity at Cambridge University, devoted to linking the fields of science and religion. The first holder of this post was the Reverend Dr. Fraser Watts, a psychologist and theologian. Dr. Watts was succeeded in 2014 by the Revd Dr. Andrew Davison, who previously taught at Westcott House, Cambridge.http://www.divinity.cam.ac.uk/directory/dr-andrew-davison Howatch is an Honorary Fellow of King's College, London,Fellows of King's the University of Wales at Lampeter, and Sarum College in Salisbury.Graduation in Sarum In 2012, Howatch was awarded an honorary Doctor of Letters degree from Hope College.Hope College Presents Honorary Degree to Author Susan Howatch She currently resides in Leatherhead.Idem.

In the Parliament of 1469 held at Edinburgh by King James III of Scotland Lord Borthwick was ranked after the Lord Halyburton (cr.1441Leeson, Francis L., A Directory of British Peerages, revised edition, London, 2002:74). In the parliament of 1471 he is the fourth Lord of Parliament ranked immediately after the Lord Glamis (cr.1445Leeson, 2002: 67).Nisbet, Alexander, A System of Heraldry, Edinburgh, 1722, facsimile edition 1984, vol.ii, Appendix, p.105 The chronology of the Lords Borthwick also presents problems as of the first seven, six were named William. Of the first Lord, Burke's (1999) merely states: \\"knighted before his father in 1430; one of the magnates who according to contemporary records habitually plundered the Customs. Married and left issue\\". Anderson states \\"the first Lord Borthwick died before 1458\\".Anderson, 1867, vol.ii:338 Arms as shown in Brown's Peerage of Scotland, 1834 His son, the second Lord (William Borthwick, 2nd Lord Borthwick), was an ambassador to England as well as Master of the Household to King James III. He was succeeded by his son, the third Lord (William Borthwick, 3rd Lord Borthwick), who some say was one of the many Scottish noblemen killed at the Battle of Flodden in 1513 although the Complete Peerage cited by Pine stated \\"this is was unlikely\\".Pine, L.G., FSA Scot., &c.;, The New Extinct Peerage 1884-1971, London, 1972:32, His son, the fourth Lord (William Borthwick, 4th Lord Borthwick), became guardian to the infant King James V. The ninth Lord, was a Royalist during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms. However, on his death in 1675 the male line of the third Lord failed. The Borthwick estates passed to his nephew John Dundas, son of his sister Margaret Borthwick, while the lordship became dormant. It was to remain dormant for the next 87 years. The right to the title, however, passed to the late Lord's kinsman and male heir William Borthwick, the de jure tenth Lord. He was the son of William Borthwick, 5th of Soltray (Soutra) and Johnstonburn, elder son of William Borthwick, 4th of Soltray and Johnstonburn, great- grandson of William Borthwick, 1st of Soltray, son of the Hon. Alexander Borthwick, third son of the second Lord Borthwick. He never assumed the title. His son, the de jure eleventh Lord, was a colonel in the army and was killed at the Battle of Ramillies in 1706. On his death the right to the lordship passed to his cousin Henry Borthwick, the de jure twelfth Lord. He was the grandson of Alexander Borthwick, younger son of the aforementioned William Borthwick, 4th of Soltray and Johnstonburn. Henry was a captain in the Scottish army and like his cousin fought at the Battle of Ramillies. He died from wounds received in action four days after the battle (and four days after his cousin). On his death the right to the lordship passed to his elder son William, de jure thirteenth Lord, and then to his younger brother Henry. The latter's claim to the title was admitted by the House of Lords in 1762, and he became the fourteenth Lord Borthwick. However, on his death in 1772 the peerage became dormant again. The claim now passed to the late Lord's kinsman and male heir Patrick Borthwick, the de jure fifteenth Lord. He was the great- grandson of Alexander Borthwick, 1st of Reidhall and Sauchnell, younger son of William Borthwick, 3rd of Soltray and Johnstonburne, grandson of William Borthwick, 1st of Soltray, cited above. His son Archibald, the de jure sixteenth Lord, petitioned the House of Lords for the right to claim the title in 1808 but was unsuccessful. His son Patrick, de jure seventeenth Lord, was also unsuccessful when he tried to claim the title in 1816. However, his younger son Cunninghame had his claim to the lordship allowed by the House of Lords in 1870 and he became the nineteenth Lord Borthwick. From 1880 to 1885 he sat in the House of Lords as a Scottish Representative Peer. His son, the twentieth Lord, was a Scottish Representative Peer between 1906 and 1910. When he died in 1910 the peerage once again became dormant. The claim passed to his distant relative William Henry Borthwick, the de jure twenty-first Lord. He was a descendant of John Borthwick, 1st of Crookston, younger son of the first Lord. His grandson John Henry Stuart Borthwick had his claim to the title admitted by the Lord Lyon in 1986, and he became the twenty-third Lord Borthwick. this ancient title is held by his elder twin son, the twenty-fourth Lord Borthwick, who succeeded in 1996. He is Chief of Clan Borthwick and also holds the feudal titles of Baron of Heriotmuir and Laird of Crookston. The family seat is Borthwick Castle, near Borthwick, Midlothian but is leased as a venue for hire by the family.

It was created in 1739 for Brabazon Ponsonby, 2nd Viscount Duncannon, who had previously represented Newtownards and County Kildare in the Irish House of Commons. In 1749 he was given the additional title of Baron Ponsonby of Sysonby, in the County of Leicester, in the Peerage of Great Britain, which entitled him to a seat in the British House of Lords. The titles Viscount Duncannon, of the fort of Duncannon in the County of Wexford, and Baron Bessborough, of Bessborough, Piltown, in the County of Kilkenny, had been created in the Peerage of Ireland in 1723 and 1721 respectively for Lord Bessborough's father William Ponsonby, who had earlier represented County Kilkenny in the Irish House of Commons. The first Earl was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Earl. He was a Whig politician and served as a Lord of the Treasury, as a Lord of the Admiralty and as Joint Postmaster General. His son, the third Earl, represented Knaresborough in the House of Commons as a Whig and like his father served as a Lord of the Admiralty. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the fourth Earl. He was a prominent Whig politician and served as First Commissioner of Woods and Forests, as Home Secretary, as Lord Privy Seal and as First Lord of the Admiralty. In 1834, ten years before he succeeded his father, he was raised to the Peerage of the United Kingdom in his own right as Baron Duncannon, of Bessborough in County Kilkenny. His eldest son, the fifth Earl, was a Liberal politician and held office under Lord Russell and William Ewart Gladstone as Lord Steward of the Household. He was childless and was succeeded by his younger brother, the sixth Earl. He never married and on his death in 1906 the titles passed to his younger brother, the seventh Earl. He was a clergyman. His grandson, the ninth Earl, was a Conservative politician and also served as Governor General of Canada from 1931 to 1935. In 1937 he was created Earl of Bessborough in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. His son, the tenth Earl, sat on the Conservative benches in the House of Lords and served as Joint Under- Secretary of State for Education in 1964 and as Minister of State at the Ministry of Technology in 1970. He was later a member of the European Parliament. Lord Bessborough had one daughter but no sons and on his death in 1993 the earldom of Bessborough created in 1937 became extinct. He was succeeded in the other titles by his first cousin, the eleventh Earl. He was the son of Major the Hon. Cyril Myles Brabazon Ponsonby, second son of the eighth Earl. the titles are held by his son, the twelfth Earl, who succeeded in 2002. Bessborough House (1818) (by John Preston Neale) Several other members of the family have gained distinction. The Hon. John Ponsonby, second son of the first Earl, served as Speaker of the Irish House of Commons and was the father of William Ponsonby, 1st Baron Ponsonby, and George Ponsonby, Lord Chancellor of Ireland. Major- General the Hon. Sir Frederick Cavendish Ponsonby, second son of the third Earl, was the father of General Sir Henry Frederick Ponsonby, who was the father of Frederick Ponsonby, 1st Baron Sysonby, and Arthur Ponsonby, 1st Baron Ponsonby of Shulbrede. The Hon. William Ponsonby, third son of the third Earl, was created Baron de Mauley in 1838 while Lady Caroline Ponsonby, only daughter of the third Earl, was the wife of Prime Minister William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne, but is perhaps best remembered for her affair with Lord Byron. Sir Spencer Ponsonby-Fane, sixth son of the fourth Earl, was for many years Comptroller of the Lord Chamberlain's Department and was admitted to the Privy Council in 1901. The present family seat is Stansted Park, near Stoughton, West Sussex, acquired by the 9th Earl in 1924. Previous family seats include Bishopscourt House near Bishopscourt, County Kildare, and Parkstead House in Roehampton, London. The family's former main seat in Ireland was Bessborough House, built in the 1740s for the 1st Earl. Located near the village of Piltown in the south of County Kilkenny, the house was sold by the 9th Earl in the late 1930s. Bessborough House is now part of Kildalton Agricultural College. Coat of arms The heraldic blazon for the coat of arms of the earldom is: Gules, a chevron between three combs argent. This can be translated as: a red shield with three white hair combs.

It is among the world's oldest and best-known general medical journals. The journal was founded in 1823 by Thomas Wakley, an English surgeon who named it after the surgical instrument called a lancet (scalpel), as well as after the architectural term lancet window, a window with a sharp pointed arch, to indicate the \\"light of wisdom\\" or \\"to let in light\\". The journal publishes original research articles, review articles (\\"seminars\\" and \\"reviews\\"), editorials, book reviews, correspondence, as well as news features and case reports. The Lancet has been owned by Elsevier since 1991, and its editor-in- chief since 1995 is Richard Horton. The journal has editorial offices in London, New York, and Beijing. Impact According to the Journal Citation Reports, the journal has a 2018 impact factor of 59.102, ranking it second after The New England Journal of Medicine in the category \\"Medicine, General & Internal\\". Specialty journals The Lancet also publishes several specialty journals: The Lancet Neurology (neurology), The Lancet Oncology (oncology), The Lancet Infectious Diseases (infectious diseases), The Lancet Respiratory Medicine (respiratory medicine), The Lancet Psychiatry (psychiatry), The Lancet Diabetes and Endocrinology (endocrinology), and The Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology (Gastroenterology) all of which publish original research and reviews. In 2013, The Lancet Global Health (global health) became the group's first fully open access journal. In 2014, The Lancet Haematology (haematology) and The Lancet HIV (infectious diseases) were launched, both as online only research titles. The Lancet Child & Adolescent Health (paediatrics) launched in 2017. The three established speciality journals (The Lancet Neurology, The Lancet Oncology, and The Lancet Infectious Diseases) have built up strong reputations in their medical speciality. According to the Journal Citation Reports, The Lancet Oncology has a 2017 impact factor of 36.421, The Lancet Neurology has 27.144, and The Lancet Infectious Diseases has 25.148. There is also an online website for students entitled The Lancet Student in blog format, launched in 2007. Volume renumbering Prior to 1990, The Lancet had volume numbering that reset every year. Issues in January to June were in volume i, with the rest in volume ii. In 1990, the journal moved to a sequential volume numbering scheme, with two volumes per year. Volumes were retro-actively assigned to the years prior to 1990, with the first issue of 1990 being assigned volume 335, and the last issue of 1989 assigned volume 334. The table of contents listing on ScienceDirect uses this new numbering scheme.The Lancet. Science Direct. Political controversies The Lancet has taken a political stand on several important medical and non- medical issues. Recent examples include criticism of the World Health Organization (WHO), rejection of the WHO's claims of the efficacy of homoeopathy as a therapeutic option, disapproval during the time Reed Exhibitions (a division of Reed Elsevier) hosted arms industry fairs, a call in 2003 for tobacco to be made illegal, and a call for an independent investigation into the American bombing of a hospital in Afghanistan in 2015.What are the Geneva Conventions for?, editorial, The Lancet, vol. 386, no. 10003, p. 1510, 17 October 2015  Tobacco ban proposal (2003)  A December 2003 editorial by the journal, titled \\"How do you sleep at night, Mr Blair?\\", called for tobacco use to be completely banned in the UK. The Royal College of Physicians rejected their argument. John Britton, chairman of the college's tobacco advisory group, praised the journal for discussing the health problem, but he concluded that a \\"ban on tobacco would be a nightmare.\\" Amanda Sandford, spokesperson for the anti-tobacco group Action on Smoking and Health, stated that criminalising a behaviour 26% of the population commit \\"is ludicrous.\\" She also said: \\"We can't turn the clock back. If tobacco were banned we would have 13 million people desperately craving a drug that they would not be able to get.\\" The deputy editor of The Lancet responded to the criticism by arguing that no other measures besides a total ban would likely be able to reduce tobacco use. The smokers rights group FOREST stated that the editorial gave them \\"amusement and disbelief\\". Director Simon Clark called the journal \\"fascist\\" and argued that it is hypocritical to ban tobacco while allowing unhealthy junk foods, alcohol consumption, and participation in extreme sports. Health Secretary John Reid reiterated that his government was committed to helping people give up smoking. He added: \\"Despite the fact that this is a serious problem, it is a little bit extreme for us in Britain to start locking people up because they have an ounce of tobacco somewhere.\\"  Iraq War death toll estimates  The Lancet also published an estimate of the Iraq War's Iraqi death toll‚Äîaround 100,000‚Äîin 2004. In 2006, a follow-up study by the same team suggested that the violent death rate in Iraq was not only consistent with the earlier estimate, but had increased considerably in the intervening period (see Lancet surveys of casualties of the Iraq War). The second survey estimated that there had been 654,965 excess Iraqi deaths as a consequence of the war. The 95% confidence interval was 392,979 to 942,636. 1,849 households that contained 12,801 people were surveyed. The estimates provided in the second article are much higher than those published in other surveys from the same time. Most notably, the \\"Iraq Family Health Survey\\" published in the New England Journal of Medicine surveyed 9,345 households across Iraq and estimated 151,000 deaths due to violence (95% uncertainty range, 104,000 to 223,000) over the same period covered in the second Lancet survey by Burnham et al. The NEJM article stated that the second Lancet survey \\"considerably overestimated the number of violent deaths\\" and said the Lancet results were \\"highly improbable, given the internal and external consistency of the data and the much larger sample size and quality-control measures taken in the implementation of the IFHS.\\"  Open Letter for the People of Gaza (2014) In August 2014 and during the 2014 Israel‚ÄìGaza conflict, The Lancet published an \\"Open letter for the people of Gaza\\" in their correspondence section. As reported in The Daily Telegraph, the letter \\"condemned Israel in the strongest possible terms, but strikingly made no mention of Hamas' atrocities.\\" According to Haaretz, the authors of the letter include doctors who \\"are apparently sympathetic to the views of David Duke, a white supremacist and former Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard.\\" One of the doctors responded by saying: \\"I legitimately use my right of freedom of opinion and do not agree or value the politics of the government of Israel, nor of many others, including Jews in and out of Israel.\\" A second one responded with: \\"I didn't know who David Duke was, or that he was connected to the Ku Klux Klan. I am concerned that if there is any truth in the video, that Jews control the media, politics and banking, what on earth is going on? I was worried.\\" The editor of The Lancet, Richard Horton, said: \\"I have no plans to retract the letter, and I would not retract the letter even if it was found to be substantiated.\\" However, Horton subsequently came to Israel's Rambam Hospital for a visit and said that he \\"deeply, deeply regret[ted] the completely unnecessary polarization that publication of the letter by Paola Manduca caused.\\" Mark Pepys, a member of the Jewish Medical Association, wrote: ‚ÄúThe failure of the Manduca et al. authors to disclose their extraordinary conflicts of interest... are the most serious, unprofessional and unethical errors. The transparent effort to conceal this vicious and substantially mendacious partisan political diatribe as an innocent humanitarian appeal has no place in any serious publication, let alone a professional medical journal, and would disgrace even the lowest of the gutter press.\\" In addition, Pepys accused Richard Horton personally, saying: \\"Horton's behavior in this case is consistent with his longstanding and wholly inappropriate use of The Lancet as a vehicle for his own extreme political views. It has greatly detracted from the former high standing of the journal.\\" In response, Horton said: \\"How can you separate politics and health? The two go hand-in-hand.\\" Comments on the Trump administration (2020) On 16 May 2020, The Lancet published an article on the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) that, amongst other things, faulted the Trump administration for its July 2019 termination of a CDC programme under which the CDC stationed officers in China, ostensibly to serve as a distant early warning system. The writers opined that CDC director Robert R. Redfield was frightened of Trump and in any case had not \\"the technical capacity to lead today's complicated effort.\\" The article concluded with a call to the American people to elect someone other than Trump in November 2020. Retracted papers and scientific controversies= Andrew Wakefield and the MMR vaccine (1998)  The Lancet was criticised after it published a paper in 1998 in which the authors suggested a link between the MMR vaccine and autism spectrum disorder. In February 2004, The Lancet published a statement by 10 of the paper's 13 coauthors repudiating the possibility that MMR could cause autism. The editor-in-chief, Richard Horton, went on the record to say the paper had \\"fatal conflicts of interest\\" because the study's lead author, Andrew Wakefield, had a serious conflict of interest that he had not declared to The Lancet. The journal completely retracted the paper on 2 February 2010, after Wakefield was found to have acted unethically in conducting the research. The Lancets six editors, including the editor-in- chief, were also criticised in 2011 because they had \\"covered up\\" the \\"Wakefield concocted fear of MMR\\" with an \\"avalanche of denials\\" in 2004.  Fabricated article withdrawn (2006)  In January 2006, it was revealed that data had been fabricated in an article by the Norwegian cancer researcher Jon Sudb√∏ and 13 co-authors published in The Lancet in October 2005. Several articles in other scientific journals were withdrawn following the withdrawal in The Lancet. Within a week, The New England Journal of Medicine published an expression of editorial concern regarding its published research papers by the same author, and in November 2006, the journal withdrew two oral cancer studies led by the Norwegian researcher.  PACE study (2011)  In 2011, The Lancet published a study by the UK-based \\"PACE trial management group\\", which reported success with graded exercise therapy and cognitive behavioural therapy for chronic fatigue syndrome; a follow-up study was published in Lancet Psychiatry in 2015. The studies attracted criticism from some patients and researchers, especially with regard to data analysis that was different from that described in the original protocol. In a 2015 Slate article, biostatistician Bruce Levin of Columbia University was quoted saying \\"The Lancet needs to stop circling the wagons and be open\\", and that \\"one of the tenets of good science is transparency\\"; while Ronald Davis of Stanford University said: \\"the Lancet should step up to the plate and pull that paper\\". Horton defended The Lancet's publication of the trial and called the critics: \\"a fairly small, but highly organized, very vocal and very damaging group of individuals who have, I would say, actually hijacked this agenda and distorted the debate so that it actually harms the overwhelming majority of patients.\\" Starting in 2011, critics of the studies filed Freedom of Information Act requests to get access to the authors' primary data, in order to learn what the trial's results would have been under the original protocol. In 2016, some of the data was released, which allowed calculation of results based on the original protocol and found that additional treatment led to no significant improvement in recovery rates over the control condition.  Study on hydroxychloroquine (2020)  On 22 May 2020, The Lancet published an article by Mehra et al., \\"Hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine with or without a macrolide for treatment of COVID-19: a multinational registry analysis\\". This study, based on retrospective observational review of 96,032 patients from 671 hospitals between 20 December 2019 and 14 April 2020, had an immediate impact; the WHO decided to stop all the clinical trials on hydroxychloroquine. On 26 May 2020, Australian researchers found an error: only 67 deaths from COVID-19 had been recorded in Australia by 21 April, where the study claims 73. The Lancet told Guardian Australia, \\"We have asked the authors for clarifications, we know that they are investigating urgently, and we await their reply.\\" Surgisphere's Sapan Desai said a hospital from Asia had accidentally been included in the Australian data. On 28 May some 180 researchers and doctors from various countries published An open letter to Richard Horton, editor of The Lancet, regarding Mehra et al.An open letter to Richard Horton, editor of The Lancet regarding Mehra et al. The following day, The Lancet published a corrected version. According to the authors, the corrections did not change the overall findings of no benefit. However, on 2 June 2020, The Lancet published an \\"Expression of Concern\\" and began an independent audit commissioned by the authors. On 3 June 2020, the WHO announced that clinical trials of Hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine will be continued. The following day, three of the four authors retracted the paper, and The Lancet published a retraction of the study.

He had already been created Baron Belmore, of Castle Coole in County Fermanagh (now in Northern Ireland), in 1781 and Viscount Belmore in 1789, also in the Peerage of Ireland. Born Armar Lowry, he was the son of Galbraith Lowry, Member of the Irish House of Commons for County Tyrone, and his wife Sarah, daughter of Colonel John Corry. In 1774, he assumed by Royal licence the additional surname of Corry. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Earl. He represented County Tyrone in both the Irish and British House of Commons, sat in the House of Lords as an Irish Representative Peer from 1819 to 1841, and served as Governor of Jamaica from 1828 to 1832. His eldest son, the third Earl, represented County Fermanagh at Westminster. On his early death, the titles passed to his eldest son, the fourth Earl. He was an Irish Representative Peer between 1857 and 1913, and he served under the Earl of Derby as Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department between 1866 and 1867. From 1867 to 1872, Lord Belmore was Governor of New South Wales. The line of the fourth Earl failed on the death of his younger son, the sixth Earl, in 1949, and he was succeeded by his first cousin once removed, the seventh Earl. He was the son of Major Adrian Lowry-Corry, fifth son of Admiral the Hon. Armar Lowry-Corry, himself the second son of the third Earl. , the titles are held by his son, the eighth Earl, who succeeded in 1960. Several other members of the Lowry-Corry family have also gained distinction. The Conservative politician the Honourable Henry Lowry-Corry, First Lord of the Admiralty from 1866 to 1867, was the second son of the second Earl. His younger son was Montagu Corry, 1st Baron Rowton, private secretary to Benjamin Disraeli. The Honourable Armar Lowry-Corry (1836‚Äì1919), second son of the third Earl, was an admiral in the Royal Navy. The Honourable Henry Lowry- Corry, younger son of the third Earl, was also a politician. The invented title of Viscount Corry is used as a courtesy title for the Earl's heir apparent.

Early life Hoar was born in Concord, Massachusetts, on August 29, 1826. He studied for several months at a boarding school in Waltham, Massachusetts, run by Samuel and Sarah Bradford Ripley. He graduated from Harvard University in 1846 and earned his law degree at Harvard Law School in 1849. He was admitted to the bar and settled in Worcester, Massachusetts, where he practiced law. Initially a member of the Free Soil Party, he joined the Republican Party shortly after its founding. Political career Hoar was elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives in 1852 and to the Massachusetts Senate in 1857. He represented Massachusetts as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives for four terms from 1869 to 1877 and then served in the U.S. Senate until his death during his fifth term. For one term during his House service, from 1873 to 1875, his brother Ebenezer Rockood Hoar served alongside him. He was a Republican, who generally avoided party partisanship and did not hesitate to criticize other members of his party whose actions or policies he believed were in error. In 1880 he was chairman of the 1880 Republican National Convention. When James Garfield, who eventually won the party's nomination and the presidential election, rose to object that votes were being cast for him without his consent, Hoar disallowed his objection. He later said: \\"I was terribly afraid that he would say something that would make his nomination impossible.\\" Hoar was long noted as a fighter against political corruption. He campaigned for the rights of African Americans and Native Americans, though his \\"campaigning\\" for Native Americans included the breakup of tribal lands for white settlement. He was a strong advocate of the Dawes Act and allotment schemes which stole millions of acres of Native land. He justified these views by comparing Federal Indian relations to that of \\"a father to his son, or by a guardian to an insane ward...\\"Congressional Record, 55th Congress, version 29, part 3 (available at the Library of Congress). He opposed the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, describing it as \\"nothing less than the legalization of racial discrimination\\" He was a member of the Congressional Electoral Commission that settled the highly disputed 1876 U.S. presidential election. He authored the Presidential Succession Act of 1886. He argued in the Senate in favor of women's suffrage as early as 1886. He was a consistent opponent of American imperialism. He did not share his Senate colleagues' enthusiasm for American intervention in Cuba in the late 1890s. On December 1897, he met with Native Hawaiian leaders opposed to the annexation of their nation. He then presented the K≈´ ªƒì Petitions to Congress and helped to defeat President William McKinley's attempt to annex the Republic of Hawaii by treaty, though the islands were eventually annexed by means of joint resolution, called the Newlands Resolution. George F. Hoar in his later years. After the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, Hoar became one of the Senate's most outspoken opponents of the imperialism of the McKinley administration. He denounced the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War and called for independence for the Philippines in a 3-hour speech in the Senate, saying: Hoar pushed for and served on the Lodge Committee, investigating allegations, later confirmed, of war crimes in the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War. He also denounced the U.S. intervention in Panama. Hoar voted against the Chinese Exclusion Act.https://cpilj.law.uconn.edu/wp- content/uploads/sites/2515/2018/10/3.1-22No-No-No-No22-Three-sons-of- Connecticut-Who-Opposed-the-Chinese-Exclusions-Acts-by-Henry-S.-Cohn-and- Harvey-Gee.pdf Other interests In 1865, Hoar was one of the founders of the Worcester County Free Institute of Industrial Science, now the Worcester Polytechnic Institute. Hoar was active in the American Historical Association and the American Antiquarian Society, serving terms as president of both organizations. He was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1853, and served as vice-president from 1878 to 1884, and then served as president from 1884 to 1887. In 1887 he was among the founders of the American Irish Historical Society. He was a regent of the Smithsonian Institution in 1880 and a trustee of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology. Through his efforts, the lost manuscript of William Bradford's Of Plymouth Plantation (1620‚Äì1647), an important founding document of the United States, was returned to Massachusetts, after being discovered in Fulham Palace, London, in 1855. Hoar was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1901. His autobiography, Autobiography of Seventy Years, was published in 1903. It appeared first in serial form in Scribner's magazine. He attended the Unitarian Church of All Souls in Washington, D.C. Hoar enjoyed good health until June 1904. He died in Worcester on September 30 of that year and was buried in Sleepy Hollow Cemetery, Concord. After his death, a statue of him was erected in front of Worcester's city hall, paid for by public donations. Hoar family and relations In 1853, Hoar married Mary Louisa Spurr (1831‚Äì1859). In 1862, he married Ruth Ann Miller (1830‚Äì1903). With his first wife, he was the father of a son, Rockwood Hoar, and a daughter, Mary (1854‚Äì1929). With his second wife he was the father of a daughter, Alice (1863‚Äì1864). Through his mother, Sarah Sherman, G.F.

Other pieces of federal legislation extend similar requirements to third-party purchases that utilize federal funds, such as highway and transit programs. The Buy American Act is not to be confused with the very similarly named \\"Buy America Act\\" that came into effect in 1983. The latter, a provision of the Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982, is 49 U.S.C., ¬ß 5323 (j), and applies only to mass-transit-related procurements valued over US$100,000 and funded at least in part by federal grants. In certain government procurements, the requirement purchase may be waived by the Contracting Officer or the Head of the Contracting Activity (HCA) if the domestic product is 25% or more expensive than an identical foreign-sourced product, if the product is not available domestically in sufficient quantity or quality, or if doing so is in the public's interest. The President has the authority to waive the Buy American Act within the terms of a reciprocal agreement or otherwise in response to the provision of reciprocal treatment to U.S. producers.

Description Ilex opaca is a medium-sized broadleaved evergreen tree growing on average to tall, and up to tall. Typically, its trunk diameter reaches , sometimes up to . The bark is light gray, roughened by small warty lumps. The branchlets are stout, green at first and covered with rusty down, later smooth and brown. The winter buds are brown, short, obtuse or acute. The leaves are alternate, long and wide, stiff, yellow green and dull matte to sub-shiny above (distinctly less glossy than the otherwise fairly similar European holly Ilex aquifoliumHuxley, A., ed. (1992). New RHS Dictionary of Gardening. Macmillan .), often pale yellow beneath; the edges are curved into several sharp, spike- like points, and a wedge-shaped base and acute apex; the midrib is prominent and depressed, the primary veins conspicuous; the petiole is short, stout, grooved, thickened at base, with a pair of minute stipules. The leaves remain on the branches for two to three years, finally falling in the spring when pushed off by growing buds.Oklahoma Biological Survey: Ilex opaca Ripe fruit The flowers are greenish white, small, borne in late spring in short pedunculate cymes from the axils of young leaves or scattered along the base of young branches. The calyx is small, four-lobed, imbricate in the bud, acute, margins ciliate, persistent. The corolla is white, with four petal-like lobes united at the base, obtuse, spreading, hypogynous, imbricate in bud. The flower stem is hairy with a minute bract at base. Like all hollies, it is dioecious, with separate male and female plants; only female plants produce the characteristic red berries. One male can pollenize several females. Male flowers have four stamens, inserted on the base of the corolla, alternate with its lobes; filaments awl-shaped, exserted in the sterile, much shorter in the sterile flower; anthers attached at the back, oblong, introrse, two-celled, cells opening longitudinally. The pistil on female flowers has a superior ovary, four-celled, rudimentary in staminate flowers; style wanting, stigma sessile, four-lobed; ovules one or two in each cell. The fruit is a small red drupe 6‚Äì12 mm diameter containing four seeds; it is often persistent into winter. Branch full of ripe fruitA ratio of three female plants to one male plant is required for ideal fruit production. ;Subspecies and varietiesThe Plant List, Ilex opaca Aiton *Ilex opaca subsp. arenicola (Ashe) A.E.

It is found in sparse numbers in the northern part of its range from Cape Cod, Massachusetts, south to northern New Jersey (including southern Connecticut and southeastern New York). It is abundant further south on the Gulf and Atlantic lowlands. The branches are short and slender. The roots are thick and fleshy. It will grow in both dry and swampy soil, but grows slowly. Ilex opaca var. arenicola, or scrub holly, is found as a shrub component in xeric scrub habitats of the Florida peninsula. This plant is shade tolerant. The ideal yearly precipitation average for the species ranges from 102 cm to 165 cm. The flowers are pollinated by insects, including bees, wasps, ants, and night-flying moths. The berries are reputedly poisonous to humans, but are important survival food for birds, who will eat the berries after other food sources are exhausted. The tree also forms a thick canopy which offers protection for birds from predators and storms. Songbirds including thrushes, mockingbirds, catbirds, bluebirds and thrashers, as well as some gamebirds and mammals frequently feed on the berries. Cultivation and uses The wood is very pale, tough, close-grained, takes a good polish, and is used for whip- handles, engraving blocks and also cabinet work. It can also be dyed and used as a substitute for ebony. It has a density of 0.58 to 0.64. The sap is watery, and contains a bitter substance used as an herbal tonic. Leaves from the American holly can be used to make a tea-like beverage. American holly tea does not contain caffeine. Mature plants often display a pyramidal shape Ornamental plant Ilex opaca is often cultivated by plant nurseries for use as a broadleaf evergreen ornamental plant, planted as a shrub or slower growing ornamental tree. Over 1,000 cultivars have been selected, including plants selected for cold tolerance ('Cobalt', a male cultivar, is able to tolerate temperatures as low as ‚àí32 ¬∞C), growth form (e.g. dwarf forms such as 'Cardinal Hedge', a female plant growing to 1.2 m tall), and color and abundance of fruit (notable female cultivars including the large-berried 'Yule', and the yellow-berried 'Canary' and 'Morgan Gold'). The holly in winter Not only is the holly associated with winter decoration, it serves as a source of food and shelter during inclement weather Holly is a popular winter Christmas and holiday season decoration. In English poetry and English stories the holly is inseparably connected with the merry-making and greetings which gather around the Christmas time. The custom is followed in North America, and holly and mistletoe are widely used for decoration of homes and churches. The European holly is smaller than the American holly, but closely resembles the American holly. The leaves of both species are similar in outline and toothed and bristled very much the same way, but the leaves are brighter in the American holly and larger. The American holly, called the evergreen or Christmas holly (Ilex opaca Aiton) was named the state tree of Delaware on 1 May 1939. Holly fruit (drupes) appear late in the season, and whether due to the need to ripen or being a food of last resort, often last until midwinter. Cedar Waxwings will strip the trees of fruit if they are not already bare during their northward migration.

Its administrative center is the city of Vladimir, which is located east of Moscow. As of the 2010 Census, the oblast's population was 1,443,693. The UNESCO World Heritage List includes the 12th-century cathedrals of Vladimir, Suzdal, Bogolyubovo, and Kideksha. Geography Vladimir Oblast borders Moscow, Yaroslavl, Ivanovo, Ryazan, and Nizhny Novgorod Oblasts. The oblast is situated in the center of the East European Plain. The Klyazma and the Oka are the most important rivers. There are approximately three hundred lakes. The oblast is situated in a zone of mixed forests. Fauna The oblast's fauna currently includes more than fifty species of mammals (some examples including elk, wild boar, roe deer, red and sika deer, lynx, wolf, squirrel, rabbit, marten, fox, weasel, badger and other fur-bearing animals), five species of reptiles, and ten species of amphibians. The semiaquatic Russian desman is listed in the Russian Red Book of endangered species. The region is inhabited by 216 species of birds, among which are the capercaillie, black grouse, grouse, partridge, woodcock, goose, duck, etc. The lesser white- fronted goose is listed in the Red Book. Hunting season runs from October to February with the following license and permit restrictions: *Elk, wild boar, red deer, and sika deer from mid-November through mid-January *Hare from October through January *Grouse, black grouse, woodcock, duck and goose for 10 days in April. Bodies of water in the region are rich in numerous species (about 40) of fresh-water fish (e.g. eel, roach, pike, perch, bream, rudd, and sturgeon in the Klyazma River), which support ice fishing in winter. Additionally, the oblast has several hunting farms. Hydrography The total expanse of the oblast's surface waters is 32.9 hectares. The region has hundreds of rivers with a total length of more than 8.6 million kilometers‚Äîthere are 560 rivers and streams throughout the oblast. The Klyazma River flows into the Oka River on the south-eastern edge of the oblast's border with the Nizhny Novgorod Region. The Klyazma River's major tributaries in the Vladimir Region are the Sherna (with the Molokcha flowing into it), the Kirzhach (with its own tributaries being the Big and Small Kirzhach), the Peksha, the Koloksha, the Nerl, the Sudogda, the Uvod, the Lukh and the Suvorosch. Tributaries of the Oka within Vladimir oblast are the Gus, Unzha, and Ushna rivers. The Dubna River, a tributary of the Volga River, originates near the town of Alexandrov. The Oka River is navigable throughout the region (157 km). The rivers in the region are characterized by their flat currents, broad valleys and meandering channels. Water levels are characterized by their high spring tides, low water periods over summer-autumn with occasional flooding during heavy rains, and stable/low levels throughout the winter. There are about three hundred lakes covering an area of five thousand hectares. Most of them are small and undrained and many are overgrown with a peat layer. The origin of the lakes varies. Numerous oxbow lakes are scattered along the river valleys. The largest of them are Lake Urvanovskoe (12 km long) and Lake Visha (length about 10 km). In the Meshchera Lowlands and in the northwest of the oblast are lakes of ancient alluvial valleys: Isikhry, Svyatoe and others. Lakes of karst origin, located in the lower reaches of the Klyazma and in the center of Vyaznikovsky District (a northeastern district in the oblast), have highly mineralized water and are associated with underground watercourses. The largest and deepest of them is Lake Kshchara. In the districts of Alexandrov and Yuryev-Polsky glacial lakes are small in size. The main masses of wetlands in the region (total area of 37.4 thousand hectares ) occur in Meshchera and Balakhna (in the northeast of the oblast) lowlands. History The territory of modern Vladimir Oblast has been populated since ancient times. The oldest known traces of human settlement date to the Upper Paleolithic. A settlement of Homo Sapiens dating back to 25,000 BCE was discovered in the area of Sungir. The region of Vladimir were inhabited by different people like Slavs, Tatars, Finno-Ugrics and Balts. The East Slavic tribe of the Buzhans originated in the Vladimir region. Archaeological excavations of Volga Finn settlements document also the Finno-Ugric roots of this land. Merya, Muromian, and Meshchera inhabited territory of the region during this period. Since the 10th century CE, Slavic colonization of the area began in Murom and Suzdal. The current territory of Vladimir Oblast became part of the Old Russian state. In the 11th century, the region became part of the Rostov-Suzdal principality and in the 12th century the Vladimir-Suzdal principality. In the early 12th century, Vladimir emerged as did Yaropolch- Zalessky. The Vladimir region rapidly developed in the mid-12th century during the rule of Yuri Dolgorukiy and Andrey Bogolyubsky. New townships arose-- Yuriev-Polsky, Gorokhovets, Starodub-on-the-Klyazma, Mstislavl‚Äîalong with the princely residences Kideksha and Bogolyubovo. The visibility of historical monuments preserves cities reminiscent of medieval Russian history and detailed documents about the history of the last hundred years records the peak of the cultural development of these places (Vladimirskaya guberniya, Vladimir Highway). Most, if not all, of modern Vladimir, during the Soviet period, seems to have been part of Ivanovo Oblast until it became a separate Federal Subject in 1944.Vladimir,_Russia#Soviet_period Politics Legislative Assembly of Vladimir Oblast, 2009 Gusevskoye peat narrow gauge railway, 2012 During the Soviet period, the high authority in the oblast was shared between three persons: The first secretary of the Vladimir CPSU Committee (who in reality had the biggest authority), the chairman of the oblast Soviet (legislative power), and the Chairman of the oblast Executive Committee (executive power). Since 1991, CPSU lost all the power, and the head of the Oblast administration, and eventually the governor was appointed/elected alongside elected regional parliament. The Charter of Vladimir Oblast is the fundamental law of the region. The Legislative Assembly of Vladimir Oblast is the province's standing legislative (representative) body. The Legislative Assembly exercises its authority by passing laws, resolutions, and other legal acts and by supervising the implementation and observance of the laws and other legal acts passed by it. The highest executive body is the Oblast Government, which includes territorial executive bodies such as district administrations, committees, and commissions that facilitate development and run the day to day matters of the province. The Oblast administration supports the activities of the Governor who is the highest official and acts as guarantor of the observance of the oblast Charter in accordance with the Constitution of Russia. Administrative divisionsEconomy and transportation The largest companies in the region include the local branches of Mondelez International (revenues of $ million in 2017) and Ferrero SpA ($ million), Treyd Servis (baby food manufacturer, $ million), Starodvorskiye Kolbasy (sausage producer, $ million). The Gusevskoye peat narrow gauge railway for hauling peat operates in the Gus-Khrustalny District.

It is served by a railway and the M7 motorway. Its population is History Vladimir was one of the medieval capitals of Russia, with significant buildings surviving from the 12th century. Two of its Russian Orthodox cathedrals, a monastery, and associated buildings have been designated as among the White Monuments of Vladimir and Suzdal, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. In the past, the city was also known as Vladimir-on-Klyazma ()Vladimir-on-Klyazma at the Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary. and Vladimir-Zalessky (), to distinguish it from another Vladimir in Volhynia (modern Ukraine). Foundation date controversy 17th century map Traditionally, the founding date of Vladimir has been acknowledged as 1108, as the first mention of Vladimir in the Primary Chronicle appears under that year. This view attributes the founding of the city, and its name, to Vladimir Monomakh, who inherited the region as part of the Rostov-Suzdal Principality in 1093. It is named there as Volodimer. On the 17th centuries maps, it was identified as Wolodimer, while its region as Volodimer. Being established long after the city of Volodymyr in Volhynia, initially it was named Vladimir-on-Klyazma. In 1958, the 850th anniversary of the city foundation was celebrated, with many monuments from the celebrations adorning the city. In the 1990s, a new opinion developed that the city is older than this. Scholars reinterpreted certain passages in the Hypatian Codex, which mentions that the region was visited by Vladimir the Great, the \\"father\\" of Russian Orthodoxy, in 990, so as to move the city foundation date to that year. The defenders of the previously uncontested founding year of 1108 dispute the claims of those who support the new date, arguing that the new theory was fabricated in order to provide a reason to have a celebration in 1995. The neighboring town of Suzdal, for instance, was mentioned in 1024. Its 12th-century inhabitants alluded to Vladimir as a young town and treated its rulers with arrogance. In the words of a major chronicle, they said that the people of Vladimir were \\"their kholops and scions\\". In the seniority conflicts of the 12th and early 13th centuries, Vladimir was repeatedly described as a \\"young town\\" compared to Suzdal and Rostov. Nevertheless, the Charter of Vladimir, the basic law of the city passed in 2005, explicitly mentions 990 as the date of the city's foundation.Charter of Vladimir, Article 3. Golden Age The city's most historically significant events occurred after the turn of the 12th century. Serving its original purpose as a defensive outpost for the Rostov-Suzdal Principality, Vladimir had little political or military influence throughout the reign of Vladimir Monomakh (1113‚Äì1125), or his son Yury Dolgoruky (\\"Far-Reaching\\") (1154‚Äì1157). Dormition Cathedral was a venerated model for cathedrals all over Russia Biblical story of King David. Under Dolgoruky's son, Andrey Bogolyubsky (1157‚Äì1175) (also known as Andrew the Pious), the city became the center of the Vladimir- Suzdal Principality. It had a Golden Age, which lasted until the Mongol invasion of Rus' in 1237. During this time, Vladimir enjoyed immense growth and prosperity. Andrey oversaw the building of the city's Golden Gates and the Dormition Cathedral. In 1164, Andrey attempted to establish a new metropolitanate in Vladimir, separate from that of Kiev. He was rebuffed by the Patriarch of Constantinople.Janet Martin, Medieval Russia: 980-1584 (Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1995), 100. Scores of Russian, German, and Georgian masons worked on Vladimir's white stone cathedrals, monastery, towers, and palaces. Unlike any other northern buildings, their exterior was elaborately carved with high relief stone sculptures. Only three of these edifices stand today: the Dormition Cathedral, the Cathedral of Saint Demetrius, and the Golden Gate. They are included among the White Monuments of Vladimir and Suzdal, designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. During Andrey's reign, a royal palace in Bogolyubovo was built, as well as the world-famous Church of the Intercession on the Nerl, now considered one of the jewels of ancient Russian architecture. Andrey was assassinated at his palace at Bogolyubovo in 1175. Decline Drawing of Mongols of the Golden Horde outside Vladimir presumably demanding submission before sacking the city Vladimir was besieged by the Mongol-Tatars of the Golden Horde under Batu Khan. It was finally overrun on February 8, 1238. A great fire destroyed thirty-two limestone buildings on the first day alone, while the grand prince's family perished in a church where they sought refuge from the flames. The grand prince escaped, but was killed at the Battle of the Sit River the following month. After the Mongols, Vladimir never fully recovered. The most important Ruthenian prince (usually the Prince of Moscow, but sometimes a Tver or another principality) was styled the Grand Prince of Vladimir, but the title had become an honorific symbol of majesty. From 1299 to 1325, the city was seat of the metropolitans of Kiev and All Rus', until Metropolitan Peter moved the See to Moscow in 1325. The Grand Princes of Vladimir were originally crowned in Vladimir's Assumption Cathedral, but when Moscow superseded Vladimir in the 14th Century as the seat of the Grand Prince, the Assumption Cathedral in the Moscow Kremlin became the site of their coronation. The Moscow cathedral was loosely copied by the Italian architect Aristotele Fioravanti from Vladimir's original. After the rise of Moscow, Grand Princes of Moscow continued to build several new churches in Vladimir. Notable examples include the Annunciation Church at Snovitsy (ca. 1501), three kilometers northwest of the city, and a church in the Knyaginin Nunnery (ca. 1505), which today includes murals dating from 1648. A view of Vladimir in 1911 Remains of the prince-saint Alexander Nevsky were kept in the ancient Nativity Abbey of Vladimir until 1703, when Peter the Great had them transferred to the Monastery (now Lavra) of Alexander Nevsky in St. Petersburg. The Nativity Church (built from 1191 to 1196) collapsed several years later, after workmen tried to fashion more windows in its walls in an effort to brighten the interior. The city was the center of , part of Moscow Governorate from its establishment by Peter the Great in 1708. Vladimir was separated from Moscow Governorate and made the center of a new by a ukase of Catherine the Great in 1778. In 1796, Paul I's administrative reform transformed the viceroyalty into the in the same borders. In the years 1838-1840, Alexander Herzen was exiled in Vladimir, passing through the city on the infamous Vladimirka. In December 1858 the city began to operate telegraph. On June 14, 1861,http://eng.rzd.ru/statice/public/en?STRUCTURE_ID=4332&layer;_id=4516&refererLayerId;=4516&id;=2554 the began to operate through Vladimir. In 1866, construction of a running water supply was completed, with telephone lines being put up in 1887 and the first electrical power lines on December 5, 1908. In November 29, 1898 Vladimir provincial scientific archival commission was established. Soviet period After the establishment of Soviet power, many streets were renamed in Vladimir; most of the parish churches were closed and condemned to be demolished. In the first decades of Soviet rule industrialization occurred in Vladimir. On January 14, 1929, the Vladimir Governorate was abolished and the city became part of the newly formed Ivanovo Industrial Oblast. On August 14, 1944, Vladimir became the administrative center of a new Vladimir Oblast carved from Ivanovo Oblast. In 1950 from the basis of the teachers' institute the Vladimir Pedagogical Institute was created. On November 5, 1952 the first trolleybus line began to operate in the city. In 1958 the was created, composed of a group of unique architectural monuments of Russian defense and church architecture. The monuments are located in three cities‚ÄîVladimir, Suzdal and Gus-Khrustalny‚Äîas well as villages of Bogolyubovo and Kideksha. Architecture of the Soviet period is represented by such structures as building complexes and polytechnic colleges, the Torpedo Stadium (built 1952), a reinforced concrete arch bridge over the river Klyaz'ma (1960), the Hotel Vladimir (1956), the Drama Theatre (1971) and others. In 1971 the city was awarded the Order of Red Banner of Labor.

As a municipal division, the City of Vladimir is incorporated as Vladimir Urban Okrug.Law #189-OZ Economy and military Vladimir is home to several electrical and chemical factories, several food processing plants and two large thermal power stations. Tourism related to the historical sites is a major contributor to the city economy. The headquarters of the 27th Guards Rocket Army of the Strategic Missile Troops is located in the city. During the Cold War, Vladimir was host to the Dobrynskoye air force base. Transportation A view to railway station and a bus terminal Since 1861, there has been a railway connection between Vladimir and Moscow.Train Station in Vladimir Vladimir is also linked to Moscow and Nizhny Novgorod by the M7 highway. Local transport includes buses, trolleybuses, fixed-route minivans, and taxis. Vladimir bus service links the city to all the district centers of Vladimir Oblast, as well as Moscow, Ivanovo, Kostroma, Nizhny Novgorod, Ryazan, Yaroslavl and other cities. At least 20 pairs of long-distance trains pass daily through Vladimir station, giving Vladimir year-round direct rail links to Moscow (Kursk Station), St. Petersburg and Nizhny Novgorod. Since the summer of 2010 Vladimir (on the Nizhny Novgorod line) is a stopping point for the \\"Peregrine Falcon\\" high-speed train. Developed suburban rail: Vladimir was the only city in Russia with concurrent commuter trains two Russian cities with subways. The city is served by the Semyazino Airport 5 km west of the city center.

Sightseeing Modern Vladimir is a part of the Golden Ring of ancient Russian cities and a popular tourist destination. Its three chief monuments, White Monuments of Vladimir and Suzdal, inscribed by UNESCO on the World Heritage List, are the following: #The magnificent five-domed Dormition Cathedral was designed as the burial place of grand princes and dedicated to the holy icon the Theotokos of Vladimir, which had been brought to the city by Andrey Bogolyubsky. The cathedral was constructed in 1158‚Äì1160, expanded in 1185‚Äì1189, and painted by the great Andrei Rublev and Daniil Chyorny in 1408. In 1810, a lofty bell-tower was added in Neoclassical style. #The helmet-domed Cathedral of Saint Demetrius was built in 1194‚Äì1197 as a private chapel of Vsevolod the Big Nest in the courtyard of his palace and was consecrated to his holy patron, St. Demetrius. For all its formal unity, the cathedral represents an international project of Russian and Byzantine masters, Friedrich Barbarossa's masons, and carvers sent by Queen Tamar of Georgia. #The Golden Gate, originally a tower over the city's main gate, was built in 1158‚Äì1164. The gate acquired its present form after having been reconstructed in the late 18th century, to prevent the dilapidated structure from tumbling down. Other remarkable monuments of pre-Mongol Russian architecture are scattered in the vicinity. For more information on them, see Suzdal, Yuriev-Polsky, Bogolyubovo, and Kideksha.

Its administrative center is the city of Kostroma and its population as of the 2010 Census is 667,562. It was formed in 1944 on the territory detached from neighboring Yaroslavl Oblast. Textile industries have been developed there since the early 18th century. Its major historic towns include Kostroma, Sharya, Nerekhta, Galich, Soligalich, and Makaryev. Viktor Shershunov was Governor from 1997 until his death in a car crash on September 20, 2007, at which point Igor Slyunyayev became the new Governor until 2012 when Sergey Sitnikov became the current incumbent. History From c. 300 CE the current area of Kostroma, with the exception the area east of the Unzha River, was part of the Finno-Ugric peoples' lands, such as the Merya people and their loose tribal confederation. During the Neolithic era, comb-ceramics replaced prafinno-Ugric Volosovo. At the turn of 3rd and 2nd millennia BCE, the Fatyanovo culture arrived in the area, later to be assimilated into the tribes of the Late Bronze Age (the Abashevo culture and the Pozdnyakovskaya culture). The Finno-Ugric component as a result of migration and assimilation and grew even stronger since the culture of the early Iron Age. The people developed the art of smelting of bog ore are already clearly Finno-Ugric in character. As a result of the mixing of the Finno-Ugric and pyanoborskoy Anan'ino local cultures with the Finno-Ugric Dyakovo culture came the Mari people, which began to take shape in Kostroma. Historically, the Kostroma region is a territory of Mari residence. In the currently existing settlements and the Old-Kazhirovo Shangskoe where the capitals of the Mari principalities of Yaksha and Sanga. Possession of these kingdoms in the north to reach the Great in earlier times. The village area was Odoevskoye SHARINSKY Mari fortress Bulaksy. There were at least 109 Merya settlements located in the area of which the most important below mentioned trading centers and important hill fortresses were later recorded by the Russians as the Russians founded towns in the late 9th to 12th centuries. With the death in 1277 of Basil Yaroslavovych, who had no children and left no heirs, the land principality as unclaimed moved into the Vladimir principality. Then, the Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich Dmitry lost ground Kostroma principality to his brother Andrei Alexandrovich Gorodetsky, who in turn gave this inheritance to his nephew, the son of Dmitry Ivan Dmitrievich, but shortly after Ivan D. to possess Pereiaslavl-Zaleski and Kostroma principality newly departed Andrei Alexandrovich and then in 1299, he gave the land to his son Boris. After the latter's death in 1303, the prince of Kostroma in 1304 was the son of Daniel of Moscow, Boris Daniilovich. At this relative independence of the Principality of Kostroma ended and later it became part of the lands of the princely House of Moscow. For the first time in what is now the area were separated from each other by Peter I: in 1708 by dividing the country into provinces were created in the province of Kostroma, Moscow province and in the Galician province of Arkhangelsk province. In 1778, the two territories were re-united in the Kostroma governorship, which has been linked with the Yaroslavl first, then with the Nizhny Novgorod, and later with the Governor- General in one of Vladimir General Government. In 1797 Paul I abolished the Governor-General Vladimir and Kostroma and Kostroma instead governorship was created Kostroma Province, which existed in constant borders until 1917. Conversion of Kostroma province center sped up its economic and cultural development, in spite of the fact that in 1773 and 1779 the city was completely burned in the fire fighting. Since 1781 the city began to be built on the master plan, in which was based on radial- concentric grid of streets that converge on a large semi-circular central area, in the open side of the Volga. The end of the 18th, and first half of the 19th century is rightly considered the time of the rise in cultural development (architecture, painting, literature), not only of Kostroma, but of other county-level cities such as: Galic, Nerekhta and Soligalich. Architectural ensembles in the classical style still adorn the centers of these cities. There were widespread noble estates, which have become centers of culture in the remote outskirts of the province. After the October Revolution of 1917, Kostroma Province became part formed in 1918 by the Russian Federation.

The strip began on July 20, 1998, and a new strip was posted every Monday, Wednesday and Friday until October 23, 2009. It is published online by Keenspot, and in print by Plan 9 Publishing. Bruno the Bandit was nominated for Best Fantasy Comic in the 2002 Web Cartoonists' Choice Awards.The 2002 Cartoonist's Choice Awards McDonald is currently on indefinite hiatus. McDonald developed the comic starting from his parody strip \\"What if Conan the Barbarian Was Garfield's Owner?\\", Conan becoming Bruno and Garfield becoming the microdragon sidekick. It began as three or four panels in black and white and laid out horizontally, published six days a week. Strips also appeared laid out vertically, with varying numbers of mixed orientation panels. Double-height strips and occasional solid colors appeared in 2001, at the end of which posting changed to thrice weekly. The strips were colored from April 4, 2003 until April 16, 2003 by Dominic and from May 30, 2005 to December 14, 2007 by colorist Lynn Blackson. The strips from the launch until July 5, 2001 have been translated into German.Bruno der Bandit, Heike Brand, comicstrips.de, (german) The comic's plots often leverage anachronistic elements: technologies such as such as cell phones, cameras, and televisions exist without drawing comment, and books of great evil are released in paperback, \\"for the benefit of evil wizards everywhere.\\" There are many homages to other comics, such as Garfield (the most referenced), Peanuts, Sandman, Conan, and others. The strip was organized in short story arcs. Some of the stories last for only 6 strips. The longest one as of late 2005 took 72 strips. There is continuity between the sagas, but gags drive the story more than long-term plot development.  Religion and Philosophy  Bruno's world has a complex history (often retrofitted onto Bruno's ancestry), springing from an elaborate religion founded by an ancient and wise prophet named \\"Ailix\\". Combining aspects of Buddha, Mohammed, and Jesus this peaceful and enlightened system of justice and non-violence has led to as much conflict as real world religions. So the greater the gulf in time and philosophy between Bruno, his victims and accomplices, the greater the distinctions between his endless corruption and their enlightenment. Bruno stubbornly clings to his evil ways (which include torture, murder, investment fraud, and clubbing baby seals) in the face of overwhelming evidence of the Machiavellian power of enlightened self-interest. The Enemy of Ailix is a demon god named \\"Xu'buxx\\" and his crafty Hench-bird named \\"The Bluebird of Happiness\\". Both use Bruno and others for their own ends.  Main characters  The main characters are: ;Bruno : A strong and ambitious thief. Not very bright, but has gathered some fame as a bandit over the years. Currently, Bruno is 38 years old. He wields the \\"Sword Of The Truth,\\" a magical sword found in the caves beneath Mt.Grislydeth in the land of Maliceria, according to Milo According to Bruno, his sword was one of many mass-produced in the factories of Asuton. (Still, it is a lethal weapon, and also has a digital alarm clock.) ;Fiona : Bruno's sidekick. A micro-dragon, she tricked Bruno into becoming her boss. She acts as the conscience/brain of Bruno, but will betray him for her own benefit on any opportunity. There's a running gag where Fiona mistakenly gets referred to as a baby dragon, which annoys her. ;Maledict : An evil wizard, he is one of Bruno's many foes. However, since Bruno is not exactly good, they have allied (and betrayed each other) many times in the strip. In fact, Bruno meets Fiona for the first time during a mission for Maledict. ;Eunyce : Bruno's mother. While initially presented as a grounded older woman, she was eventually revealed to have been a Warrior hottie in her youth. From time to time, she dons her old outfit to help her son. ;Ambrose : Bruno's father, and the parent from whom he has taken his moral code. Ambrose was a bandit until recently. He lost an arm before the strip began (making him a literal \\"one-armed bandit\\"); a bonus story in one of the printed books explains the story behind the loss. He is married to Eunyce. ;Constable Oswold : Bruno's least favorite representative of the elite Rothland Imperial Guard. Rothland's above-ground institutions hobble themselves with ineffective and corrupt laws and regulations. Oswold's narrow-minded focus on obeying the law frequently prevents him from dealing with even the simplest of petty crimes, committed right under his nose. ;The Fame Vampires : Beautiful, undead, talented creatures whose life energy depends on the constant adulation of fans. If they lose their fan-base, and if the number of cameras on them reduces to zero, they dissolve into a grey powder, but can be reconstituted with the utterance of the correct punch-line into a normal Human, a H√§zbin, a Warrior Hottie, a Stage Mother, or a Fame Vulture. The latter crave infamy, and their life energy depends on continuous tabloid-oriented scandal and public opprobrium. ;Demons : Evil, often inept creatures from beyond known dimensions of space and time. One, a Dread Lord known as Num'thkul (numbskull), works as a bartender in Bruno's hometown. His ex-wife, a hideous female demon known as Shub Megawrath, has ten thousand children sired by Num'thkul, child number 666 being the most well-known and evil, possibly due to his name being a satanic number.

This type of investment is called foreign direct investment (FDI). BITs are established through trade pacts. A nineteenth-century forerunner of the BIT is the friendship, commerce, and navigation treaty (FCN).See W. Michael Reisman et al.,\\"International Law in Comparative Perspective\\" (2004), p. 460. Most BITs grant investments made by an investor of one Contracting State in the territory of the other a number of guarantees, which typically include fair and equitable treatment, protection from expropriation, free transfer of means and full protection and security. The distinctive feature of many BITs is that they allow for an alternative dispute resolution mechanism, whereby an investor whose rights under the BIT have been violated could have recourse to international arbitration, often under the auspices of the ICSID (International Center for the Settlement of Investment Disputes), rather than suing the host State in its own courts.See Jarrod Wong, \\"Umbrella Clauses In Bilateral Investment Treaties: Of Breaches of Contract, Treaty Violations, and the Divide Between Developing and Developed Countries In Foreign Investment Disputes\\", George Mason Law Review (14 Geo. Mason L. Rev. 135) (2007). This process is called investor-state dispute settlement. The world's first BIT was signed on November 25, 1959 between Pakistan and Germany. There are currently more than 2500 BITs in force, involving most countries in the world.See Rudolf Dolzer and Christoph Schreuer, Principles of International Investment Law, Oxford, 2008, p. 2.

Criticism  NGOs have spoken against the use of BITs, stating that they are mostly designed to protect the foreign investors and do not take into account obligations and standards to protect the environment, labour rights, social provisions or natural resources.

It had a population of 1,061,651 as of the 2010 Russian Census. Its three largest cities are Ivanovo (the administrative center), Kineshma, and Shuya. The principal center of tourism is Plyos. The Volga River flows through the northern part of the oblast. History St. Barbara Church, Plyos The Ivanovo region was early in its history a melting pot between different populations like Russians, Europeans, Asians and others.

This agreement would be abolished on 26 February 2002. Geography Ivanovo Oblast shares borders with Kostroma Oblast (N), Nizhny Novgorod Oblast (E), Vladimir Oblast (S), and Yaroslavl Oblast (W). Climate of Ivanovo Oblast is continental, with long, cold winters, and short, warm summers. The coldest month is January with average temperature of in the west and in the east. Warmest month is July with average temperature of about . Although larger than several of Russia's republics, Ivanovo Oblast is the smallest oblast by land area in Russia. Politics During the Soviet period, the high authority in the oblast was shared between three persons: the first secretary of the Ivanovo CPSU Committee (who in reality had the greatest authority), the chairman of the oblast Soviet (legislative power), and the Chairman of the oblast Executive Committee (executive power). Since 1991, CPSU has lost all power, when the head of the oblast administration, and eventually the governor, was appointed/elected alongside an elected regional parliament. The Charter of Ivanovo Oblast is the fundamental law of the region. The Legislative Assembly of Ivanovo Oblast is the province's standing legislative (representative) body. The Legislative Assembly exercises its authority by passing laws, resolutions, and other legal acts and by supervising the implementation and observance of the laws and other legal acts passed by it. The highest executive body is the Oblast Government, which includes territorial executive bodies such as district administrations, committees, and commissions that facilitate development and run the day-to-day matters of the province. The Oblast administration supports the activities of the Governor who is the highest official and acts as guarantor of the observance of the oblast Charter in accordance with the Constitution of Russia.

Its administrative center is Vologda. Population: 1,202,444 (2010 Census). The largest city is Cherepovets, the home of the Severstal metallurgical plant, the largest industrial enterprise in the oblast. Vologda Oblast is rich in historic monuments, such as the Kirillo-Belozersky Monastery, Ferapontov Monastery (a World Heritage Site) with the frescoes of Dionisius, medieval towns of Velikiy Ustyug and Belozersk, and baroque churches of Totma and Ustyuzhna. Large reserves of wood and fresh water are the main natural resources. History lithograph from 1897 The area of Vologda Oblast was settled by Finno-Ugric peoples since prehistory, and most of the toponyms in the region are in fact Finno-Ugric. Vepsians, who still live in the west of the oblast, are the descendants of that population. Subsequently, the area was colonized by the Russians. Belozersk was mentioned in chronicles in 862 as one of the oldest towns in Russia. Much of the area was controlled by the Novgorod Republic, in particular, Totma was founded in 1152. Veliky Ustyug and the west of the current territory of the Oblast, with Belozersk and Ustyuzhna, belonged to the Vladimir-Suzdal Principality and were constantly threatened by Novgorod. Not later than in the 13th century the Novgorod merchants already reached the White Sea. They reached the area by using the waterways. The main waterway to the White Sea was the Northern Dvina, and Novgorod merchants used the Volga and its tributary, the Sheksna, along the Slavyanka River into Lake Nikolskoye, then the boats were taken by land to Lake Blagoveshchenskoye, from there downstream along the Porozovitsa River into Lake Kubenskoye and further to the Sukhona and the Northern Dvina. In the 13th century, minor principalities started to proliferate. First, the Principality of Beloozero separated from Rostov. Its northern and northeastern parts in the 15th century became quasi-independent, forming smaller feudal states like the Principality of Zaozerye or the Principality of Kubena. Many smaller principalities are only mentioned once in chronicles, and the very existence of these principalities is questionable. Between 1452 and 1481, Vologda was the center of the Principality of Vologda, the last independent principality in Vologda lands. By the end of the 15th century, all these lands were a part of the Great Duchy of Moscow. In the 14th and the 15th centuries, the lands around Vologda became attractive for monks looking for desolate areas but still wishing to keep connections with the princes of Moscow. The princes, in their turn, viewed the monasteries as means to keep the influence of the Grand Duchy of Moscow in its remote areas. A number of influential monasteries, including Spaso-Prilutsky, Pavlo-Obnorsky, Kirillo-Belozersky, and Ferapontov monasteries, were founded. Kirillo-Belozersky Monastery soon became one of the most prominent Russian monasteries, with a lot of political influence, and successful economic development. In the middle of the 15th century, the Vologda Lands were strongly involved with the Muscovite Civil War: Thus, Vasily the Blind was exiled to Vologda in 1446 and was released from his allegiance oath by the hegumen of the Kirillo-Belozersky Monastery, and by the late 1440s the Sukhona valley became the battlefield between the retreating army of Dmitry Shemyaka and the army of Vasily, chasing Shemyaka. During the Time of Troubles, the area was ravaged by Polish troops, who at some point besieged Vologda but did not succeed in conquering the city. In the 17th century, Vologda was a prosperous city located on the main trading route from Moscow to Western Europe. During the reign of Tsar Peter the Great in the 18th century, Vologda became a shipbuilding center and played an important role in support of Russian military operations against Sweden. However, the importance of Vologda as a trade center was diminished after Saint Petersburg was founded in 1703, and the foreign trade was rerouted to the Baltic Sea. Peter even imposed restrictions on the White Sea trade. Vologda was the northernmost territory where serfdom existed in Russia. In the lands west and south of Vologda, estates existed, but to the north and east of Vologda serfdom was never implemented, and the population owned their land. In 1708, Peter the Great issued an edict which established seven governorates.–£–∫–∞–∑ –æ–± —É—á—Ä–µ–∂–¥–µ–Ω–∏–∏ –≥—É–±–µ—Ä–Ω–∏–π –∏ –æ —Ä–æ—Å–ø–∏—Å–∞–Ω–∏–∏ –∫ –Ω–∏–º –≥–æ—Ä–æ–¥–æ–≤ The description of the borders of the governorates was not given; instead, their area was defined as a set of towns and the lands adjacent to those towns. Two of the governorates, Archangelgorod Governorate (east of the oblast) and Ingermanland Governorate (west of the oblast), were located in the present-day area of Vologda oblast. Vologda became a part of Archangelgorod Governorate. Subsequently, the western part of the Oblast was transferred to Novgorod Governorate. In 1780, Vologda became the administrative center of Vologda Viceroyalty which included the territory of the former Archangelgorod Governorate. Eventually, the viceroyalty was transformed into Vologda Governorate. After a sequence of further administrative reforms, Vologda Oblast was established in 1937. During the Second World War, parts of Oshtinsky District in the west of the oblast became the only areas of Vologda Oblast to be occupied by foreign (Finnish) troops. The Finnish advance was stopped in October 1941, but the occupation continued till June 1944, when the Soviet Army started to advance. In 1955, the construction of Severstal in the city of Cherepovets, the biggest industrial enterprise in the oblast, was completed. On 4 July 1997, Vologda, alongside Bryansk, Chelyabinsk, Magadan, and Saratov signed a power-sharing agreement with the government of Russia, granting it autonomy. The agreement would be abolished on 15 March 2002. Politics Legislative Assembly of the Vologda Oblast During the Soviet period, the high authority in the oblast was shared between three persons: The first secretary of the Vologda CPSU Committee (who in reality had the biggest authority), the chairman of the oblast Soviet (legislative power), and the Chairman of the oblast Executive Committee (executive power). Since 1991, CPSU lost all the power, and the head of the Oblast administration, and eventually the governor was appointed/elected alongside elected regional parliament. The politics in the oblast is governed by the Charter of Vologda Oblast. The laws within the authority of the oblast are passed by the Legislative Assembly of Vologda Oblast which is the legislative (representative) body. The highest executive body is the Vologda Oblast Administration. It also includes the executive bodies of the subdivisions such as districts, and is responsible for the daily administration. The Oblast administration supports the activities of the Governor who is the head of the oblast and acts as guarantor of the observance of the Charter in accordance with the Constitution of Russia. First secretaries of the Vologda Oblast CPSU Committee In the period when they were the most important authority in the oblast (1937 to 1991), the following first secretaries were appointed *1937 Grigory Andreyevich Ryabov, executed during the Great Purge; *1937-1942 Pavel Timofeyevich Komarov; *1942-1945 Boris Fyodorovich Nikolayev; *1945-1952 Vasily Nikitich Derbinov; *1952-1955 Alexey Vladimirovich Syomin; *1955-1960 Ivan Sergeyevich Latunov; *1960-1961 Vadim Sergeyevich Milov; *1961-1985 Anatoly Semyonovich Drygin; *1985-1990 Valentin Alexandrovich Kuptsov; *1990-1991 Vladimir Ivanovich Saranskikh.

Vologda Oblast is located on the East European Plain, and most of it represents forested hilly landscape. The southwest of the oblast, along the Sheksna and the Mologa, is flat. The northwestern part is mostly of glacial origin, with the Andoma Hills, the Veps Hills, and a number of minor hill chains. In the east of the oblast, the valleys of the Vaga, the Sukhona, and the Yug are cut through the hills. The southeast of the oblast is occupied by the Northern Ridge, which is located south of the valley of the Sukhona. Much of the area of the oblast is occupied by coniferous forest (taiga) and by swamps. Hills in Vologda Oblast. Northwest of the city of Vologda, close to the selo of Molochnoye. The area of Vologda Oblast is split between the basins of the White Sea, the Baltic Sea, and the Caspian Sea. In the northeast of the oblast, in Vologodsky district, there is a point which is a triple divide of the river basins of the Neva (Baltic Sea), the Volga (Caspian Sea), and the Onega (White Sea), and thus the basins of the Atlantic Ocean, the Arctic Ocean, and the endorheic basins of the interior of Eurasia. This is one of the very few such triple divides in the world and the only one in Russia. The southwestern shore of Lake Onega, one of the biggest freshwater lakes in Europe, belongs to Vologda Oblast, and the tributaries of Lake Onega, the biggest of which are the Vytegra River and the Andoma River, belong to the river basin of the Neva and thus drain to the Baltic Sea. Also, minor areas in the west of the oblast drain into the Oyat River which is a right tributary of the Svir and belongs to the basin of the Neva. The western part of the oblast drains into the Rybinsk Reservoir of the Volga. The biggest tributaries of the reservoir are the Mologa, the Suda, the Sogozha, and the Sheksna. Lake Beloye, one of the biggest lakes in the oblast, is the source of the Sheksna. Some areas in the south of the oblast drain into tributaries of the Volga, including the Unzha. Lake Vozhe in the northwest of the Oblast, with its main tributary, the Vozhega, drains in the Onega River in the White Sea basin. The rest of the oblast, including Lake Kubenskoye, another major lake in the oblast, belongs to the river basin of the Northern Dvina. The Northern Dvina is formed in the northeast of the oblast from merging of the Sukhona and the Yug. The Sukhona forms the major waterway of Vologda Oblast. Another major tributary of the Norther Dvina, which has its source in Vologda Oblast, is the Vaga. Two areas in Vologda Oblast have been designated as protected natural areas of federal significance. These are Russky Sever National Park in the center of the oblast and Darwin Nature Reserve in the southwest of the oblast (shared with Yaroslavl Oblast). Demographics Population: Ethnic composition (2010): *Russians - 97.3% *Ukrainians - 0.7% *Belarusians - 0.3% *Veps - 0.04 *Others - 1.7% *58,511 people were registered from administrative databases, and could not declare an ethnicity. It is estimated that the proportion of ethnicities in this group is the same as that of the declared group. ;Vital statistics for 2012 *Births: 16 678 (13.9 per 1000) *Deaths: 18 013 (15.0 per 1000) *Total fertility rate: 2009 - 1.61  2010 - 1.60  2011 - 1.68  2012 - 1.84  2013 - 1.85  2014 - 1.86  2015 - 1.92  2016 - 1.90(e) Babayevsky and Vytegorsky District in the northwest of the oblast belong to the areas traditionally populated by Vepsians. The Vepsians living in Vologda Oblast speak the central group of Veps dialects. Religion According to a 2012 survey 29.5% of the population of Vologda Oblast adheres to the Russian Orthodox Church, 2% are unaffiliated generic Christians, 1% are Orthodox Christian believers not belonging to any church or belonging to non-Russian Orthodox churches, 1% are adherents of the Slavic native faith (Rodnovery), and 1% are Old Believers. In addition, 39% of the population declared to be \\"spiritual but not religious\\", 20% is atheist, and 6.5% follows other religions or did not give an answer to the question. Administrative divisions The oblast is administratively divided into four cities and towns under the oblast's jurisdiction (Vologda, Cherepovets, Sokol, and Veliky Ustyug) and twenty-six districts. Another ten towns (Babayevo, Belozersk, Gryazovets, Kadnikov, Kharovsk, Kirillov, Nikolsk, Totma, Ustyuzhna, and Vytegra) have the status of the towns of district significance. The town of Krasavino is under administrative jurisdiction of Veliky Ustyug Town of Oblast Significance. Economy=Industry The biggest industrial enterprise of Vologda Oblast is the Severstal steel plant located in the city of Cherepovets. The metallurgical industry is responsible for approximately 50% of the total industrial production of the oblast. it is followed by chemical (also based in Cherepovets), food, and timber industries, and the machine building industry. Metallurgy was a traditional industry developed in the region since the 16th century, when its center was located in Ustyuzhna. Another traditional industries were salt production (around Totma) and glass making (in what is currently Chagodoshchensky District). In the 18th century, timber production started to grow rapidly. In the 19th century, the textile industry enterprises making flax textiles started to proliferate. In 1871, the Danish merchant Friedrich Buman opened a specialized butter factory in the manor of Fominskoye (13 km northwest of Vologda). It was the first butter factory both in Vologda Governorate and in Russia. Since then Vologda became the center of the butter industry, and the Vologda butter, a special type of butter with the taste of nuts invented by Nikolay Vereschagin and Buman, became a world trademark. Agriculture Young Russian peasant women in front of traditional wooden house, in a rural area along the Sheksna River near Kirillov. Early color photograph from Russia, created by Sergey Prokudin- Gorsky. The agriculture in the oblast is essentially cattle breeding with milk and meat production, production of eggs, growing of crops, flax, potatoes, and vegetables. In 2008, 73% of all agricultural products were produced by large- scale farms. Transportation The area of current Vologda Oblast has always been located on the trading routes connecting central Russia to the White Sea, and, in fact, in the 17th century the White Sea was the main sea export route for Russia. The whole course of the Sukhona is navigable, as well as the lower courses of some of its tributaries, including the Vologda. However, there is currently very little or no regular passenger navigation on the Sukhona. Volga‚ÄìBaltic Waterway, first constructed in the 19th century as the Mariinsk Canal System and then reconstructed in the 20th century, connects the river basins of the Volga and the Neva via the Sheksna, Lake Beloye, the Kovzha, and the Vytegra, and is one of the main waterways in European Russia. The Northern Dvina Canal connects the Sheksna and Lake Kubenskoye, thus being a connection between the river basins of the Volga and the Northern Dvina. One of the principal highways in Russia, M8, connects Moscow and Arkhangelsk, and passes Vologda. This highway is paved and heavily used. Other important paved roads include A114 highway, connecting Vologda to Cherepovets and Saint Petersburg, the roads connecting Vologda to Kirillov (the part which continues to Lipin Bor, Vytegra, and Pudozh, is partially paved), Vologda to Veliky Ustyug via Totma, Totma to Nikolsk via Imeni Babushkina, and Kotlas to Manturovo and eventually to Kostroma and Moscow via Veliky Ustyug and Nikolsk. There are connections from Ustyuzhna to Pestovo and Vesyegonsk. However, the road network is underdeveloped, especially close to the borders of the oblast. There is only one road crossing from Vologda Oblast to Kostroma Oblast. Several roads cross into Kirov Oblast, but they are all unpaved and badly maintained. So is the connection between Lipin Bor and Kargopol. In the west of the oblast, there are very few through roads even across the district boundaries. Nevertheless, the vast majority of settlements have road connections of some quality, the roads are used for timber transportation, and there is regular bus service on the main roads. Belorucheyskaya forest railway in 2015 The principal railway line in the oblast is the railroad connecting Moscow and Arkhangelsk. The piece between Vologda and Arkhangelsk was constructed in the 1890s. A branch from Konosha eastwards to Kotlas and further to Vorkuta, which crosses the north of the oblast, was constructed in the 1940s to facilitate the transport of coal from the Komi Republic. The railway connecting Vologda with Saint Petersburg via Cherepovets was built in the 1900s. There is also a railway connecting Vologda via Vokhtoga to Buy. At Vokhtoga, the Monza Railroad branches off east. It was built for timber transport and is operated by the timber production authorities. The Monza railroad runs along the border of Vologda and Kostroma Oblasts. The plans to extend it further east to Nikolsk were never realized. The Monza Railroad has a separate station in Vokhoga, Vokhtoga-2 railway station. The headquarters of the Monzales company which owns the railroad are located in Vokhtoga. A big number of narrow gauge railways have been built in the 1950s and 1960s to facilitate the transport of timber, but since then most of these became unprofitable and have been destroyed. Currently, the local aviation has almost disappeared. There is an airport in Vologda. Locally, there is infrequent service to Veliky Ustyug, Kichmengsky Gorodok, and Vytegra. The oil transport system, Baltic Pipeline System, runs through the oblast, with three oil- pumping stations located at Nyuksenitsa, Pogorelovo, and Gryazovets. Arts and culture=Architecture Church of the Entry into Jerusalem, Totma Three of the towns in the oblast‚ÄîBelozersk, Totma, and Veliky Ustyug‚Äîare classified as historical towns by the Ministry of Culture of Russian Federation, which implies certain restrictions on construction in their historical centers. The old center of Vologda until the 1990s contained many wooden houses, including five wooden classicist manors, protected by the government as cultural heritage monuments. Despite the protection, many of these burnt down, or were simply demolished. Still, many buildings, including four classicist manors, survive, and make Vologda one of the biggest collection of wooden town houses of the 19th century in Russia. Some of the best examples of rural wooden architecture are collected in open-air Ethnographic Museum in Semyonkovo, northwest of Vologda. Several cities and towns in Vologda Oblast preserved their architectural heritage. In contrast to many other Russian towns in the 1920s and 1930s, Veliky Ustyug was left intact and declared the national cultural heritage very early after 1917. It preserved therefore almost all of its historic center. Vologda, Belozersk, Totma, Gryazovets, and Ustyuzhna keep many of their historical buildings. In particular, several churches in Totma were built in the 18th century in the unique style which is sometimes referred to as Totma Baroque. The relative desolation of Vologda lands attracted monks looking for solitude, resulting in numerous monasteries. The Kirillo-Belozersky Monastery, the Spaso-Prilutsky Monastery, the Goritsky Monastery, and the Troitse-Gledensky Monastery represent examples of Russian medieval fortification architecture and also contain buildings rated among the best preserved cultural heritage. The Ferapontov Monastery, included into the World Heritage list, contains the only survived fully painted church in Russia with the frescoes of Dionisius. As of 2010, four of the monasteries in Vologda Oblast were acting: the Kirillo- Belozersky, the Spaso-Prilutsky, the Goritsky, and the Pavlo-Obnorsky monasteries.

Thus, Konstantin Batyushkov, a poet, was born and raised in his estate in Danilovskoye, but became a notable author after he moved to the state service to Saint Petersburg, and he only returned to Vologda (where he eventually died) after he developed a mental illness. Igor Severyanin, a 20th-century poet, spent considerable periods of his life in the estate of his uncle, Vladimirovka, close to the city of Cherepovets. In the 20th century, two of the authors of the Village prose movement in Soviet literature, which predominantly described rural life, were tightly connected with Vologda Region. Vasily Belov was born in the village of Timonikha, currently in Kharovsky District, and lives in Vologda. Alexander Yashin was born in Nikolsky District and completed his studies in Nikolsk, but then moved to Moscow. A poet Nikolay Rubtsov spent much of his life in Vologda Oblast before being killed in a domestic dispute in 1971. Yury Koval, mainly known for his children's books, spent considerable periods of his life in Vologda Oblast. Handicrafts Various handicrafts were developed in the area. A number of those are protected by law. References=NotesSources * * Bibliography *Brumfield, William.

Bryansford House, better known as Tollymore Park, in County Down (demolished 1952) Earl of Roden is a title in the Peerage of Ireland. It was created in 1771 for Robert Jocelyn, 2nd Viscount Jocelyn. This branch of the Jocelyn family descends from the 1st Viscount, prominent Irish lawyer and politician Robert Jocelyn, the son of Thomas Jocelyn, third son of Sir Robert Jocelyn, 1st Baronet, of Hyde Hall (see below). He notably served as Lord Chancellor of Ireland from 1739 to 1756. In 1743 he was raised to the Peerage of Ireland as Baron Newport, of Newport, and in 1755 he was further honoured when he was made Viscount Jocelyn, also in the Peerage of Ireland. He was succeeded by his son, the second Viscount. He represented Old Leighlin in the Irish House of Commons and served as Auditor-General of Ireland. In 1770 he also succeeded his first cousin once removed as fifth Baronet of Hyde Hall. In 1771 he was created Earl of Roden, of High Roding in the County of Tipperary, in the Peerage of Ireland. Lord Roden married Lady Anne Hamilton, daughter of James Hamilton, 1st Earl of Clanbrassil and sister of James Hamilton, 2nd Earl of Clanbrassil, a title which became extinct in 1798. Lord Roden was succeeded by his son, the second Earl. He sat in the Irish House of Commons for Dundalk and served as an Irish Representative Peer in the British House of Lords between 1800 and 1820. He was also a professional soldier who played a decisive, if somewhat ruthless role in suppressing the Irish Rebellion of 1798. His son, the third Earl, represented County Louth in the British House of Commons and was Auditor-General of the Exchequer in Ireland. In 1821 he was created Baron Clanbrassil, of Hyde Hall in the County of Hertford and Dundalk in the County of Louth, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, which gave him and his descendants an automatic seat in the House of Lords. This was a revival of the Clanbrassil title held by his ancestors the Earls of Clanbrassil. Lord Roden was a leading figure in the Protestant Second Reformation. His grandson, the fourth Earl, Viscount Jocelyn's son, served in the second Conservative administration of Benjamin Disraeli as a Lord-in- Waiting (government whip in the House of Lords) from 1874 to 1880. He died at an early age and was succeeded by his uncle, the fifth Earl. When he died in 1897 the barony of Clanbrassil became extinct. He was succeeded in the Irish titles by his first cousin, the sixth Earl. He was the son of the Hon. John Jocelyn, fourth son of the second Earl. On his death the titles were inherited by his younger brother, the seventh Earl. His son, the eighth Earl, sat in the House of Lords as a Representative Peer between 1919 and 1956. the titles are held by his grandson, the tenth Earl, who succeeded his father in 1993. The Jocelyn Baronetcy, of Hyde Hall in the County of Hertford, was created in the Baronetage of England in 1665 for Robert Jocelyn. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Baronet. This line of the family failed on the death of his younger son, the fourth Baronet, in 1778. The late Baronet was succeeded by his first cousin once removed, the first Earl of Roden. The family seat was Hyde Hall, near Sawbridgeworth, Hertfordshire, and Tollymore Park, near Bryansford, County Down. The Earls of Roden were associated with the County Louth town of Dundalk for over three centuries; in July 2006 the freehold of the town was sold by auction.Fiona Gartland, \\"Freehold of Dundalk sold at auction\\" in The Irish Times dated 22 July 2006 Descendants of the Earls of Roden are also known to be living in the area of Beechlawn, Coolock, on the northside of Dublin.

Origin of the name  The name comes from the CRM-114 Discriminator in the Stanley Kubrick movie Dr. Strangelove - a piece of radio equipment designed to filter out messages lacking a specific code-prefix.  Operation  While others have done statistical Bayesian spam filtering based upon the frequency of single word occurrences in email, CRM114 achieves a higher rate of spam recognition through creating hits based upon phrases up to five words in length. These phrases are used to form a Markov Random Field representing the incoming texts. With this additional contextual recognition, it is one of the more accurate spam filters available. Initial testing in 2002 by author Bill Yerazunis\\"The antispam man \\", March 19, 2007, Cara Garretson, Network World gave a 99.87% accuracy;\\"Bill Yerazunis: Better Than Human\\", Paul Graham's website Holden Spam Filtering II and TREC 2005 and 2006.Spam Track Overview (2005) - TREC 2005Spam Track Overview (2006) - TREC 2005 gave results of better than 99%, with significant variation depending on the particular corpus. CRM114's classifier can also be switched to use Littlestone's Winnow algorithm, character-by-character correlation, a variant on KNN (K-nearest neighbor algorithm) classification called Hyperspace, a bit-entropic classifier that uses entropy encoding to determine similarity, a SVM, by mutual compressibility as calculated by a modified LZ77 algorithm, and other more experimental classifiers. The actual features matched are based on a generalization of skip-grams. The CRM114 algorithms are multi-lingual (compatible with UTF-8 encodings) and null-safe. A voting set of CRM114 classifiers have been demonstrated to detect confidential versus non- confidential documents written in Japanese at better than 99.9% detection rate and a 5.3% false alarm rate.https://media.blackhat.com/bh- us-10/whitepapers/Yerazunis/BlackHat-USA-2010-Yerazunis-Confidential-Mail- Filtering-wp.pdf CRM114 is a good example of pattern recognition software, demonstrating how machine learning can be accomplished with a reasonably simple algorithm. The program's C source code is available under the GPL. At a deeper level, CRM114 is also a string pattern matching language, similar to grep or even Perl; although it is Turing complete it is highly tuned for matching text, and even a simple (recursive) definition of the factorial takes almost ten lines. Part of this is because the crm114 language syntax is not positional, but declensional. As a programming language, it may be used for many other applications aside from detecting spam. CRM114 uses the TRE approximate-match regex engine, so it is possible to write programs that do not depend on absolutely identical strings matching to function correctly. CRM114 has been applied to email filtering in the KMail client and a number of other applications, including detection of bots on Twitter and Yahoo, Detecting Automation of Twitter Accounts: Are You a Human, Bot, or Cyborg?\\", Zi Chu, Steven Gianvecchio, Haining Wang, Sushil Jajodia, IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing, 2012 vol 9, pages 811-824, https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/sec08/tech/full_papers/gianvecchio/gianvecchio_html/index.html as well as the first-level filter in the US Dept of Transportation's vehicle defect detection system. https://www.oig.dot.gov/sites/default/files/NHTSA%20Safety- Related%20Vehicle%20Defects%20-%20Final%20Report%5E6-18-15.pdf It has also been used as a predictive method for classifying fault-prone software modules.https://www.st.cs.uni- saarland.de/edu/softmine2007/Projects/28300004.pdf See also * String matching ReferencesExternal links * The CRM114 home page on SourceForge * The TRE approximate regex matcher homepage Category:Spam filtering ","title":"CRM114 (program)"},{"id":"463950","text":"Vologda () is a city and the administrative, cultural, and scientific center of Vologda Oblast, Russia, located on the river Vologda within the watershed of the Northern Dvina.

The Ministry of Culture of the Russian Federation has classified Vologda as an historic city, one of forty- one in Russia and one of only three in Vologda Oblast. 224 buildings in Vologda have been officially recognized as cultural heritage monuments. Culture in the Vologda region: Vologda city History=Foundation Two conflicting theories exist as to the date of Vologda's foundation.

The date of the foundation of the monastery is then taken as the date of the foundation of the city of Vologda and is mentioned in official city documents.Official website of Vologda Oblast Government: A brief history of Vologda This date, which would make Vologda to be of the same age as Moscow, is, however, not supported by any scientific data and is considered by authoritative sources to be fictional. The story was only written in 1666 by a certain Foma, who got a request from Archbishop Markel to produce the vita of Gerasimus. Foma himself admitted that he had no sufficient data on the biography. The story contains many contradicting details. Besides, the monastic life in the Russian north was not known in the 12th century: the first monastery in Vladimir was founded in 1152, in Rostov in 1212, in the Belozersk area in 1251. Archeological excavations do not confirm this date either. Instead, they demonstrate that the city of Vologda was founded in the 13th century. The year 1264 was the first mention of Vologda when it was included in the list of possessions of the Novgorod Republic in the agreement between the Republic and the Grand Prince of Vladimir. This date is also supported by archaeological data. The nucleus of Vologda in the 13th century was not located in the area which is now the city center, but rather the area known now as \\"Lazy ground\\" (), close to the Resurrection church. This area was the center of Vologda up to 1565. Until that year, no stone constructions existed in Vologda; all of the city fortifications, bridges, houses, churches, and industrial enterprises were made of wood. Before the 16th century The unique position of Vologda on important waterways connecting Moscow, Novgorod, and the White Sea (via the Northern Dvina) made it attractive for the Novgorod Republic, as well as for the princes of Tver and Moscow, who fought numerous wars between the 13th and the 15th centuries. In 1371, Dmitry Prilutsky, a monk from the Nikolsky Monastery in Pereslavl-Zalessky, founded Nikolsky Monastery, now known as Spaso-Prilutsky Monastery, close to the city. Dmitry Donskoy, the Grand Prince of Moscow, was the chief benefactor of the monastery and viewed it as a stronghold of the influence of the Grand Duchy of Moscow in the Northern lands in competition with Novgorod. In 1397, during the reign of Vasily I, Vologda was added to the Grand Duchy of Moscow. Subsequently, the city was several times attacked by Novgorod forces. During the Muscovite Civil War, Vologda played a key role. After Vasily II the Blind, the Grand Prince of Moscow, was defeated by Dmitry Shemyaka in 1447, he swore to never start a war against Shemyaka, was exiled to Vologda, and got the city as a personal possession. From there Vasily traveled to the Kirillo-Belozersky Monastery where the hegumen released him from the oath. The civil war continued, and in 1450, Vologda was besieged by the troops of Dmitry Shemyaka; however, they did not manage to occupy the town. After the death of Vasily in 1462, Vologda passed to the possession of his son Andrey Menshoy and became the center of the Principality of Vologda. In 1481, after the death of Andrey who had no successors, Vologda passed to Ivan III, the Grand Duke of Moscow, and was included to the Grand Duchy of Moscow. Times of Ivan the Terrible During the reign of Tsar Ivan the Terrible, Vologda became one of the major transit centers of Russia's trade. The foreign trade was conducted mostly with England, Holland, and other western countries via the White Sea. Arkhangelsk was the major foreign trade haven, and Vologda stood on the waterway connecting Moscow with Arkhangelsk. The trade with Siberia was conducted via the Sukhona and the Vychegda, and Vologda also played an important role as a transit center. The state courtyard was built in the city on the bank of the Vologda. In 1553, Vologda was visited by the English seafarer Richard Chancellor who officially established diplomatic relations between the Tsardom of Russia and England. In 1554, trading agent John Gass described Vologda to English merchants as a city with an abundance of bread where the goods were twice as cheap as in Moscow and Novgorod, and that there was no city in Russia that would not trade with Vologda. Following the reports of John Gass, in 1555 England opened a trading office in the city, and the first Russian ambassador sent to England for negotiations became Osip Nepeya, a native of Vologda. In 1565, Ivan the Terrible introduced the policy of Oprichnina and included Vologda into the structure of Oprichnina lands. That year, he visited the city for the first time and decided to make it the center of Oprichnina and consequently the capital of the country. The Tsar ordered to build a new fortress. It was decided to build it not in the former town center, but rather in another part of the town, limited on the one side by the river, and on the other side by what are now Leningradskaya, Oktyabrskaya, and Mira Streets. The fortress was surrounded by a moat. Ivan the Terrible traveled to Vologda in person to supervise the foundation of the fortress on April 28, 1566, which was the day to celebrate the memory of Saint Jason (Nason in Russian tradition) and Saint Sosipater. Therefore, the territory of the fortress located in the new part of Vologda was named the \\"Nason-gorod\\" (Nason-town). The other name of the Nason-gorod was the Vologda Kremlin (currently the name is sometimes referred only to the Bishop's courtyard). St. Sophia Cathedral Between 1568 and 1570, a new cathedral was built in the new fortress. The Saint Sophia Cathedral became the first stone building in Vologda. The design of the cathedral copied the Dormition Cathedral of the Moscow Kremlin. This was the idea of Ivan the Terrible who wanted to make his new capital similar to Moscow. He personally supervised the construction, headed by the architect Razmysl Petrov. In 1571, Vologda became the center of the Diocese of Vologda and Perm that was formed in 1492 and previously had its main church in the distant settlement of Ust-Vym in Perm lands. Thereby, Vologda was strengthened not only in trading, military and political influence, but also in ecclesiastical affairs. However, in 1571 Ivan the Terrible unexpectedly stopped the construction work in Vologda and left the city for good. Presumably, this was connected with his decision to abolish Oprichnina, and Vologda was not needed as the second capital any longer. According to the legend, when Ivan visited the Saint Sophia Cathedral, a little stone fell from the roof on his head. The superstitious Tsar who received a serious head injury took it as an sign of misfortune and decided to leave the city. In any case, it is known that the Tsar wanted even to demolish the cathedral, and that the cathedral was never consecrated during his lifetime. The consecration took place only during the reign his son Feodor I in 1587. Parts of the incomplete fortress which were later in the 17th century strengthened with wooden walls stayed up to the 19th century when they were disassembled by the city authorities and local residents and used as a material for stone building. Time of Troubles The Time of Troubles for Vologda began with a plague epidemic in 1605. In 1608, when Russia was split into areas controlled by Tsar Vasily Shuysky and areas controlled by the pretender False Dmitry II supported by Polish troops, the people of Vologda made an oath to False Dmitry. By gaining Vologda not only did he get control over Russian and English trading warehouses, but he also positioned himself to gain control over northern Russia. However, abuses and property seizures by the new administration sent to Vologda caused extreme discontent among the population. As a result, Vologda denounced False Dmitry II and supported Shuysky. Moreover, in February 1609 a national home guard headed by Nikita Vysheslavtsev was formed in Vologda and went to fight against False Dmitry II. In 1612, people of Vologda rendered sizable food and military help to the home guard organized by Kuzma Minin and Dmitry Pozharsky, which eventually defeated Polish troops. However, after the city sent huge military forces to support the second home guard, it remained without sufficient protection, and on September 22, 1612 one of the Lithuanian extortionate groups seized Vologda without resistance, later burning down the city and killing and imprisoning many of its inhabitants. Under the Romanovs Vologda butter After 1613, Vologda quickly recovered due to its convenient location and once again became an important center of foreign trade. During the reign of Peter the Great, Vologda became one of the main military bases of Russia. Military and technical equipment for fortresses and military ships under construction was stored there. Vessels which delivered food supplies to Arkhangelsk were constructed in Vologda. Peter intended to hold them on Lake Kubenskoye, north of Vologda. However, after personally inspecting the lake in 1692, he abandoned the idea deciding that the lake is improper for that purpose. Peter the Great visited Vologda on no less than ten occasions, on six of which (in 1692, 1693, 1694, 1702, 1722, and 1724) he stayed in the city for extended time. He always stayed in a small house of the Dutch merchant Goutman, which in 1872 was bought by the city authorities, and in 1885 was transformed into the memorial museum of Peter the Great and became the first museum of Vologda. However, after St. Petersburg was founded and foreign trade was rerouted to the Baltic Sea, the importance of Vologda as a center of foreign trade decayed. In 1722, Peter issued the decree restricting trade through Arkhangelsk, which damaged Vologda even further. In the course of the administrative reform carried out in 1708, Vologda lost its functions as an administrative center and was included as a town of Archangelgorod Governorate. The revival began only during the reign of Catherine the Great who in 1780 made Vologda the center of Vologda Viceroyalty, a successor of Archangelgorod Governorate. In 1796, the viceroyalty, administered by a governor-general, was transformed into Vologda Governorate, the borders of which stretched up to the Ural mountains in the east. The center of Vologda was rebuilt according to the plan of a provincial city issued in 1781. The street network is still in use now. A new economic lifting of the city was connected with a steamship movement across the Sukhona and with the building of a new railroad line connecting Vologda with Yaroslavl and Moscow (1872), with Arkhangelsk (1898), with St. Petersburg and Vyatka (1905). In 1871, the Danish merchant Friedrich Buman opened a specialized butter factory in the manor of Fominskoye, from Vologda. It was the first butter factory both in Vologda Governorate and in Russia. Since then Vologda became the center of the butter industry, and the Vologda butter, a special type of butter with the taste of nuts invented by Nikolay Vereschagin and Buman, became a world trademark. In 1911, the manor of Fominskoye together with the Buman's creamery was given to the state and became the base for the Vologda dairy institute. Thereby Vologda turned to one of the largest dairy centers of Russia. Since the 15th century, Vologda was a political exile destination and was even known as \\"Siberia close to the capital\\". In the 19th‚Äì20th centuries, such persons as Joseph Stalin, Vyacheslav Molotov (later the Minister of Foreign Affairs), Nikolai Berdyaev (the famous Russian philosopher), Boris Savinkov (later known as a successful terrorist), Mariya Ulyanova, and Alexander Bogdanov were sent to Vologda. Anatoly Lunacharsky chose to go there to join Bogdanov, and to marry Anna Alexandrovna Malinovskaya, Bogdanov's sister. Soviet period Soviet power was established in Vologda in December 1917, and up to the summer of 1918 co-existed with the zemstvo and municipal administration. In February 1918, Vologda became the \\"diplomatic capital of Russia\\" for several months. Embassies located in Saint Petersburg were threatened by the German army, so Western powers, led by American Ambassador David R. Francis, relocated them to Vologda. However, pressured by the Bolsheviks, on July 24, 1918 the diplomats were compelled to leave Vologda and repatriate via Arkhangelsk. During the Russian Civil War, Vologda was the location of the headquarters of the 6th Red Army. The army opposed the White Army under command of Evgeny Miller and the military forces of Entente in northern Russia. In 1924 the government ordered to close the Vsegradsky cathedral, that used to be one of the biggest and most revered in the city. In 1929, the Vologda Governorate was abolished and included into the structure of a new formation, Northern Krai, which also included former Arkhangelsk and Northern Dvina Governorates, as well as the Komi-Zyryan Autonomous Oblast. The administrative center of Northern Krai was located in Arkhangelsk. In December 1936, Northern Krai was abolished and divided into the Komi ASSR and Northern Oblast, with the administrative center still located in Arkhangelsk. On September 23, 1937, Northern Oblast was divided into Arkhangelsk Oblast and Vologda Oblast by the decision of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union. According to the same decision, districts of former Cherepovets Okrug of Leningrad Oblast were attached to Vologda Oblast. These districts currently make for the western part of Vologda Oblast. Thereby the current borders of Vologda Oblast were determined. In the 1930s, a flax factory, a coach-repair factory, and a sawmill, \\"Northern Communard,\\" were constructed. During World War II, martial law was declared in Vologda, and its industrial enterprises shifted to military production. In the fall of 1941, Finnish troops crossed the borders of Vologda Oblast, and Vologda thus became a front city. The inhabitants were mobilized to dig trenches. In the city, bomb-proof shelters and elementary shelters were under construction, systems of air defense which protected the railway junction and the military-industrial enterprises were developed. As a result, though attempts of bombardments were numerous, no bombs fell on the city. To commemorate these events, a monument to the air defense forces was later erected on Zosimovskaya Street in Vologda. The monument has the shape of an anti-aircraft gun. In addition, Vologda was a railway hub used to supply the army and to evacuate equipment. It also served as a large hospital center. Residents of Vologda donated blood, money, and jewellery. The tank detachment \\"Vologda Collective Farmer\\" was funded by these donations. To commemorate these events the monument to the tank T-34 was built on Mira Street. Between 1961 and 1985, Anatoly Drygin was the first secretary of the CPSU Vologda Oblast Committee and the head of the oblast. During this period, notable changes in many aspects of economy both of the city and of the oblast occurred. In particular, a bearing plant, a mechanical plant, and an optical- mechanical factory were built in Vologda. A polytechnical university was opened. A large-scale poultry farm was established. A major construction initiative was carried out, and, in particular, the first buildings higher than five floors were constructed. The city expanded, with new residential areas built; in particular, Byvalovo, GPZ, the 5th and the 6th Microdistricts. In 1976, the Vologda trolleybus system opened. Post-Soviet period In November 1991, the city administration was formed and the reform of local governments began. In October 1993, the Soviets of People's Deputies of all levels were abolished. After the dissolution of the Vologda Soviet, the City Duma was established. The first Duma elections took place on March 20, 1994. This first Duma only had six seats, but in 1995, after the next elections, it was expanded to thirty deputies. On July 25, 1996, the City Duma adopted the main city document: the Charter of Vologda. On October 6, 1996, the first mayoral elections in the history of Vologda took place. Alexey Yakunichev was elected and became the head of the city. His term ended in 2008. In 2003, the construction of a ring road started. Before that, the –ú8 highway connecting Moscow and Arkhangelsk run through the city center causing congestion. After the completion, the ring road connects the highways –ê114 (Vologda ‚Äì Novaya Ladoga), –†5 (Vologda ‚Äì Medvezhyegorsk), and –ú8 (Moscow ‚Äì Arkhangelsk). On August 25, 2005, the City Duma approved the new Charter of Vologda. Even though the deputies introduced more than four hundred amendments and the document increased more than twice in volume as compared with the Charter of 1996, the changes were relatively minor. On October 12, 2008, Yevgeny Shulepov was elected to be the City Head.

The reason is that Vologda is not only a big city but also the administrative center of Vologda Oblast. Around 43 million hectares of farmland is unused, hence government has announced giving away free land. Vologda will lend 468,000 hectares of land for agriculture and raising livestock purpose. Culture and art Vologda is one of the best preserved big cities of Russia combining traditional wooden architecture and stone monuments. In Vologda, 193 monuments of architecture and history are designated as cultural monuments of federal significance.

Fort Irwin is at an average elevation of . It is located northeast of Barstow, in the Calico Mountains. The National Training Center is part of the US Army Forces Command (FORSCOM). The opposing force at the National Training Center (NTC) is the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment, the Blackhorse Cavalry, who are stationed at the base to provide an opposing force to units on a training rotation at Fort Irwin. In September 2017, a state-of-the-art hospital was opened that provides healthcare services to the Fort Irwin beneficiaries. Fort Irwin works within the R-2502 Special Use Airspace Complex. The 2010 United States census reported Fort Irwin's population was 8,845. History The Fort Irwin area has a history dating back almost 15,000 years, when Native Americans of the Lake Mojave Period were believed to live in the area. Native American settlements and pioneer explorations in the area were first recorded when the Spanish missionary Padre Francisco Garces traveled the Mohave Trail with Mohave Indian guides in 1776. During his travels, he noted several small bands of Indians, and is believed to have been the first European to make contact with the Native Americans of the area. Jedediah Smith is thought to have been the first American to explore the area in 1826. A fur trapper, Smith was soon followed by other pioneers traveling the Old Spanish Trail between Santa Fe and Los Angeles. The trail crossed the area on the eastern edge of Fort Irwin, between Salt Spring and the Mojave River. The Old Spanish Trail passed through Silurian Valley, then west through the Avawatz Mountains at Red Pass and beyond the playa of Red Pass Lake, through a gap between the Soda and Tiefort Mountains to Bitter Spring in a wash in the next valley. Bitter Spring was the only reliable watering and grazing place along the route. From Bitter Spring the trail led 18.75 miles southwest climbing Alvord Mountain to cross Impassable Pass to descend Spanish Canyon and cross the plains to the location of Fork of the Road on the north side of the Mojave River where it met the Mohave Trail. In 1844, Captain John C. Fremont, accompanied by Kit Carson, was the first member of the US Army to visit the Fort Irwin area. Captain Fremont established a camp near Bitter Springs as he pioneered a route that served travelers on the Old Spanish Trail, and later the Mormon Road, linking Salt Lake City to California. This camp was later to become an important water and grazing place for pioneers crossing the Mojave Desert during California's settlement and gold rush. The California Gold Rush brought prosperous trade and unexpected trouble to the area. As California grew, and more travelers and freighters used the Mormon Road to cross the territory between California and Utah, raids and horse stealing became a problem. In 1847, the Army's Mormon Battalion patrolled the Fort Irwin area to control the raiding and horse stealing. By 1855 it became part of the route of the freight wagon road between Los Angeles and Salt Lake City.Edward Leo Lyman, Overland Journey from Utah to California: Wagon Travel from the City of Saints to the City of Angels, University of Nevada Press, 2008. During the Bitter Spring Expedition in 1860 the Army constructed Camp Bitter Springs, a small stone fort overlooking Bitter Spring and patrolled the Fort Irwin area.William Gorenfeld and John Gorenfeld, Bvt. Major James Carleton at Bitter Spring 1860, Originally published in Wild West, June 19, 2001. From Saturday, January 15, 2005 musketoon.blogspot.com accessed September 17, 2014 National Training center sign. In the 1880s the area experienced an economic boom with the discovery of borax at Death Valley. From the late 19th century to the early 20th century, the area began to grow tremendously as mining operations of all types flourished. Soon railroads, workers, and businesses led to the establishment of the nearby town of Barstow. The years following the Indian Wars were quiet militarily. In 1940, President Franklin D. Roosevelt established the Mojave Anti-Aircraft Range, a military reservation of approximately in the area of the present Fort Irwin. In 1942, the Mojave Anti- Aircraft Range was renamed Camp Irwin, in honor of Major General George LeRoy Irwin, commander of the 57th Field Artillery Brigade during World War I, and it was subsumed into the Desert Training Center as one of its cantonment areas and some of its ranges. Two years later, Camp Irwin was deactivated and placed on surplus status. Camp Irwin reopened its gates in 1951 as the Armored Combat Training Area and served as a training center for combat units during the Korean War. Regimental tank companies of the U.S. 43d Infantry Division from Camp Pickett, Virginia were the first to train at the new facility. The garrison was designated a permanent installation on 1 August 1961 and renamed Fort Irwin. During the Vietnam buildup, many units, primarily artillery and engineer, trained and deployed from Fort Irwin. In January 1971, the garrison was deactivated again and placed in maintenance status under the control of Fort MacArthur (Los Angeles), California. The California National Guard assumed responsibility for the garrison and from 1972 - 1980, Fort Irwin was used primarily as a training area by Army National Guard and U.S. Army Reserve units. National Training Center Soldiers move forward to search a building during training at the National Training Center. Long known for large-scale tank vs. tank battles, NTC now provides extensive training in urban operations as of 1 September 2005. 3rd Infantry patrol the California desert during a training mission. Rock formation painted by units visiting Ft. Irwin On 9 August 1979, the Department of the Army announced that Fort Irwin had been selected as National Training Center (NTC). The location - an isolated area - was ideal because of its over capacity for maneuver and ranges, its uncluttered electromagnetic spectrum, and its restricted airspace. The National Training Center was officially activated 16 October 1980, and Fort Irwin was transferred from the California Army National Guard back to the Regular Army returning into active status on 1 July 1981. The NTC was unique in its training approach in the use of Real Time Location System (originally a General Dynamics microwave transponder system; later replaced by GPS); the use of lasers to simulate direct fire (including small arms); and the use of real time interactive computer models for indirect fire along with Air to Ground and Ground to Air missile systems. Originally developed as a prototype by the US Army's Fort Hunter-Liggett with Systems and Software design the BDM, the NTC system was the first to augment After Action Reviews of training exercises with video and maneuver overlays including time stamped combat events. Since its activation, the NTC has witnessed many other firsts. The first units to train against the Opposing Force (OPFOR) were from among others the 3rd Battalion 67th Armor 2nd Armored Division from Fort Hood Texas operation named TASK FORCE IRWIN III, 1 Aug - 14 Sept 1979.. 3rd Brigade, U.S. 1st Cavalry Division from Fort Hood Texas. in spring 1981. Also Ft Irwin and the 1st CAV tested and implemented the Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System (MILES). Infantry and armor units first augmented the Opposing Force in 1984 as a detachment of the 7th infantry Division, Fort Ord CA. June 1985 saw the first use of M1 Abrams tanks and later in the fall of 1985 saw the M2 Bradley fighting vehicles on the NTC battlefield. The first armored cav. squadron rotation occurred in November 1984. Units from the 101st Airborne Division participated in the first light force rotation in March 1985. The 197th Infantry Brigade participated in the first extended rotation with brigade operations in June 1985. The first combined Light/Mechanized Infantry rotation took place in February 1990; the 7th Infantry Division (Light) from Fort Ord and the 24th Infantry Division (Mechanized) from Fort Stewart, Georgia participated. The first MOUT (Military Operations in Urban Terrain) mission was conducted at the NTC Pioneer Training Facility in December 1993. Opposing Forces (OPFOR) During the re-opening of the NTC in 1980, the OPFOR consisted of re-activation of the 6th Battalion, 31st Infantry, \\"The Polar Bears,\\" from the 7th Infantry Division, based in Fort Ord, California, and the 1st Battalion, 73rd Armor. Once the US Army turned to regimental units in 1985, the OPFOR was redesignated 177th Armored Brigade (SEP). The OPFOR soldiers were dressed in Soviet-style armor uniforms including black berets, Soviet-style insignias, and used M551 Sheridans visually modified to resemble BMP-1 vehicles and T-72 tanks. In their OPFOR role the Infantry Battalion was designated as the 32nd Guards Motorized Rifle Regiment. U.S. Marine Corps (USMC), U.S. Army Reserve and Army National Guard units would support infantry roles for the OPFOR. Air support and air combat tactics came from USAF fighter wings operating from Nellis AFB and George AFB. USN strike squadrons from NAS Lemoore, USMC fighter/attack squadrons operating from MCAS El Toro, and USMC helicopter attack squadrons operating from MCAS Tustin. When George AFB, MCAS El Toro and MCAS Tustin were closed as a result of Base Realignment and Closure Commission actions in the 1990s, USAF air support shifted to composite fighter wings from Nellis AFB, Hill AFB, Luke AFB and Davis-Monthan AFB. USMC air support shifted to MCAS Miramar (formerly NAS Miramar), MCAS Yuma and MCAS Camp Pendleton. During the 1980s and 1990s, the NTC also showcased US Army large-scale tactics to foreign military leaders from all over the world. The OPFOR ran 15 training rotations a year against armored brigades from both Active and Reserve Component US Army units from all over the United States. The command centers of these large-scale battles were computerized in a central command post, where each battle was recorded and analyzed. The results were subsequently debriefed to the participants. NTC Today The Post is composed of the Fort Irwin garrison with general support facilities such as: * Post Emergency Services * Public Affairs Service * Veterinary Service * Housing, Financial, Admin and Community Services * Religious Support and Social Services * Human Resources and Civilian Personnel Services * Environmental and Safety Office * Public Works The National Training Center element of the Post which consists of the following units: * 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment (Blackhorse) acting as the ‚Äòenemy‚Äô for all training visiting units. * 916th Support Brigade providing support to the installation, and sustainment for visiting units and their operations. * The National Training Center (NTC) Operations Group which is responsible for all live training events. * The Joint Center of Excellence is facilitating individual, collective and unit counter IED training; evaluating existing and developing new operational techniques, tactical procedures and counter IED equipment concepts. * The Mission and Installation Contracting Command is responsible for the maintenance and logistics of all NTC and garrison facilities. * The Reserve Component Operations Plans and Training (RCOPT) facilitates integration of all reserve component formations at the NTC. It also serves as the NTC Command Group's advisor on all reserve component matters and educates all reserve units. The NTC at Fort Irwin continues to serve as one of the US Army's main training centers. All US military services, as well as other government agencies and some foreign military units train at the NTC. A common tradition for any visiting military unit is to paint their sign on one of the rock formations near the main gate. Units of all types and locations are represented. After the September 11, 2001 attacks, the NTC transformed to focus on continuous counterinsurgency ops that reflected a rapidly changing battlefield, especially in desert climate environments. NTC training is not easy! The exercises incorporate complex scenarios exposing the units to detailed hybrid threats. Facing a strong opposing force and an insurgent force, at the same time, they must assist local people in towns and villages in the area in any way possible. One of the NTC features is the presence of 12 mock-up \\"villages\\" used to train troops in Military Operations in Urban Terrain (MOUT) prior to their deployment. These villages have religious sites, hotels, traffic circles, etc. filled with foreign ‚Äòlocals‚Äô. These are arabic speaking roleplaying actors portraying government officials, local militia, police, military, villagers, street vendors and insurgents. They will confront the military with all kinds of all-day problems. The largest two villages are known as Razish and Ujen, the closest located about 30 minutes from the main part of the post. The largest village consists of 585 buildings that can engage an entire brigade combat team into a fight. The training uses simulated as well as live Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), the Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System (MILES) and incorporates multi-national forces and (social) media actions. Observer, Controller and Trainers (OCTs) are embedded with the training units from brigade down to platoon level. Some villages are completely instrumented, including video recording, to assist the OC/T teams in providing feedback to the training unit. Fort Irwin Solar Project The Fort Irwin Solar Project, launched in 2009, will be the largest renewable energy project in the DoD's history. This plan is expected to result in more than 500 MW of renewable energy with one billion kilowatt-hours (kWh) of solar power generated per year by 2022.

It is a member of the oceanic dolphin family, Delphinidae. Taxonomy The striped dolphin is one of five species traditionally included in the genus Stenella; however, recent genetic work by LeDuc et al. (1999) indicates Stenella, as traditionally conceived, is not a natural group. According to that study, the closest relatives of the striped dolphin are the Clymene dolphin, the common dolphins, the Atlantic spotted dolphin, and \\"Tursiops\\" aduncus, which was formerly considered a subspecies of the common bottlenose dolphin. The striped dolphin was described by Franz Meyen in 1833. Description leaps in the Mediterranean Sea off Toulon The striped dolphin has a similar size and shape to several other dolphins that inhabit the waters it does (see pantropical spotted dolphin, Atlantic spotted dolphin, Clymene dolphin). However, its colouring is very different and makes it relatively easy to notice at sea. The underside is blue, white, or pink. One or two black bands circle the eyes, and then run across the back, to the flipper. These bands widen to the width of the flipper which are the same size. Two further black stripes run from behind the ear ‚Äî one is short and ends just above the flipper. The other is longer and thickens along the flanks until it curves down under the belly just prior to the tail stock. Above these stripes, the dolphin's flanks are coloured light blue or grey. All appendages are black, as well. At birth, individuals weigh about 10 kg (22 lb) and are up to a meter (3 feet) long. By adulthood, they have grown to 2.4 m (8 ft) (females) or 2.6 m (8.5 ft) (males) and weigh 150 kg (330 lb) (female) or 160 kg (352 lb) (male). Research suggested sexual maturity was reached at 12 years in Mediterranean females and in the Pacific at between seven and 9 years. Longevity is about 55‚Äì60 years. Gestation lasts about 12 months, with a three- or four-year gap between calving. In common with other dolphins in its genus, the striped dolphin moves in large groups ‚Äî usually up to thousands of individuals in number. Groups may be smaller in the Mediterranean and Atlantic. They may also mix with common dolphins. The striped dolphin is as capable as any dolphin at performing acrobatics ‚Äî frequently breaching and jumping far above the surface of the water. Sometimes, it approaches boats in the Atlantic and Mediterranean, but this is dramatically less common in other areas, particularly in the Pacific, where it has been heavily exploited in the past. Striped dolphins are known as ‚Äústreakers‚Äù throughout the eastern tropical Pacific due to their behavior of rapidly swimming away from vessels to avoid collisions The striped dolphin feeds on small pelagic fish and squid.Spitz, J., et al. \\"Dietary plasticity of the oceanic striped dolphin, Stenella coeruleoalba, in the neritic waters of the Bay of Biscay.\\" Journal of Sea Research 55.4 (2006): 309-320. Population and distribution jumping in the Gulf of Corinth The striped dolphin inhabits temperate or tropical, off- shore waters. It is found in abundance in the North and South Atlantic Oceans, including the Mediterranean (sightings and strandings have been reported rather recently in Sea of MarmaraFirst stranding record of a Risso‚Äôs Dolphin (Grampus griseus) in the Marmara Sea, Turkey (pdf). Retrieved on September 06, 2017) and Gulf of Mexico, the Indian Ocean, and the Pacific Ocean. Roughly speaking, it occupies a range running from 40¬∞N to 30¬∞S. It has been found in water temperatures ranging from 10 to 26 ¬∞C, though the standard range is 18-22 ¬∞C. In the western Pacific, where the species has been extensively studied, a distinctive migration pattern has been identified. This has not been the case in other areas. The dolphin appears to be common in all areas of its range, though that may not be continuous; areas of low population density do exist. The total population is in excess of two million. The southernmost record is of a stranded individual nearby Dunedin, southern New Zealand in 2017.Stuff.co.nz. 2017\\\\. Rare striped dolphin stranding on Otago beach. Retrieved September 26, 2017 Human interaction Japanese whalers have hunted striped dolphins in the western Pacific since at least the 1940s. In the heyday of \\"striped dolphin drives\\", at least 8,000 to 9,000 individuals were killed each year, and in one exceptional year, 21,000 individuals were killed. Since the 1980s, following the introduction of quotas, this number has fallen to around 1,000 kills per year. Conservationists are concerned about the Mediterranean population which is threatened by pollution, disease, busy shipping lanes, and heavy incidental catches in fishing nets such as long- liners, trawlers, gill nets, trammel and purse seine nets. . Recent threats include military sonar, and chemical pollution from near by harbors. Hydrocarbons are also a major concern such has PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) and HCB (hexachlorobenzene). These are said to give problems to additional food chains as well as doing a full body test to see what hydrocarbons may be passed down through parturition and lactation. Attempts have been made to keep the striped dolphin in captivity, but most have failed, with the exception of a few captured in Japan for the Taiji Whale Museum. Striped dolphins are one of the targeted species in the Taiji dolphin drive hunt. Diet The adult striped dolphin eats fish, squid, octopus, krill, and other crustaceans. Mediterranean striped dolphins seem to prey primarily on cephalopods (50-100% of stomach contents), while northeastern Atlantic striped dolphins most often prey on fish, frequently cod. They mainly feed on cephalopods, crustaceans, and bony fishes. They feed anywhere within the water column where prey is concentrated, and they can dive to depths of 700 m to hunt deeper-dwelling species. Conservation Small numbers of dolphins live nearby Gij√≥n The eastern tropical Pacific and Mediterranean populations of the striped dolphin are listed on Appendix II \\"Appendix II \\" of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS). As amended by the Conference of the Parties in 1985, 1988, 1991, 1994, 1997, 1999, 2002, 2005 and 2008. Effective: 5 March 2009. of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS), since they have an unfavorable conservation status or would benefit significantly from international co- operation organized by tailored agreements.Convention on Migratory Species page on the Striped dolphin, Memorandum of Understanding Concerning the Conservation of the Manatee and Small Cetaceans of Western Africa and Macaronesia On the IUCN Red List the striped dolphin classifies as vulnerable due to a 30% reduction in its subpopulation over the last three generations. These dolphins may also be an indicator species for long term monitoring of heavy metal accumulation in the marine environment because of its importance in the Japan pelagic food web as well as its ability to live for many years. In addition, the striped dolphin is covered by the Agreement on the Conservation of Small Cetaceans of the Baltic, North East Atlantic, Irish and North Seas (ASCOBANS),Agreement on the Conservation of Small Cetaceans of the Baltic, North East Atlantic, Irish and North Seas the Agreement on the Conservation of Cetaceans in the Black Sea, Mediterranean Sea and Contiguous Atlantic Area (ACCOBAMS),Official website of the Agreement on the Conservation of Cetaceans in the Black Sea, Mediterranean Sea and Contiguous Atlantic Area the Memorandum of Understanding for the Conservation of Cetaceans and Their Habitats in the Pacific Islands Region (Pacific Cetaceans MOU)Memorandum of Understanding for the Conservation of Cetaceans and Their Habitats in the Pacific Islands Region and the Memorandum of Understanding Concerning the Conservation of the Manatee and Small Cetaceans of Western Africa and Macaronesia (Western African Aquatic Mammals MoU) Conservation efforts have included having ship lines take a new path to their destination such as cruise lines as well as reduced human interaction close up. Feeding the dolphins has also become a problem, and has led to behavioral changes. This has also been suggested as another reason for mortality events. Strandings and mortality The striped dolphin once thrived, numbering 117,880 before 1990. Since then, the population has suffered from incidental catches in fisheries. Mortality has been considered unsustainable, but there is a lack of data which hampers conservation efforts. Various cases of stranding over the years have been a cause for alarm. With an unfavorable conservation status and the increasing amount of debris piling in the ocean every year, striped dolphin's population is decreasing. 37 dolphins stranded off the Spanish Mediterranean coast were suffering from dolphin morbillivirus (DMV). The causes of these stranding have been changing from epizootic to enzootic. Cetacean morbillivirus (CeMV) can be divided into six strains in cetaceans throughout the world, causing widespread mortality events in Europe, North America, and Australia. Studies have indicated that characteristics of CeMV may be more closely associated with disease in ruminants than carnivore species, which is representative of their evolutionary histories. Common disease presentation includes broncointerstitial pneumonia, encephalitis, lymphocytopenia, and increases in multinucleated cells. CeVM causes immunosuppression, increasing risk to secondary infection following acute resolution of clinical signs. Hypothesized transmission routes include via aerosol and trans-placentally. The unusual mortality events (UMEs) among striped dolphins suggest that parasitic diseases may be increasing in the open ocean due to anthropogenic causes. In addition, case reports indicate nematodes present in the brain of the striped dolphin, described as a single round and thin worm with numerous eggs in the subcortical lesions, including the optic nerve. It is hypothesized this worm belongs to the genus Contracaecum, the same genus which has been reported to infect the brains of sea lions. Caution should be employed when handling these animals due to the possibility of a serious injury if the right steps are not taken in order to ensure both human and animal safety.

Delayed by stormy weather and high seas, the mission began on October 20, 2011. On the afternoon of October 21, Squyres and his crewmates officially became aquanauts, having spent over 24 hours underwater. NEEMO 15 ended early on October 26 due to the approach of Hurricane Rina. Squyres commented in a post-NEEMO 15 interview, \\"I would love to continue to be part of NEEMO - in any capacity. I'd be happy to go back as a support diver. I think what they are doing is so cool and I was proud to be part of it.\\" In June 2012, Squyres served as a crew member of the NEEMO 16 mission aboard Aquarius, which began on June 11, 2012 and lasted twelve days. Squyres also contributed to the DAN instrument on the Curiosity rover. Mars Science Laboratory Squyres said in an interview that he would not be the principal investigator for the Mars Science Laboratory, launched in 2011, as he did not want to be away from his family again for a long period (as happened during the Mars Exploration Rover Mission).

The single-day attacks resulted in 257 fatalities and 1,400 injuries. The attacks were reported to be coordinated by Dawood Ibrahim, leader of the Mumbai-based international organised crime syndicate D-Company. Ibrahim was believed to have ordered and helped organize the bombings through his subordinates Tiger Memon and Yakub Memon. The Supreme Court of India gave its judgement on 21 March 2013, after over 20 years of judicial proceedings, upholding the death sentence against suspected ringleader Yakub Memon while commuting the previous death sentences against 10 others to life in prison. However, two of the main suspects in the case, Dawood Ibrahim and Tiger Memon, have not yet been arrested or tried. After India's three-judge Supreme Court bench rejected his curative petition, saying the grounds raised by him do not fall within the principles laid down by the apex court in 2002, the Maharashtra state government executed Yakub Memon on 30 July 2015. Introduction=Background In December 1992 and January 1993, there was widespread rioting throughout the nation following the Babri Masjid demolition in Ayodhya, where some of the most notable riots occurred in Mumbai. Five years after the December‚ÄìJanuary riots, the Srikrishna Commission report found that 900 individuals had died and over 2,000 had been injured. Confession of Gul Mohammed On 9 March 1993, three days before the bombings took place, a small-time criminal from the Behrampada slum in Northeast Mumbai named Gul Noor Mohammad Sheikh (Gullu) detained at the Nag Pada police station. A participant in the communal riots that had rocked Mumbai the previous year, Gullu was also one of the 19 men handpicked by Tiger Memon, whose office was burnt in the riots. Tiger was a silver smuggler and chief mastermind of the bombings, for training in the use of guns and bomb making.The man who knew too much ‚Äì The Telegraph, 1 October 2006. Retrieved 21 August 2009. Archived 4 September 2009. Gullu had been sent to Pakistan via Dubai on 19 February 1993 and upon completion of his training returned to Mumbai on 4 March. In his absence the police had detained Gullu's brothers to encourage him to surrender, which he did. He confessed to his role in the riots, his training in Pakistan, and a conspiracy underway to bomb major locations around the city, including the Bombay Stock Exchange, Sahar International Airport and the Sena Bhavan. However, his conspiracy claim was dismissed by the police as \\"mere bluff\\". The arrest of Gul Mohammed spurred Tiger Memon to advance the date of the bombings which had originally been planned to coincide with the Shiv Jayanti celebrations in April 1993.Lost in a maze of documents ‚Äì Indian Express, 13 March 1999. Retrieved 21 August 2009. Archived 4 September 2009. The bombings At 1:30 p.m. on 12 March 1993, a powerful car bomb exploded in the basement of the Bombay Stock Exchange building. The 28-storey office building was severely damaged and many nearby office buildings also suffered damage. Reports indicate that 50 were killed by this explosion. About 30 minutes later, another car bomb exploded in front of the Mandvi branch of Corporation Bank near Masjid. From 1:30 p.m. to 3:40 p.m. a total of 12 bombs exploded throughout Mumbai.

Aftermath The official number of fatalities was 257 with 1,400 others injured (some sources reported that 317 people died; this misreport was due to a bomb which killed 69 in Calcutta on 16 March and was not part of 12 March Bombay bombings). On 10 July 2006, the Chief Minister of Maharashtra, Sharad Pawar, admitted that he had \\"deliberately misled\\" people following the 1993 Mumbai bombings by saying there were \\"13 and not 12\\" explosions and had added the name of a Muslim-dominated locality to show that people from both communities had been affected. He attempted to justify this deception by claiming that it was a move to prevent communal riots by falsely portraying that both Hindu and Muslim communities in the city had been affected adversely. He also admitted to lying about evidence recovered and misleading people into believing that it pointed to the Tamil Tigers as possible suspects. The bombings also caused a major rift within D-Company, the most powerful criminal organisation in the Mumbai underworld, headed by Dawood Ibrahim. Infuriated at the bombings, Ibrahim's right-hand man, Chotta Rajan, split from the organisation and took most of the leadership-level Hindu aides with him, including Sadhu, Jaspal Singh and Mohan Kotiyan. Rajan's split divided the Mumbai underworld along communal lines and pitted Chhota Rajan's predominantly Hindu gang against Dawood Ibrahim's predominantly Muslim D-Company.

Hussain Zaidi, Penguin Books, 2002, p.279 Arrests, convictions and verdict Many hundreds of people were arrested and detained in the Indian courts. In 2006, 100 of 129 accused were found to be guilty and were convicted by Justice PD Kode of the specially designated Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act (TADA) court. Many of those convicted have eluded custody, including the mastermind of the attacks, Tiger Memon. On 12 September 2006, the special TADA court convicted four members of the Memon family on charges of conspiring and abetting acts of terror. They face jail terms from five years to life imprisonment, that would be determined based on the severity of their crime. Three other members of the Memon family were acquitted with the judge giving them the benefit of the doubt. Yakub Memon was charged for possession of unauthorised arms. After the bombings, family members of Tiger Memon, including Yakub, escaped to Dubai and Pakistan. Correspondents say Tiger owned a restaurant in Mumbai and was allegedly closely associated with Dawood Ibrahim, the suspected mastermind. Except for Tiger and Yakub, the entire family returned to India and were promptly arrested by the Central Bureau of Investigation in 1994. Yakub was later taken into custody and was undergoing treatment for depression. The Memon family was tried in court and found guilty of conspiracy. The defence lawyers asked for leniency in the sentencing and caused delays in the process. Yakub Memon was executed by hanging in Nagpur Central Jail at 6:35 a.m. IST on 30 July 2015. Two of the accused, Mohammed Umar Khatlab and Badshah Khan (pseudonym given by the prosecution to hide his real identity) turned state approvers. Dawood Ibrahim, believed to have masterminded the terrorist attacks, is the Don of the Mumbai organised crime syndicate D-Company. He is suspected of having connections to Islamic terrorist elements such as al-Qaeda and its leader, Osama bin Laden, as well as Lashkar-e-Toiba, and was declared a terrorist by the governments of India and the United States in 2003. Ibrahim is now wanted by Interpol as a part of the worldwide terror syndicate of Osama bin Laden. He has been in hiding since the bombings and is living in white house, karachi, Pakistan, which the Pakistani government denied previously but accepted on 22 August 2020. The Bush administration in the United States imposed sanctions on Ibrahim in 2006. The penalty stage of the longest-running trial in India's history continued. In February 2007, prosecutors asked for the death penalty for 44 of the 100 convicted. The prosecution also requested the death penalty for those convicted of conspiracy in the case. Asghar Yusuf Mukadam and Shahnawaz Qureshi, who have been found guilty for involvement in the bombings pleaded for leniency, claiming that they were not terrorists and were emotionally driven to participate in the act. Mukadam claimed that the main conspirators took advantage of his \\"frame of mind\\" after the demolition of Babri Masjid and the subsequent riots, alleging police partiality during the riots. \\"Vested interests\\" instigated him to act as he did. Quareshi was trained in Pakistan to handle arms and ammunition. He and Muquddam parked the explosive-filled vehicle at Plaza cinema which resulted in 10 deaths and 37 injuries. Qureshi reached Pakistan via Dubai, where he claims he was taken \\"under the pretext of providing ... an alternative job\\".

Geography The town is located in the hills of the North Eifel, within the Hohes Venn ‚Äì Eifel Nature Park in the narrow valley of the Rur river. The historic town center has many preserved half-timbered houses and narrow streets have remained nearly unchanged for 300 years, making the town a popular tourist attraction nowadays. An open-air, classical music festival is staged annually at Burg Monschau. Historically, the main industry of the town was cloth-mills. History On the heights above the city is Monschau castle, which dates back to the 13th century -- the first mention of Monschau was made in 1198. Beginning in 1433, the castle was used as a seat of the dukes of J√ºlich. In 1543, Emperor Charles V besieged it as part of the Geldern Feud, captured it and plundered the town. However, the castle stayed with J√ºlich until 1609, when it became part of Palatinate-Neuburg. In 1795, the French captured the area and, under the name Montjoie, made it the capital of a canton of the Roer d√©partement. After the area became part of the Kingdom of Prussia in 1815, Monschau became the district capital of the Kreis Montjoie. During World War I, some people argued that Monschau (or \\"Montjoie\\" as it was then still called) should be annexed to Belgium since they believed it historically to be a Walloon area that had been Germanized by the Prussians.Finot, Jean. New York Times, May 30th, 1915 In 1918, William II, German Emperor, changed the name to Monschau. In 1972, the town was enlarged with the previously independent municipalities of H√∂fen, Imgenbroich, Kalterherberg, Konzen, M√ºtzenich and Rohren. M√ºtzenich, to the west of the town center, is an exclave of German territory surrounded by Belgium. It is separated from Germany by the Vennbahn railway line, which was assigned to Belgium by the Treaty of Versailles in 1919. During World War II the town of Monschau, sitting on a vital road network, was a point of great tactical importance in the opening phase of the Battle of the Bulge in December 1944 as the northernmost point of the battlefront.

He is considered one of the Fathers of Canadian Confederation, despite his opposition to Confederation, as he was a delegate to both the Charlottetown and Qu√©bec Conferences. Early life Edward Palmer was the son of James Bardin Palmer, an Irish barrister who had come to the Island at the beginning of the nineteenth century, and Millicent Jones. He attended grammar school before becoming a law clerk in his father's law firm. He was called to the bar in 1830 and thereafter he worked as a lawyer, land agent, land proprietor, politician, a judge, being appointed Queen's Counsel in 1873. He was a very active politician and later a judge. He married Isabella Tremain in 1846. He acted as a land agent and was a landed proprietor but, after experiencing long term conflict with his tenant farmers, he sold his substantial landholdings in 1870.  Political life  He was elected as member of the Prince Edward Island House of Assembly for Charlottetown and Quebec in 1835. He soon established himself as one of the leading Conservatives. He was often viewed as a champion of the status quo, being against responsible government, against union of the colonies of British North America, and against land reform. He was also much given to conflict in the assembly, frequently arguing with both George Coles and Edward Whelan. In 1849, Palmer became the leader of the Tories in the provincial assembly. In 1859, he became premier, only to be pushed from office by his colleague John Hamilton Gray in 1863. He was first appointed to the Legislative Council in 1860 and when that body became elective he retained his seat. His views against Confederation placed him in direct opposition to John Hamilton Gray. Their conflict fractured the Tory party and damaged the union cause, eventually resulting in both Palmer and Gray resigning from Cabinet. Palmer, however, retained his position as attorney general. Palmer remained ardently opposed to Confederation after 1864. He also opposed the \\"Better Terms\\" offer made by Canada in 1869. Instead, he favoured a free trade deal between Prince Edward Island and the United States. In 1872, Palmer changed parties and joined the Liberal, anti-Confederation government of Robert Poore Haythorne. When the financial burden of a railway project forced Prince Edward Island to the brink of economic collapse it was the Haythorne government, of which Palmer was a member, that sought the union with Canada in 1873. After Prince Edward Island joined the Confederation, Palmer became a Queens County judge and was later elevated to Chief Justice of Prince Edward Island, holding that title until his death.

Previously named Cap‚ÄëFran√ßais (initially Cap-Fran√ßois) and Cap‚ÄëHenri, it was historically nicknamed the Paris of the Antilles, because of its wealth and sophistication, expressed through its architecture and artistic life. It was an important city during the colonial period, serving as the capital of the French Colony of Saint-Domingue from the city's formal foundation in 1711 until 1770 when the capital was moved to Port-au-Prince. After the Haitian Revolution, it became the capital of the Kingdom of Northern Haiti under King Henry Christophe until 1820. Cap-Ha√Øtien's long history of independent thought was formed in part by its relative distance from Port-au-Prince, the barrier of mountains between it and the southern part of the country, and a history of large African populations. These contributed to making it a legendary incubator of independent movements since slavery times. For instance, from February 5‚Äì29, 2004, the city was taken over by militants who opposed the rule of the Ha√Øtian president Jean-Bertrand Aristide. They eventually created enough political pressure to force him out of office and the country. Cap- Ha√Øtien is near the historic Haitian town of Milot, which lies to the southwest along a gravel road. Milot was Haiti's first capital under the self- proclaimed King Henry Christophe, who ascended to power in 1807, three years after Haiti had gained independence from France. He renamed Cap‚ÄëFran√ßais as Cap‚ÄëHenri. Milot is the site of his Sans-Souci Palace, wrecked by the 1842 earthquake. The Citadelle Henry, a massive stone fortress bristling with cannons, atop a nearby mountain is away. On clear days, its silhouette is visible from Cap‚ÄëHa√Øtien. The small Hugo Ch√°vez International Airport (formerly Cap-Ha√Øtien International Airport), located on the southeast edge of the city, is served by several small domestic airlines. It has been patrolled by Chilean UN troops from the \\"O'Higgins Base\\" since the 2010 earthquake. The airport is currently being expanded. Several hundred UN personnel, including nearby units from Nepal and Uruguay, are assigned to the city as part of the ongoing United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH). History and character The well-preserved Cathedral Notre-Dame of Cap‚ÄëHa√Øtien. The island was occupied for thousands of years by cultures of indigenous peoples, who had migrated from present-day Central and South America. In the 16th century, Spanish explorers in the Caribbean began to colonize the island. They adopted the native name, Gu√°rico for this area that is today known as \\"Cap‚ÄëHa√Øtien\\". Due to the introduction of new infectious diseases, as well as poor treatment, the indigenous peoples population rapidly declined. On the nearby coast Columbus founded his first community in the New World, the short- lived La Navidad. In 1975, researchers found near Cap‚ÄëHa√Øtien another of the first Spanish towns of Hispaniola: Puerto Real was founded in 1503. It was abandoned in 1578, and its ruins were not discovered until late in the twentieth century.Florida Museum of Natural History, Puerto Real. A street scene in Cap‚ÄëHa√ØtienThe French occupied roughly a third of the island of Hispaniola from the Spanish in the early eighteenth century. They established large sugar cane plantations on the northern plains and imported tens of thousands of African slaves to work them. Cap‚ÄëFran√ßais became an important port city of the French colonial period and the colony's main commercial centre. It served as the capital of the French colony of Saint-Domingue from the city's formal founding in 1711 until 1770, when the capital was moved to Port-au-Prince on the west coast of the island. After the slave revolution, this was the first capital of the Kingdom of Northern Haiti under King Henry Christophe, when the nation was split apart. The central area of the city is between the Bay of Cap‚ÄëHa√Øtien to the east and nearby mountainsides to the west; these are increasingly dominated by flimsy urban slums. The streets are generally narrow and arranged in grids. As a legacy of the United States' occupation of Haiti from 1915 to 1934, Cap‚ÄëHa√Øtien's north-south streets were renamed as single letters (beginning with Rue A, a major avenue) and going to \\"Q\\", and its east-west streets with numbers from 1 to 26; the system is not followed outside the central city, where French names predominate. The historic city has numerous markets, churches, and low-rise apartment buildings (of three‚Äìfour storeys), constructed primarily before and during the U.S. occupation. Much of the infrastructure in need of repair. Many such buildings have balconies on the upper floors, which overlook the narrow streets below. With people eating outside on the balconies, there is an intimate communal atmosphere during dinner hours.

The bay, beaches and monuments have made it a resort and vacation destination for Haiti's upper classes, comparable to P√©tion-Ville. Cap‚ÄëHa√Øtien has also attracted more international tourists, as it has been isolated from the political instability in the south of the island. It has a wealth of French colonial architecture, which has been well preserved. During and after the Haitian Revolution, many craftsmen from Cap‚ÄëHa√Øtien, who were free people of color, fled to French-controlled New Orleans as they were under attack by the mostly African slaves. As a result, the two cities share many similarities in styles of architecture. Especially notable are the gingerbread houses lining the city's older streets. Tourism=Labadie and other beaches Labadie beach and village The walled Labadie (or Labadee) beach resort compound is located to the city's northwest. It serves as a brief stopover for Royal Caribbean International (RCI) cruise ships. Major RCI cruise ships dock weekly at Labadie. It is a private resort leased by RCI, which has generated the largest proportion of tourist revenue to Haiti since 1986. It employs 300 locals, allows another 200 to sell their wares on the premises, and pays the Haitian government US$6 per tourist. The resort is connected to Cap‚ÄëHa√Øtien by a mountainous, recently paved road. RCI has built a pier at Labadie, completed in late 2009, capable of servicing the luxury-class large ships. Attractions include a Haitian market, numerous beaches, watersports, a water-oriented playground, and a zip-line. People not on cruises can visit the beach, too. Water taxis parked at Labadie beach A view of the beach at Paradis Cormier Plage is another beach on the way to Labadie, and there are also water taxis from Labadie to other beaches, like Paradis beach. In addition, Belli Beach is a small sandy cove with boats and hotels. Labadie village could be visited from here.Cameron, p. 406 Verti√®res Verti√®res is the site of the Battle of Verti√®res, the last and defining battle of the Haitian Revolution. On November 18, 1803, the Haitian army led by Jean-Jacques Dessalines defeated a French colonial army led by the Comte de Rochambeau. The French withdrew their remaining 7,000 troops (many had died from yellow fever and other diseases), and in 1804, Dessalines' revolutionary government declared the independence of Haiti. The revolution had been underway, with some pauses, since the 1790s. In this last battle for independence, rebel leader Capois La Mort survived all the French bullets that nearly killed him. His horse was killed under him, and his hat fell off, but he kept advancing on the French, yelling, \\"En avant!\\" (Go forward!) to his men. He has become renowned as a hero of the revolution. The 18 of November has been widely celebrated since then as a Day of Army and Victory in Haiti. View of the Citadelle Henry, in northern Haiti Inside the ruins of Sans Souci Palace Citadelle Henry and Sans-Souci Palace The Citadelle Henryat the site & ISPAN & UNESCO , also known as Citadelle Henry, or the Citadelle, is a large mountaintop fortress located approximately south of the city of Cap‚ÄëHa√Øtien and beyond the town of Milot. It is the largest fortress in the Americas, and was listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site in 1982 along with the nearby Sans-Souci Palace. The Citadel was built by Henry Christophe, a leader during the Haitian slave rebellion and self- declared King of Northern Haiti, after the country gained its independence from France in 1804. Together with the remains of his Sans-Souci Palace, damaged in the 1842 earthquake, Citadelle Henry has been designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\\"Citadelle Henry\\", UNESCO World Heritage Sites Bois Ca√Øman Bois Ca√Øman (), south of road RN 1, is the place where Vodou rites were performed under a tree at the beginning of the slave revolution. For decades, maroons had been terrorizing slaveholders on the northern plains by poisoning their food and water. Makandal is the legendary (and perhaps historical) figure associated with the growing resistance movement. By the 1750s, he had organized the maroons, as well as many people enslaved on plantations, into a secret army. Makandal was murdered (or disappeared) in 1758, but the resistance movement grew. At Bois Ca√Øman, a maroon leader named Dutty Boukman held the first mass antislavery meeting secretly on August 14, 1791. At this meeting, a Vodou ceremony was performed, and all those present swore to die rather than to endure the continuation of slavery on the island. Following the ritual led by Boukman and a mambo named C√©cile Fatiman, the insurrection started on the night of August 22‚Äì23, 1791. Boukman was killed in an ambush soon after the revolution began. Jean-Fran√ßois was the next leader to follow Dutty Boukman in the uprising of the slaves, the Haitian equivalent of the storming of the Bastille in the French Revolution. Slaves burned the plantations and cane fields, and massacred French colonists across the northern plains. They also attacked Cap Francais and some of the free people of color. Eventually the revolution gained the independence of Haiti from France and freedom for the slaves. The site of Dutty Boukman's ceremony is marked by a ficus tree. Adjoining it is a colonial well, which is credited with mystic powers. Morne Rouge Morne Rouge is to the south of Cap. It is the site of the sugar plantation known as \\"Habitation Le Normand de Mezy\\", known for several slaves who led the rebellion against the French.Cameron, p. 409 Natural disasters=1842 Cap-Ha√Øtien earthquake On 7 May 1842, an earthquake destroyed most of the city and other towns in the north of Haiti and the neighboring Dominican Republic. Among the buildings destroyed or significantly damaged was the Sans-Souci Palace. Ten thousand people died in the earthquake., quoting and . Its magnitude is estimated as 8.1 on the Richter scale.http://earthquakes.findthedata.org/detail/1675/Haiti-Cap-haitien 2010 Haiti earthquake In the wake of the 2010 Haiti earthquake, which destroyed port facilities in Port-au-Prince, the Port international du Cap- Ha√Øtien was used to deliver relief supplies by ship. As the city's infrastructure was little damaged, numerous businessmen and many residents have moved here from Port-au-Prince. The airport is patrolled by Chilean UN troops since the 2010 earthquake, and several hundred UN personnel have been assigned to the city as part of the ongoing United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH). They are working on recovery throughout the island. After the earthquake, the port of Labadee was demolished and the pier enlarged and completely re-paved with concrete, which now allows larger cruise ships to dock, rather than tendering passengers to shore. Transportation=Airports Cap-Ha√Øtien is served by the Hugo Ch√°vez International Airport, Haiti's second busiest airport. It is a hub for Salsa d'Haiti. American Airlines has recently started international flights into the enlarged airport. Seaport The Port international du Cap-Ha√Øtien is Cap-Ha√Øtien's main seaport. Roads The Route Nationale#1 connects Cap-Ha√Øtien with the Haitian capital city Port-au-Prince via the cities of Saint-Marc and Gona√Øves. The Route Nationale#3 also connects Cap-Ha√Øtien with Port-au-Prince via the Central Plateau and the cities of Mirebalais and Hinche. Cap-Ha√Øtien has one of the best grid systems in Haiti with its north-south streets were renamed as single letters (beginning with Rue A, a major avenue), and its east-west streets with numbers. The Boulevard du Cap-Haitian (also called the Boulevard Carenage) is Cap‚ÄëHa√Øtien's main boulevard that runs along the Atlantic Ocean in the northern part of the city. Public transportation Cap-Ha√Øtien is served by tap tap and local taxis or motorcycles. Health Cap Haitien is served by the teaching hospital: H√¥pital Universitaire Justinien. Education A union of four Catholic Church private schools have been present for two decades in Cap‚ÄëHa√Øtien. They have higher-level grades, equivalent to the lyc√©es that feed the √âcoles Normale Sup√©rieure in France. They have high standards of academic excellence, selectivity in admissions, and generally their students come from the social and economic elite. Also, the lyce√© Philippe Guerrier that was built in 1844 by the Haitian President, Philippe Guerrier, has been a fountain of knowledge for more than a century. * Coll√®ge Notre-Dame du Perpetuel Secours des P√®res de Sainte-Croix * Coll√®ge Regina Assumpta des S≈ìurs de Sainte-Croix * √âcole des Fr√®res de l'instruction Chr√©tienne * √âcole Saint Joseph de Cluny des S≈ìurs Anne-Marie Javoue * Lyce√© Philippe Guerrier built by the Haitian President, Philippe Guerrier in 1844.

However, as an epithet, Wledig seems to have been applied to some official or claimed position within the Roman hierarchy. See: Wade-Evans, Arthur. Welsh Medieval Law. Accessed 30 January 2013. ( 5th century) was an important early Welsh leader, and the progenitor of the royal dynasty of Gwynedd. Background and life The name Cunedda (spelled Cunedag in the AD 828 pseudo-history Historia Brittonum) derives from the Brythonic word ', meaning \\"Good Hound/Warrior\\" or \\"Having Good Hounds/Warriors\\".Koch, John, Celtic Culture, ABC-CLIO, 2006, p. 519 His genealogy is traced back to a grandfather named Padarn Beisrudd, which literally translates as Paternus of the \\"red tunic\\". One traditional interpretation identifies Padarn as a Roman (or Romano-British) official of reasonably high rank who had been placed in command of Votadini troops stationed in the Clackmannanshire region of Scotland in the 380s or earlier by the Emperor Magnus Maximus. Alternatively, he may have been a frontier chieftain who was granted Roman military rank, a practice attested elsewhere along the empire's borders at the time. In all likelihood, Padarn's command in Scotland was assumed after his death by his son, Edern (), and then passed to Edern's son, Cunedda. According to Old Welsh tradition contained in section 62 of the Historia Brittonum, Cunedda came from Manaw Gododdin, the modern Clackmannanshire region of Scotland: > Maelgwn, the great king, was reigning among the Britons in the region of > Gwynedd, for his ancestor, Cunedag, with his sons, whose number was eight, > had come previously from the northern part, that is from the region which is > called Manaw Gododdin, one hundred and forty-six years before Maelgwn > reigned. And with great slaughter they drove out from those regions the > Scotti who never returned again to inhabit them.Bartrum, Peter, A Welsh > Classical Dictionary, National Library of Wales, 1993, p. 172. Cunedda and his forebears led the Votadini against Pictish and Irish incursions south of Hadrian's Wall. Sometime after this, the Votadini troops under Cunedda relocated to North Wales to defend the region from Irish invasion, specifically the U√≠ Liath√°in, as mentioned in the Historia Brittonum. Cunedda established himself in Wales, in the territory of the Venedoti, which would become the centre of the kingdom of Gwynedd. Two explanations for these actions have been suggested: either Cunedda was acting under the orders of Maximus (or Maximus's successors) or Vortigern, the high king of the British in the immediate post-Roman era. The range of dates (suggested by Peter Bartrum) runs from the late 370s, which would favour Maximus, to the late 440s, which would favour Vortigern. The suggestion that Cunedda was operating under instructions from Rome has been challenged by several historians. David Dumville dismisses the whole concept of transplanting foederati from Scotland to Wales in this manner, given that the political state of sub-Roman Britain would probably have made it impossible to exercise such centralised control by the 5th century. As Maximus himself was dead by the end of 388, and Constantine III departed from Britain with the last of Rome's military forces in 407, less than a generation later, it is doubtful that Rome had much direct influence over the military actions of the Votadini, either through Maximus or any other emissary, for any significant length of time. Maximus (or his successors) may have handed over control of the British frontiers to local chieftains at an earlier date; with the evacuation of the fort at Chester (which Mike Ashley, incidentally, argues is most likely where Cunedda established his initial base in the region, some years later) in the 370s, he may have had little option. Given that the archaeological record demonstrates Irish settlement on the Ll≈∑n Peninsula however and possible raids as far west as Wroxeter by the late 4th century, it is difficult to conceive of either Roman or allied British forces having presented an effective defence in Wales. Academics such as Sheppard Frere have argued that it may have been Vortigern who, adopting elements of Roman statecraft, moved the Votadini south, just as he invited Saxon settlers to protect other parts of the island. According to this version of events, Vortigern would have instructed Cunedda and his Votadini subjects to move to Wales in response to the aforementioned Irish incursions no later than the year 442, when Vortigern's former Saxon allies rebelled against his rule. Cunedda's supposed great grandson Maelgwn Gwynedd was a contemporary of Gildas,, De Excidio, sections 28 and 29 (in English), De Excidio, sections 28 and 29 (in Latin) and according to the Annales Cambriae died in 547., Annales Cambriae, year 547 ‚Äì \\"Mortalitas magna inqua pausat mailcun rex genedotae\\" The reliability of early Welsh genealogies is not uncontested however, and many of the claims regarding the number and identity of Cunedda's heirs did not surface until as late as the 10th century. Nonetheless, if we accept this information as valid, calculating back from this date suggests the mid-5th- century interpretation. Of Cunedda personally even less is known. Probably celebrated for his strength, courage, and ability to rally the beleaguered Romano-British forces of the region, he eventually secured a politically advantageous marriage to Gwawl, daughter of Coel Hen, the Romano-British ruler of Eboracum (modern York), and is claimed to have had nine sons. The early kingdoms of Ceredigion and Meirionnydd were supposedly named after his two sons Ceredig and Meirion. Allt Cunedda The hill of Allt Cunedda close to Cydweli in Carmarthenshire is probably associated with this Cunedda and suggests his campaigns against the Irish extended from Gwynedd into southwest Wales. Amateur excavations of this site in the 19th century revealed an Iron Age hill fort and several collapsed stone cists containing the buried but well-preserved skeletons of several men with formidable physical proportions. At least one of these was found in the seated position and another buried beneath a massive stone \\"shield\\" who had apparently been killed by a head wound. The bones appear to have been sent to various museums and have all since been woefully lost. One of the tumuli was known locally as Banc Benisel and was reputedly the grave of a Sawyl Penuchel, a legendary King of the Britons presumably from late Iron Age Britain. His epithet Penuchel or Ben Uchel means \\"high head\\" perhaps on account of his height. According to the Welsh Life of Saint Cadoc, a king named Sawyl Penuchel held court at Allt Cunedda. Confusingly, Geoffrey of Monmouth, in his Historia Regum Britanniae (1136), uses the name Samuil Penessil for a legendary pre-Roman king of Britain, preceded by Redechius and succeeded by Pir.History of the Kings of Britain 3.19 at Wikisource. Lewis Thorpe's translation for Penguin Classics (p. 105) gives two kings, Samuil followed by Penessil. Whether this is the same king and Cadoc's tale is just revisiting an old folk memory, a different man of the same name, or simply an error by the composer of the Life, is unclear. Much of the archaeological evidence was inadvertently destroyed by J. Fenton's expedition in 1851 and it is not known if all the great men buried at this site were contemporaries or if there were successive burials on a site with long-term cultural significance. The name connection with Cunedda makes it tempting to speculate that Cunedda himself may have been buried at this site--a site whose Iron Age notoriety may well have maintained a cultural importance well after the end of the Roman period and into the Dark Ages. The folk memories of people living near Allt Cunedda that were recorded by the Victorian antiquarians suggests an enduring respect for this site of deep historic importance.

Founded as a school for Quakers in 1891, the private school has more than 4,000 students combined between its main campus in Newberg and its centers in Portland, Salem and Redmond. Graduate studies include psychology, social work, business, education, counseling, physical therapy and seminary. The main campus is near downtown Newberg, near the junction of Oregon Route 99W and Oregon Route 219. George Fox competes athletically at the NCAA Division III level in the Northwest Conference as the Bruins. The school colors are navy blue and old gold. History The university was founded in Newberg, Oregon, in 1885 by Quaker pioneers, originally called Friends Pacific Academy for several years before becoming a college in 1891 as Pacific College.Horner, John B. (1919). Oregon: Her History, Her Great Men, Her Literature. The J.K. Gill Co.: Portland. p. 255. The Bruin mascot comes from a real bear cub found in 1887 in the Coast Range's foothills near Carlton, about west of Newberg.Athletics at George Fox University: The Bruin Mascot from George Fox University The cub's mother had been shot and a Pacific Academy student found the cub and brought it back to campus. Years later, the bear hide became the senior class's unofficial mascot and other students often attempted to steal it away. After the hide deteriorated, a leather replica was created and called Bruin Jr. Students today still participate in student-government-sponsored class competitions called \\"Bruin brawls\\" for possession of Bruin Jr.Felton, Rob (George Fox Journal, Spring 2008). \\"Bruin Brawl - A 110-year-old school tradition keeps creating new memories... and a few bruises too\\" https://www.georgefox.edu/journalonline/spring08/brawl.html In 1893 the school was incorporated as a joint-stock company. It became a four-year school in 1925.Corning, Howard M. (1989) Dictionary of Oregon History. Binfords & Mort Publishing. p. 98. Herbert Hoover‚Äôs uncle Dr. H. J. Minthorn served as the school‚Äôs first president, and Hoover was an early student at the academy. The school‚Äôs name changed to George Fox College in 1949 to honor George Fox, the founder of the Quaker movement. From 1991 to 2010, George Fox provided each traditional undergraduate student with a computer. In 1996, the college merged with Western Evangelical Seminary to form George Fox University. Associate professor of biology Dwight Kimberly received the Carnegie Foundation's Oregon Professor of the Year award in 2000. Associate professor of theatre Rhett Luedtke was one of three faculty members nationally to receive a National Directing Fellow Award from the John F. Kennedy Center in 2010. The student body has grown more than 500% since 1986, when enrollment was 549. With more than 4,100 students in Newberg, Portland, Salem, and at other Oregon teaching sites, George Fox is now the state's second-largest private university. In 2014, prompted by a housing dispute involving a transgender student, George Fox University sought and received an exemption from Title IX's requirements with respect to transgender students. In 2015, the school completed a new residence hall, Brandt Hall, named for former school president David H. Brandt and his wife, Melva. A new dining hall, Canyon Commons, opened in the fall of 2016. Academics The Stevens Center on the Newberg campus George Fox grants degrees at each of the traditional levels of university education, baccalaureates, master's degrees, and doctorates. The university participates in the Richter Scholars program, which sponsors 15 to 25 students each year in encouragement of original research. The university also offers study-abroad opportunities through the \\"Best Semester\\" program offered by the Council for Christian Colleges and Universities (CCCU). Athletics George Fox Athletics logo George Fox's athletic teams are known as the Bruins. The university offers 21 varsity sports ‚Äì eleven for women, ten for men ‚Äì and competes in the nine-member Northwest Conference at the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division III level. George Fox offers baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, soccer, swimming, tennis, and track and field (indoor and outdoor) for men. Women compete in basketball, cross country, golf, lacrosse, soccer, softball, swimming, tennis, track and field (indoor and outdoor), and volleyball. After four decades in the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), George Fox University and the Northwest Conference switched affiliation to the National Collegiate Athletic Association in 1998. The Bruins have enjoyed recent success at the national level. The baseball team won the 2004 NCAA Division III national championship, a game that was named one of the top 50 moments in Northwest Sports History by Portland radio station KFXX AM 1080, \\"The Fan.\\" In 2009, the school's women's basketball team went unbeaten (32‚Äì0) and capped the season with a 60‚Äì53 defeat of Washington University in St. Louis in the title game. In winning, George Fox claimed the first Division III national women's championship for any program west of the Rocky Mountains. Head coach Scott Rueck was named the NCAA Division III national coach of the year. More recently, the 2011‚Äì12 and 2014-15 women's basketball teams reached the championship game of the NCAA Division III tournament. Football was reintroduced as a varsity sport at George Fox in the fall of 2014 after a 45-year hiatus from the sport. The head coach for the resurrection was Chris Casey, brother to former Bruin and current Oregon State Beaver Baseball coach Pat Casey. Student life Wood- Mar Hall. George Fox University is a full member of the Council for Christian Colleges and Universities.

One of the sons of Cunedda, grandfather of Saint David,The Cambrian, A Bi-Monthly Published in the interest of the Welsh people and their descendants in the United States, 1881, Vol. 1, 1881 according to tradition, he arrived in what is now modern Wales from Gododdin with his father's family when they were invited to help ward off Irish invaders. As a reward for his bravery, his father gave him the southernmost part of the territories in north-west Wales reconquered from the Irish.

As of the 2010 Census, its population was 312,310, making it the most populous city in the oblast. Etymology The origin of the word \\"Cherepovets\\" is a subject of much debate among the local historians. According to one version, the city supposedly received its name from the word \\"skull\\" (, cherep). In antiquity, a pagan sanctuary was there in honor of the god Veles on the hill at the confluence of the Sheksna and Yagorba Rivers. The top of the hill was called the \\"skull.\\" Another version suggests that the word \\"Cherepovets\\" originates from the name of the tribe \\"Ves\\" (), who inhabited the Sheksna's banks. According to some legends, \\"Cherepovets\\" in the language of local indigenous Veps means \\"Veps' fish hill.\\" Geography The city is located near the major Volga-Baltic waterway, west-east railroads, gas pipelines, and between two Russian federal cities, Moscow and St. Petersburg. History Restored Church of the Nativity (1789) The foundation of Cherepovets is traditionally ascribed to two orthodox monks Feodosy and Afanasy. In 1362, they founded the Cherepovets Resurrection Monastery, in the vicinity of which a small village of Fedosyevo was founded. Historians consider the former village of Fedosyevo to be in the center of modern Cherepovets. Several centuries were needed to develop the small village into a prominent trade, manufacturing, and regional transportation center. Cherepovets was granted city status in 1777 by Catherine the Great and became the center of a separate uyezd in the administrative structure of the Novgorod Governorate. The construction of the Mariinsk canal system in 1810 made a significant impact on the development of the city. The Mariinsk Canal System connected Cherepovets with Volga River to the south and the Baltic Sea to the west. At that time, the city was still at a very early stage of development with a population of 3000 residents by 1863. For a long time, the city brickworks with seven workers was the sole industrial enterprise in Cherepovets. The development of the city became more dynamic after Emancipation Reform happened in 1861 and the appearance of the shipbuilding industry. The city soon became a prominent shipbuilding and logistics center connecting major regional railways and waterways. The population had grown to 10,000 by 1915. After the revolution, in March 1918, eastern uyezds of the Novgorod Governorate were renamed to separate Cherepovets Governorate centered around Cherepovets. The new governorate existed for less than 10 years. In 1927, it was merged with Leningrad, Novgorod, Pskov, and Murmansk Governorates into a single Leningrad Oblast. In September 1937, most of the former Cherepovets Governorate territories (except for Tikhvin district) were transferred to the newly established Vologda Oblast. The subsequent development of the city is closely related to the completion of the construction of the Cherepovets steel mill (now known as Severstal) in 1955, the second-largest in the country. Unlike the majority of the most important metallurgy centers in the former Soviet Union, the location of the future steel plant was selected far away from the actual mineral resources and deposits. The reason for that was the logistic advantage of having a well- developed infrastructure that allowed connection of the north and northwest of the country by rail, road, and waterways into a single operation system. It connected such remote mining centers as Vorkuta and Olenegorsk, Murmansk Oblast. The rapid growth of the industry center drastically changed the city, and by the early 1960s, its population exceeded 100,000 residents (three times bigger than the pre-World War II population). By 1970, Cherepovets had become the most populated city in Vologda Oblast. Administrative and municipal status Within the framework of administrative divisions, Cherepovets serves as the administrative center of Cherepovetsky District, although not being a part of it.Resolution #178 As an administrative division, it is incorporated separately as the \\"city of oblast significance of Cherepovets\\" (one of the four in the oblast), an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts.Law #371-OZ As a municipal division, the city of oblast significance of Cherepovets is incorporated as Cherepovets Urban Okrug.Law #1104-OZ Economy Cherepovets is an important industrial center in northwestern Russia, mostly known as the country's largest steel manufacturing plant, with exports going to more than 50 countries around the world. Metallurgy The city began growing rapidly with the construction of the metallurgical works in the late 1930s. The first works' blast furnace was put into operation in 1955. The first Cherepovets iron was produced in August 1955 and steel in May 1958. In February 1959, the first ingot was rolled in a blooming mill, and in November of the same year, the first hot-rolled plate was produced. Nowadays, complex processes of iron and steel production are highly automated. The workshops have been modernized according to the latest advances in engineering and technology of metal production. The joint-stock company 'Severstal' (LSE, MOEX) is a global exporter of ferrous and nonferrous metals: iron, steel, hot-rolled plates, cold roll-formed shapes, and other products. Chemical industry The second largest industry in the city is the chemical industry. Its main production area is concentrated in mineral fertilizers. PhosAgro (LSE, MOEX) is the largest producer of phosphate-based fertilizers and phosphoric and sulfuric acids in Europe. It is also one of the leading producers of NPK fertilizers, ammonia, and ammonium nitrate in Russia. As an outcome of the high volume of metallurgical and chemical production, Cherepovets is one of the most heavily polluted cities in the world. According to a 2011 assessment, the city ranked second only to Norilsk, Russia. Transportation Cherepovets is served by the Cherepovets Airport, which is a hub for Severstal Air Company. Cherepovets has rail and road access to Vologda, the administrative center of the oblast, to Moscow, the capital of Russia, and to St. Petersburg. The rail service is operated by the Cherepovets-1 terminal. The city public transport consists of buses and trams. Climate Cherepovets has distinctive four-seasons humid continental climate (just above subarctic), with warm summers and cold but not extremely cold winters by Russian standards. It falls into the humid continental zone by the fourth warmest month being just above in mean temperature and the annual temperature being , above the freezing point. Winter, however, lasts for five months, rendering transitional periods rather short. Modern city The Oktyabrsky Bridge, the first cable-stayed bridge in Russia (1979) The passing years have left their mark on the city's appearance. Large-scale housing and industrial construction have been carried out in the city. Over the past years, hundreds of new multistory blocks of apartments, detached and semi- detached houses were built in Cherepovets. Not only is Cherepovets an industrial city, but also it is a center of culture, education, and sport, with associations of local writers, poets, actors, painters, composers, and journalists. The city invests in sport and sports clubs. Cherepovets' athletes regularly compete in international and internal competitions. The Severstal hockey club is well known in Kontinental Hockey League. The Severstal basketball team, as well as the chess team, are a part of Russian Major League.

It was created in circa 1489 for Sir John Sempill, founder of the collegiate Church of Lochwinnoch. Sempill was killed at the Battle of Flodden in 1513. His grandson, the third Lord, was known as \\"The Great Lord Sempill\\". His grandson, the fourth Lord, was Ambassador from King James VI of Scotland to Spain in 1596. The male line failed on the death of his great-grandson, the eighth Lord, in 1684. He was succeeded by his sister Anne, wife of Robert Abercromby, who in 1685 was created Lord Glassford for life. In 1688 she obtained a new charter settling the lordship of Sempill in default of male issue, upon her daughters without division by her then and any future husband. Her younger son, the twelfth Lord, commanded the left wing of the government army at the Battle of Culloden in 1746. His great-grandson, the fifteenth Lord, died unmarried in 1835 and was succeeded by his younger sister Maria. She was the wife of Edward Chandler. In 1853 they were both allowed by Royal licence to assume the name and arms of Sempill only. However, they had no children and Maria was succeeded by her first cousin once removed Sir William Forbes, 8th Baronet, of Craigievar, who became the seventeenth Lord Sempill (see Forbes baronets of Craigievar for earlier history of this title). He was the grandson of the Hon. Sarah Sempill, eldest daughter of the thirteenth Lord Sempill. In 1885 he assumed by Royal licence the additional and principal surname of Sempill. His son, the eighteenth Lord, sat in the House of Lords as a Scottish Representative Peer from 1910 to 1934. His son, the nineteenth Lord, is known as an aviation pioneer who sold state secrets to the Japanese prior to World War Two and was also a Scottish Representative Peer between 1935 and 1963 (when all Scottish peers gained an automatic seat in the House of Lords). He fathered one daughter. His father, the eighteenth Lord, had sired four children in total; the succeeding Lord and three daughters. The youngest, Elizabeth Forbes-Sempill, was born on 6 September 1912. On the death of her father, her brother, the new Lord and Baronet, entrusted the management of his Fintray and Craigievar estates into her hands. Elizabeth, who felt the decision that she was female was a mistake, re-registered her birth in 1952, becoming Ewan Forbes-Sempill. On the nineteenth Lord's death in 1965 the baronetcy and barony were separated; the lordship passed to his daughter Ann, the twentieth Lady Sempill, while his younger brother, Ewan, succeeded in the baronetcy, which could only be inherited by male heirs, after a two-year legal dispute to determine if he was a legitimate male successor. After his death, the cousin born in 1927 became Sir John Alexander Cumnock Forbes-Sempill, baronet. (For information about the further succession of the baronetcy, see Forbes baronets of Craigievar.) The twentieth Lady Sempill had married and divorced Eric Holt; she later married secondly Stuart Whitemore Chant, who in 1966 by decree of the Lord Lyon assumed the additional surname of Sempill. the title is held by Lady Sempill's eldest son from her second marriage, the twenty-first Lord, who succeeded in 1995.

Population: The historical part of Vesyegonsk lies under the waters of the Rybinsk Reservoir. It was previously known as Ves Yogonskaya (until 1776). History The territory of modern Vesyegonsky District was originally populated by the Ves people, a Finnic tribe; the name of Vesyegonsk derives from the Ves. Vesyegonsk was first mentioned as Ves Yogonskaya in the 15th century. The settlement was located on the Mologa River, which was one of the main waterways from the Volga to the north of Russia. In the 18th century, after the Tikhvin Water System was constructed, Vesyegonsk was on the waterway connecting Moscow with St. Petersburg. However, the Tikhvin Water System eventually decayed and Vesyegonsk's importance declined as well. In the course of the administrative reform carried out in 1708 by Peter the Great, the territory was included into Ingermanland Governorate (known since 1710 as St. Petersburg Governorate), but in 1727 it was transferred to Moscow Governorate. In 1775, Tver Viceroyalty was formed and in 1776 Vesyegonsky Uyezd was established as a part of Tver Viceroyalty. At the same time, Vesyegonsk was granted town status and became the seat of the uyezd. In 1796, the viceroyalty was transformed into Tver Governorate and the uyezd was abolished. In 1803, Vesyegonsky Uyezd was re-established. On April 25, 1921, Vesyegonsky Uyezd was transferred to newly established Rybinsk Governorate. In February 1923, Rybinsk Governorate was abolished and the uyezd was transferred back to Tver Governorate on February 6, 1923. On July 12, 1929, the governorates and uyezds were abolished. Vesyegonsky District, with the administrative center in Vesyegonsk, was established within Bezhetsk Okrug of Moscow Oblast. On July 23, 1930, the okrugs were abolished and the districts were directly subordinated to the oblast.Snytko et al., p. 87 On January 29, 1935, Vesyegonsky District was transferred to newly established Kalinin Oblast. In 1939, the construction of the Rybinsk Reservoir started and large areas in the lower course of the Mologa were slated to be submerged under water. Vesyegonsk in particular was to be completely submerged. Due to this, the town was moved from the original location and downgraded in status to that of an urban-type settlement; the administrative center of the district was moved to the selo of Ovinishche. On April 26, 1940, Vesyegonsky District was abolished and on March 3, 1949, it was re-established; Vesyegonsk became the administrative center of the district again. In December 1953, Vesyegonsk was once again granted town status. Administrative and municipal status Within the framework of administrative divisions, Vesyegonsk serves as the administrative center of Vesyegonsky District. As an administrative division, it is incorporated within Vesyegonsky District as Vesyegonsk Urban Settlement.Law #34-ZO stipulates that the borders of the settlements (administrative-territorial divisions) are identical to the borders of the urban and rural settlements (municipal divisions), and that the borders of the administrative districts are identical to the borders of the municipal districts. Law #21-ZO, which describes the borders and the composition of the municipal formations in Vesyegonsky Municipal District, lists the town of Vesyegonsk as a part and the administrative center of Vesyegonsk Urban Settlement of that district. As a municipal division, this administrative unit also has urban settlement status and is a part of Vesyegonsky Municipal District.Law #21-ZO Economy=Industry There are enterprises of timber and food industries in Vesyegonsk. Transportation Vesyegonsk is a terminal railway station on the railway which runs to Ovinishchi. There, it connects to the railway running between Moscow and Mga via Krasny Kholm and Pestovo. Vesyegonsk is connected by roads with Ustyuzhna and with Tver via Krasny Kholm and Bezhetsk. There are also local roads. There is bus traffic originating from Vesyegonsk. Culture and recreation After Vesyegonsk was relocated, only two streets from the original town survived. There are five cultural heritage monuments of local significance in Vesyegonsk. These include the monuments to soldiers fallen in World War II, the tomb of the early Bolshevik, and the ensemble of two churches‚Äîthe Kazan Church (1811) and the Trinity Church (1868).

He founded his school in Rome. According to Tertullian, Valentinus was a candidate for bishop but started his own group when another was chosen.Adversus Valentinianos 4. Valentinus produced a variety of writings, but only fragments survive, largely those embedded in refuted quotations in the works of his opponents, not enough to reconstruct his system except in broad outline.Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005, article Valentinus His doctrine is known only in the developed and modified form given to it by his disciples. He taught that there were three kinds of people, the spiritual, psychical, and material; and that only those of a spiritual nature received the gnosis (knowledge) that allowed them to return to the divine Pleroma, while those of a psychic nature (ordinary Christians) would attain a lesser or uncertain form of salvation, and that those of a material nature were doomed to perish.The Tripartite Tractate, ¬ß14Irenaeus, Adversus Haeresies i. 6 Valentinus had a large following, the Valentinians. It later divided into an Eastern and a Western, or Italian, branch. The Marcosians belonged to the Western branch. Biography=Education Epiphanius wrote () that he learned through word of mouth (although he acknowledged that it was a disputed point) that Valentinus was \\"born a Phrebonite\\" in the coastal region of Egypt, and received his Greek education in Alexandria, an important and metropolitan early center of Christianity.Epiphanius ¬ß31 in The word \\"Phrebonite\\" is otherwise unknown, but probably refers to the ancient town of Phragonis, near present day Tidah. In Alexandria, Valentinus may have heard the Gnostic philosopher Basilides and certainly became conversant with Hellenistic Middle Platonism and the culture of Hellenized Jews like the great Alexandrian Jewish allegorist and philosopher Philo. Clement of Alexandria records that his followers said that Valentinus was a follower of Theudas, and that Theudas in turn was a follower of Paul the Apostle.Clement of Alexandria, Stromateis, book 7, chapter 17. \\"Likewise they allege that Valentinus was a hearer of Theudas. And he was the pupil of Paul.\\" Valentinus said that Theudas imparted to him the secret wisdom that Paul had taught privately to his inner circle, which Paul publicly referred to in connection with his visionary encounter with the risen Christ (Romans 16:25; 1 Corinthians 2:7; 2 Corinthians 12:2‚Äì4; Acts 9:9‚Äì10), when he received the secret teaching from him. Such esoteric teachings were downplayed in Rome after the mid-2nd century.The article esoteric Christianity focuses on Early Modern and modern esoteric Christian revivals. Teaching Valentinus apparently taught first in Alexandria and went to Rome about 136, during the pontificate of Pope Hyginus, and remained until the pontificate of Pope Anicetus, dying probably about 160 or 161. The Christian heresiologists wrote details about the life of Valentinus, often scurrilous. In Adversus Valentinianos, iv, Tertullian says Valentinus was a candidate for bishop, after which he turned to heresy in a fit of pique. He did this apparently along with Marcion, who was also active in Rome at the same time.Bernard Green, Christianity in Ancient Rome: The First Three Centuries Commonly unaccepted, we cannot know the accuracy of this statement, since it is delivered by his orthodox adversary and might not be other than a rhetorical insult. Conversely, Epiphanius of Salamis wrote that Valentinus taught with piety in Rome, but that he gave up the true faith after he had suffered a shipwreck in Cyprus and became insane. Epiphanius might have been influenced to believe this by the presence of Valentinian communities in Cyprus.Andrew S. Jacobs, Epiphanius of Cyprus: A Cultural Biography of Late Antiquity Valentinianism Valentinianism is the name for the school of gnostic philosophy tracing back to Valentinus. It was one of the major gnostic movements, having widespread following throughout the Roman Empire and provoking voluminous writings by Christian heresiologists. Notable Valentinians included Heracleon, Ptolemy, Florinus, Marcus and Axionicus. Valentinus professed to have derived his ideas from Theodas or Theudas, a disciple of Paul. Valentinus drew freely on some books of the New Testament. Unlike a great number of other gnostic systems, which are expressly dualist, Valentinus developed a system that was more monistic, albeit expressed in dualistic terms.'Valentinian gnosticism ... differs essentially from dualism' (Elaine Pagels, The Gnostic Gospels, 1978); 'a standard element in the interpretation of Valentinianism and similar forms of Gnosticism is the recognition that they are fundamentally monistic' (William Schoedel, 'Gnostic Monism and the Gospel of Truth' in The Rediscovery of Gnosticism, Vol.1: The School of Valentinus, edited by Bentley Layton, E.J. Brill, Leiden, 1980). While Valentinus was alive he made many disciples, and his system was the most widely diffused of all the forms of Gnosticism, although, as Tertullian remarked, it developed into several different versions, not all of which acknowledged their dependence on him (\\"they affect to disavow their name\\"). Among the more prominent disciples of Valentinus were Heracleon, Ptolemy, Marcus and possibly Bardaisan. Many of the writings of these Gnostics, and a large number of excerpts from the writings of Valentinus, existed only in quotes displayed by their orthodox detractors, until 1945, when the cache of writings at Nag Hammadi revealed a Coptic version of the Gospel of Truth, which is the title of a text that, according to Irenaeus, was the same as the Gospel of Valentinus mentioned by Tertullian in his Against All Heresies. Cosmology Valentinian literature described the primal being, called Bythos, as the beginning of all things. After ages of silence and contemplation, Bythos gave rise to other beings by a process of emanation. The first series of beings, the aeons, were thirty in number, representing fifteen syzygies or pairs sexually complementary. Through the error of Sophia, one of the lowest aeons, and the ignorance of Sakla, the lower world with its subjection to matter is brought into existence. Man, the highest being in the lower world, participates in both the psychic and the hylic (material) nature, and the work of redemption consists in freeing the higher, the spiritual, from its servitude to the lower. This was the word and mission of Jesus and the holy spirit. Valentinius' Christology may have posited the existence of three redeeming beings, but Jesus while on Earth had a supernatural body which, for instance, \\"did not experience corruption\\" by defecating, according to Clement:Clement, Stromateis 3.59.3 translated B. Layton p. 239. there is also no mention of the account of Jesus's suffering in First Epistle of Peter, nor of any other, in any Valentinian text. The Valentinian system was comprehensive, and was worked out to cover all phases of thought and action. Valentinius was among the early Christians who attempted to align Christianity with Platonism, drawing dualist conceptions from the Platonic world of ideal forms (pleroma) and the lower world of phenomena (kenoma). Of the mid-2nd century thinkers and preachers who were declared heretical by Irenaeus and later mainstream Christians, only Marcion of Sinope is as outstanding as a personality. The contemporary orthodox counter to Valentinius was Justin Martyr, though it was Irenaeus of Lyons who presented the most vigorous challenge to the Valentinians. Trinity Valentinus's name came up in the Arian disputes in the fourth century when Marcellus of Ancyra, a staunch opponent of Arianism, denounced the belief in God existing in three hypostases as heretical. Marcellus, who believed Father and Son to be one and the same, attacked his opponents by attempting to link them to Valentinus: In the fourth century, Marcellus of Ancyra declared that the idea of the Godhead existing as three hypostases (hidden spiritual realities) came from Plato through the teachings of Valentinus,A.H.B. Logan, \\"Marcellus of Ancyra (Pseudo-Anthimus), 'On the Holy Church': Text, Translation and Commentary. Verses 8-9.\\" Journal of Theological Studies, New Series, 51.1, April 2000:95. who is quoted as teaching that God is three hypostases and three prosopa (persons) called the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit: While this accusation is often sourced in stating Valentinus believed in a Triune Godhead, there is in fact no corroborating evidence that Valentinus ever taught these things. Irenaeus makes no mention of this in any of his five books against heresies, even though he deals with Valentinianism extensively in them. Rather, he indicates that Valentinus believed in the pre-existent Aeon known as Proarche, Propator, and Bythus who existed alongside Enn≈ìa, and they together begot Monogenes and Aletheia: and these constituted the first-begotten Pythagorean Tetrad, from whom thirty Aeons were produced.Irenaeus, Against Heresies, 1.1.1-3 Likewise, in the work cited by Marcellus, the three natures are said to have been the three natures of man, concerning which Irenaeus writes: \\"They conceive, then, of three kinds of men, spiritual, material, and animal, represented by Cain, Abel, and Seth. These three natures are no longer found in one person, but constitute various kinds [of men]. The material goes, as a matter of course, into corruption.\\"Irenaeus, Against Heresies, 1.7.5 According to Eusebius, Marcellus had a habit of mercilessly launching unsubstantiated attacks against his opponents, even those who had done him no wrong.Eusebius, Against Marcellus, Book I Valentinus' detractors Shortly after Valentinus' death, Irenaeus began his massive work On the Detection and Overthrow of the So- Called Gnosis (better known as Adversus Haereses) with a highly negative portrayal of Valentinus and his teachings, which occupies most of his first book. A modern student, M. T. Riley, observes that Tertullian's Adversus Valentinianos retranslated some passages from Irenaeus, without adding original material.M.T. Riley. Later, Epiphanius of Salamis discussed and dismissed him (Haer., XXXI). As with all the non-traditional early Christian writers, Valentinus has been known largely through quotations in the works of his detractors, though an Alexandrian follower also preserved some fragmentary sections as extended quotes. A Valentinian teacher Ptolemy refers to \\"apostolic tradition which we too have received by succession\\" in his Letter to Flora. Ptolemy is known only for this letter to a wealthy gnostic lady named Flora, a letter itself only known by its full inclusion in Epiphanius' Panarion. The letter describes the gnostic doctrine about the laws of Moses and their relation to the demiurge. The possibility should not be ignored that the letter was composed by Epiphanius, in the manner of composed speeches that ancient historians put into the mouths of their protagonists, as a succinct way to sum up. The Gospel of Truth A new field in Valentinian studies opened when the Nag Hammadi library was discovered in Egypt in 1945. Among the very mixed bag of works classified as gnostic was a series of writings which could be associated with Valentinus, particularly the Coptic text called the Gospel of Truth which bears the same title reported by Irenaeus as belonging to a text by Valentinus.Irenaeus, Adversus Haereses 3.11.9. It is a declaration of the unknown name of Jesus's divine father, the possession of which enables the knower to penetrate the veil of ignorance that has separated all created beings from said father. It furthermore declares that Jesus has revealed that name through a variety of modes laden with a language of abstract elements. This unknown name of the Father, mentioned in the Gospel of Truth, turns out to be not so mysterious. It is in fact stated in the text: \\"The name of the Father is the Child.\\"See The Gospel of Truth 23:1, Hal Taussig, ed., A New New Testament: A Bible for the Twenty-first Century (Boston-New York: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2013). Indeed, the overarching theme of the text is the revelation of the oneness of Christian believers with the \\"Father\\" through the \\"Son\\", leading to a new experience of life characterized by the words \\"fullness\\" and \\"rest\\". The text's primary claim is that \\"since need came into being because the Father was not known, when the Father is known, from that moment on, need will no longer exist.\\"See Gospel of Truth 10:11, Hal Taussig, ed., A New New Testament: A Bible for the Twenty- first Century (Boston-New York: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2013) The tone is mystical and the language symbolic, reminiscent of the tone and themes found in the canonical Gospel of John.Compare GofT 1:1 with John 1; GofT 8:10 with John 3:7-8; GofT 10:10 with John 17:21-23; GofT 10:11 with John 17:1-3; GofT 14:5 with John 15:1-6; GofT 16:7 with John 1; GofT 27:6 with John 14:10; GofT 27:8 with John 15:1-6; Hal Taussig, edl, A New New Testament (Boston-New York: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2013) There are also very striking linguistic similarities with the early Christian songs known as the Odes of Solomon. Compare GofT 2:2 with Ode 16:18; GofT 2:8 with Ode 22:1; GofT 5:1 with Ode 3:6-8; GofT 5:2 with Ode 3:2; GofT 6:1 with Ode 23; GofT 6:11 with Ode 15:8; GofT 10:8 with Ode 19:1-5; GofT 10:12 with Ode 14:10; GofT 21:8 with Ode11; GofT 21:9 with Ode 9:3; GofT 22:4-7 with Ode 24:8; GofT 23:8&9 with Ode 26; GofT 23:10 with Ode 23:1-3; GofT 27:2 with Ode 19:1-2; GofT 27:4 with Ode 3:5; Hal Taussig, ed.

A member of a prominent political family in Massachusetts, he was a leading 19th century lawyer of that state. He was associated with the Federalist Party until its decline after the War of 1812. Over his career, a prominent Massachusetts anti-slavery politician and spokesperson. He became a leading member of the Massachusetts Whig Party, a leading and founding member of the Massachusetts Free Soil Party, and a founding member and chair of the committee that organized the founding convention for the Massachusetts Republican Party in 1854. Hoar may be best known in American history for his 1844 trip to Charleston, South Carolina as an appointed Commissioner of the state of Massachusetts. He went to South Carolina to investigate and contest the laws of that state, which allowed the seizure of sailors who were free African Americans (often who were citizens of Massachusetts) and placed into bondage, if such sailors disembarked from their ship. Hoar was prevented from undertaking his appointed tasks by resolutions of the legislature and efforts of the governor of South Carolina, and was escorted back onto a ship by Charleston citizens fearing mob violence against the agent from Massachusetts. News of the thwarting of Hoar inspired anti-slavery political reaction in Massachusetts. Early life Hoar was a born in the town of Lincoln, Massachusetts, and as an adult lived in neighboring Concord, Massachusetts. He graduated from Harvard College in 1802, and was admitted to the bar in 1805. On October 13, 1812 he married Sarah Sherman (1785‚Äì1862) of New Haven, Connecticut. Sarah was the youngest child of Roger Sherman and his second wife, Rebecca Minot Prescott. Roger Sherman was a signer of the United States Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.  Political and legal career  Hoar was delegate to the Massachusetts constitutional convention in 1820. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1824.

Massachusetts commissioner to South Carolina, 1844  There was an ongoing constitutional and legal conflict between the state of Massachusetts and the states of South Carolina and Louisiana regarding the seizure of Massachusetts citizens. South Carolina had enacted laws prohibiting the emancipation of slaves, or the entry into the state of free African Americans. South Carolina agents would arrest free African American seamen from Massachusetts, members of the crew aboard ships that arrived at South Carolina sea ports; if the arrestee or the captain of the ship failed to pay fines for the criminal entry into the state, the arrestee would be sold into slavery to pay the fines. In 1844 the Massachusetts legislature authorized the governor to appoint a Commissioner to reside in Charleston, South Carolina and New Orleans, Louisiana, to collect information as to the number from Massachusetts citizens unlawfully seized in those cities, and to prosecute some of the suits before higher courts for the purpose of testing the constitutionality of the laws under which the forcible seizures were being made. In 1844, Massachusetts governor George N. Briggs (Whig party) appointed Hoar commissioner to South Carolina. Upon receipt of the letter from Massachusetts Governor Briggs announcing Hoar's appointment, South Carolina Governor James H. Hammond promptly placed it before the South Carolina legislature, which issued several resolves, declaring the right of South Carolina to exclude its borders all persons whose presence might be considered dangerous; denying that free Negroes were citizens of the United States, and for the Massachusetts commissioner: The effective result was that Hoar was prevented from appearing before that state's courts to test the law. On his arrival, with daughter Elizabeth Sherman Hoar, in Charleston, December 1844, local citizens warned Hoar to leave town. Local leading citizens secretly escorted the Hoars out of their hotel, to a ship, in advance of feared mob violence. When news of this incident reached Massachusetts it aroused much ire, contributing to a developing sentiment in Massachusetts against slavery and in favor of abolitionism.Governors of Massachusetts: George Nixon Briggs (1796-1861): Governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts 1844-1851 Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

Anger over the Kansas-Nebraska Act, and the issue of slavery in Federal territories were motivating factors leading to the subsequent convention in Worcester. The mass convention of 2,500 people, held in open air on the common in Worcester, September 7, 1854, founded the Massachusetts Republican Party, principally from members of the Massachusetts Free Soil Party, with a few Whig Party, and anti-slavery Democrats.Wilson, Leslie Perrin.

Lord Sinclair is a title in the Peerage of Scotland. It was created in 1449 for William Sinclair, 3rd Earl of Orkney. In 1470, Lord Orkney surrendered the earldom in return for the earldom of Caithness. In 1477, Lord Caithness wished to disinherit his eldest son from his first marriage to Lady Elizabeth Douglas, William Sinclair (d. 1487), who was known as \\"The Waster\\". Therefore, so that his earldom would not pass to him, he resigned the title in favour of his son from his second marriage to Marjory Sutherland, who was also named William Sinclair (d. 1513) (who became the second Earl of Caithness). However, Lord Caithness was succeeded in the lordship of Sinclair by his eldest son William Sinclair, 2nd Lord Sinclair. The latter's son Henry, the third Lord, was confirmed in the title in 1488. On the death of his great-great-great-grandson, the ninth Lord, the male line of the second Lord failed. He was succeeded by his grandson, the tenth Lord, the son of Catherine Sinclair, Mistress of Sinclair, daughter of the ninth Lord, and her husband John St Clair. In 1677 he obtained a new charter of the peerage confirming him in the title and with remainders respectively to his brother Henry Sinclair and his father's brothers Robert St Clair, George St Clair and Matthew St Clair, and failing them to his own heirs male whatsoever. However, his eldest son and heir John Sinclair, Master of Sinclair, was involved in the Jacobite rising of 1715 and attainted by Parliament. Consequently, he was not allowed to assume the title. He died childless in 1750 when the claim to the title passed to his younger brother General James St Clair (d. 1762). However, he never assumed the title. On his death the lordship became dormant. It was to remain so until it was successfully claimed by Charles Sinclair, 13th Lord Sinclair, who was confirmed in the title by the House of Lords in 1782. He was the son of Andrew St Clair, de jure 12th Lord Sinclair, grandson of Charles Sinclair, de jure 11th Lord Sinclair (d. 1755) and great-grandson of the aforementioned Matthew St Clair, uncle of the tenth Lord. He thereby became the first holder of the title without descent from the original Lords. The thirteenth Lord, his son the fourteenth Lord, grandson the fifteenth Lord, great-grandson the sixteenth Lord, and great-great-grandson the seventeenth Lord, all sat in the House of Lords as Scottish Representative Peers. As of 2016, the title is held by the latter's only son, the eighteenth Lord, who succeeded on his father's death in 2004. The University College London research project The Legacies of British Slave-ownership and The records of the Slave Compensation Commission, highlights that Charles St Clair, 13th Lord Sinclair owned 666 slaves at the time of abolition in 1833.

It is headquartered at Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida. Its primary mission is the air defense of the Contiguous United States (CONUS), United States Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. It was one of the four original pre-World War II numbered air forces formed during the existence of the United States Army Air Corps. It was activated as the Northeast Air District on 18 December 1940, at Mitchel Field, Long Island, New York with a mission of air defense of the Northeastern United States and Great Lakes regions. Its primary mission was the organization and training of new combat units prior to their deployment overseas. It was active in 1941‚Äì42; 1942‚Äì58; 1966‚Äì69; and with minor name and function changes from 1985 to the present. First Air Force is commanded by Lieutenant General Kirk S. Pierce. Its Command Chief Master Sergeant is Chief Master Sgt. Tony L. Whitehead. It has the responsibility for ensuring the air sovereignty and air defense of the Contiguous United States (CONUS), United States Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. As the CONUS NORAD Region (CONR) for North American Aerospace Defense Command, CONR provides air defense in the form of airspace surveillance and airspace control. 1AF (AFNORTH) is also the designated air component for the United States Northern Command (USNORTHCOM). USNORTHCOM's area of responsibility includes the continental United States, Canada, and Mexico, and its air, land and maritime approaches. With the transfer of responsibility for continental air defense from the active duty component of the Air Force to the Air National Guard, 1 AF became the first numbered air force to be made up primarily of citizen airmen. Furthermore, 1AF now has operational control (OPCON) of the Civil Air Patrol. History One of the four original numbered air forces, First Air Force was activated as the Northeast Air District of the GHQ Air Force on 18 December 1940, at Mitchel Field, Long Island, New York. It was redesignated First Air Force on 9 April 1941 with a mission for the defense of the Northeast and Great Lakes regions of the United States. World War II First Air Force region of the United States, World War II During the initial months after the Pearl Harbor Attack, First Air Force organized what would eventually become the core of the Army Air Forces Antisubmarine Command (AAFSC), obtaining most of its forces from I Bomber Command to combat the German U-Boat threat along the Atlantic Coast. AAFSC would eventually expand that mission to the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean until the antisubmarine mission was taken over completely by the Navy in mid-1943. Beginning in May 1942, the mission of First Air Force became operational training of units and crews, and the replacement training of individuals for bombardment, fighter, and reconnaissance operations. It received graduates of Army Air Forces Training Command flight schools; navigator training; flexible gunnery schools and various technical schools, organized them into newly activated combat groups and squadrons, and provided operational unit training (OTU) and replacement training (RTU) to prepare groups and replacements for deployment overseas to combat theaters. The First Air Force became predominantly a fighter OTU and RTU organization. Most P-47 Thunderbolt fighter groups were trained by I Fighter Command, along with P-39/P-63 Airacobra groups; C-47 Skytrain and later C-46 Commando groups by I Troop Carrier Command. By 1944, most of the Operational Training of groups ended, with the command concentrating on the training of individual replacements using Army Air Force Base Units (AAFBU) as training organizations at the airfields controlled by First Air Force. Air Defense Wings were also organized for the major metropolitan areas along the northeast coast, using training units attached to the Wings. By 1944 the likelihood of an air attack along the eastern seaboard was remote, and these air defense wings were reduced to paper units. By 1944, the vast majority of the USAAF was engaged in combat operations in various parts of the world, such as the Eighth Air Force in Europe and the Twentieth Air Force in the Pacific. The training units located within the United States (known as the Zone of the Interior, or \\"ZI\\".) under First, Second, Third and Fourth Air Force were all were placed under the unified command of the Continental Air Forces (CAF) on 13 December 1944, with the Numbered Air Forces becoming subordinate commands of CAF. Air Defense Command In March 1946, USAAF Chief General Carl Spaatz had undertaken a major re-organization of the postwar USAAF that had included the establishment of Major Commands (MAJCOM), who would report directly to HQ United States Army Air Forces. Continental Air Forces was inactivated, and First Air Force was assigned to the postwar Air Defense Command in March 1946 and subsequently to Continental Air Command (ConAC) in December 1948 being primarily concerned with air defense. First Air Force Headquarters was located at Fort Slocum, New York, from 1946 to 1949. The command was originally assigned the region of the New England states, along with New York and New Jersey. With the inactivation of the ADC Eleventh Air Force on 1 July 1948 due to budget restrictions, command's region of responsibility was increased to include the upper Midwest states of Michigan and Ohio, along with the Mid-Atlantic region south to the North Carolina/Virginia Border. In 1949 Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve units were placed under First Air Force command, with its active-duty units being reassigned to Eastern Air Defense Force (EADF) or to the 30th, 32d or 26th Air Divisions. The command was inactivated on 23 June 1958 for budgetary reasons, its assigned units being placed under ConAC. First Air Force was reactivated at Stewart Air Force Base, Newburgh, N.Y., on 20 January 1966 due to the inactivation of the ADC Air Defense Sectors. First Air Force assumed responsibility for the ADC 21st, 33d, 34th, 35th, and 36th Air Divisions, primarily located in the northeast and upper Midwest regions of the United States. It also was responsible for the air defense of Greenland, Iceland and parts of Canada. By July 1968, First Air Force had again assumed total responsibility for the air defense of the eastern seaboard, just as it had during World War II. On 16 January 1968 Air Defense Command was re- designated Aerospace Defense Command (ADCOM) as part of a restructuring of USAF air defense forces. First Air Force's second period of service was short lived, however, and the command was again inactivated as the result of a major ADCOM reorganization on 31 December 1969 of the First, Fourth, Tenth Air Forces and several Air Divisions. This reorganization was the result of the need to eliminate intermediate levels of command in ADCOM driven by budget reductions and a perceived lessening of the need for continental air defense against attacking Soviet aircraft. ADCOM reassigned the units under the inactivated First Air Force were reassigned primarily to the 20th, 21st or 23d Air Divisions. Tactical Air Command As part of realignment of military assets. ADCOM was reorganized on 1 October 1979. The atmospheric defense resources (interceptors and warning radars) of ADCOM were reassigned to Tactical Air Command (TAC). With this move many Air National Guard units that had an air defense mission also came under the control of TAC, which established a component called Air Defense, Tactical Air Command (ADTAC), at the level of a numbered air force. On 6 December 1985 HQ USAF reactivated First Air Force at Langley Air Force Base, Virginia, and assigned it to Tactical Air Command (TAC), replacing ADTAC. First Air Force was given the mission to provide, train and equip combat ready air defence forces for the air defense of the North American continent. Upon its reactivation, First Air Force was composed of units of the active Air Force and the Air National Guard. Because of its unique mission and its binational responsibilities, First Air Force works closely with the Canadian Forces. Canadian personnel are stationed at First Air Force Headquarters at Tyndall Air Force Base Florida, and at the various regional air defense sectors located throughout the United States. Activation of the Continental NORAD Region on 1 October 1986, resulted in a new structure for North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD). The continental U.S. region, along with Alaskan and Canadian regions provided the command and operational system for North American air defense. * On 1 July 1987, four of the previous Air Defense Command Air Defense sectors were reactivated, re-designated, assigned and co-located with the four remaining air divisions. : The Montgomery Air Defense Sector (MOADS, Inactivated 1966) was reactivated as the Southeast Air Defense Sector (SEADS); assigned to 23d Air Division :: 23d Air Division inactivated 4 July 1987; assets transferred to SEADS. : The Los Angeles Air Defense Sector (LAADS, Inactivated 1966) was reactivated as the Southwest Air Defense Sector (SWADS); assigned to 26th Air Division :: 26th Air Division inactivated 30 September 1990; assets transferred to SWADS. : The Seattle Air Defense Sector (SEADS, Inactivated 1966) was reactivated as the Northwest Air Defense Sector (NWADS); assigned to 25th Air Division :: 25th Air Division inactivated 30 September 1990; assets transferred to NWADS. : The New York Air Defense Sector (NYADS, Inactivated 1966) was reactivated as the Northeast Air Defense Sector (NEADS); assigned to 24th Air Division. :: 24th Air Division inactivated 30 September 1990; assets transferred to NEADS. The Air Defense Sectors were transferred by the Air Force to the National Guard Bureau and allotted to the Air National Guard on 1 October 1990. They were operationally gained by First Air Force, Tactical Air Command. * SEADS became part of the Florida ANG at Tyndall AFB * SWADS became part of the California ANG at March AFB * NWADS became part of the Washington ANG at McChord AFB * NEADS became part of the New York ANG at Griffiss AFB First Air Force was transferred to Air Combat Command along with the rest of TAC on 1 June 1992.Ravenstein, Charles A. (1984). Air Force Combat Wings Lineage and Honors Histories 1947‚Äì1977. Maxwell AFB, Alabama: Office of Air Force History. Air Combat Command In the years since its third activation, more of the responsibility for the defense of American air sovereignty has primarily shifted to the Air National Guard. Also, reorganization of the command structure of the U.S. Air Force saw the assignment of air defense to Tactical Air Command and later, its successor, Air Combat Command. In the 1970s and 1980s, the role of the Air National Guard in the defense of North America increased. As this role changed, discussions between the active Air Force and the Air National Guard commenced concerning roles and responsibilities. As the Cold War began to wind down and budgetary constraints became realities, more and more of the missions previously carried out by active duty forces began to be transferred into the reserve components. By the 1990s, 90 percent of the air defense mission was being handled by the Air National Guard. In October 1997, First Air Force became primarily composed of Air National Guard units charged with the air defense of the North American continent. Today, First Air Force consists primarily of members of the Air National Guard. Its headquarters is located at Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida. It comprises 10 fighter wings and two air defense sectors for the East and Western regions of the country. =Units circa 2018= * Eastern Air Defense Sector (EADS), former Griffiss AFB, Rome, New York * Western Air Defense Sector (WADS), McChord AFB, Washington * 601st Air and Space Operations Center (601 AOC), Tyndall AFB, Florida * Air Force Rescue Coordination Center (AFRCC), Tyndall AFB, Florida * Air Force National Security Emergency Preparedness Agency (AFNSEP), Tyndall AFB, Florida * 1 AF Detachment 1, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada * Air Force Element, Joint Air Defense Operations Center (AFELM JADOC), Bolling AFB, District of Columbia * Detachment 2, First Air Force, North Bay, Ontario, Canada.

In World War II the CONUS unit defended the Northwestern United States and Upper Great Plains regions and during the Cold War, was Strategic Air Command unit with strategic bombers and missiles. Elements of Second Air Force engaged in combat operations during the Korean War; Vietnam War, as well as Operation Desert Storm. History The Northwest Air District of the GHQ Air Force was established on 19 October 1940; activated on 18 December 1940 at McChord Field, and then re-designated as 2d Air Force on 26 March 1941. 5th Bombardment Wing was assigned to Second Air Force up until 5 September 1941. 2nd Air Force Second Air Force region of the United States, World War II On 11 December 1941, four days after the Pearl Harbor attack, 2d Air Force was placed under Western Defense Command. However, on 5 January 1942, it was returned to the Air Force Combat Command (a redesignation of GHQAF after creation of the United States Army Air Forces on 20 January 1941), and later placed directly under Headquarters AAF when Air Force Combat Command was dissolved in March 1942. From December 1941, 2d Air Force organized air defense for the northwest Pacific Ocean coastline of the United States (1940‚Äì1941) and flew antisubmarine patrols along coastal areas until October 1942. It appears that immediately after 7 December 1941, only the 7th, 17th, 39th and 42d Bombardment Groups under II Bomber Command were available for this duty. In late January 1942, elements of the B-25 Mitchell-equipped 17th Bombardment Group at Pendleton Field, Oregon were reassigned to Columbia Army Air Base, South Carolina ostensibly to fly antisubmarine patrols off the southeast coast of the United States, but in actuality came to prepare for the Doolittle Raid against Japan. In January 1942, the 2d Air Force was withdrawn from the Western Defense Command and assigned the operational training of units, crews, and replacements for bombardment, fighter, and reconnaissance operations. It received graduates from Army Air Forces Training Command flight schools; navigator training; flexible gunnery schools and various technical schools, organized them into newly activated combat groups and squadrons, and conducted operational unit training (OTU) and replacement training (RTU) to prepare groups and replacements for deployment overseas to combat theaters. As the Second Air Force it became predominantly the training organization of B-17 Flying Fortress and B-24 Liberator heavy bombardment groups. Nearly all new heavy bomb groups organized after Pearl Harbor were organized and trained by Second Air Force OTU units, then were deployed to combat commands around the world. After most of the heavy bombardment groups had completed OTU training, the Second Air Force conducted replacement training of heavy bombardment combat crews and acquired a new mission of operational and replacement training of very heavy bombardment (B-29 Superfortress) groups and crews. Designated the Second Air Force on 18 September 1942, starting in mid-1943 the unit's training of B-17 and B-24 replacement crews began to be phased out, and ressigned to First, Third and Fourth Air Forces as the command began ramping up training of B-29 Superfortress Very Heavy bomb groups, destined for Twentieth Air Force. Under the newly organized XX Bomber Command, B-29 aircraft were received from Boeing's manufacturing plants and new combat groups were organized and trained. XX Bomber Command and the first B-29 groups were deployed in December 1943 to airfields in India for Operation Matterhorn operations against Japan. A football team made up of Second Air Force personnel defeated Hardin‚ÄìSimmons University in the 1943 Sun Bowl. XXI Bomber Command, the second B-29 combat command and control organization was formed under Second Air Force in March 1944 with its combat groups beginning to deploy to the Mariana Islands in the Western Pacific beginning in December 1944. A third B-29 organization, XXII Bomber Command was formed by Second Air Force in August 1944, however the organization never got beyond forming Headquarters echelon and Headquarters squadron. Inactivated before any operational groups were assigned, as XX Bomber Command units were reassigned from India to the Marianas, eliminating need for the command. On 13 December 1944, First, Second, Third and Fourth Air Force were all placed under the unified command of the Continental Air Forces (CAF) with the Numbered Air Forces becoming subordinate commands of CAF. The training of B-29 groups and replacement personnel continued until August 1945 and the end of the Pacific War. With the war's end, Second Air Force was inactivated on 30 March 1946. In what was effectively a redesignation, the headquarters staff and resources were used to create Fifteenth Air Force, which became the first Numbered Air Force of the new Strategic Air Command ten days later. Cold War The command was reactivated on 6 June 1946 under Air Defense Command, at Offutt Air Force Base. The Second Air Force assumed responsibility for the air defense of certain portions of the continental United States. In 1947, the 73d Bomb Wing was reactivated with the 338th and 351st Bombardment Groups being assigned to it, both reserve B-29 Superfortress organizations. The wing was assigned to Second Air Force. A third group, the 381st was added in 1948. However SAC was having enough difficulties keeping its front-line active duty bomb units in the air to maintain even minimal pilot proficiency in the late 1940s. The wing and its bomb groups were all inactivated in 1949. The Second Air Force was also assigned the reserve 96th Bomb Wing, which was later redesignated an air division, and several C-46 Commando troop carrier groups under the 322d Troop Carrier Wing. One of these groups was the 440th Troop Carrier Group. It was again inactivated on 1 July 1948. 125px The Second Air Force was (re)-activated and assigned to Strategic Air Command on 1 November 1949 at Barksdale AFB, Louisiana. The initial organization of Second Air Force as part of SAC was: * 6th Air Division, MacDill AFB, Florida (assigned 10 February 1951) : 305th Bombardment Wing (MacDill AFB) (B-29) : 306th Bombardment Wing (MacDill AFB) (B-47A)(Initial B-47 Stratojet Operational Training Unit ‚Äì Not on Operational Alert) : 307th Bombardment Wing (MacDill AFB) (B-29) :: Detached for Korean War combat service with Far East Air Force, Kadena AB, Okinawa * 40th Air Division, Turner AFB, Georgia (assigned 14 March 1951) : 31st Fighter Escort Wing (Turner AFB) (F-84) : 108th Fighter Wing (Turner AFB) (F-47D) (Federalized New Jersey Air National Guard wing) 37th and 38th Air Divisions joined Second Air Force on 10 October 1951. 37th Air Division was responsible for Lockbourne Air Force Base and Lake Charles Air Force Base, and 38th Air Division was located at Hunter Air Force Base, Georgia. With the end of fighting in Korea, President Eisenhower, who had taken office in January 1953, called for a \\"new look\\" at national defense. The result: a greater reliance on nuclear weapons and air power to deter war. His administration chose to invest in the Air Force, especially Strategic Air Command. The nuclear arms race shifted into high gear. The Air Force retired nearly all of its propeller-driven bombers and they were replaced by new Boeing B-47 Stratojet medium jet bombers. By 1955, the Boeing B-52 Stratofortress heavy bomber would be entering the inventory in substantial numbers and as a result, Second Air Force grew both in scope and in numbers. After the Korean War, the history of Second Air Force became part of Strategic Air Command's history, as B-47 Stratojet, and later B-52 Stratofortress and KC-135 Stratotanker aircraft entered SAC's inventory. During the Cold War, Second Air Force aircraft and intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM)s stood nuclear alert, providing a deterrence against an attack on the United States by the Soviet Union. In 1966, an order of battle for the force showed units spread across most of the United States, from the 6th Strategic Aerospace Wing at Walker AFB, New Mexico, to the 11th Strategic Aerospace Wing at Altus AFB, Oklahoma, to the 97th Bombardment Wing at Blytheville AFB, Arkansas. During the Vietnam War, squadrons of 2d Air Force B-52 Stratofortesses (primarily B-52Ds, augmented by some B-52Gs) were deployed to bases on Guam, Okinawa and Thailand to conduct Arc Light bombing attacks on communist forces. The 28th Bombardment Wing was among the units assigned this duty.1966 order of battle The 2d Air Force organization was inactivated during the post-Vietnam drawdown, on 1 January 1975, with those 2 AF bomb wings not inactivated and/or those 2 AF bases not closed, redistributed to 8 AF and 15 AF. With the end of the Cold War and the restructuring of Strategic Air Command, Second Air Force was reactivated and became the steward for reconnaissance and battlefield management assets, based at Beale AFB, California. This assignment lasted from 1 September 1991 until 1 July 1993, when it was inactivated by Air Combat Command. Air Education and Training Command Second Air Force was reactivated and reassigned on 1 July 1993 to Keesler AFB, Mississippi. Its mission became conducting basic military and technical training for Air Force enlisted members and support officers at five major AETC training bases in the United States. The command has the mission is to train mission ready graduates to support combat readiness and to build 'the world's most respected air, space, and cyberspace force'. To carry out this mission, Second Air Force manages all operational aspects of nearly 5,000 active training courses taught to approximately 250,000 students annually in technical training, basic military training, medical and distance learning courses. Training operations across Second Air Force range from intelligence to computer operations to space and missile operations and maintenance. The first stop for all Air Force, Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve enlisted airmen is basic military training (BMT) at Lackland AFB, Texas. After completing BMT, airmen begin technical training in their career field specialties, primarily at five installations: Goodfellow, Lackland, and Sheppard Air Force bases in Texas; Keesler AFB, Mississippi; and Vandenberg AFB, California. Each base is responsible for a specific portion of formal technical training airmen require to accomplish the Air Force mission. Instructors conduct technical training in specialties such as enlisted aviator, aircraft maintenance, civil engineering, medical services, computer systems, security forces, air traffic control, personnel, intelligence, fire fighting, and space and missile operations. Commissioned officers attend technical training courses for similar career fields at the same locations. Wings and Groups under Second Air Force are: *37th Training Wing Lackland Air Force Base Texas Provides Basic Military Training to Air Force recruits as well as technical training in the career enlisted aviator, logistics, and Security Forces career fields. *81st Training Wing Keesler Air Force Base Mississippi Provides training in Aviation Resource Management, weather, basic electronics, communications electronic systems, communications computer systems, air traffic control, airfield management, command post, air weapons control, precision measurement, education and training, financial management and comptroller, information management, manpower and personnel. *17th Training Wing Goodfellow Air Force Base Texas Provides training in intelligence and firefighting career fields. Also provides training to Army, Navy and Marine detachments. *82d Training Wing Sheppard Air Force Base Texas Provides specialized technical training, medical, and field training for officers, Airmen, and civilians of all branches of the military, other DoD agencies, and foreign nationals. *381st Training Group Vandenberg AFB, California Provides qualification training for intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM), space surveillance, missile warning, spacelift, and satellite command and control operators. It also performs initial and advanced maintenance training on air-launched missiles (ALM) and ICBMs. It conducts training in joint space fundamentals and associated computer maintenance. The group also conducts qualification and orientation training for Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) staff and senior-level personnel, as well as instructor enhancement in support of operational units. *602d Training Group Keesler Air Force Base Mississippi Provides fully combat mission capable Airmen to all Combatant Commanders in direct support of the Joint Expeditionary Tasking (JET) mission. In 2006, Second Air Force was assigned the responsibility of coordinating training for Joint Expeditionary Tasked (JET) Training Airmen. These Airmen are assigned to perform traditional US Army duties in Iraq, Afghanistan and the Horn of Africa. An Expeditionary Mission Support Group was formed to provide command and control of these JET Airmen as they are trained at US Army Power Projection Platforms across the US prior to deploying to their assigned Area of Responsibility (AOR). This group has been named the 602d Training Group. In 2007, Second Air Force was given responsibility to provide curricula and advice to the Iraqi Air Force as it stands up its own technical training and branch specific basic training among others. This mission is known as \\"CAFTT\\" for Coalition Air Forces Technical Training.

Its headquarters is Ramstein Air Base, Germany. It is responsible for all U.S. Air Forces in Europe and Africa operations and support activities in the U.S. European Command and U.S. Africa Command's areas of responsibility. One of the four original pre‚ÄìWorld War II numbered air forces, it was established on 26 March 1941, at Tampa, Florida with a mission of air defense of the Southeastern United States and Gulf Coast regions. During the war, its primary mission became the organization and training of combat units prior to their deployment to the overseas combat air forces. Its Command Chief Master Sergeant is Chief Master Sergeant Randall D. Kwiatkowski. Overview The command directs all USAFE and AFAFRICA forces engaged in contingency and wartime operations in the United States European Command (EUCOM) and United States Africa Command (AFRICOM) areas of responsibility. It also has a unique mission as the U.S. military's primary liaison to the British government, which is conducted through the command's 3 AF-UK headquarters at RAF Mildenhall, England. As an integral part of America's commitment to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Third Air Force's area of responsibility includes Air Force missions and personnel in Europe and Africa. The Third Air Force oversees host nation support agreements for all U.S. military forces based in the United Kingdom through the command's 3 AF-UK headquarters at RAF Mildenhall. Through the NATO Partnership for Peace program, Third Air Force manages military contact and assistance programs for a number of countries in Eastern Europe. Third Air Force is also responsible for contingency planning and support of American security interests in Africa. It is composed of more than 25,000 Airmen. Third Air Force is assigned more than 200 aircraft, while tasked to provide support servicing to thousands of other transient aircraft that visit its bases each year.

It was redesignated Third Air Force on 26 March 1941 with a mission for the defense of the Southeast and Gulf of Mexico regions of the United States. It moved to offices in downtown Tampa on 8 January 1941. MacDill Field was one of two major Army Air Corps bases established in the Tampa Bay area in the buildup prior to World War II. Tampa's Drew Field Municipal Airport, established in 1928 was leased by the Air Corps in 1940. A major expansion of the airport was initiated and Drew Army Airfield was opened in 1941. Two secondary Army Airfields, Brooksville Army Airfield and Hillsborough Army Airfield were built and opened in early 1942 to support the flight operations of MacDill and Drew Fields. The Bonita Springs Auxiliary Field, located near Fort Myers provided an additional emergency landing field for MacDill. All of these airfields came under the jurisdiction of Third Air Force. III Fighter Command, the fighter arm, was headquartered at Drew Field.  World War II  Third Air Force region of the United States, World War II Third Air Force initially provided air defense for the southeastern United States (1940‚Äì1941) and flew antisubmarine patrols along coastal areas of the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico from after Pearl Harbor. In January 1942, the command was withdrawn by Air Force Combat Command from the Eastern Defense Command and assigned operational training of units, crews, and replacements for medium bombardment, fighter, and reconnaissance operations. In 1942, the antisubmarine patrols were turned over to the Coast Guard and other agencies and the command was engaged primarily in training replacements for combat units and operational training of units, crews, and individuals for bombardment, fighter, and reconnaissance operations. It received graduates of Army Air Forces Training Command flight schools; navigator training; flexible gunnery schools and various technical schools, organized them into combat groups and squadrons, and provided operational unit training (OTU) and replacement training (RTU) to prepare groups and replacements for deployment overseas to combat theaters. Third Air Force primarily trained B-25 Mitchell and B-26 Marauder medium bomber groups and A-20 Havoc and A-36 Apache light bomber groups. It also trained replacement fighter pilots, initially using P-39 Airacobra and P-40 Warhawks in 1942, later with P-47 Thunderbolts and P-51 Mustangs beginning in 1943 and 1944 as they became available. Third Air Force also provided support to the Army Air Forces School of Applied Tactics in Florida. By 1944, most of the Operational Training of groups ended, with the command concentrating on RTU training using Army Air Force Base Units (AAFBU) as training organizations at the airfields controlled by Third Air Force. Also by 1944, the majority of the Numbered Air Forces of the AAF were fighting in various parts of the world, such as the Eighth Air Force in Europe and the Twentieth Air Force in the Pacific. They were supported by four numbered air forces located within the United States (known as the Zone of the Interior, or \\"ZI\\".) On 13 December 1944, First, Second, Third and Fourth Air Force were all were placed under the unified command of the Continental Air Forces, the predecessor of the later established Strategic Air Command, Tactical Air Command, and Air Defense Command, which were all established in 1946. Postwar era When the Army Air Forces reorganized in 1946, Tactical Air Command (TAC) was established as one of its three major commands. The USAAF Troop Carrier Command (TCC) was inactivated as part of this reorganization and Third Air Force was reassigned to TAC to control the troop carrier units formerly part of TCC. It was headquartered at Greenville AAF, South Carolina. The C-46 Commando and C-47 Skytrain were the primary troop carrier aircraft, but surplus C-54 Skymasters that had been originally purchased for the Air Transport Command (ATC) were made available for troop carrier use. Third Air Force was inactivated on 1 November 1946 and TAC's troop carrier mission was reassigned to Ninth Air Force with its return from Europe and reassignment to Donaldson. Cold War In August 1948, in response to the Berlin blockade, the U.S. deployed long-range B-29 Superfortress strategic bombers to four East Anglian bases. The USAFE 3d Air Division was activated to receive, support and operationally control the B-29 units deployed in England for training. It also provided aircraft maintenance support at RAF Burtonwood for C-54 Skymaster aircraft used in the Berlin Airlift. When the Berlin Airlift ended in 1949, the division participated in the Military Assistance Program in England and began an extensive air base construction program through May 1951. Briefly elevated to the Major Command level from 3 January 1949 ‚Äì 21 January 1951, the 3d Air Division controlled large numbers of USAF organizations based in the United Kingdom and supervised a tremendous airfield construction program. However, with the advent of the Korean War and the growing Cold War threat of the Soviet Union, the U.S. and UK agreed to an even greater U.S. military presence in the United Kingdom. The resulting growing size and complexity of the American military presence required a larger command and organizational structure that could meet the needs of the increased operations. =Reactivation of Third Air Force= F-84Gs of the 77th Tactical Fighter Squadron, RAF Wethersfield McDonnell F-4D-28-MC Phantom Serial 65-0738 at RAF Bentwaters, September 1972. Northrop F-5E Tiger II Serials 73-0953, 0956 and 0985 of the 527th TFTAS in formation at RAF Alconbury, 1977 A-10A Serial 81-0991 at RAF Bentwaters. F-15C Serial 80-082, 53d Fighter Squadron, Spangdahlem Air Base The 3d Air Division was discontinued on 1 May 1951, and in its place the USAFE Third Air Force was activated to oversee tactical air operations. Strategic Air Command's 7th Air Division controlled deployed bombardment and reconnaissance forces with Third Air Force providing its logistical support. From its headquarters at RAF South Ruislip near London, Third Air Force carried out that mission basically unchanged through 1966, when the 7th Air Division was inactivated. =Tactical Air Operations= The first tactical unit to come to England under Third Air Force was the 81st Fighter Bomber Wing based at RAF Bentwaters on 6 September 1951. The next assigned unit was the 20th Fighter Bomber Wing, assigned to RAF Wethersfield. These Republic F-84 Thunderjet/Thunderchief and North American F-86 Sabre units worked with Royal Air Force Fighter Command providing air defense for England. In addition, the attached Tactical Air Command 47th Bombardment Wing flew B-45 Tornado and B-66 Destroyer tactical bombers from RAF Sculthorpe and RAF Alconbury. Initially the 49th Air Division functioned as the intermediate-level command authority for USAFE's wings in the UK, no operational combat groups were attached. The division supervised and participated in numerous training missions such as Quick Shot, Kingpin, and Bear Claw. It was inactivated on 1 July 1956. During the 1960s, Third Air Force had four to five combat wings and major changes occurred in the types of aircraft deployed in the United Kingdom. North American F-100 Super Sabres, McDonnell F-101 Voodoos, and McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom IIs replaced older fighter aircraft. Boeing KC-135 Stratotankers replaced older refueling aircraft. In June 1972, daily operational control of tactical units in the United Kingdom was transferred to Headquarters USAFE at Wiesbaden Air Base, West Germany. Third Air Force still retained command of the units, but as a result of the change, the headquarters was reorganized, reduced in personnel strength, and moved to RAF Mildenhall, United Kingdom. In 1979, NATO ministers decided to deploy BGM-109G Gryphon Ground Launched Cruise and Pershing II IRBM missiles to counter the growing Soviet SS-20 intermediate range ballistic missile threat. RAF Greenham Common and RAF Molesworth were selected as the beddown sites for the GLCM. The 501st Tactical Missile Wing (TMW) was activated at RAF Greenham Common in July 1982 and the 303d Tactical Missile Wing at RAF Molesworth in December 1986. In June 1987, Headquarters USAFE delegated tactical control of Third Air Force units to the Third Air Force commander. On 15 April 1986, General Dynamics F-111 aircraft based at RAF Lakenheath and RAF Upper Heyford were launched against suspected terrorist targets in Libya, as part of Operation Eldorado Canyon. With the signing of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty in December 1987, GLCMs deployed to RAF Molesworth were removed to the U.S. and the 303rd TMW inactivated 30 January 1989. The last GLCMs at RAF Greenham Common were removed in March 1991, and the 501st TMW inactivated 4 June 1991. When Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990, Third Air Force, like many other U.S. military units, received their trial by fire. However, for Third Air Force, the scenario was not similar to any which had been practiced in the past. Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm were not classic East-West confrontations in Europe that Third Air Force had been trained for. Thousands of miles removed from the Kuwait theater of operations, Third Air Force played a major support role, deploying half its combat aircraft, several thousand vehicles, approximately 50,000 tons of munitions, and many more tons of supplies and material. Third Air Force also provided 2,250 hospital beds by activating three of its contingency hospitals and was ready in the event of a large number of casualties were received. = Structure in 1989 = F-111F aircraft from the 493rd Tactical Fighter Squadron takes off from Hahn Air Base for a mission over West Germany during Exercise REFORGER '86. At the end of the Cold War Third Air Force consisted of the following units: * Third Air Force, at RAF Mildenhall, United Kingdom ** 10th Tactical Fighter Wing, at RAF Alconbury *** 509th Tactical Fighter Squadron, with 24x A-10 Thunderbolt II *** 511th Tactical Fighter Squadron, with 24x A-10 Thunderbolt II ** 20th Tactical Fighter Wing, at RAF Upper Heyford *** 55th Tactical Fighter Squadron, with 24x F-111E *** 77th Tactical Fighter Squadron, with 24x F-111E *** 79th Tactical Fighter Squadron, with 24x F-111E *** 42nd Electronic Combat Squadron, with 18x EF-111A Raven, detached from the 66th Electronic Combat Wing at Sembach Air Base, West Germany ** 48th Tactical Fighter Wing, at RAF Lakenheath *** 492nd Tactical Fighter Squadron, with 24x F-111F *** 493rd Tactical Fighter Squadron, with 24x F-111F *** 494th Tactical Fighter Squadron, with 24x F-111F *** 495th Tactical Fighter Squadron, with 24x F-111F (Training Squadron) ** 81st Tactical Fighter Wing, at RAF Bentwaters *** 78th Tactical Fighter Squadron, with 24x A-10 Thunderbolt II (based at RAF Woodbridge) *** 91st Tactical Fighter Squadron, with 24x A-10 Thunderbolt II (based at RAF Woodbridge) *** 92nd Tactical Fighter Squadron, with 24x A-10 Thunderbolt II *** 510 Tactical Fighter Squadron, with 24x A-10 Thunderbolt II *** 527th Tactical Fighter Training Squadron, with 16x F-16C Falcon fighters for aggressor training ** 513th Airborne Command and Control Wing, at RAF Mildenhall *** 10th Airborne Command and Control Squadron, with E-3 Sentry AWCS ** 303rd Tactical Missile Wing, at RAF Molesworth *** 87th Tactical Missile Squadron, with 64x BGM-109G Ground Launched Cruise Missiles ** 501st Tactical Missile Wing, at RAF Greenham Common *** 11th Tactical Missile Squadron, with 96x BGM-109G Ground Launched Cruise Missiles ** 7020th Air Base Group, at RAF Fairford, US Air Forces in Europe only B-52 Stratofortress heavy bomber base ** 7274th Air Base Group, at RAF Chicksands =Post Cold War= The end of the Cold War with the former Soviet Union left in its wake many new military challenges, tensions and emerging conflicts. It also drew attention to the need for American military forces to operate in ways and locations outside the traditional NATO construct. The shift in East-West relations and the increasing focus toward Eastern Europe, the southern region and the Middle East led to a changing of the focus of Third Air Force as well. The U.S. Congress mandated large reductions in the American military budget and American military troop strength based in Europe. From a Cold War high of 450,000 in the late 1980s, American troop strength in Europe was reduced to 100,000 by the mid-1990s. During the 1990s the USAF restructured itself to meet the emerging needs of the new world order. Several Third Air Force units returned to the U.S., and several more were inactivated. Third Air Force returned many of its bases to the British Ministry of Defence, and scaled down operations at other places. In March 1996, Headquarters USAFE announced a major reorganization of its numbered air forces. The announcement included news of the inactivation of Seventeenth Air Force at Sembach Air Base Germany, transferring its responsibility for overseeing all U.S. Air Force units north of the Alps to Third Air Force. As a result of the changes, Third Air Force grew substantially, taking on two main operating bases, Ramstein Air Base and Spangdahlem Air Base, both in Germany, and five geographically separated units. With this 1996 reorganization, Third Air Force was composed of more than 25,000 military people, and more than 35,000 family members. In terms of numbers of aircraft, Third Air Force had more than 200, including KC-135 and F-15 aircraft at bases in England, and A-10, F-16, C-9, C-20, C-21 and C-130E aircraft in Germany. In addition to a larger area of responsibility, the command reorganization also brought about a subtle change in the mission of the Third Air Force headquarters element. Third Air Force was tasked to take a more active role in the leadership of operational contingencies, and provide trained staff to lead or augment joint and combined task force headquarters elements. In 1998, Third Air Force provided the headquarters for JTF Eagle Vista, supporting the President's trip to Africa. In 2005, USAFE once again realigned its numbered air forces. Sixteenth Air Force was aligned as the command's new Warfighting Headquarters. Third Air Force was inactivated on 1 November, ending the unit's prestigious 50-plus year legacy in the UK. =Current Status= Just over a year after inactivation, Third Air Force was reactivated on 1 December 2006, at Ramstein AB, Germany, as USAFE's Air and Space Operations supporting U.S. European Command. Its new mission was to support the EUCOM commander's strategic objectives across the full range of military operations. When a joint task force is created in EUCOM, the Third Air Force commander is ready to assume the roles of Joint Forces Air Component Commander and Commander Air Force Forces, or lead the JTF as a Joint Force Commander. Upon the inactivation of the Seventeenth Air Force in 2012, Third Air Force became the numbered air force supporting United States Air Forces Africa.

Oprichnik (, , man aside; plural Oprichniki) was the designation given to a member of the Oprichnina, a bodyguard corps established by Tsar Ivan the Terrible to govern a division of Russia from 1565 to 1572. Foundation Some scholars believe that Ivan's second wife, the Circassian Maria Temryukovna, first had the idea of forming the organization. This theory comes from Heinrich von Staden, a German oprichnik. Maria Temryukovna's brother also became a leading oprichnik. Oath Upon acceptance, the new Oprichniki were required to swear an oath of allegiance: > I swear to be true to the Lord, Grand Prince, and his realm, to the young > Grand Princes, and to the Grand Princess, and not to maintain silence about > any evil that I may know or have heard or may hear which is being > contemplated against the Tsar, his realms, the young princes or the > Tsaritsa. I swear also not to eat or drink with the zemshchina, and not to > have anything in common with them. On this I kiss the cross. Description Modern theories suggest that the motivating purpose for the organization and existence of the Oprichniki was to oppress people or groups opposed to the Tsar. Known to ride black horses and led by Ivan himself, the group was known to terrorize civilian populations. Sometimes called the cromeshnina (selected) because they were a hand-picked body, the Oprichniki dressed in black garb, similar to a monastic habit, and carried attached to their saddles a severed dog's head (to sniff out treason and enemies of the Tsar), or an actual wolf's head and a broom (to sweep them away). The wolf's head was also symbolic of the hounds of hell tearing at the heels of the Tsar's enemies. The logistics of acquiring the canine heads was quite gruesome. Due to the lack of taxidermy, the severed and drained heads would only remain frozen for the winter months of the year. To maintain their image, the Oprichnik required a constant supply of fresh heads. Ivan himself carried a fearsome canine head made of iron with jaws that would open and snap shut as his horse galloped. The Oprichniki were ordered to execute anyone disloyal to Ivan and used various methods of torture to do so, including tying each limb to a different horse and riding in opposite directions, death by boiling, impalement, and roasting victims tied to poles over an open fire. When Ivan declared himself the \\"Hand of God\\", he selected 300 of the Oprichniki to be his personal \\"brotherhood\\" and live in his castle at Aleksandrovskaia Sloboda near Vladimir. At 4 a.m., these select Oprichniki attended a sermon given by Ivan, then performed the day's ritual executions. The Oprichniki sought to lead an externally ascetic lifestyle, like the monks they emulated, but it was punctuated by acts of cruelty and debauchery. Ivan sang while his Oprichniki ate, eating only when they had finished. At 9 p.m. he went to bed, listening to stories told by three blind men. In the Novgorod incident, the Oprichniks killed an estimated 1500 \\"big people\\" (nobles), although the actual number of victims is unknown.Ruslan Skrynnikov, Ivan Groznyi (Moscow: AST, 2001); A. A. Zimin, Oprichnina Ivana Groznogo (Moscow: Mysl‚Äô, 1964). By 1572, the Oprichnik had become a destabilizing force and were disbanded by Ivan, especially as he blamed them for the lack of response to the Tartar sack of Moscow in 1571. Thereafter it became a capital offense to say or discuss \\"Oprichnina\\".

It was redesignated Fourth Air Force on 26 March 1941 with a mission for the defense of the Southwest and Lower Midwest regions of the United States. World War II Fourth Air Force region of the United States, early World War II During World War II Fourth Air Force was the primary air defense command for the West Coast. The command also flew antisubmarine patrols along coastal areas of the Gulf of Mexico from after Pearl Harbor until October 1942. One of its primary fighter units was the 10th Fighter Wing at Hamilton Field, California. On 29 September 1942, Rice Municipal Airport located in the Desert Training Center was acquired by the IV Air Support Command, and was operational by 26 October 1942. Re-designated Rice AAF it was used to train pilots and crews of aircraft whose mission it was to support ground troops. Beginning in May 1942, the mission of Fourth Air Force became operational training of units and crews, and the replacement training of individuals for bombardment, fighter, and reconnaissance operations. It received graduates of Army Air Forces Training Command flight schools; navigator training; flexible gunnery schools and various technical schools, organized them into newly activated combat groups and squadrons, and provided operational unit training (OTU) and replacement training (RTU) to prepare groups and replacements for deployment overseas to combat theaters. The Fourth Air Force became predominantly a fighter OTU and RTU organization. Most P-51 Mustang and P-38 Lightning groups were trained by Fourth Air Force primarily due to the proximity of their manufacturing plants in Southern California. By 1944, most of the Operational Training of groups ended, with the command concentrating on RTU training of individual replacements using Army Air Force Base Units (AAFBU) as training organizations at the airfields controlled by Fourth Air Force. Air Defense Wings were also organized for the major metropolitan areas along the West Coast, using training units attached to the Wings. By 1944 the likelihood of a full-scale air attack along the West Coast since the bombing of Dutch Harbor two years earlier was remote, and these air defense wings were reduced to paper units. On 13 December 1944, First, Second, Third and Fourth Air Force were all were placed under the unified command of the Continental Air Forces. Air Defense Command In March 1946, USAAF Chief General Carl Spaatz had undertaken a major re- organization of the postwar USAAF that had included the establishment of Major Commands (MAJCOM), who would report directly to HQ United States Army Air Forces. Continental Air Forces was inactivated, and Fourth Air Force was assigned to the postwar Air Defense Command in March 1946 and subsequently to Continental Air Command (ConAC) in December 1948 being primarily concerned with air defense. The command was headquartered at Hamilton AFB, California and originally assigned the region of the CONUS west of the Rocky Mountains, roughly from the Pacific Ocean coast east to the eastern borders of, and . It was also responsible for training Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard personnel throughout the region. By 1949 with the establishment of the Western Air Defense Force (WADF), the air defense mission of the command was transferred to WADF, leaving Fourth AF free to focus on its reserve training tasks, which it did for the next decade. On 1 September 1960, Air Defense Command inactivated Fourth Air Force, transferring its reserve training mission to the Sixth Air Force Reserve Region. Fourth Air Force was re- activated on 20 January 1966 again at Hamilton AFB, as part of Air Defense Command with the inactivation of its organization of Air Defense Sectors. Its area of responsibility was essentially unchanged from its 1948 region. Subordinate organizations assigned by ADC were the 25th 26th and 27th Air Divisions. On 16 January 1968 Air Defense Command was re-designated Aerospace Defense Command (ADCOM) as part of a restructuring of USAF air defense forces. Fourth Air Force's second period of service was short lived, however, and the command was again inactivated as the result of a major ADCOM reorganization on 31 December 1969 of the First Fourth, Tenth Air Forces and several Air Divisions. This reorganization was the result of the need to eliminate intermediate levels of command in ADCOM driven by budget reductions and a perceived lessening of the need for continental air defense against attacking Soviet aircraft. ADCOM reassigned the units under the inactivated Fourth Air Force were reassigned primarily to the 25th and 26th Air Divisions.

Fourth Air Force has been a key component of the Air Force reserve ever since. Fourth Air Force personnel supported operations in Grenada (Operation Urgent Fury) and Panama (Operation Just Cause). More than 8,000 Air Force Reservists assigned to Fourth Air Force units served in the United States, Europe, and the Persian Gulf during Operation Desert Shield and Desert Storm. This included more than 2,878 medical personnel assigned to Fourth Air Force units. Since the end of the Cold War, Fourth Air Force has supported humanitarian missions such as Provide Promise in the Balkans and Provide Relief and Restore Hope in Somalia. Units rushed to provide aid and rescue service to the residents of Florida, the Gulf Coast, and the Caribbean in the aftermath of the traumatic and prolonged 1995 hurricane season. It supported immediate assistance to aid victims and disaster officials following the bombing of the Oklahoma City Federal Building. Fourth Air Force units provided assistance for several natural disasters, including the 1994 Northridge earthquake in the Los Angeles area, and the catastrophic midwest floods and the California wildfires in 1993. Fourth Air Force units routinely support United Nations and Department of State missions. Fourth Air Force people were on the first teams into Haiti for Operation Uphold Democracy, and supported Vigilant Warrior and Desert Thunder deployments to Southwest Asia. The men and women of Fourth Air Force continue to perform international peacekeeping and humanitarian missions on an almost daily basis. Headquarters Fourth Air Force officially returned to its original home, now March Air Reserve Base, in Riverside, CA, in April, 1998. In 2003 Fourth Air Force became an intermediate echelon responsible primarily for all Air Mobility Command (AMC) gained AFRC air refueling units in the United States and AMC gained AFRC strategic airlift units in the western United States. Today the sixty person staff consists of Traditional Reservists, Air Reserve Technicians and civilian employees. They direct the activities and supervise the equipping and training of more than 30,000 Air Force reservists in unit programs located across the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii and Guam. Reservists from 4 AF units were routinely deployed to Air Expeditionary units in combat areas of Afghanistan and Iraq as part of the \\"war on terror\\".

Population: History Buy was originally a trading post and protected by a hill fortress of Finno-Ugrian Meri people c. 400‚Äì500 CE. Its original Meri name is not known, but in Finnish language it was called either Vuoksensuu or Vieksansuu (lit. Mouth of Vuoksi/Vieksa). It was inhabited by the Finno-Ugrian peoples at least up to the Mongol invasion of Russia in 1237‚Äì1238. During the Mongol threat, some inhabitants of Kostroma sought refuge in Buy, and it seems that they renamed the place Buy (Vui, Bui) instead of using the Finno-Ugrian name which was difficult for them to pronounce, but the origin of the Russian name comes from the old Meri name. Modern Buy was founded in 1536 as a fortified point at the confluence of the Kostroma and the Vyoksa Rivers. The fortified point was built according to the order of Yelena Glinskaya, the regentess of Russia at that time and the mother of Ivan the Terrible, to defend the eastern frontiers of the Grand Duchy of Moscow from the raids by Kazan Tatars and others. However, twenty years after its construction, the fortress lost its military significance, as Kazan was taken and the raids ceased. During Buy's first three and a half centuries, the population scarcely exceeded 2,000. Except for officials and priests, most inhabitants were peasants and small craftsmen. Cottage industries included pottery, iron, leather, felt, wool, carpentry, painting, blacksmithing, and oil pressing. These products were primitive and distribution was local; even export to a neighboring area was considered a commercial success. One exception was the distillery, the predecessor of the current chemical plant. Almost the only factory in town, the distillery employed forty workers producing 600,000 liters of vodka annually. The soft bog water allowed the plant to produce a high-quality product which was sold even in provincial capitals. Buy was granted town status in 1778, during the reign of Catherine the Great. In 1905, a branch of the Saint Petersburg-Vyatka Railway (completed in 1908) reached Buy. At the same time, the railroad running north from Yaroslavl through Danilov arrived, so that Buy became a railroad junction town. The new Buy railway station was located from Saint Petersburg and from Moscow. In 1914-1915 the Russians built a large POW camp for captured Austrian, Hungarian, and German prisoners of war. It was located south of Buy in Korega at the west bank of Kostroma River. After the Peace Treaty of Brest- Litowsk was signed on March 3, 1918 under the terms of Peace Treaty all prisoners of war were released. The camp was left empty. After the end of the Finnish Civil War in 1918, many Finnish Reds who escaped into Soviet Russia were relocated to the Buy camp as their first place to create a Communist society. In May 1918 there were 3,268 Finns in Buy. Most of them relocated soon after, so that in July only about 500 remained. Few stayed in Buy, and some that did were deported during the Great Purge two decades later.

It is headquartered at Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana. The command serves as Air Forces Strategic ‚Äì Global Strike, one of the air components of United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM). The Eighth Air Force includes the heart of America's heavy bomber force: the B-2 Spirit stealth bomber, the B-1 Lancer supersonic bomber, and the B-52 Stratofortress heavy bomber aircraft. Established on 22 February 1944 by the redesignation of VIII Bomber Command at RAF Daws Hill in High Wycombe, England, the Eighth Army Air Force (8 AAF) was a United States Army Air Forces combat air force in the European Theater of World War II (1939/41‚Äì1945), engaging in operations primarily in the Northern Europe area of responsibility; carrying out strategic bombing of enemy targets in France, the Low Countries, and Germany; and engaging in air-to-air fighter combat against enemy aircraft until the German capitulation in May 1945. It was the largest of the deployed combat Army Air Forces in numbers of personnel, aircraft, and equipment. During the Cold War (1945‚Äì1991), 8 AF was one of three Numbered Air Forces of the United States Air Force's Strategic Air Command (SAC), with a three-star general headquartered at Westover AFB, Massachusetts commanding USAF strategic bombers and missiles on a global scale. Elements of 8 AF engaged in combat operations during the Korean War (1950‚Äì1953); Vietnam War (1961‚Äì1975), as well as Operation Desert Storm (1990‚Äì1991) over Iraq and occupied Kuwait in the First Persian Gulf War. Overview Eighth Air Force is one of two active duty numbered air forces in Air Force Global Strike Command. Eighth Air Force, with headquarters at Barksdale AFB, in the Bossier City ‚Äì Shreveport, Louisiana, metro area, supports U.S. Strategic Command, and is designated as U.S. Strategic Command's Task Force 204, providing on-alert, combat-ready forces to the president. The mission of \\"The Mighty Eighth\\" is to safeguard America's interests through strategic deterrence and global combat power. Eighth Air Force controls long-range nuclear-capable bomber assets throughout the United States and overseas locations. Its flexible, conventional and nuclear deterrence mission provides the capability to deploy forces and engage enemy threats from home station or forward positioned, anywhere, any time. The 8th Air Force motto is \\"Peace Through Strength.\\" The Eighth Air Force team consists of more than 16,000 Regular Air Force (e.g., active duty), Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve professionals operating and maintaining a variety of aircraft capable of deploying air power to any area of the world. This air power includes the heart of America's heavy bomber force, deploying the B-1 Lancer, B-2 Spirit and the B-52 Stratofortress. The Mighty Eighth's B-52 force consists of 76 bombers assigned to two active duty wings, the 2d Bomb Wing at Barksdale AFB, Louisiana and the 5th Bomb Wing at Minot AFB, North Dakota, and one reserve wing, the 307th Bomb Wing at Barksdale AFB, Louisiana. The B-2 force consists of 20 bombers assigned to the active duty 509th Bomb Wing along with the Missouri Air National Guard's associate 131st Bomb Wing at Whiteman AFB, Missouri. The B-1 force consists of 62 bombers assigned to the active duty 7th Bomb Wing at Dyess AFB, Texas and the 28th Bomb Wing at Ellsworth AFB, South Dakota. The 131st Bomb Wing is operationally-gained by AFGSC and 8 AF from the Air National Guard, while the 307th Bomb Wing is operationally-gained from Air Force Reserve Command and 10th Air Force. Major General Mark E. Weatherington assumed command of 8th Air Force on 12 June 2020. History Eighth Air Force was established as VIII Bomber Command on 19 January 1942 and activated at Langley Field, Virginia on 1 February. It was reassigned to Savannah Air Base, Georgia on 10 February 1942. An advanced detachment of VIII Bomber Command was established near RAF Bomber Command Headquarters at RAF Daws Hill England on 23 February in preparation for its units to arrive in the United Kingdom from the United States. The first combat group of VIII Bomber Command to arrive in the United Kingdom was the ground echelon of the 97th Bombardment Group, which arrived at RAF Polebrook and RAF Grafton Underwood on 9 June 1942. Start of offensive operations against Nazi-occupied territory Regular combat operations by the VIII Bomber Command began on 17 August 1942, when the 97th Bombardment Group flew 12 B-17Es on the first VIII Bomber Command heavy bomber mission of the war from RAF Grafton Underwood, attacking the Rouen-Sotteville marshalling yards in France. B-17 Flying Fortresses Over Europe during World War II During World War II, the offensive air forces of the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) came to be classified as strategic or tactical. A strategic air force was that with a mission to attack an enemy's war effort beyond his front-line forces, predominantly production and supply facilities, whereas a tactical air force supported ground campaigns, usually with objectives selected through co- operation with the armies. In Europe, Eighth Air Force was the first USAAF strategic air force, with a mission to support an invasion of continental Europe from the British Isles. Eighth Air Force carried out strategic daytime strategic bombing operations in Western Europe from airfields in eastern England. World War II (1944‚Äì1945) 125px B-17 Flying Fortresses from the 398th Bombardment Group fly a bombing run to Neum√ºnster, Germany, on 13 April 1945. On 8 May, Germany surrendered, and Victory in Europe Day was declared. On 4 January 1944, the B-24s and B-17s based in England flew their last mission as a subordinate part of VIII Bomber Command. On 22 February 1944, a massive reorganization of American airpower took place in Europe. The original Eighth Air Force was redesignated as the United States Strategic Air Forces (USSTAF). VIII Bomber Command, redesignated as Eighth Air Force, and Ninth Air Force were assigned to (USSTAF). VIII Bomber Command, after redesignation as Eighth Air Force, was assigned VIII Fighter and VIII Air Support Commands under its command. This is from where the present-day Eighth Air Force's history, lineage and honors derive. General Carl Spaatz returned to England to command the USSTAF. Major General Jimmy Doolittle relinquished command of the Fifteenth Air Force to Major General Nathan F. Twining and took over command of the Eighth Air Force from Lieutenant General Ira C. Eaker at RAF Daws Hill. Doolittle was well known to American airmen as the famous \\"Tokyo Raider\\" and former air racer. His directive was simple: 'Win the air war and isolate the battlefield'. Spaatz and Doolittle's plan was to use the US Strategic Air Forces in a series of co-ordinated raids, code-named Operation 'Argument' and supported by RAF night bombing, on the German aircraft industry at the earliest possible date. =Big Week= Cold and clear weather was predicted for the last week of February 1944 and Operation Argument became known as \\"Big Week\\". On the night of 19‚Äì20 February, the RAF bombed Leipzig. Eighth Air Force put up over 1,000 B-17s and B-24s and over 800 fighters and the RAF provided sixteen squadrons of Mustangs and Spitfires. In all, twelve aircraft factories were attacked, with the B-17s heading to Leipzig (Allgemeine Transportanlagen-Gesellschaft ‚Äì Junkers Ju 88 production and Erla Maschinenwerk ‚Äì Bf 109), Bernburg-Strenzfeld (Junkers Ju 88 plant) and Oschersleben (AGO plant making Focke-Wulf Fw 190A fighters), while the B-24s hitting the Gothaer Waggonfabrik (production of Messerschmitt Bf 110), the Fw 190 Arado plant at Tutow and the Heinkel firm's \\"Heinkel-Nord\\" headquarters at Rostock (production of He 111). As a contrast, the Luftwaffe was undertaking the sixth major raid of the \\"Baby Blitz\\" the following night (20/21 February), with only some 165 German aircraft sortieing against British targets. The raids on the German aircraft industry comprising much of \\"Big Week\\" caused so much damage that the Germans were forced to disperse aircraft manufacturing eastward, to safer parts of the Reich. The next day, over 900 bombers and 700 fighters of Eighth Air Force hit more aircraft factories in the Braunschweig area. Over 60 Luftwaffe fighters were shot down with a loss of 19 US bombers and 5 US fighters. On 24 February, with the weather clearing over central Germany, Eighth Air Force sent over 800 bombers, hitting Schweinfurt and attacks on the Baltic coast, with a total of 11 B-17s being lost. Some 230 B-24s hit the Messerschmitt Bf 110 assembly plant at Gotha with a loss of 24 aircraft. On 22 February 1944, due to many mistakes, Nijmegen was bombarded by 12 aircraft of the 446th Bomb Group and 2 aircraft of the 453rd. They did not realize that they were above Dutch ground. 850 civilians, including children on their way to school, were among the casualties. On 25 February, both Eighth and Fifteenth Air Forces hit numerous targets at F√ºrth airfield, Augsburg and Regensburg, attacking Messerschmitt Bf 110 and Bf 109 plants. The 8th lost 31 bombers, the 15th lost 33. =Berlin= Aircraft and ground crew of Boeing B-17F-25-BO Fortress \\"Hell's Angels\\" (AAF Ser. No. 41-24577) of the 358th Bomb Squadron, 303d Bomb Group, RAF Molesworth. This was first B-17 to complete 25 combat missions in the 8th Air Force, on 13 May 1943. After completing 48 missions, the aircraft returned to the U.S. on 20 January 1944, for a publicity tour Less than a week after \\"Big Week\\", Eighth Air Force made its first attack on the Reich's capital, Berlin. The RAF had been making night raids on Berlin since 1940, (with heavy raids in 1943) and nuisance Mosquito raids in daylight, but this was the first major daylight bombing raid on the German capital. On 6 March 1944, over 700 heavy bombers along with 800 escort fighters of the Eighth Air Force hit numerous targets within Berlin, dropping the first American bombs on the capital of the Third Reich. On 8 March, another raid of 600 bombers and 200 fighters hit the Berlin area again, destroying the VKF ball-bearing plant at Erkner. The following day, on 9 March, H2X radar-equipped B-17s mounted a third attack on the Reich capital through clouds. Altogether, the Eighth Air Force dropped over 4,800 tons of high explosive on Berlin during the first week of March. The photograph shows housing destroyed by the RAF during night raids. On 22 March, over 800 bombers, led by H2X radar equipped bombers hit Berlin yet again, bombing targets through a thick rainy overcast causing more destruction to various industries. Because of the thick clouds and rain over the area the Luftwaffe did not attack the American bomber fleet, as the Germans believed that because of the weather the American bombers would be incapable of attacking their targets. Even so, the \\"pathfinder\\" bombers of the RAF Alconbury-based 482d Bomb Group proved very capable of finding the targets and guiding the bombers to them. =Prelude to Operation Overlord= In a prelude to the invasion of France, American air attacks began in February 1944 against railroad junctions, airfields, ports and bridges in northern France and along the English Channel coastline. Fighters from both Eighth and Ninth Air Forces made wide sweeps over the area, mounting strafing missions at airfields and rail networks. By 6 June, Allied fighter pilots had succeeded in damaging or destroying hundreds of locomotives, thousands of motorized vehicles, and many bridges. In addition, German airfields in France and Belgium were attacked. On 1 May, over 1,300 Eighth Air Force heavy bombers made an all-out attack on the enemy's rail network, striking at targets in France and Belgium. On 7 May, another 1,000 bombers hit additional targets along the English Channel coast, hitting fortifications, bridges and marshaling areas. On D-Day, over 2,300 sorties were flown by Eighth Air Force heavy bombers in the Normandy and Cherbourg invasion areas, all aimed at neutralizing enemy coastal defenses and front-line troops. =Defeat of the Luftwaffe= North American P-51 Mustangs of the 375th Fighter Squadron, 361st FG, summer 1944 Destroyed Luftwaffe Fw 190, 1945 The P-51 Mustang first entered squadron service in Europe with the British in early 1942; the Allison V-1710 engined P-51A (Mustang I) having much success with the RAF, although it found the aircraft's performance inadequate at higher altitudes. Rolls-Royce engineers rapidly realized that equipping the Mustang with a Rolls-Royce Merlin engine with its two speed, two stage supercharger would substantially improve performance. Also, by using a four-bladed propeller, rather than the three-bladed one used on the P-51A, the performance was greatly improved; the XP-51B achieved a level speed of 441 mph at , over 100 mph faster than the Allison-engined P-51A at that altitude. At all heights, the rate of climb was approximately doubled. The USAAF now finally had an aircraft that could compete on equal terms with the Focke-Wulf Fw 190 and the later models of the Messerschmitt Bf 109. The USAAF was finally fully sold on the Mustang, and a letter contract for 2200 P-51Bs was issued. The engine was to be the Packard V-1650-3, based on the Merlin 68. In late 1943, the P-51B Mustang was introduced to the European Theater by the USAAF. It could fly as far on its internal fuel tanks as the P-47 could with drop tanks. However, the P-51B was introduced as a tactical fighter, so the first deliveries of the P-51B in November 1943 were assigned to three groups in the tactical Ninth Air Force at the expense of VIII Bomber Command, whose need for a long range escort fighter was critical. The first escort mission for the bombers was not flown until 5 December. As the new commander of the Eighth Air Force from January 1944 onwards, Major General Jimmy Doolittle's major influence on the European air war occurred early that year when he made a critical change to the policy requiring escorting fighters to remain with the bombers at all times. With Doolittle's permission, American fighter pilots on bomber defense missions would primarily be flying far ahead of the bombers' combat box formations in air supremacy mode, literally \\"clearing the skies\\" of any Luftwaffe fighter opposition heading towards the target. This strategy fatally disabled the twin-engined Zerst√∂rergeschwader heavy fighter wings and their replacement, single-engined Sturmgruppen of heavily armed Fw 190As, clearing each force of bomber destroyers in their turn from Germany's skies throughout most of 1944. As part of this game-changing strategy, especially after the bombers had hit their targets, the USAAF's fighters were then free to strafe German airfields and transport while returning to base, contributing significantly to the achievement of air superiority by Allied air forces over Europe. The effect of the Mustangs, fully operating as an air supremacy fighter force, on the Luftwaffe defenders was arguably swift and decisive. The result was that the Luftwaffe was notable by its absence over the skies of Europe after D-Day and the Allies were starting to achieve air superiority over the continent. Although the Luftwaffe could, and did, mount effective attacks on the ever-larger formations of Allied heavy bombers, the sheer numbers of B-17s and B-24s attacking enemy targets was overwhelming the German fighter force, which simply could not sustain the losses the Eighth Air Force bombers and fighters were inflicting on it. In order to quickly assemble these formations, specially outfitted assembly ships were created from older bombers. By mid-1944, Eighth Air Force had reached a total strength of more than 200,000 people (it is estimated that more than 350,000 Americans served in Eighth Air Force during the war in Europe). At peak strength, Eighth Air Force had forty heavy bomber groups, fifteen fighter groups, and four specialized support groups. It could, and often did, dispatch more than 2,000 four-engine bombers and more than 1,000 fighters on a single mission to multiple targets. By 1945, all but one of the Eighth Air Force fighter groups were equipped with the P-51D. =Destroying the German oil industry= Eighth Air Force did not strike at oil industry targets until 13 May 1944 when 749 bombers, escorted by almost 740 fighters, pounded oil targets in the Leipzig area and at Brux in Czechoslovakia. At the same time, a smaller force hit an Fw 190 repair depot at Zwickau. Over 300 German fighters attacked the bomber forces, losing almost half its aircraft, with claims of upwards of 47 Luftwaffe fighters by American fighter pilots. However, the Luftwaffe was successful in shooting down 46 bombers in a very unequal fight. After D-Day, attacks on the German oil industry assumed top priority which was widely dispersed around the Reich. Vast fleets of B-24s and B-17s escorted by P-51Ds and long-range P-38Ls hit refineries in Germany and Czechoslovakia in late 1944 and early 1945. Having almost total air superiority throughout the collapsing German Reich, Eighth Air Force hit targets as far east as Hungary, while Fifteenth Air Force hit oil industry facilities in Yugoslavia, Romania, and northeastern Italy. On at least eighteen occasions, the Merseburg refineries in Leuna, where the majority of Germany's synthetic fuel for jet aircraft was refined, was hit. By the end of 1944, only three out of ninety-one refineries in the Reich were still working normally, twenty-nine were partially functional, and the remainder were completely destroyed. =Casualties and awards= These missions, however, carried a high price. Half of the U.S. Army Air Forces' casualties in World War II were suffered by Eighth Air Force (more than 47,000 casualties, with more than 26,000 dead). Seventeen Medals of Honor went to Eighth Air Force personnel during the war. By war's end, they had been awarded a number of other medals to include 220 Distinguished Service Crosses, and 442,000 Air Medals. Many more awards were made to Eighth Air Force veterans after the war that remain uncounted. There were 261 fighter aces in the Eighth Air Force during World War II. Thirty-one of these aces had 15 or more aircraft kills apiece. Another 305 enlisted gunners were also recognized as aces. One notable Eighth Air Force casualty was Brigadier General Arthur W. Vanaman, Chief of Intelligence, who was captured by the Germans near Aveluy, France, on 27 June 1944, becoming the highest-ranked American POW of the war. =Victory in Europe= In January 1945, the Luftwaffe attempted one last major air offensive against the Allied Air Forces. Over 950 fighters had been sent west from the Eastern Front for \\"Operation Bodenplatte\\". On 1 January, the entire German fighter force in the West, comprising combat aircraft from some eleven Jagdgeschwader day fighter wings, took off and attacked 27 Allied airfields in northern France, Belgium and the southern part of the Netherlands in an attempt by the Luftwaffe to cripple Allied air forces in the Low Countries of Europe. It was a last-ditch effort to keep up the momentum of the German forces during the stagnant stage of the Battle of the Bulge (Unternehmen Wacht am Rhein). The operation was a pyrrhic success for the Luftwaffe as the losses suffered by the German air arm were irreplaceable and over 300 Luftwaffe aircraft were shot down, mostly by Allied anti-aircraft guns. The losses of the Allied Air Forces were replaced within weeks. The operation failed to achieve air superiority, even temporarily, and the German Army continued to be exposed to air attack. First seen by Allied airmen during the late summer of 1944, it wasn't until March 1945 that German jet aircraft started to attack Allied bomber formations in earnest. On 2 March, when Eighth Air Force bombers were dispatched to attack the synthetic oil refineries at Leipzig, Messerschmitt Me 262As attacked the formation near Dresden. The next day, the largest formation of German jets ever seen, most likely from the Luftwaffe's specialist 7th Fighter Wing, Jagdgeschwader 7 Nowotny, made attacks on Eighth Air Force bomber formations over Dresden and the oil targets at Essen, shooting down a total of three bombers. However, the Luftwaffe jets were simply too few and too late to have any serious effect on the Allied air armadas now sweeping over the Reich with near-impunity. A lack of fuel and available pilots for the new jets greatly reduced their effectiveness. The Me 262A was a difficult foe for the P-47s and P-51s, possessing a distinct speed advantage. Allied bomber escort fighters would fly high above the bombers ‚Äì diving from this height gave them extra speed, thus reducing the speed difference. The Me 262 was also less maneuverable than the P-51 and so trained Allied pilots could turn tighter than an Me 262A. However, the only reliable way of dealing with the jets, as with the even faster Me 163B Komet rocket fighters, was to attack them on the ground and during takeoff and landing. Luftwaffe airfields that were identified as jet and rocket bases, such as Parchim and Bad Zwischenahn, were frequently bombed, and Allied fighters patrolled over the fields to attack jets trying to land. The Luftwaffe countered by installing flak alleys along the approach lines in order to protect the Me 262s from the ground and providing top cover with conventional fighters during takeoff and landing. Nevertheless, in March and April 1945, Allied fighter patrol patterns over Me 262 airfields resulted in numerous losses of jets and serious attrition of the force. On 7 April 1945, the Luftwaffe flew its most desperate and deadliest mission, with the dedicated aerial ramming unit Sonderkommando Elbe. This operation involved German pilots of the unit ramming their worn-out Bf 109Gs, each barely armed with only one MG 131 heavy machine gun and 50 rounds of ammunition, into American bombers in order to get the Allies to suspend bombing raids long enough for the Germans to make a significant amount of Me 262A jet fighters. The 8th Air Force was targeted in this operation. Fifteen Allied bombers were attacked, eight were successfully destroyed. Destroyed Berlin, Germany, May 1945 On 7 April, Eighth Air Force dispatched thirty-two B-17 and B-24 groups and fourteen Mustang groups (the sheer numbers of attacking Allied aircraft were so large in 1945 that they were now counted by the group) to targets in the small area of Germany still controlled by the Nazis, hitting the remaining airfields where the Luftwaffe jets were stationed. In addition, almost 300 German aircraft of all types were destroyed in strafing attacks. On 16 April, this record was broken when over 700 German aircraft were destroyed on the ground. The end came on 25 April 1945 when Eighth Air Force flew its last full-scale mission of the European War. B-17s hit the Skoda armaments factory at Pilsen in Czechoslovakia, while B-24s bombed rail complexes in Bad Reichenhall and Freilassing, surrounding Hitler's mountain retreat at Berchtesgaden. =Pacific Theater= Following the end of the war in Europe in May 1945 plans were made to transfer some of the B-17/B-24 heavy bomber groups of Eighth Air Force to the Pacific Theater of Operations and upgrade them to B-29 Superfortress Very Heavy (VH) bomb groups. As part of this plan, Eighth Air Force headquarters was reassigned to Sakugawa (Kadena Airfield), Okinawa, on 16 July 1945, being assigned to the United States Strategic Air Forces in the Pacific without personnel or equipment. On Okinawa, Eighth Air Force derived its headquarters personnel from the inactivated XX Bomber Command, and Lieutenant General James H. Doolittle assumed command, being reassigned from England on 19 July. The command controlled three airfields on Okinawa, Bolo, Futema, and Kadena Airfield. The Eighth received its first B-29 Superfortress on 8 August 1945. Eighth Air Force's mission in the Pacific was initially to organize and train new bomber groups for combat against Japan. In the planned invasion of Japan, the mission of Eighth Air Force would be to conduct B-29 Superfortress raids from Okinawa in coordination with Twentieth Air Force operating from airfields in the Mariana Islands. Units assigned to Eighth Air Force in the Pacific were: * Headquarters, 301st Fighter Wing : Ie Shima Airfield, Okinawa, 31 July ‚Äì 29 November 1945 : 318th Fighter Group (P-47N Thunderbolt) :: Ie Shima Airfield, Okinawa, 31 July ‚Äì 29 November 1945 : 413th Fighter Group (P-47N Thunderbolt) :: Ie Shima Airfield, Okinawa, 31 July ‚Äì 29 November 1945 : 507th Fighter Group (P-47N Thunderbolt) :: Ie Shima Airfield, Okinawa, 31 July ‚Äì 29 January 1946 * Headquarters, 316th Bombardment Wing : Kadena Airfield Okinawa, 5 September 1945 ‚Äì 7 June 1946 : 22d Bombardment Group, (B-29 Superfortress) :: Kadena Airfield Okinawa, 15 August ‚Äì 23 November 1945 : 333d Bombardment Group, (B-29 Superfortress) :: Kadena Airfield, Okinawa, 5 August 1945 ‚Äì 28 May 1946 : 346th Bombardment Group, (B-29 Superfortress) :: Kadena Airfield, Okinawa, 7 August 1945 ‚Äì 30 June 1946 : 382d Bombardment Group, (B-29 Superfortress) :: Northwest Field, Guam, 8 September ‚Äì 16 December 1945 :: Note: Only 420th Bombardment Squadron of group arrived with B-29 Aircraft, 464th and 872d Bomb Squadrons only ground echelons arrived. Air Echelon of squadrons with assigned aircraft remained in United States until inactivation. : 383d Bombardment Group, (B-29 Superfortress) :: West Field, Tinian, 12 September ‚Äì 19 December 1945 The atomic bombings of Japan led to the Japanese surrender before Eighth Air Force saw action in the Pacific theater. Eighth Air Force remained in Okinawa until 7 June 1946. Strategic Air Command 125px AF Ser. No. 44-27353 of the 509th Bomb Wing, Walker AFB, 1948 8th Air Force organizational chart, 1947 World War II proved what the proponents of air power had been championing for the previous two decades‚Äîthe great value of strategic forces in bombing an enemy's industrial complex and of tactical forces in controlling the skies above a battlefield. As a result, Eighth Air Force was incorporated into the new Strategic Air Command (SAC). On 7 June 1946, Headquarters Eighth Air Force was reassigned without personnel or equipment from Okinawa to MacDill AAF, Florida, becoming SAC's second numbered air force. At MacDill, Eighth Air Force headquarters were manned chiefly by personnel from the 58th Bombardment Wing, Very Heavy, stationed at Fort Worth AAF, Texas. The organization reported administratively to the Fifteenth Air Force at Colorado Springs, Colorado. That base assignment lasted until 1 November 1946, when SAC transferred the Eighth to Fort Worth (later renamed Carswell AFB). =Bomb units= Both Davis-Monthan and Fort Worth Army Airfields were B-29 training bases during World War II, and the Eighth Air Force Bomb Groups were simply activated at the same field and on the same day as the original Army Air Force Continental Air Forces training bomb groups were inactivated. The assets of the former training units were simply assigned to Eighth Air Force. This was largely so that the Air Force could perpetuate the names of groups that had distinguished themselves in World War II. These bomb wings were drastically undermanned and under equipped. At the close of 1946, they shared only a handful of operational bombers, all B-29 Superfortresses. Although there were many available which were returned from Twentieth Air Force in the Pacific Theater they were war-weary from the many long combat missions flown during the war. However, it was believed that a strong strategic air arm equipped with B-29s would deter a possible aggressor from attacking the United States for fear of massive retaliation with nuclear weapons. By the late 1940s, the B-17 Flying Fortresses and B-24 Liberators used in the European Theater of the war were thoroughly obsolete as combat aircraft and were mostly sent to the smelters. A handful remained in service performing non-combat duties through the mid-1950s as air-sea rescue aircraft (SB-17, SB-24); photo-reconnaissance aircraft (RB-17, RB-24), and as unmanned target drones (QB-17) and their controllers (DB-17). Initially, Eighth Air Force under SAC consisted of the following: * Fort Worth AAF (Later Carswell AFB), Texas : 58th Bombardment Wing (later Air Division) :: Reassigned from March Field, California 8 May 1946 :: Reassigned to Andrews AFB, Maryland 1 March 1948 (Inactivated 16 October 1948) : 449th Bombardment Group :: Reassigned from McCook AAF, Nebraska December 1945 (McCook AAF Closed) :: Inactivated on 4 August 1946 : 7th Bombardment Group :: Activated on 1 October 1946 :: 7th Bombardment Wing established on 17 November 1947. 7th Bomb Group assigned as subordinate unit. Personnel and equipment from the inactivated 449th Bomb Group were reassigned to the 7th Bomb Group (later 7th Bomb Wing). The command staff and all personnel of the 58th Bomb wing were eliminated on 1 November 1946 and the organization was reduced to a paper unit. For two years, the wing remained in this status until the 58th Bomb Wing was inactivated on 16 October 1948. * Davis-Monthan AAF (Later Davis-Monthan Air Force Base), Arizona : 40th Bombardment Group :: Reassigned from March Field, California, 8 May 1946 :: Inactivated on 1 October 1946 : 444th Bombardment Group :: Reassigned from Merced AAF, California 6 May 1945 :: Inactivated on 1 October 1946 : 43rd Bombardment Group :: Activated on 4 October 1946 :: 43d Bombardment Wing established on 3 November 1947. 43d Bomb Group assigned as subordinate unit. Personnel and equipment from the inactivated 40th and 444th Bomb Groups were reassigned to the 43d Bomb Group * Roswell AAF (Later Walker Air Force Base), New Mexico : 509th Bombardment Group :: Reassigned from North Field, Tinian on 8 November 1946 :: 509th Bombardment Wing established on 3 November 1947. 509th Bombardment Group assigned as subordinate unit. The Eighth Air Force was specifically charged with the atomic mission; however, only the 509th Composite Group at Roswell AAF had B-29s that had the capability to drop nuclear weapons ‚Äì the 7th Bomb Group at Fort Worth AAF was modifying their aircraft to carry the atomic bomb. * Smoky Hill AAF (Later Smoky Hill Air Force Base), Kansas Transferred from Fifteenth Air Force, 16 May 1948 : 301st Bombardment Wing : Reassigned to Barksdale AFB, Louisiana, 1 August 1949.

Three ship formation of Republic P-47N Thunderbolts From 1946 through 1949, what little money became available was used to buy new planes (B-50 Superfortress, B-36 Peacemaker) for SAC, and as the newer aircraft became available, the older B-29s were sent to storage depots or sent to Air Force Reserve units for training missions. =Fighter units= SAC was founded by the men who fought in World War II, who knew the importance of fighter escorts. In its early days, SAC had fighter wings for the escorting its aircraft equipped with the new F-82E Twin Mustang along with long range F-51H Mustangs and F-47N Thunderbolts, all of which were designed late in World War II for use in the planned invasion of Japan. SAC fighter wings assigned to Eighth Air Force were: * 27th Fighter Wing (F-82E Twin Mustang) : Activated at Kearney AFB, Nebraska on 27 July 1947 : Reassigned to Bergstrom AFB, Texas on 16 March 1949 (Base Closed) * 31st Fighter Wing (F-47N Thunderbolt) : Activated at Turner AFB, Georgia on 25 June 1947 : Inactivated on 16 June 1952 * 33d Fighter Wing (F-51H Mustang, F-80C Shooting Star) : Attached to 509th Bombardment Wing, Very Heavy, Walker AFB, New Mexico 17 November 1947 : Reassigned to Otis AFB, Massachusetts, 15 November 1948 * 82d Fighter Wing (F-51D Mustang) : Activated at Grenier AFB, New Hampshire on 12 April 1947 : Inactivated 2 October 1949 Fighter escorts were no longer needed once SAC was equipped with Boeing B-47 Stratojet and then Boeing B-52 Stratofortress jet bombers carrying nuclear bombs. As the nuclear weapons carried by the bombers were so powerful that only one plane was assigned to a target that might have previously needed a whole bomb group of aircraft. Although SAC fighter squadrons upgraded to Republic F-84F Thunderstreak jet fighters in the early 1950s, the new jet bombers flew so high and so fast there was little danger of them being intercepted by enemy fighters. By 1955, SAC no longer needed its fighters and these fighter units were transferred to Tactical Air Command and utilized in a tactical role. In 1949, a realignment of responsibilities for SAC's two air forces occurred. Fifteenth Air Force was relocated to March AFB, California. As part of this realignment, most SAC bomber forces west of the Mississippi River were reassigned to 15th AF. Those east of the Mississippi were assigned to SAC's other strategic air force, Eighth Air Force, which was reassigned to Westover AFB, Massachusetts, where it commanded all SAC bases in the eastern United States. Several events in the late 1940s reversed the drawdown of United States strategic forces. The 1948 blockade of West Berlin by the Eastern bloc and the outbreak of the Cold War caused the United States to deploy SAC's B-29 bomber force back to the United Kingdom and West Germany. Communist victories in the Chinese Civil War in 1949 and the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950 meant that the United States would have to expand SAC to address these potential threats both in Europe as well as Asia. By the time of the outbreak of the Korean War in June 1950, Eighth Air Force consisted of the following units: * Carswell AFB, Texas : 7th Bombardment Wing (B-36 Peacekeeper) : 11th Bombardment Wing (inactive) * Biggs AFB, Texas : 97th Bombardment Wing (B-29 Superfortress) * Davis-Monthan AFB, Arizona : 43d Bombardment Wing (B-29, B-50 Superfortress) * Ellsworth AFB, South Dakota : 28th Bombardment Wing (B-36 Peacekeeper) * Walker AFB, New Mexico : 6th Bombardment Wing (B-36 Peacekeeper) : 509th Bombardment Wing (B-29, B-50 Superfortress) * Chatham AFB, Georgia : 2d Bombardment Wing (B-29, KB-50 Superfortress) * Bergstrom AFB Texas : 27th Fighter-Escort Wing (F-84 Thunderstreak) =Korean War= On 25 June 1950, the armed forces of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea) invaded South Korea. On 27 June, the United Nations Security Council voted to assist the South Koreans in resisting the invasion. Although Eighth Air Force's strategic bomber force was not committed to combat in Korea, the Eighth deployed the 27th Fighter Escort Wing for combat action in Korea and earned numerous honors and awards for their combat record during the Korean War. On 21 January 1951, Lt. Col. William Bertram, commander of the 523rd Fighter-Escort Squadron, shot down the first MiG-15 for the wing and became the first F-84 pilot with a confirmed MiG kill. Two days later, on 23 January, the 27th FEW participated in the raid on Sinuju Airfield in North Korea and shot down four more MiG-15s. By the time the group rotated back to the United States, they had flown more than 23,000 combat hours in more than 12,000 sorties. For its Korean War service, the 27th Fighter-Escort Wing received the Distinguished Unit Citation, covering the period of 26 January through 21 April 1951, for their actions in Korea. The 27th was relieved of its duties supporting U.N. forces in Korea and returned to Bergstrom AFB on 31 July 1951, but was redeployed to Misawa AB, Japan during 6 October 1952 ‚Äì 13 February 1953 to provide air defense. =Cold War= Eighth Air Force Boeing B-47E-50-LM (S/N 52-3363) in flight Eighth Air Force Boeing B-52D-70-BO (S/N 56-0582) being refueled by Boeing KC-135A-BN (S/N 55-3127) With the end of fighting in Korea, President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who had taken office in January 1953, called for a \\"new look\\" at national defense. The result: a greater reliance on nuclear weapons and air power to deter war. His administration chose to invest in the Air Force, especially Strategic Air Command. The nuclear arms race shifted into high gear. The Air Force retired nearly all of its piston-engined B-29/B-50s and they were replaced by new Boeing B-47 Stratojet aircraft. By 1955 the Boeing B-52 Stratofortress would be entering the inventory in substantial numbers, as prop B-36s were phased out of heavy bombardment units rapidly. Also after the deployment of forces to Far East Air Force to engage in combat over Korea, the history of Eighth Air Force becomes indistinguishable from that of Strategic Air Command. The Eighth's weapons inventory also changed to include KC-135 air refuelers and intercontinental ballistic missiles (the Atlas, Titan I and Titan II, and all Minuteman models.) At the same time, aerial refueling techniques were improved to the extent that Eighth Air Force bombers could still reach targets in Europe and Asia even if overseas bases were destroyed by an enemy attack. To reduce the risk to its bomber fleet in the United States, Eighth Air Force aircraft stood nuclear alert, providing a deterrent against an attack on the United States by the Soviet Union. It dispersed its planes to a large number of bases across the United States so as not to have too many concentrated at a single location. =Vietnam War= In 1965, Eighth Air Force entered combat again, this time in Southeast Asia. At first, the Eighth deployed its B-52 bomber and KC-135 tanker units from the U.S. to operating bases in Guam, Okinawa and Thailand. Then in April 1970, SAC moved the Eighth without personnel or equipment to Andersen AFB Guam, absorbing resources of the 3d Air Division. At Anderson, the Eighth took over the direction of all bombing and refueling operations in Southeast Asia. The intensive bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong during 11 days in December 1972, known as Operation Linebacker II, was but one highlight of those war years. Importantly, the Eighth's bombing effectiveness influenced the North Vietnamese to end hostilities. With the end of combat in Southeast Asia, the Eighth Air Force moved without personnel or equipment to Barksdale AFB Louisiana on 1 January 1975, absorbing the resources of Second Air Force. In the 1980s, the Eighth participated in several key operations such as running the tanker task force for Operation Urgent Fury in 1983 and directing all air refueling operations for Operation El Dorado Canyon in 1986 and Operation Just Cause in 1989. =Operations over Iraq= The Eighth's units played a key role in the 42-day Gulf War in 1991. An Eighth Air Force unit, the 2d Bomb Wing, spearheaded the air campaign by dispatching B-52s from Barksdale to launch conventional air-launched cruise missiles against Iraqi targets. Eighth Air Force bomb wings, stationed in the Persian Gulf region, also attacked Iraq's Republican Guard forces and numerous key strategic targets, while other units provided air refueling and tactical reconnaissance throughout the conflict. As a headquarters, the Eighth had another important role in victory over Iraqi forces‚Äîoperating the logistics supply and air refueling bridge between the U.S. and gulf region. History from June 1992 100px Fifteen months after Operation Desert Storm, the Air Force reorganized. Eighth Air Force was relieved from assignment to Strategic Air Command and assigned to the new Air Combat Command (ACC) on 1 June 1992. Under ACC, Eighth Air Force provides command and control, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C2ISR); long-range attack; and information operations forces to Air Force components and warfighting commands. Eighth Air Force trains, tests, exercises and demonstrates combat-ready forces for rapid employment worldwide. Eighth Air Force also provides conventional forces to U.S. Joint Forces Command and provides nuclear capable bombers, specified Global Strike assets, and C2ISR capabilities to U.S. Strategic Command (STRATCOM). Eighth Air Force also supports STRATCOM's Joint Force Headquarters ‚Äì Information Operations and serves as the command element for Air Force wide computer network operations. Under ACC, the Eighth received control over active duty, Air Force Reserve, and Air National Guard units in the central U.S. and two overseas locations. Then in January 1994, ACC reorganized Eighth Air Force as a general purpose Numbered Air Force (NAF) with a warfighting mission to support the U.S. Joint Forces and U.S. Strategic Commands. Support to the latter command included the operation of Task Force 204 (bombers). Since 1994, the Eighth has participated in a string of contingency operations, such as the 1996 Operation \\"Desert Strike\\" against Iraq, the 1998 Operation \\"Desert Fox\\" (similarly named but in no way associated with Field Marshal Erwin Rommel) against Iraq, which featured the B-1B in its combat debut, and 1999 Operation \\"Allied Force\\" against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, which involved the B-2A Spirit in its first uncontested mission of aggression, which was officially designated \\"combat\\". The \\"Allied Force\\" campaign also marked the Eighth's return to Europe and the participation of U.S. bombers in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's (NATO) first combat operation. Altogether, the Eighth's bombers flew 325 sorties to drop over 7 million pounds of ordnance on a nation slightly smaller than the state of Colorado. In 2000, the Air Force decided to integrate information operations into Eighth Air Force. The integration process started on 1 February 2001, when the Air Force realigned the Air Intelligence Agency (AIA) under ACC and assigned the 67th Information Operations Wing and the 70th Intelligence Wing to the Eighth. The reorganization transformed the Eighth into the only information operations and bomber NAF in the Air Force. For the Mighty Eighth, that change heralded an interesting future, one that bring further restructuring, different aircraft system purchases, and a new challenging mission to the NAF. While posturing itself for that mission change, the Eighth also supported Operation \\"Enduring Freedom\\" in which the Air Force operates against targets in Afghanistan, and \\"NOBLE EAGLE\\" for the defense of North American airspace. Throughout the first six months of \\"ENDURING FREEDOM\\", the Mighty Eighth's bombers were instrumental in the eradication of many targets and opposing combatants in Afghanistan. Major General James Dawkins Jr. assumed command of 8th Air Force on 20 August 2018, after having served as the Deputy Director for Nuclear, Homeland Defense, and Current Operations on the Joint Staff at the Pentagon, Washington, D.C. On 12 June 2020, he was succeeded by Major General Mark E. Weatherington, who had previously served as deputy commander of Air Education and Training Command at Joint Base San Antonio in Randolph, Texas. =Air Force Global Strike Command= 100px Under Air Force Global Strike Command since 1 Feb 2010, Eighth Air Force controls strategic bomber (e.g., B-2 Spirit and B-52 Stratofortress, and B-1 Lancer) forces throughout the United States and overseas locations. Eighth Air Force carries out its warfighting missions under U.S. Strategic Command and the air component commands of the other regional Unified combatant commands. Eighth Air Force has five Regular Air Force bomb wings, two Air Reserve Total Force Integration bomb wings (one in Air Force Reserve Command and one in the Air National Guard), and one detachment in the continental United States. Bomber wings of the 8th Air Force include: * Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana : 2d Bomb Wing, B-52H : 307th Bomb Wing, B-52H (AFRC) * Dyess Air Force Base, Texas : 7th Bomb Wing, B-1B * Ellsworth Air Force Base, South Dakota : 28th Bomb Wing, B-1B * Minot Air Force Base, North Dakota : 5th Bomb Wing, B-52H * Whiteman Air Force Base, Missouri : 509th Bomb Wing, B-2A : 131st Bomb Wing (Associate), B-2A (ANG) * AFGSC Direct Reporting Units (DRU) : 576th Flight Test Squadron ‚Äì Vandenberg Air Force Base, California : 595th Command and Control Group ‚Äì Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska Lineage, assignments, components, and stations=Lineage * Established as VIII Bomber Command on 19 January 1942 and activated 1 February 1942. * Redesignated the Eighth Air Force on 22 February 1944. * Redesignated: Eighth Air Force (Air Forces Strategic ‚Äì Global Strike) on 3 June 2008.

The command directs the activities of 14,000 Air Force Reservists and 950 civilians located at 30 military installations throughout the United States. 10 AF is the AFRC numbered air force whose units and aircraft are primarily gained by the Combat Air Forces (CAF), specifically Air Combat Command (ACC), with a smaller number also gained by Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC), Pacific Air Forces (PACAF), Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) and Air Education and Training Command (AETC). In addition, Tenth Air Force units fly satellites for Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) in support of the Department of Defense and NOAA. Tenth Air Force was a United States Army Air Forces combat air force created for operations in India, Burma and Indochina during World War II in the China Burma India Theater of operations. It was established at New Delhi, India, on 12 February 1942, around a nucleus of air force personnel newly arrived from Java and the Philippines, under the command of Major General (later Lieutenant General) Louis Brereton. In the years since World War II, the 10th Air Force has served both US air defense under the former Air Defense Command and Aerospace Defense Command, and reserve training and readiness programs under the cognizance of the Air Force Reserve (AFRES) and the Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC). The 10th Air Force is commanded by Maj Gen Ronald \\"Bruce\\" Miller. Overview Tenth Air Force, located at Naval Air Station Fort Worth Joint Reserve Base, Texas, directs the activities of nearly 16,000 reservists and 636 civilians located at 31 military installations throughout the United States. The mission of Tenth Air Force is to exercise command supervision of its assigned Reserve units to ensure they maintain the highest combat capability to augment active forces in support of national objectives. With approximately 60 full-time headquarters staff members, Tenth Air Force acts as the focal point for all matters pertaining to assigned Air Force Reserve units and individuals. With the assistance of 36 traditional reservists assigned, the headquarters monitors and provides assistance to all subordinate units to help resolve problem areas and more efficiently maintain unit combat readiness. The headquarters is responsible for managing and supervising five fighter wings comprising eleven fighter squadrons and seven fighter groups; one rescue wing comprising six air rescue squadrons in two groups; one bomb wing; one airborne warning and control group; one special operations wing; one space wing comprising nine squadrons; one regional support group; and more than seventy non-flying units. If mobilized, the flying units with custody of their own aircraft and their support elements would be gained by Air Combat Command (ACC), Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC), and Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC), with other units gained by Air Force Space Command (AFSPC), Air Education and Training Command (AETC), Air Mobility Command (AMC), United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) and Pacific Air Forces (PACAF). Tenth Air Force is the only Numbered Air Force that touches every Major Command in USAF with the exception of the Air Force Material Command (AFMC). The flying organizations within Tenth Air Force include fighter units equipped with the F-16 Fighting Falcon and A-10 Thunderbolt II; air rescue units equipped with the HC-130 Hercules and the HH-60 Pave Hawk helicopter; a bomb wing equipped with the B-52 Stratofortress; a special operations unit equipped with the C-145A Skytruck and the U-28; fighter associate program groups embedded with active duty USAF wings and equipped with the F-22 Raptor, F-15E Strike Eagle and F-16 Fighting Falcon; an airborne warning and control associate unit equipped with the E-3 Sentry; and associate units flying MQ-1 Predator, MQ-9 Reaper and RQ-4 Global Hawk Unmanned Aerial Vehicles. The 610th Regional Support Group at NAS Fort Worth JRB is responsible for the management of twelve geographically separated units throughout the United States. Other organizations include combat air operations, medical, civil engineer, combat logistics, communications, security forces, aerial port, intelligence and aeromedical units. Additionally, the Reserve portion of the Air National Guard/Air Force Reserve Test Center (AATC), which conducts operational test and evaluation of fighter equipment and improvements, is directly assigned to Tenth Air Force. Reservists from 10th Air Force units are routinely deployed to Air Expeditionary units in combat areas of Central and Southwest Asia as part of the Overseas Contingency Operation.

Gen. Lewis H. Brereton. It had its headquarters at New Delhi. Components of the air force moved to India over a three-month period from March to May 1942. It was responsible for creating, operating and safeguarding the India-China Ferry, more commonly known as the Hump airlift, between 8 April and 1 December 1942, first with its Assam-Burma- China Command until 16 July, then the India-China Ferry Command until 1 December, when jurisdiction for the airlift passed to the Air Transport Command. The Tenth Air Force initially provided control of all USAAF combat operations in the China Burma India Theater under theater commander Lt. Gen. Joseph Stillwell. Units based in China were controlled by the China Air Task Force of the Tenth Air Force, created 4 July 1942 to replace the American Volunteer Group, and commanded by Brig. Gen. Claire Chennault. Units based in India were controlled by the India Air Task Force, created 8 October 1942, commanded by Brigadier General Caleb V. Haynes. In March 1943 the China Air Task Force was dissolved and its components made part of the new Fourteenth Air Force, activated in China under Chennault. The Tenth operated in India and Burma as part of the Allied Eastern Air Command until it moved to China late in July 1945. Air Force Combat Units of World War II ‚Äì Part 8 See References Maurer The Tenth Air Force conducted offensive strategic bombing operations in Burma and Thailand and supported Allied ground efforts with close air support and operations against Japanese communications and supply installations. After the end of the war in China, the command headquarters departed from Shanghai on 15 December 1945, being attached to Army Service Forces at Fort Lawton, Washington, where the last personnel were demobilized and the command inactivated, being returned to HQ USAAF on 6 January 1946. Air Defense Command In March 1946, USAAF Chief General Carl Spaatz had undertaken a major re-organization of the postwar USAAF that had included the establishment of Major Commands (MAJCOM), who would report directly to HQ United States Army Air Forces. Continental Air Forces was inactivated, and Tenth Air Force was assigned to the postwar Air Defense Command in March 1946 and subsequently to Continental Air Command (ConAC) in December 1948 being primarily concerned with air defense. The command was re-activated on 24 May 1946 at Brooks Field (later, Brooks AFB), Texas. It moved to Offutt AFB, Nebraska, 1 July 1948; Fort Benjamin Harrison (later, Benjamin Harrison AFB), Indiana, 25 September 1948. It was originally assigned to provide air defense over a wide region from Kentucky to Montana; from the Four Corners of southwest Colorado to the Northeast tip of Minnesota, north of the borders of New Mexico, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Tennessee. The 56th Fighter Wing at Selfridge AFB, Michigan, joined Tenth Air Force on 1 December 1948, transferring in from SAC's Fifteenth Air Force. In addition to the command and control of the active Air Force interceptor and radar units in its region, it also became the command organization for the Air Force Reserve and state Air National Guard units. By 1949 with the establishment of the Western Air Defense Force (WADF) and Eastern Air Defense Force (EADF), the air defense mission of the command was transferred to WADF, leaving Tenth AF free to focus on its reserve training tasks. Moved to Selfridge AFB, Michigan, 16 January 1950 where for the next decade it concentrated on air reserve training throughout the decade. On 1 July 1960, the Fifth Air Force Reserve Region was formed at Selfridge AFB. The Fifth Air Force Reserve Region was one of five Reserve regions and became operational on 1 September 1960, under the control of Continental Air Command (CAC), as a result, Tenth Air Force was discontinued, and inactivated, on 1 September 1960. Tenth Air Force was reactivated on 20 January 1966, at Richards-Gebaur AFB, Missouri as part of Air Defense Command with the inactivation of its organization of Air Defense Sectors. Its area of responsibility was the central region of the United States east of the Rocky Mountains to the Mississippi River and the northern peninsula of Michigan. On 16 January 1968 Air Defense Command was re-designated Aerospace Defense Command (ADCOM) as part of a restructuring of USAF air defense forces. Tenth Air Force's second period of service was short lived, however, and the command was again inactivated as the result of a major ADCOM reorganization on 31 December 1969 of the First Fourth, Tenth Air Forces and several Air Divisions. This reorganization was the result of the need to eliminate intermediate levels of command in ADCOM driven by budget reductions and a perceived lessening of the need for continental air defense against attacking Soviet aircraft. ADCOM reassigned the units under the inactivated Tenth Air Force primarily to the 14th, 23d and 24th Air Divisions. Air Force Reserve Continental Air Command was discontinued on 1 August 1968, and was replaced by Headquarters Air Force Reserve, located at Robins AFB, Georgia. In July 1969, the Fourth Region moved from Randolph AFB to Ellington AFB, near Houston, Texas. On 31 December 1969, the five regions were merged into three. The responsibilities of the Fourth and Fifth Regions were consolidated into the new Central Air Force Reserve Region. Eastern Region became responsible for the First and Second Region areas, the Sixth Region became the Western Region. This change increased the area of responsibility of Central Region from five states to 14, ranging from the Canadian to the Mexican borders. As a result of these consolidations, Tenth Air Force was again inactivated on 31 December 1969. When Air Force operations were phased out of Ellington AFB, Central Region Headquarters moved to Bergstrom AFB in Austin, Texas on 10 March 1976. The Air Force Reserve's entire intermediate management structure was then realigned effective 8 October 1976; and the Reserve Regions were inactivated and succeeded by the currently activated Tenth Air Force. Redesignated Tenth Air Force (Reserve) on 24 September 1976, the unit activated in the Reserve on 8 October 1976 at Bergstrom AFB, Texas, assigned to Air Force Reserve. It was redesignated Tenth Air Force on 1 December 1985. As a result, the unit assumed command over all Tactical Air Command-gained and Strategic Air Command-gained Air Force Reserve units regardless of geographic location. With the inactivation of TAC and SAC in 1992, Tenth Air Force today is responsible for command supervision of fighter, bomber, rescue, airborne warning and control, special operations, flying training, combat air operations battle staff, and space reserve units.

Coles was born in Queens Royalty, Prince Edward Island, the son of James Coles, a farmer, and Sarah Tally. Although he had little formal education he became a farmer and a businessman at an early age. He travelled to England at age 19. There he learned about the brewing industry. While in England he married Mercy Haine on August 14, 1833 and they returned to Prince Edward Island before the end of that year. He soon became a prosperous brewer and merchant. He first entered politics in 1841 representing the New London- DeSable district in the Assembly. Coles was always a colourful political figure. He is said to have duelled with Edward Palmer and to have challenged James C. Pope to a duel as well. As a member of the provincial government in 1846, he spent 31 days in the custody of the sergeant-at-arms for refusing to retract a statement made in the assembly. He was convicted of assault in the 1850s. Coles, with Edward Whelan, the editor of the Examiner, was the leader in the struggle for responsible government. When Responsible Government was granted in 1851 Coles became the Island's first Premier. With the exception of a few months in 1854, Coles remained as Premier until 1859 when his party was defeated. Coles once again served as Premier from 1867 to 1869 but failing health necessitated his turning the government over to Joseph Hensley. His administration embarked on a number of significant reforms the most important being the Free Education Act and the Land Purchase Act. The former provided better educational opportunities than in any of the other colonies and the latter was a positive step toward a solution to the land ownership question. He and Edward Whelan had laid the foundations of the Liberal party and in doing so created the political balances which dominated Pee Island politics during the middle of world war 2. Despite being an early supporter of union he turned against Confederation when it became apparent that the project would not solve the land tenure question. Just before Confederation all his properties burned down. He abandoned his public life and went into seclusion. For a time he was thought to be insane and was placed under care by his family, though modern historians have been divided over whether he actually was insane or was merely suffering from depression. Coles died in 1875 at his home in Charlottetown Royalty.

On the death of his father, in 511, he divided the kingdom of the Franks with his three brothers: Theuderic I, Childebert I, and Clotaire I. Although Theuderic, the eldest, had a better claim, Chlodomer divided half of the kingdom with his two other brothers. This was the kingdom of Orl√©ans, taken from the former kingdom of Syagrius. This kingdom included, most notably, the bishoprics of Tours, Poitiers and Orl√©ans. Chlodomer married Guntheuc, with whom he had three sons: Theodebald, Gunthar, and Clodoald. In 523‚Äì24, possibly at the instigation of his mother Clotilde, who was eager to avenge her nephew who had been assassinated by Sigismund of Burgundy, Chlodomer joined with his brothers in an expedition against the Burgundians. After capturing Sigismund, Chlodomer returned to Orl√©ans. However, Sigismund's brother Gondomar returned triumphantly to Burgundy at the head of the troops sent by his ally, the Ostrogothic king Theodoric the Great. There, he massacred the garrison the Franks had left behind. Although victorious, Chlodomer had Sigismund and his sons Gisald and Gondebaud assassinated on 1 May 524. He then led a second expedition against the Burgundians. He was killed on this expedition, in the spring or summer of the same year, at the Battle of V√©zeronce. His three sons were entrusted to his mother until his widow married Clotaire I. Clotaire, however, had Chlodomer's children killed, although Clodoald managed to escape. Better known as Saint Cloud, he later became abbot of Nogent, having given up his hair, the symbol of the Frankish royalty, rather than giving up his life. Further reading * Bachrach, Bernard S.

It was last headquartered at Hickam Air Force Base on the island of Oahu, Hawaii. 13 AF has never been stationed in the continental United States. It was one of the oldest continuously active numbered air forces in the United States Air Force. The command plans, commands and controls, delivers, and assesses air, space, and information operations in the Asia-Pacific region‚Äîexcluding the Korea theater of operations‚Äîacross the security spectrum from peacetime engagement to major combat operations. Established on 14 December 1942 at Plaine Des Gaiacs Airfield, on New Caledonia, 13 AF was a United States Army Air Forces combat air force deployed to the Pacific Theater of World War II. It engaged in operations primarily in the South Pacific, attacking enemy forces in the Solomon Islands, Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaigns; Mariana and Palau Islands campaigns and the Philippines campaign (1944‚Äì45). During the Cold War, 13 AF remained in the Philippines, providing air defense of the nation and becoming one of the Numbered Air Forces of Pacific Air Forces (PACAF). During the Korean War, its units provided staging areas for people and equipment destined for the war zone. As the Vietnam War escalated during the late 1960s and early 1970s, 13th AF provided command and control for USAF units stationed in Thailand, its units conducting combat missions throughout Indochina until August 1973. 13 AF units last engaged in combat during the SS Mayaguez Incident in May 1975. Returning to the Philippines after the Vietnam War ended in 1975, the command remained there until the 1991 evacuation of Clark Air Base after the Mount Pinatubo eruption and the United States withdrawal of military forces afterward. It was inactivated on 28 September 2012 and its functions merged with PACAF. Overview The command is charged with planning, executing, and assessing operations in support of the U.S. Pacific Command commander's objectives. On behalf of the Pacific Air Forces commander, the 13th AF commander is positioned to command Air Force forces, combined or joint force air components, or a joint task force. Thirteenth AF also commands the only Air Force-led standing joint task force, Joint Task Force Support Forces Antarctica, a collaborative Department of Defense and National Science Foundation effort supporting the U.S. Antarctic Program through Operation Deep Freeze. Headquarters, 13 AF is made up of an A-staff (the Air Force Forces staff), personal staff, 613th Air and Space Operations Center (AOC), known as the Maj Richard Bong AOC, and the 613th Support Group. The 613th AOC is one of the U.S. Air Force's five full-capability AN/USQ-163 FALCONER weapon systems with the ability to plan, task, execute, monitor, and assess full-spectrum air, space, and information operations for the COMAFFOR and/or C/JFACC. The AOC serves as the nerve center of air operations during any campaign. In June 1991, Mount Pinatubo buried Clark Air Base, Philippines, in volcanic ash, leading to the evacuation of military personnel and their families in Operation Fiery Vigil, eventually forcing the base to close 26 November 1991. Thirteenth AF relocated and officially established its headquarters at Andersen AFB, Guam, on 2 December 1991. The command was moved from Guam to Hickam AFB in May 2005. In the early 2000s, 13 AF activated the 13th Air Expeditionary Group for a number of exercises, (February 2004-1 April 2004 for Exercise Balikatan 04; February‚ÄìMarch 2004 for Exercise Cope Tiger 04; January‚ÄìFebruary 2005 for Exercise Cope Tiger 05.  Units  Prior to its inactivation, two wings were permanently assigned to 13 AF: * 15th Wing, Hickam AFB Hawaii Partnered with the Hawaii Air National Guard, the 15th WG provides strategic, tactical and command airlift with C-17s, one specially configured C-40 and one C-37. It also includes a squadron of Lockheed F-22s. Finally it serves as an important en-route location for transient aircraft. * 36th Wing, Andersen AFB, Guam The 36th WG has an expansive mission to support global projection and reach from its strategic location in the Pacific. On 5 January 2007, Detachment 1, 13 AF was activated at Yokota AB, Japan. Det 1 is responsible for planning, coordinating, and executing air operations around Japan in coordination with the Japan Air Self Defense Force, through the Fifth Air Force staff at Yokota, and the 613th Air and Space Operations Center at Hickam. The 613th Support Group maintains a consolidated commander's support staff providing personnel support for the entire headquarters; an operational support flight providing facility, training, readiness, and security management; and has two subordinate units: the 56th Air and Space Communications Squadron and the 17th Operational Weather Squadron. The 13th Air Expeditionary Group, and formerly the 500th Air Expeditionary Group, is activated seasonally to support Operation Deep Freeze in the Antarctic.  History  Thirteenth Air Force has never been stationed in the continental United States; it is also one of the oldest, continuously active, numbered air forces. It engaged in combat in the Pacific Theater during World War II. Since World War II, it has provided air defense in the Far East, primarily the Philippines, until the 1991 eruption of Mt. Pinatubo forced the closure of Clark AB. Numerous Thirteenth Air Force organizations participated in Southeast Asia combat operations in the 1960s and 1970s.

Formed into 868th Bomb Squadron in January 1944 and operated independently within the 13th AF. =Operational history= 100px B-25 Mitchells from the 42d Bombardment Group fly over Bougainville from their base at Stirling Airfield, Stirling Island, Solomon Islands, 1944 Thirteenth Air Force began operations in November 1942 as an organization composed of many widely separated Seventh Air Force and independent units scattered in the South Central Pacific during the Solomon Islands campaign. Initially charged with taking a defensive stand against advancing enemy forces, Thirteenth Air Force later took the offensive flying a variety of aircraft, including the B-17 Flying Fortress, B-24 Liberator, B-25 Mitchell, B-26 Marauder, P-38 Lightning, P-39 Airacobra, P-40 Warhawk, P-61 Black Widow, C-46 Commando, C-47 Skytrain, and L-5 Sentinel. It was Thirteenth Air Force P-38Gs of the 339th Fighter Squadron of the 347th Fighter Group which, on 18 April 1943, flew the mission which resulted in the death of Japanese Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto. From 1942‚Äì1945, Thirteenth Air Force staged out of tropical jungles on more than 40 remote islands including the Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign; Mariana and Palau Islands campaign and the Philippines campaign (1944‚Äì45), thus earning the nickname, \\"The Jungle Air Force.\\" The command's units participated in a total of five different operation areas and 13 campaigns. Thirteenth Air Force along with Fifth Air Force in Australia and Seventh Air Force in Hawaii were assigned to the newly created United States Far East Air Forces (FEAF) on 3 August 1944. FEAF was subordinate to the U.S. Army Forces Far East and served as the headquarters of Allied Air Forces Southwest Pacific Area. By 1945, three numbered air forces‚Äî5th, 7th and 13th‚Äîwere supporting operations in the Pacific. FEAF was the functional equivalent in the Pacific of the United States Strategic Air Forces (USSTAF) in the European Theater of Operations. After hostilities ended in 1945, Thirteenth Air Force established its headquarters at Clark Field, Philippines, in January 1946. In May of that year, it moved to Fort William McKinley, Luzon. By August 1947, 13AF returned to Clark Field. In December 1948, the unit moved to Kadena, Okinawa, where it remained for only a few months before returning to Clark in May 1949.  Korean War  On 25 June 1950, 13AF consisted of the following units:Air Force Historical Research Agency PACAF History Factsheet Final Cut: The Postwar B-17 Flying Fortress: The Survivors, Scott A.

Maxwell AFB, Alabama: Office of Air Force History. *18th Fighter-Bomber Wing/Group (F-80) *21st Troop Carrier Squadron (C-54) *6204th Photo Mapping Flight (RB-17)) The 6204th Photo Mapping Flight, located at Clark AB, Philippines, deployed the Flight's two RB-17 aircraft complete with combat crews and maintenance personnel to Johnson AB, Japan in mid-June 1950. The FEAF deployment order specified that the two RB-17 aircraft be equipped with normal armament insofar as practicable, not to interfere with the photographic capability of the aircraft. This posed a problem for the Flight, since the RB-17s had been flying peacetime missions and were not equipped for combat. However, the 6204th found the necessary gunners and equipment, made the modifications to the aircraft, and by late August 1950 the detachment began flying photo-mapping missions over Korea. By the end of November 1950, it had photographed the entire North Korean area at least once and re- photographed some areas as far north as weather conditions permitted. By early December the detachment returned to Clark AB and resumed the flight's mapping program in the Philippine area. During the Korean War, 13AF units provided staging areas for people and equipment destined for the war zone. During the decade of peace that followed the war, the command concentrated on training and surveillance activities to maintain a high state of readiness for contingencies.  Vietnam War  From the time of signing of U.S./Taiwan defense arrangements, the 327th Air Division of 13th Air Force maintained units in Taiwan, up until 1979. 327th Air Division reported in this capacity to United States Taiwan Defense Command. As the Vietnam War escalated during the late 1960s and early 1970s, 13AF again served as a staging base and logistics manager for units fighting in Southeast Asia. As more American aircraft and people were poured into the war effort, combat units and facilities under 13AF in Thailand increased. At its peak, 13AF was composed of seven combat wings, nine major bases, 11 smaller installations and more than 31,000 military members. With the buildup and execution of Operations Desert Shield and Storm, 13AF provided aircraft and support staff vital to the Gulf war coalition victory in Southwest Asia.  Post Cold War  In June 1991, Mount Pinatubo buried Clark in volcanic ash, forcing the base to close on 26 November and leading to the evacuation of assigned military members and their families in Operation Fiery Vigil. The Thirteenth Air Force relocated and officially established its headquarters at Andersen Air Force Base on 2 December 1991. In 2005, the Jungle Air Force stood down as a traditional Numbered Air Force and moved to Hickam Air Force Base to assume the role of the new Kenney Warfighting Headquarters for PACAF, which was activated in provisional status in June 2005. On 6 October 2006, after a one-year transformation of command and control of air, space and information operations in the Pacific, Thirteenth Air Force officially began operations as a component numbered air force headquarters and welcomed a new commander. Former Pacific Air Forces Deputy Commander, Lt. Gen. Loyd S. \\"Chip\\" Utterback, assumed command of the unit 6 October, replacing Maj. Gen. Edward A. Rice, Jr., who had commanded Thirteenth Air Force from Andersen Air Force Base, Guam, and Hickam since January 2005. Previously designated as a management headquarters, Thirteenth Air Force became one of 10 organizations designed to enhance the operational level support, planning, command, control and execution of air, space and information operations capabilities across the full range of military operations throughout the U.S. Pacific Command's area of responsibility (minus the Korea theater of operations). In September 2012, 13 AF was inactivated and its functions merged into PACAF.

World War II 15th USAAF patch Fifteenth Air Force (15th AF) was established on 1 November 1943 in Tunis, Tunisia as part of the United States Army Air Forces in the World War II Mediterranean Theater of Operations as a strategic air force and commenced combat operations the day after it was formed. The first commander was General Jimmy Doolittle. 15th AF resulted from a reorganization of Doolittle's Twelfth Air Force into the 15th with Doolittle in command, and the Ninth Air Force (9th AF) with Lewis H. Brereton in command. The new air force was activated with a strength of ninety B-24 Liberators and 210 B-17 Flying Fortresses, inherited from the Twelfth Air Force and Ninth Air Force. In December, new groups, most of which were equipped with B-24s soon started arriving from the United States. 13 new groups were added. It was hoped that the 15th AF ‚Äì stationed in the Mediterranean ‚Äì would be able to operate when the Eighth Air Force (8th AF) in England was socked in by bad English weather. The 9th AF would later move to England to serve as a tactical unit to take part in the invasion of Europe. Once bases around Foggia in Italy became available, the 15th was able to reach targets in southern France, Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and the Balkans, some of which were difficult to reach from England.

On 1 December 1943, the Headquarters was moved to Bari Airfield, Italy. On 4 January 1944, the Fifteenth, along with Twelfth Air Force, were organized into Mediterranean Allied Air Forces, along with the Royal Air Force 205 Group. MAAF was the southern component of U.S. Strategic Air Forces, Europe, the overall USAAF command and control organization in Europe. The first major operation carried out by Fifteenth Air Force was bombing missions in support of the Anzio Landings in Italy, Operation Shingle beginning on 22 January 1944. Strikes on German and fascist Italian targets were carried out and caused widespread damage to Axis forces.B-24 of the 464h Bomb Group B-17F of the 97th Bomb Group over the Alps B-24 of the 451st Bomb Group Big Week \\"Big Week\\" was the name of an intense Eighth and Fifteenth Air Forces series of attacks on Germany in a series of co-ordinated raids on the German aircraft industry. The plan, code-named \\"Operation Argument,\\" was to use both American strategic air forces in Europe, with support by the Royal Air Force with night bombing raids to destroy or seriously cripple the German ability to produce combat aircraft. The Americans were facing strong Luftwaffe fighter opposition to their daylight bombing raids over Nazi-occupied Europe, and it was planned to initiate Operation Argument at the earliest possible date. On 22 February 1944, Fifteenth Air Force made its first attack on Germany, with an attack on Regensburg. The Fifteenth dispatched a force of 183 bombers to the Oberstraubing Messerschmidt assembly plant. Some 118 bombed with good results but fourteen were shot down. The next day the 15th sent 102 bombers to the Steyr ball-bearing works in Austria where they destroyed twenty percent of the plant. On 24 February, over 180 Liberators inflicted considerable damage to the Messerschmitt Bf 110 assembly plant at Gotha, losing 28 aircraft in the process. On 25 February 114 B-17s and B-24s were dispatched to Steyr again, but the force became separated and the Liberators bombed the Fiume oil refinery instead. Seventeen bombers were lost. Despite these losses, it was believed that the USSTAF had dealt the German aircraft industry a severe blow. Oil Industry Targets In April, General Eisenhower ordered the USSTAF to attack German fuel production centers by striking both the oil refineries and the factories producing synthetic fuels. The 15th started the offensive on 5 April when it dispatched 235 B-17s and B-24s from Italy to transportation targets in the vicinity of the Ploie»ôti oilfields in Romania. The refineries were attacked again on 15 and 24 April, inflicting additional damage. Attacks on oil targets had assumed top priority by October and vast fleets of heavy bombers, escorted by P-38 Lightning and P-51 Mustang fighters, attacked refineries in Germany, Czechoslovakia and Romania. The P-51 escorts were able to establish an environment of air superiority, enabling the bombers to roam widely across southern and eastern Europe, attacking targets at Brux in Czechoslovakia, Budapest, Kom√°rom, Gy≈ër, and P√©tf√ºrd≈ë in Hungary, Belgrade and other cities in Yugoslavia, and Trieste in north-eastern Italy. Soviet Support By June 1944, the 15th Air Force was bombing railway networks in southeast Europe in support of Soviet military operations in Romania. Throughout the summer of 1944, Austrian aircraft manufacturing centers at Wiener Neustadt were bombed and oil producing centers were attacked. On 2 June, the 15th Air Force flew its first \\"shuttle\\" mission when 130 B-17s and P-51 escorts landed in Russian controlled territory after a raid in Hungary. Two more shuttle missions followed. Operation Anvil In July, the 15th began attacking targets in Southern France in preparation for Operation Anvil, the invasion of Southern France. Marseilles, Lyon, Grenoble, and Toulon were all attacked by B-24s and B-17s. The end of the Third Reich A historic 15th Air Force operation mission occurred on 24 March 1945 when 666 bombers struck Berlin, Munich, and other German targets, as well as Czechoslovakia. The Berlin force was attacked by Me 262 jets that inflicted losses (ten bombers and five fighters) while the Mustangs claimed eight jets downed. Despite their speed, the German jets were too few and produced too late to stop the Allied aerial armadas from simply overwhelming the Luftwaffe and leveling their targets. The last major effort came on 25 April when 467 bombers struck rail targets in Austria, severing communications into Czechoslovakia. The 15th's final bombing mission was flown 1 May when 27 B-17s attacked Salzburg rail targets. With the German surrender in Italy, 15th Air Force aircraft began dropping supplies over Yugoslavia and evacuating Allied prisoners of war. A total of around 2,110 bombers were lost on operations by its 15 B-24 and six B-17 bombardment groups, while its seven fighter groups claimed a total of 1,836 enemy aircraft destroyed. The Fifteenth was inactivated in Italy 15 September 1945. Postwar era in late 1940s On 31 March 1946, Fifteenth Air Force was reactivated at Colorado Springs AAB, Colorado and assigned to the ten-day-old Strategic Air Command. 15th AF assumed the assets and personnel of the former Continental Air Forces Second Air Force, which was inactivated on 30 March. The original bomb groups assigned to 15th Air Force were: * 28th Bombardment Group : Activated at Grand Island AAF, Nebraska on 4 August 1946 : Transferred to Eleventh Air Force, Elmendorf AAF, Alaska, 20 October 1946 : Reassigned to 15th AF at Rapid City AAF, South Dakota 3 May 1947 : Established as 28th Bombardment Wing (Very Heavy), 28 July 1947* * 92d Bombardment Group : Activated at Ft Worth AAF, Texas, 4 August 1946 : Reassigned to Smoky Hill AAF, Kansas, October 1946 : Reassigned to Spokane AAF, Washington, June 1947 : Established as 92d Bombardment Wing (Very Heavy), 17 November 1947* * 93d Bombardment Group : Activated at Castle Field, California, 21 June 1946 : Established as 93d Bombardment Wing (Very Heavy), 28 July 1947* * 97th Bombardment Group : Activated at Smoky Hill AAF, Kansas, 4 August 1946 : Established as 97th Bombardment Wing (Very Heavy), 11 September 1947* : Reassigned to Eighth Air Force, 16 May 1948 * 301st Bombardment Group : Activated at Clovis AAF, New Mexico on 4 August 1946 : Inactivated 16 July 1947 : Reactivated at Smoky Hill AAF, Kansas, 16 July 1947 : Established as 301st Bombardment Wing (Very Heavy), 15 October 1947* : Reassigned to Barksdale AFB, Louisiana, 7 November 1949 * 307th Bombardment Group : Activated at MacDill AAF, Florida on 4 August 1946 : Established as 307th Bombardment Wing (Very Heavy), 28 July 1947* * 311th Reconnaissance Wing : Reassigned to MacDill AAF, Florida on 17 April 1946 : Transferred to Fifteenth Air Force on 1 May 1946 : Redesignated as 311th Air Division (Reconnaissance) on 6 April 1948 .*Group became subordinate element to wing. However, demobilization was in full swing and few of these groups were fully equipped or manned. All of these groups were equipped with B-29 Superfortresses, most or all of which were aircraft which returned from Twentieth Air Force groups returning from the Pacific War. When SAC was established in 1946, its primary bomber aircraft was the B-29. Although there were many in storage, they were war-weary. The plane was greatly improved and soon new models, designated the B-50 Superfortress, began joining the inventory replacing the older aircraft. 15th Air Force org chart, 1947 Boeing B-50D of Fifteenth Air Force displaying while on detachment to England in May 1953 The 15 AF returned to a combat-ready role as a result of the 1948 Berlin Crisis, a squadron from the 301st Bombardment Group was deployed with its B-29s at F√ºrstenfeldbruck Air Base, Germany. SAC immediately ordered the group's other two squadrons to Goose Bay Air Base, Labrador to prepare for immediate deployment to Germany. The 307th and 28th Bombardment Groups were placed on alert and ordered to be ready to deploy within three and twelve hours respectively. Within a few weeks, the other 301st Bomb Group's squadrons had joined the first. Later on 28 July, Bombardment Group left Rapid City AFB, South Dakota for RAF Scampton, in the United Kingdom. The 307th Bombardment Group left MacDill AFB, Florida for RAF Marham and RAF Waddington in the UK. The 56th Fighter Wing at Selfridge in Michigan left Fifteenth Air Force on 1 December 1948, transferring to Tenth Air Force. On 7 November 1949, Headquarters Fifteenth Air Force was relocated to March AFB, California. As part of this realignment, most SAC bomber forces west of the Mississippi River were reassigned to 15th AF. Those east of the Mississippi were assigned to SAC's other strategic air force, Eighth Air Force, and reassigned to Westover AFB, Massachusetts, where it commanded all SAC bases in the eastern United States. From 1947 onwards Fifteenth Air Force incorporated a number of fighter escort wings and strategic fighter wings, intended to escort bombers to their targets. Among these units were the 56th Fighter Wing, 71st Strategic Fighter Wing, the 82nd Fighter Wing, and the 407th Strategic Fighter Wing. They were all redesignated and transferred to other USAF components in 1957‚Äì58 with the end of the fighter escort concept. Korean War B-29 bombers were shot down by communist aircraft. On 25 June 1950, the armed forces of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea) invaded South Korea. On 27 June the United Nations Security Council voted to assist the South Koreans in resisting the invasion. President Harry S. Truman authorized General Douglas MacArthur (commander of the US occupying forces in Japan) to commit units to the battle. MacArthur ordered General George E. Stratemeyer, CIC of the Far Eastern Air Force (FEAF) to attack attacking North Korean forces between the front lines and the 38th parallel. At that time, the 22 B-29s of the Twentieth Air Force 19th Bomb Group stationed at Andersen Field on Guam were the only aircraft capable of hitting the Korean peninsula, and this unit was ordered to move to Kadena Air Base on Okinawa and begin attacks on North Korea. These raids began on 28 June. On 29 June, clearance was given for B-29 attacks on airfields in North Korea. On 8 July, a special FEAF Bomber Command was set up under the command of Major General Emmett O'Donnell. Although President Truman wasn't willing to risk extensive use of the U.S. bomber force in the United States, which was being used as a deterrent for possible Soviet aggression in Europe, a few groups of B-29 bombers ‚Äì that were not part of the nuclear strike force ‚Äì were released. On 13 July, the FEAF Bomber Command took over command of the Twentieth Air Force 19th Bombardment Group and of the Fifteenth Air Force's 22nd and 92nd Bombardment Groups which had been transferred from SAC bases in the United States. Later in July, the Fifteenth Air Force 98th and 307th Bombardment Groups were sent to Japan to join the FEAF. The 92nd and 98th BGs and the 31st SRG operated from bases in Japan, whereas the 19th, 22nd, and 307th BGs were based in Okinawa. When the Korean War ended on 27 July 1953, the B-29s had flown over 21,000 sorties, nearly 167,000 tons of bombs had been dropped, and 34 B-29s had been lost in combat (16 to fighters, four to flak, and fourteen to other causes). B-29 gunners had accounted for 34 Communist fighters (16 of these being MiG-15s) probably destroyed another 17 (all MiG-15s) and damaged 11 (all MiG-15s). Losses were less than one per 1000 sorties. Cold War B-52D Dropping bombs over Southeast Asia KC-135 refueling F-15s and F-16s With the end of fighting in Korea, President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who had taken office in January 1953, called for a \\"new look\\" at national defense. The result: a greater reliance on nuclear weapons and air power to deter war. His administration chose to invest in the Air Force, especially Strategic Air Command. The nuclear arms race shifted into high gear. The Air Force retired nearly all of its propeller-driven B-29/B-50s and they were replaced by new Boeing B-47 Stratojet aircraft. By 1955 the Boeing B-52 Stratofortress would be entering the inventory in substantial numbers, as prop B-36s were phased out of heavy bombardment units rapidly. Also after the deployment of forces to Far East Air Force in order to engage in combat over Korea, the history of Fifteenth Air Force becomes indistinguishable from that of Strategic Air Command. During the Cold War, Fifteenth Air Force aircraft stood nuclear alert, providing a deterrence against an attack on the United States by the Soviet Union. During the Vietnam War, squadrons of 15th Air Force B-52 Stratofortesses (B-52Ds mostly, some B-52Gs) were deployed to bases on Guam, Okinawa and Thailand conducting Arc Light strikes on communist forces. The 15th Air Force also included missile squadrons, such as the 703d Strategic Missile Wing and 706th Strategic Missile Wing. Post Vietnam Between the Vietnam War and 1991, 15 AF units and assets consisted of reconnaissance aircraft (SR-71 until 1989, U-2), bombers (B-52D until 1984, B-52G, B-52H and B-1B), aerial refueling (KC-135, KC-10), and intercontinental ballistic missiles (Titan II until 1984, Minuteman II/III, Peacekeeper). Fifteenth Air Force became exclusively aerial tanker command with KC-135 and KC-10 aircraft on 1 September 1991. When Strategic Air Command was inactivated 1 June 1992 and its assets divided between the newly created Air Mobility Command and Air Combat Command, Fifteenth Air Force became part of Air Mobility Command. Post Cold War and 21st-century Headquarters Fifteenth Air Force moved from March Air Force Base to Travis Air Force Base on 2 July 1993 with the BRAC transition of March AFB to March Air Reserve Base, and merged its tankers with the airlift aircraft of the Twenty-Second Air Force. The Twenty-Second Air Force's flag moved to the Air Force Reserve Command at Dobbins Air Force Base, Georgia. Fifteenth Air Force was one of the two numbered air forces assigned to the Air Mobility Command. Its main area of operations was the region stretching west of the Mississippi River to the east coast of Africa, pole to pole, but was often tasked to support Air Mobility Command's global reach mission. Its primary mission was to provide strategic and theater airlift for all Department of Defense agencies as well as air refueling for the Air Force in both peace and wartime. This included the aeromedical evacuation of sick and injured. With the assigned military work force of 28,912 personnel and an assigned civilian work force of 5,288 people, Fifteenth Air Force managed almost 300 aircraft and many support facilities in the United States and in the Pacific and Indian Oceans ‚Äì all the way to Diego Garcia. The 15 AF commander was also the Commander, Task Force 294 (TF 294), which provided aerial refueling to aircraft that supported the United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) in time of war. TF 294 included 26 units from the AMC, the Air National Guard, and the Air Force Reserve Command. The 15 AF staff assured the operational readiness of its units by conducting readiness assessment visits and staff assistance visits. It acted as an advocate for its subordinate units and enforces higher headquarters policies and directives. As a result of an Air Mobility Command restructuring, Fifteenth Air Force was redesignated the Fifteenth Expeditionary Mobility Task Force, focused on air mobility support in peacetime and wartime. 15 AF operational flying organizations were transferred to Eighteenth Air Force. 15 EMTF retained AMC's Pacific region airlift and air refueling enroute support organization as well as AMC's contingency response units. The 15 EMTF provided rapid and flexible transportation support from six major Air Force bases in the United States and 47 locations throughout the Pacific.

Overview As AMC's sole NAF (and the Air Force's largest NAF), 18 AF is responsible for the command's worldwide operational mission of providing rapid, global mobility and sustainment for America's armed forces through airlift, aerial refueling, aeromedical evacuation, and a global air mobility support system. 18 AF presents air mobility forces to combatant commanders through its role as Air Forces Transportation (AFTRANS), the air component of United States Transportation Command. The 18 AF commander also acts as the Commander, Air Force Forces (COMAFFOR), and Joint Force Air Component Commander (JFACC), when so designated. The command's mobility aircraft include the C-5 Galaxy, KC-10 Extender, C-17 Globemaster III, C-130 Hercules,, KC-46 Pegasus, and KC-135 Stratotanker. Operational support aircraft are the VC-25 (Boeing 747 / Air Force One), C-21, C-20B (Gulfstream III), C-32A (Boeing 757) , C-37A (Gulfstream V) , C-37B (Gulfstream 550) and C-40B (Boeing 737) . 18 AF has an assigned military and civilian workforce of more than 37,000 personnel. Units Units reporting to 18 AF include 11 wings and two stand alone groups. Other AMC units assigned to 18th AF are: * Airlift Wings : 19th Airlift Wing, C-130H/J :: Little Rock AFB, Arkansas : 62d Airlift Wing, C-17A :: Joint Base Lewis-McChord (McChord AFB), Washington : 89th Airlift Wing, :: VC-25A (Air Force One), C-20B (Gulfstream III), C-32A (Boeing 757), C-37A (Gulfstream V), C-40B (Boeing 737) :: Joint Base Andrews (Andrews AFB), Maryland : 436th Airlift Wing, C-5M, C-17A :: Dover AFB, Delaware : 437th Airlift Wing C-17A :: Joint Base Charleston (Charleston AFB), South Carolina : 317th Airlift Wing, C-130J :: Dyess AFB, Texas * Air Mobility Wings : 60th Air Mobility Wing, C-5M, C-17A, KC-10A :: Travis AFB, California : 305th Air Mobility Wing, C-17A, KC-10A :: Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst (McGuire AFB), New Jersey : 375th Air Mobility Wing, C-21, C-40 :: Scott AFB, Illinois * Air Refueling Wings : 6th Air Refueling Wing, KC-135R :: MacDill AFB, Florida : 22d Air Refueling Wing, KC-135R :: McConnell AFB, Kansas : 92d Air Refueling Wing, KC-135R :: Fairchild AFB, Washington * Air Expeditionary Wings/Group : 385th Air Expeditionary Group :: Incirlik Air Base, Turkey 618th Air Operations Center The 618th Air and Space Operations Center (Tanker Airlift Control Center), located at Scott AFB, also reports to 18 AF and serves as the organization's air operations center, planning and directing tanker and transport aircraft operations around the world. It is stationed at Scott Air Force Base, Illinois. The 618th AOC (TACC) is responsible for planning, scheduling, and tracking aircraft performing airlift, aerial refueling, and aeromedical evacuation operations around the world. It serves as an Air Operations Center (AOC) for 18AF/AFTRANS, executing missions assigned by the United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM).Brockhoff, Justin. \\"618th Tanker Airlift Control Center enables Air Mobility Command's global reach.\\" Air Mobility Command. 4 March 2009. Accessed 28 January 2011. The 618th AOC (TACC), initially known as TACC, became operational April 1, 1992. Air mobility leadership sought to simplify the execution of the worldwide mobility mission. They created a highly efficient organization to centralize command and control operations previously located within numbered air forces and airlift divisions. TACC was redesignated as the 618th TACC on April 1, 2007, and remained under that designation until being renamed the 618th AOC (TACC) Aug. 30, 2010.Brockhoff, Justin. \\"618th Tanker Airlift Control Center redesignated as 618th Air Operations Center (Tanker Airlift Control Center).\\" 618th AOC (TACC) home page. 30 August 2010. Accessed 28 January 2011. History=Origins When the Army Air Forces (AAF) reorganized in 1946, Tactical Air Command (TAC) was established as one of its three major commands. The AAF IX Troop Carrier Command (TCC) was inactivated as part of this reorganization and Third Air Force was reassigned to TAC to control the troop carrier units formerly part of IX TCC. It was headquartered at Greenville Army Airfield, South Carolina. The C-46 Commando and C-47 Skytrain were the primary troop carrier aircraft, but surplus C-54 Skymasters that had been originally purchased for the Air Transport Command (ATC) were made available for troop carrier use. Third Air Force was inactivated on 1 November 1946 and TAC's troop carrier mission was reassigned to Ninth Air Force which moved to Greenville. In 1947, many of TAC's Troop Carrier Groups/Wings were assigned directly to Headquarters TAC with the rest to the Air Defense Command's Fourteenth Air Force reserve 302d Troop Carrier Wing. The theater troop carrier mission was expanded rapidly during the Korean War when many of these reserve units were called into active service and assigned directly to HQ TAC. Cold War 18 AF was established and activated 28 March 1951 to discharge Tactical Air Command's (TAC) troop carrier responsibilities. The organization became operational on 1 June 1951 at Donaldson AFB, South Carolina and initially assumed control of nine \\"medium\\" C-119 Flying Boxcar troop carrier wings (314th, 375th, 403d, 433d, 434th, 435th, 443d, 514th and 515th), seven of which were Air Force Reserve wings called to active duty during the Korean War. The command added a \\"heavy\\" (C-124 Globemaster) wing, the 62nd Troop Carrier Wing, in Fall 1951 and another in early 1953, the 63rd Troop Carrier Wing. In the spring of 1952, 18 AF C-124 Globemasters were sent to Japan and by July 1952, C-124s from the 22nd Troop Carrier Squadron were flying missions in South Korea. The arrival of the C-124 introduced the aircraft loadmaster position to the troop carrier mission. As the Korean War wound down, C-119 Flying Boxcar crews from the 483rd Troop Carrier Wing began supporting French operations in Indochina. United States Air Force-supplied C-47 Skytrain and C-119s were placed \\"on- loan\\" to the French Air Force at Tourane Air Base. By early 1953, the Air Force Reserve wings were replaced by active duty wings organized, administered, equipped, trained, and prepared for combat by 18 AF. Augmented troop carrier forces in the Far East and Europe provided trained crews and replacement personnel to units in the Korean War. The next year, 18 AF C-119s from the 483rd Troop Carrier Wing (and flown by civilian crews employed by Civil Air Transport) airdropped supplies to besieged French paratroops at Dien Bien Phu, Indochina. Some 483rd personnel flew missions in an unofficial capacity and would play key roles in the troop carrier mission in later years. After the Battle of Dien Bien Phu, 374th Troop Carrier Wing and TAC C-124s airlifted wounded French soldiers out of Indochina to Japan. The command also took part in joint exercises and provided support for airborne paratroop training all the while working to improve communications capabilities and to advocate for the inclusion of medical air evacuation in joint exercises. 18 AF also provided airlift support to other Air Force major commands and TAC organizations. The advent of the jet age saw TAC with a new mission, as it became the focal point for a new military philosophy based on the rapid deployment of heavily armed fighter/bomber units and Army airborne and light infantry units to overseas \\"trouble spots\\" before conflicts could escalate into full-scale war. 18 AF units supplemented Military Air Transport Service (MATS) airlift when needed and transported U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force units for training and deployment. The Korean War illustrated the need for a medium transport capable of operating from dirt airstrips, which led to the development of several new transport aircraft, including the delivery of the jet-prop powered C-130 Hercules at the end of 1956. 18 AF also took deliveries of the Fairchild C-123 Provider, a twin-engine transport designed for assault operations into rudimentary landing zones. With the advent of the C-130, TAC established the Composite Air Strike Force, commonly known as a CASF, which was centered on troop carrier C-130s supplemented by MATS aircraft to deliver personnel and cargo at a moment's notice to support TAC fighter/bombers at overseas destinations. With these new aircraft, 18 AF units rotated troop carrier units to Europe in support of NATO. The command was heavily committed to airlift operations in Arctic areas beginning in the Fall of 1952. Between 1955 and 1957, the command offloaded and airdropped equipment supporting the construction of the Distant Early Warning Line (DEW Line) radar system across northern Canada. Helicopters of the 310th Troop Carrier Squadron, operating from two icebreakers, provided support airlift to the U.S. Navy in the HIRAN (High Precision Air Navigation) project in January 1956. The command provided airlift and airlift expertise to the U.S. Navy in Antarctic Operation Deep Freeze I and II, establishing a base at the South Pole. Crews of the 63rd Troop Carrier Wing performed the first airdrop at the South Pole in October 1956. A combat controller of the 1st Aerial Port Squadron performed the first parachute jump at the South Pole in November 1956 (in order to determine the necessary corrections for ongoing airdrops of equipment). 18 AF also provided airdrop and airland support to Alaskan Air Command and Northeast Air Command, from March to early June 1957 in order to establish similar sites on ice islands in north polar regions. The command was also instrumental in the development of the aerial port concept, including techniques and equipment for loading troop carrier aircraft and the airdrop of cargo. 18 AF Airmen also developed the Air Force \\"pathfinder\\" combat controller capability to establish ground to air communications and navigation aids at jump sites and to select landing sites. They also carried out fixed wing assault missions using C-123 aircraft for landing on small unimproved landing areas. The command organized the first rotary assault group in the U.S. Air Force before losing the mission to the U.S. Army and served as advisory body for reserve troop carrier wings. Finally, the command was also heavily involved in the testing of new aerial delivery equipment, equipment and techniques for dropping paratroops and cargo, and navigation devices to determine \\"point of release\\". A realignment of Troop Carrier forces in 1957 led to the reassignment of 18 AF's C-124 wings to MATS and its headquarters was moved to James Connally AFB, Texas on 1 September. At the same time, Donaldson AFB was turned over to MATS (along with the C-124s and 63d TCW assigned there). At Connally the command gained responsibility for TAC's day fighter, fighter-bomber, and aerial tanker operations on western U.S. bases. 18 AF was inactivated effective 1 January 1958 due to budgetary reasons, and its units were reassigned to Twelfth Air Force (which had been reassigned from U.S. Air Forces Europe at Ramstein Air Base, West Germany to James Connally AFB). Air Mobility Command 18 AF was reactivated on 1 October 2003 as part of an overall AMC reorganization. Born from the consolidation of AMC's 15th and 21st Air Forces under the leadership of Maj Gen Bill Essex, AMC'S Director of Plans and Programs, the command had a modest restart. By the time Lt Gen William Welser III was finally confirmed as commander a mere two months after reactivation, the 18 AF headquarters staff numbered 30 (of which more than half was the legal office). At that time, every AMC wing and independent group reported to the 18 AF, including the newly designated 15th Expeditionary Mobility Task Force and 21st Expeditionary Mobility Task Force, AMC's lead agencies for conducting airlift, air refueling, aeromedical evacuation, and expeditionary combat support operations worldwide. This meant that a single commander, the 18 AF commander, had tasking and execution authority for all air mobility missions. It became quickly apparent that in order for the command to effectively oversee the global air mobility enterprise it would have to grow and develop strong relationships with key organizations across the Air Force and United States Department of Defense. In November 2005, Maj Gen James A. Hawkins, a former 18 AF vice commander, took the reins of the 18 AF. Under his leadership, and that of his successor, Maj Gen Winfield W. Scott III, who took command in June 2008, the command continued to evolve to meet complex missions at home and abroad. One of the most demanding of those missions came when Hurricane Katrina made landfall on the Gulf Coast in August 2005, eventually causing more than 1,800 deaths and nearly $80 billion in damage over an area of approximately 90,000 square miles. From the initial response through recovery, 18 AF Airmen were part of a massive total force team that flew more than 300 missions that moved nearly 1,800 sick and injured hurricane victims to safety and airlifted more than 4,000 tons of relief supplies to the stricken area. A mere two years afterward, the command also flexed its muscle overseas with the deployment of approximately 1,500 Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicles to Iraq in only four months. The increasingly complex nature of the command's mission, evidenced by global demands such as these argued for a second \\"rebirth\\" of the command, which was soon to come. These changes occurred on 6 January 2011, when five units transferred from the 18 AF to the command of the United States Air Force Expeditionary Center (USAFEC) at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, New Jersey. Included in the transition were the 87th Air Base Wing at Joint Base M-D-L, the 628th Air Base Wing at Joint Base Charleston, South Carolina, the 627th Air Base Group at Joint Base Lewis- McChord, Washington, the 43rd Airlift Group at Pope Army Air Field, North Carolina and the 319th Air Refueling Wing at Grand Forks Air Force Base, North Dakota. The 18 AF Commander, Lt Gen Robert Allardice at the time, retained operational control of Airmen in these units (a control 18 AF retains to this day), but the change reduced his administrative burden, allowing him greater focus on the command's worldwide mobility flying operations. The need for that focus had become obvious over the years, reflected in a doubling of the 18 AF's headquarters staff between 2003 and 2010. During the same time the headquarters also added Operations and Plans directorates as well as an integration cell to leverage other key AMC staff members performing operational tasks supporting the command's mission. While the 2011 restructuring was one of the most visible elements of an evolutionary process that enhanced the 18 AF's operational capability - it was far from the last. The following year the command went through one of its most significant restructuring efforts to date. In March 2012, the 18 AF inactivated its two Expeditionary Mobility Task Forces: the 21st Expeditionary Mobility Task Force at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, New Jersey and the 15th Expeditionary Mobility Task Force at Travis Air Force Base, California. These inactivations administratively aligned the task forces' subordinate units, the 615th Contingency Response Wing at Travis, the 621st Contingency Response Wing at Joint Base MDL, the 515th Air Mobility Operations Wing at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, Hawaii, and the 521st Air Mobility Operations Wing at Ramstein Air Base, Germany under the U.S. Air Force Expeditionary Center (USAF EC). The following June also saw the inactivation of the 615 CRW, with the alignment of its subordinate units under the 621 CRW. While the changes reduced the administrative demands on the 18 AF commander, they still left him with full operational control of AMC's forces. Lt Gen Mark Ramsay, then-18 AF Commander, noted that the changes represented a more effective and efficient way of carrying out the command's global air mobility mission \\"especially the planning, exercising, execution, and assessment of airlift, air refueling, and aeromedical evacuation operations in support of combatant commanders across the globe.\\" In the wake of Japan's 2011 earthquake and tsunami, the command orchestrated efforts transporting hundreds of tons of humanitarian relief while assuring the safe return of thousands of military families back to the U.S. Simultaneously, within hours of the passing of a Security Council Resolution, AMC tanker units rapidly formed the 313th Air Expeditionary Wing, a total force \\"Calico wing\\" (so named for the variety of aircraft tail flashes from the different units that constituted it) to support the U.S. Operation Odyssey Dawn over Libya, which later became the NATO Operation Unified Protector. All this occurred against the backdrop of the massive movement of personnel and equipment from Iraq. Since that time, the command has continued to rapidly respond to crises across the globe whether delivering relief supplies to Americans stricken by Superstorm Sandy, moving troops and equipment in the face of provocations by North Korea and Syria, or supporting international efforts battling extremists in Mali and the Central African Republic. At the same time, the command has undertaken the effort of redeploying equipment and troops from Afghanistan.

During the Cold War it was a component of Tactical Air Command, with a mission of command and control over deployed USAF forces in support of United States foreign policy initiatives. The command was reactivated in 1993 under Air Education and Training Command with a mission of conducting AETC's flying training. 19th Air Force was inactivated on 9 July 2012 as a cost-cutting measure by the Secretary of the Air Force, but was reactivated on 1 October 2014 when it was determined that the cost-cutting measures did not reap the savings expected. AETC commander General Robin Rand directed the reactivation to consolidate the management of the AETC flying mission again under a Numbered Air Force instead of the AETC Headquarters.  History =Cold War Origins = In the aftermath of the Korean War in 1953, the United States Air Force began to institutionalize a quick response force to deploy personnel, aircraft and equipment to bases with minimal facilities and to develop an air refueling capacity for its fighter aircraft. From this initiatives, Tactical Air Command (TAC) developed the Composite Air Strike Force (CASF), a small tactical air force composed of a command element and of fighter, reconnaissance, tanker, troop carrier, and communications support units. While it could fight, if necessary, the principal function of the CASF was to deter Communist aggression in such areas as the Middle East or Latin America, beyond the reach of American forces already stationed overseas. Its primary characteristic was fast reaction, and it would be as self-sufficient as possible. Each of its elements would prepare and store flyaway kits of spare parts and supplies, and each of its members would have specific deployment tasks assigned. Upon arrival in-theater, the unit would be able to sustain operations for 30 days on minimum logistics support, with the addition of required food, fuel, and munitions. Air-to-air refueling not only made rapid response possible, it enabled the various elements of the CASF to maintain themselves economically on their home bases until the need to deploy arose. Once the CASF concept was fully implemented and tested by the late 1950s, the first strike elements of a CASF could arrive in the Middle East within 16 hours of notification, with the total force in place and ready for operations in 48 hours. In the Far East the lead elements would arrive within 36 hours, with the full force in operational status within 72 hours. On 8 July 1955, under the command of Brig. Gen. Henry Viccellio, TAC activated the command element of the CASF, the Nineteenth Air Force. = Organization = Nineteenth Air Force patch from the 1960s The headquarters of the Nineteenth Air Force was one of the most unusual air units ever created at that time. It had no permanently assigned aircraft or combat units. Nor did it have, since it was an operational headquarters only, any units or bases to supervise, train, or inspect. When not deployed, the Nineteenth had a close working relationship with the Ninth Air Force, which supported its administrative functions with many of its own people. These circumstances allowed the Nineteenth to limit its staff to approximately 85 military and 6 civilian personnel. The mission of Nineteenth Air Force was to prepare contingency plans for and to command short-notice deployments of the CASF anywhere in the world. It required each individual member to be ready for instant departure from the United States, and its staff sections maintained 30-day flyaway kits prepared for shipment. The Nineteenth worked closely with U.S. Army contingency units, and at one point, one-third of its staff was jump-qualified, able to parachute in with U.S. Army airborne troops. In the event of a crisis, the Nineteenth (working from a prepared plan which designated specific units, travel routes, en route support, and timing) would take command of the deploying CASF and serve as part of a joint task force, as a senior air command, or as a component command. At first glance the Nineteenth had a normal headquarters organization with major sections for planning, operations, and logistics. However, these sections had an important secondary function: each served as the lead command element for various geographical contingencies. The plans section would lead Europe and Middle Eastern deployments; the operations section would lead those to the Pacific; and the logistics section would lead deployments to Latin America, the Caribbean, and Africa. This unique arrangement allowed for continuity of planning and expertise and helped overcome some of the disadvantages inherent in the U.S. armed forces policy of churning personnel through different assignments every three or so years. Within the service, the Nineteenth soon earned its nickname: The Suitcase Air Force. In keeping with its mission of deterrence, a CASF, in theory, consisted of three task forces, each of which could vary in size and composition, according to its assigned task. * The first task force had only a limited combat capability and consisted of a show- the-flag or a good-will package. It could fulfill the role of gunboat diplomacy. A force such as this went to Turkey, Iran, and Pakistan (Operation Quick Span) in February 1960. * The second task force consisted of the basic CASF combat element and would serve as the initial force for a small war. TAC kept the units of the second task force on a progressive 24-hour alert system and planned for the first portion to move within four hours of alert and the entire force to deploy in 24 hours. * The third task force, composed of additional fighter squadrons, would augment the second if the situation required an expanded force. = 1958 Lebanon Crisis = On 15 July 1958, President Dwight Eisenhower, acting at the request of the Lebanese government, ordered the U.S. Marine Corps (USMC) into Beirut, Lebanon to help preserve that small country from a wave of popular discontent that was sweeping the Middle East, toppling monarchies in Syria and Iraq and replacing them with military regimes hostile to United States interests. To support the Marines, the National Command Authorities (NCA) alerted the CASF. Under the command of Maj. Gen. Henry Viccellio, within three hours, B-57 Canberra tactical bombers of the 345th Bombardment Wing, Langley AFB, left for the only friendly major operating airfield in the region, Adana Air Base, Turkey, fifteen minutes' flight time from Beirut. In another three hours, TAC KB‚Äì50J Superfortress tankers from the 427th Air Refueling Squadron left Langley AFB to refuel F-100 Super Sabre fighters from the 354th Tactical Fighter Wing departing Myrtle Beach Air Force Base, South Carolina, while RF-101 Voodoos and RB-66 Destroyers from the 363d Tactical Reconnaissance Wing left Shaw AFB, South Carolina. Sixty C‚Äì130 Hercules ferried support personnel, spare parts, and equipment. Thirteen hours and 6,700 miles after the initial alert, the F‚Äì100s were taxiing to alert ramps at Adana. All deployed aircraft came from the Ninth Air Force. Within two days an underutilized Turkish Air Force gunnery base had become an American air center, with an operations center manned by Nineteenth Air Force personnel (flown in on a single C‚Äì130) and integrated with USN, USMC, and U.S. Army forces in the Middle East. = 1958 Taiwan Straits Crisis = Because the entire Nineteenth Air Force headquarters had deployed to Lebanon, TAC ordered its Twelfth Air Force to form another command element similar to that of the Nineteenth, should another emergency arise. Given the upsurge in tension between the Communist Chinese government on the Asian mainland and the Nationalist Chinese regime on Taiwan, the new command element focused its planning on the Far East. The People‚Äôs Republic of China had announced its intention to reincorporate a series of small Nationalist- held islands within artillery range of the mainland, in particular the islands of Quemoy and Matsu. During the summer of 1958, the magnitude and duration of the Communists' bombardments increased dramatically. The United States responded by supplying the Nationalists with tanks and new heavy and longer- ranged artillery as well as by beefing up its own forces in the region. TAC placed on alert a squadron of F‚Äì100s; transport aircraft loaded with supplies, parts, and equipment; and a communications and control squadron. It also began to \\"lean forward\\", sending tankers, weathermen, maintenance crews, and control units to islands on the air route between California and Thirteenth Air Force headquarters at Clark AB in the Philippine Islands. Late on 29 August 1958, the second CASF received the \\"go\\" order. F‚Äì100s from the 31st Tactical Fighter Wing, George Air Force Base carrying AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles took off on 30 August and spent that night at Hickam AFB, Hawaii. The next night they were at Andersen AFB, Guam, where Typhoon Lola delayed their movement for 24 hours. On 2 September, they landed at Clark AB, after a flight of 9,500 miles and an elapsed time of 96 hours. RF‚Äì101s from the 432d Tactical Reconnaissance Wing Shaw AFB arrived soon after, and C‚Äì130s formed an airlift bridge carrying support personnel, equipment, tools, and workstands to Clark. On 5 and 6 September, the CASF, with much assistance from both the Thirteenth Air Force and the Fifth Air Force in Japan, flew to Chia-ti AB, a Nationalist air base on Taiwan where they came under the control of a joint operations center established the previous day by CASF personnel. Nine days later, a squadron of F-104 Starfighters of the 83d Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, Hamilton AFB, California, occupied another Nationalist air base (Taoyuan Air Base). Two more fighter squadrons at Kadena AB, and a B-57 Canberra squadron at Naha AB, Okinawa backed up this force. The mission of all units was to defend the straits between Formosa and the mainland. = 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis = In mid-October 1962, the Nineteenth moved from its home base, Seymour Johnson AFB, North Carolina, to Homestead AFB, Florida. Once at Homestead, the Nineteenth spearheaded the deployment of TAC units at the beginning of the Cuban Missile Crisis. The Nineteenth‚Äôs commander headed the main air operations center, the Air Force Atlantic Advanced Operational Nucleus (AFLANT ADVON), which activated shortly after President Kennedy‚Äôs speech declaring a quarantine of Soviet missile shipments into Cuba. Augmented by airmen and officers from other TAC air forces, AFLANT ADVON soon controlled nearly 1,000 aircraft and 7,000 men and women. The Nineteenth returned to North Carolina in December 1962 when the crisis ended. =Other missions= In September 1962, when racial tension over the integration of the state university in Oxford, Mississippi, caused the federal government to send in troops, personnel of the Nineteenth coordinated airlift activities. In 1963 Nineteenth Air Force conducted two show-the-flag exercises. The first went to Saudi Arabia in early May. There, the Nineteenth helped to train Saudi pilots and supervised a tactical demonstration at Jidda International Airport for 30,000 spectators that included Crown Prince Faisal, the Prime Minister, the Saudi Foreign Minister, and other royalty and officials. The second went to India in October. There, in Exercise Shiksha (Sanskrit for training), the Nineteenth, in cooperation with the British and Australian Royal Air Forces, helped to improve Indian Air Force air defense capabilities and provide other tactical training. This effort was partially in response to the earlier division-sized Sino-Indian conflict. Throughout its existence, the Nineteenth also participated in numerous joint exercises within the United States as well as in practice alerts. For practical purposes, the Vietnam War ended the work of the Nineteenth Air Force, as that conflict absorbed a large proportion of the USAF‚Äôs assets not directly dedicated to the nuclear deterrent and consequently lessened the nation‚Äôs ability to intervene in other crisis areas. At the beginning of the Vietnam War, a CASF deployed in response to the Tonkin Gulf incidents, and in 1968 the last CASF deployment came in support of American forces in the Republic of Korea during the USS Pueblo incident. =Legacy= The Nineteenth Air Force was inactivated in July 1973, as part of the economies enacted after the end of the Vietnam War. On 4 August 1998, the Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force (CSAF), General Michael E. Ryan, and the Acting Secretary of the Air Force (SECAF), F. Whitten Peters, announced their plans to implement a major change in the structure of the Air Force. They proposed to divide the USAF‚Äôs combat strength and the elements directly supporting it into ten Aerospace Expeditionary Forces (AEFs). Although the EAF concept was a major step in recasting the operations, outlook, and culture of the USAF, it sprang from the performance of missions traditionally performed by the Air Force ‚Äì the timely response of land-based air power to the needs of the nation. Air Education and Training Command As a part of the realignment and re-organization of the Air Force after the end of the Cold War, Nineteenth Air Force was re-activated on 1 July 1993 as part of the new Air Education and Training Command (AETC). It was assigned to Randolph AFB, Texas with a mission of conducting AETC's flying training. Air Force pilot candidates began with introductory flight training (IFT). In IFT, civilian instructors provided 50 hours of flight instruction to pilot candidates who completed requirements for a private pilot license. Upon graduation, pilot candidates then attended either Euro-NATO joint jet pilot training (ENJJPT) or joint specialized undergraduate pilot training (JSUPT).19th Air Force Official factsheet * ENJJPT is located at Sheppard AFB, Texas. The entire course lasts about 54 weeks. Students learn with, and are taught by, USAF officers and officers from various air forces of our European allies. Student pilots first fly the T-6 Texan II mastering contact, instrument, low-level and formation flying. Next, they train on the supersonic T-38 Talon and continue building the skills necessary to become a fighter pilot. * JSUPT students accomplish primary training in the T-6 Texan II at one of three Air Force bases ‚Äì Columbus AFB, Mississippi, Laughlin AFB, Texas, or Vance AFB, Oklahoma; or in the T-34C Turbomentor at Naval Air Station Whiting Field, Florida. Joint training is conducted at Vance AFB, and NAS Whiting Field for students from the Air Force and Navy. During the primary phase of JSUPT, students learn basic flight skills common to all military pilots. * Prospective airlift and tanker pilots are assigned to the airlift/tanker track and train in the T-1 Jayhawk at Columbus AFB, Laughlin AFB, or Vance AFB. Student pilots headed for bomber or fighter assignments are assigned to the bomber/fighter track and train in the T-38 Talon at Columbus, Laughlin or Vance. Students assigned to the multi-engine turboprop track fly the T-44 Pegasus turboprop trainers at NAS Corpus Christi, Texas, and will eventually fly the C-130 Hercules. * Those students selected to fly helicopters are assigned to the helicopter track and fly the UH-1 Huey at Fort Rucker, Alabama. Nineteenth Air Force also provided follow-on training for most Air Force pilots in their assigned aircraft. Pilots assigned to fighter aircraft complete the introduction to fighter fundamentals course at Randolph AFB or Sheppard AFB, Texas, or Columbus AFB, Mississippi, flying the AT-38B Talon, and then move on to train in either the F-15 Eagle at Kingsley Field ANGB, Oregon, or the F-16 Fighting Falcon at Luke AFB, Arizona. Altus AFB, Oklahoma hosts training for pilots and enlisted aircrew assigned to KC-135 Stratotanker, C-17 Globemaster III, and KC-46 Pegasus aircraft. Aircrews assigned to fly the C-130 train at Little Rock AFB, AR Pilots assigned to fly MC-130 Combat Talon, HC-130 Hercules, CV-22 Osprey, UH-1N, MH-53 Pave Low or HH-60 Pave Hawk helicopters receive their training at Kirtland AFB, New Mexico. Keesler AFB, Mississippi, provides training for pilots assigned to the C-21 Learjet The Army at Fort Rucker, provides training in the C-12 Huron. In addition to pilot training, Nineteenth Air Force provides joint specialized undergraduate navigator training. JSUNT is conducted at Randolph AFB and NAS Pensacola, Florida, and provides training for Air Force, Navy and Marine student navigators. Students at Randolph complete training in the T-43 Bobcat and move to follow-on assignments in transport and tanker aircraft such as the C-130 and KC-135. Students at NAS Pensacola, complete primary and intermediate training in the T-34C and T-1 aircraft, and then enter the one of two tracks in the next phase. Students in the strike track will serve as navigators in the B-52 Stratofortress or as weapon systems officers in the B-1B Lancer. Navigators assigned to the B-1B attend a special training program at Randolph. Students in the strike/fighter track will receive follow-on assignments in the F-15E Strike Eagle as weapon systems officers and attend special training in the IFF course. Nineteenth Air Force also provided enlisted aircrew training for a wide variety of aircrew specialties including flight engineers, air-to- air refueling boom operators, loadmasters, aerial gunners, airborne communications specialists and weapons directors. Flight engineers and boom operators train at Altus AFB, loadmasters train at Sheppard AFB, helicopter flight engineers and aerial gunners train at Kirtland AFB, airborne communications specialists train at Keesler AFB, and Air Battle Managers train at Tyndall AFB. As a cost-cutting measure, Nineteenth Air Force was inactivated on 9 July 2012.

The 21 EMTF was a redesignation of Twenty-First Air Force, effective 1 October 2003. The 21st EMTF reported to Headquarters, Eighteenth Air Force at Scott Air Force Base, Illinois. It was inactivated on 19 March 2012. Mission The 21st Expeditionary Mobility Task Force (EMTF) provided a rapid, tailored, worldwide, air mobility response to combatant commander's needs. Reporting through Eighteenth Air Force, the EMTF extended existing AMC infrastructure, through both en route employment and rapid forward deployment capabilities. Its mission was to command and assess the combat readiness of assigned air mobility forces over the Atlantic half of the globe in support of Global Reach. These forces were at more than 55 locations in eight countries. 21 EMTF's major units included six active duty wings, two operational flying groups, and two mobility operations/support groups. Additionally, the 21 EMTF was liaison to 40 Air Reserve Component Wings. 21 EMTF's strategic airlift force included the C-5 Galaxy, C-17 Globemaster III and the C-130 Hercules, aircraft, used to move cargo and passengers worldwide. The tanker force included KC-10 Extenders and KC-135 Stratotankers used for inflight refueling to provide increased global mobility.

Operational history thumb 1966 emblem of the 21st Air Force, based on the MATS Eastern Transport Air Force emblem 21st Expeditionary Mobility Task Force units provided airlift in support of national policy under the most difficult circumstances. Under Military Air Transport Service, Eastern Transport Air Force (EASTAF), headquartered at McGuire AFB, New Jersey, controlled all strategic airlift operations between the Mississippi River and the east coast of Africa and in Central and South America. When MATS became Military Airlift Command, EASTAF was redesignated Twenty-First Air Force, with the same area of responsibility. In addition to Dover AFB, other major 21st AF bases were Charleston AFB, South Carolina and McGuire AFB, NJ. Depending upon command organization at different times, airlift and airlift support units in Europe, the Azores, Bermuda and throughout the southeastern United States also reported to EASTAF or 21st AF. Operating as Twenty-First Air Force, in Operation Just Cause, Twenty-first Air Force units conducted the largest night airdrop since World War II, leading to the liberation of Panama. Twenty-first Air Force controlled the largest airlift in history during Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm, ensuring the success of our response to Iraqi aggression. Twenty-First Air Force was involved in operations in Bosnia and Southwest Asia. The command also supported peaceful, humanitarian missions. Twenty-first Air Force units flew relief missions after Hurricane Hugo (1989) and Andrew (1992), earthquakes in Armenia and San Francisco, and many other natural disasters. In addition, it controlled the Operation Provide Comfort airlift missions to the Kurds following the Persian Gulf War, the Operation Provide Hope airlift in the aftermath of the collapse of the Soviet Union, and participated in Operation Restore Hope, the humanitarian airlift of food and supplies into Somalia. The ETF supported numerous exercises around the world, one of which was CENTRAZBAT, in which C-17's flew multi-national paratroopers non-stop from Pope AFB, North Carolina, airdropping them directly into the Central Asian countries of Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan demonstrating the capabilities of direct delivery. The command could operate in remote, often austere locations throughout Europe, Africa, and South America. ReferencesFurther reading * Snedeker, Clayton H.

It was activated on 1 July 1993 and is headquartered at Dobbins Air Reserve Base, Georgia. In the event of mobilization, some of the Twenty-Second Air Force's subordinate units would come under the operational control (OPCON) of the Air Mobility Command's (AMC) 21st Expeditionary Mobility Task Force, headquartered at McGuire Air Force Base, New Jersey, while others would come under OPCON of Air Education and Training Command's 19th Air Force at Randolph AFB, Texas. Mission 22 AF is responsible for recruiting and training reservists and for maintaining subordinate units at the highest level of combat readiness. A by-product of training is to coordinate daily support of the active duty air force. 22 AF's wartime mission is to provide combat-ready airlift and support units and augments personnel requirements to Air Mobility Command in the United States. Twenty-Second Air Force manages more than 25,000 Reservists and has 149 unit- equipped aircraft. Reserve crews in 22 AF fly the C-130 Hercules, including the WC-130 \\"Hurricane Hunter\\" aircraft, which are located at nine different Air Force Reserve wings.

In 1946, the organization was transferred to Air Transport Command and became, in essence, a military airline its Continental Division, managing transport routes within the United States. When the USAF was created as a separate service in 1947, Military Air Transport Service was established to support the new Department of Defense, with responsibility for its support falling to the Department of the Air Force. Redesignated Western Transport Air Force (WESTAF), the organization managed all MATS operations from the Mississippi River west to the east coast of Africa until MATS was replaced by the Military Airlift Command in 1966. When MATS became MAC, WESTAF was redesignated 22d AF, with headquarters at Travis AFB, CA. During the 1960s, Twenty-Second Air Force transports flew missions worldwide, supporting the efforts of the United States in Southeast Asia, Europe and other places around the world. In December 1974, the Twenty- Second Air Force absorbed Tactical Air Command's Twelfth Air Force C-130 Hercules tactical airlift operations. On 29 March 1979, the Twenty-Second Air Force assumed responsibility for managing Military Airlift Command resources in the Pacific. For this mission, the unit provided a single commander for MAC airlift units in the Pacific theater; command and control of theater-assigned airlift forces for Pacific Air Forces; theater tactical airlift war planning and Pacific exercise planning; and aerial ports in the Pacific area to support the air movement of personnel, cargo, equipment, patients, and mail. The division participated in tactical exercises such as Team Spirit, Ulchi Focus Lens, and Capstan Dragon. The unit was relieved from assignment to Military Airlift Command and assigned to Air Mobility Command on 1 June 1992.

","title":"Twenty-Second Air Force"},{"id":"464061","text":"Earl of the County of Mayo, usually known simply as Earl of Mayo, is a title in the Peerage of Ireland. It was created in 1785 for John Bourke, 1st Viscount Mayo (of the second creation). For many years he served as \\"First Commissioner of Revenue\\" in Ireland. He had already been created Baron Naas, of Naas in the county of Kildare, in 1776, and Viscount Mayo, of Moneycrower in the county of Mayo, in 1781, also in the Peerage of Ireland. This branch of the Bourke family descends from John Bourke, fourth son of Sir Thomas Bourke (died 1397), whose second son Edmund was the ancestor of the Viscounts Mayo (of the first creation). Before becoming Viscounts and Earls of Mayo, the senior branch of the family held the Gaelic title Mac William √çochtar and received the White Rod. The Earls of Clanricarde were members of another branch of the De Burgh dynasty. Lord Mayo was succeeded by his eldest son John, the second Earl, who was a member of the Irish House of Commons. On his death the titles passed to his younger brother, the third Earl. He was a prominent Anglican clergyman and served as Bishop of Leighlin from 1772 to 1782 and as Archbishop of Tuam from 1782 to 1794. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the fourth Earl. He sat in the House of Lords as an Irish representative peer from 1816 to 1849. On his death the titles passed to his nephew, the fifth Earl. He was an Irish representative peer in the House of Lords from 1852 to 1867. The 6th Earl of Mayo was Viceroy and Governor-General of India until his assassination in 1872. His eldest son, the sixth Earl, was a prominent Conservative politician. Known for most of his life under his courtesy title of Lord Naas, he was three times Chief Secretary for Ireland and served as Viceroy and Governor-General of India from 1869 to 1872, when he was assassinated on the Andaman Islands. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the seventh Earl. He sat in the House of Lords as an Irish representative peer from 1890 to 1927 and was a Member of the Senate of the Irish Free State from 1922 to 1927. This line of the family expired on his death in 1927 and the titles passed to the late Earl's first cousin, the eighth Earl. He was the son of the Reverend The Hon. George Wingfield Bourke, fourth son of the fifth Earl. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the ninth Earl. On his death in 1962 the peerages passed to his nephew, the tenth Earl. He was the only son of the Hon. Bryan Longley Bourke, third son of the eighth Earl. The tenth Earl was involved in British politics and unsuccessfully contested South Dorset in the 1964 general election as a Liberal. , the titles are held by his eldest son, the eleventh Earl, who succeeded in 2006. The present Earl was educated at Portora Royal School, Enniskillen, Queen's University Belfast and Dublin Institute of Technology, Dublin. Lord Mayo is a marble specialist like his father, whose children are Roman Catholics, reverting to pre-peerage family tradition.Daily Telegraph obituary for the 10th Earl of Mayo Several other members of the Bourke (pronounced \\"Burke\\") family have also gained distinction. The Right Reverend The Hon. Richard Bourke, second son of the third Earl and father of the fifth Earl, was Bishop of Waterford and Lismore. The Hon. John Jocelyn Bourke (1823‚Äì1904), second son of the fifth Earl, was a lieutenant-general in the Army. The Hon. Robert Bourke was a Conservative politician and was created Baron Connemara in 1887. Sir George Deane Bourke, grandson of Reverend the Hon. George Theobald Bourke, fourth son of the third Earl, was a major-general in the Army. The courtesy title of Lord Mayo's eldest son and heir is Lord Naas (pronounced \\"Nace\\"). The family seat is Derryinver, near Clifden, County Galway. The ancient family seat was in Palmerstown, County Kildare, where the 7th Earl built Palmerstown House in 1872 to honour his father after his assassination. It was burned by Irish Republicans in 1923, but later repaired and sold, and is currently a hotel.

This massive granite structure is prominently located on a hilltop, and was raised to commemorate the Voortrekkers who left the Cape Colony between 1835 and 1854. On 8 July 2011 the Voortrekker Monument, designed by the architect Gerard Moerdijk, was declared a National Heritage Site by the South African Heritage Resource Agency. History Wounded Voortrekker at Vegkop, detail of the historical frieze The idea to build a monument in honour of God was first discussed on 16 December 1888, when President Paul Kruger of the South African Republic attended the Day of the Covenant celebrations at Danskraal in Natal. However, the movement to actually build such a monument only started in 1931 when the Sentrale Volksmonumentekomitee (SVK) (Central People's Monuments Committee) was formed to bring this idea to fruition. Construction started on 13 July 1937 with a sod-turning ceremony performed by the chairman of the SVK, Advocate Ernest George Jansen, on what later became known as Monument Hill. On 16 December 1938 the cornerstone was laid by three descendants of some of the Voortrekker leaders: Mrs. J.C. Muller (granddaughter of Andries Pretorius), Mrs. K.F. Ackerman (great-granddaughter of Hendrik Potgieter) and Mrs. J.C. Preller (great-granddaughter of Piet Retief). The Monument was inaugurated on 16 December 1949 by the then-prime minister D. F. Malan. The total construction cost of the Monument was about ¬£ 360,000, most of which was contributed by the South African government. The construction contract being awarded to Raubex, after its incorporation. A large amphitheatre, which seats approximately 20,000 people, was erected to the north-east of the Monument in 1949. Main features The Voortrekker Monument is 40 metres high, with a base of 40 metres by 40 metres. The building shares architectural resemblance with European monuments such the D√¥me des Invalides in France and the V√∂lkerschlachtdenkmal in Germany but also contains African influences. The two main points of interest inside the building are the Historical Frieze and the Cenotaph. South window and frieze Historical Frieze The main entrance of the building leads into the domed Hall of Heroes. This massive space, flanked by four huge arched windows made from yellow Belgian glass, contains the unique marble Historical Frieze which is an intrinsic part of the design of the monument. It is the biggest marble frieze in the world. The frieze consists of 27 bas-relief panels depicting the history of the Great Trek, but incorporating references to every day life, work methods and religious beliefs of the Voortrekkers. The set of panels illustrates key historical scenes starting from the first voortrekkers of 1835, up to the signing of the Sand River Convention in 1852. In the centre of the floor of the Hall of Heroes is a large circular opening through which the Cenotaph in the Cenotaph Hall can be viewed. The Cenotaph Cenotaph The Cenotaph, situated in the centre of the Cenotaph Hall, is the central focus of the monument. In addition to being viewable from the Hall of Heroes it can also be seen from the dome at the top of the building, from where much of the interior of the monument can be viewed. Through an opening in this dome a ray of sunlight shines at twelve o'clock on 16 December annually, falling onto the centre of the Cenotaph, striking the words 'Ons vir Jou, Suid-Afrika' (Afrikaans for 'We're for you, South Africa'), a line from 'Die Stem van Suid-Afrika'. The ray of light symbolises God's blessing on the lives and endeavours of the Voortrekkers. 16 December 1838 was the date of the Battle of Blood River, commemorated in South Africa before 1994 as the Day of the Vow. The Cenotaph Hall is decorated with the flags of the different Voortrekker Republics and contains wall tapestries depicting the Voortrekkers as well as several display cases with artefacts from the Great Trek. Against the northern wall of the hall is a niche with a lantern in which a flame has been kept burning ever since 1938. It was in that year that the Symbolic Ox Wagon Trek, which started in Cape Town and ended at Monument Hill where the Monument's foundation stone was laid, took place. The wagon laager wall features 64 wagons Other features Visitors to the monument enter through a black wrought iron gate with an assegai (spear) motif. After passing through the gate one finds oneself inside a big laager consisting of 64 ox-wagons made out of decorative granite. The same number of wagons were used at the Battle of Blood River to form the laager. Voortrekker woman and children by Anton van Wouw Statue of Piet Retief At the foot of the Monument stands Anton van Wouw's bronze sculpture of a Voortrekker woman and her two children, paying homage to the strength and courage of the Voortrekker women. On both sides of this sculpture black wildebeest are chiselled into the walls of the Monument. The wildebeest symbolically depicts the dangers of Africa and their symbolic flight implies that the woman, carrier of Western civilisation, is triumphant. On each outside corner of the Monument there is a statue, respectively representing Piet Retief, Andries Pretorius, Hendrik Potgieter and an \\"unknown\\" leader (representative of all the other Voortrekker leaders). Each statue weighs approximately 6 tons. At the eastern corner of the monument, on the same level as its entrance, is the foundation stone. Under the foundation stone is buried: *A copy of the Trekker Vow on 16 December 1838. *A copy of the anthem \\"Die Stem\\". *A copy of the land deal between the Trekkers under Piet Retief and the Zulus under king Dingane. German links According to Dr Alta Steenkamp, the masonic subtext of the Monument to the Battle of the Nations (V√∂lkerschlachtdenkmal) in Leipzig, Germany, is reflected in the Voortrekker Monument because the architect, Gerard Moerdijk, had used the geometric order and spatial proportions of the V√∂lkerschlachtdenkmal. This Germanisation of the Voortrekker Monument occurred after Moerdijk's initial design had caused a public outcry in the South African press for its resemblance to an Egyptian temple. In Moerdijk's initial design, the monument consisted of a causeway linking two Egyptian obelisks. Finalising his design of the Voortrekker Monument, Moerdijk visited Egypt in 1936, including the Karnak Temple Complex in Thebes. In Thebes, the pharaoh Akhenaten, Nefertiti's husband, had erected three sun sanctuaries, including the Hwt-benben ('mansion of the Benben'). The cenotaph is the symbolic tomb of Piet Retief and his delegation. The most prominent aspect of Moerdijk's monument is the annual mid noon sun illumination of the Benben stone, the encrypted cenotaph. In the years preceding WWII, several Afrikaner nationalists travelled to Germany for academic, political and cultural studies. In 1928 Moerdijk visited Germany, and viewed the Amarna bust of Nefertiti on public display in Berlin. By 1934 Chancellor Hitler had decided that Germany would not return the Amarna bust of Nefertiti to Egypt. He instead announced the intention to use the Amarna bust as the central show piece of the thousand years Third Reich, in a revitalised Berlin to be renamed Germania. Likewise Moerdijk's thousand years monument with Amarna sun symbol at its centre, became Afrikaner nationalists' centre show piece of their capital Pretoria. Round floor opening Looking from the sky dome downwards, 32 sun rays can be counted, reflecting the masonic influence of the architecture Looking from the sky dome downwards, a chevron pattern on the floor of the Hall of Heroes, radiates outwards like 32 sun rays. In Moerdijk's architecture, the natural sun forms the 33rd ray through the floor opening. Moerdijk said the chevron pattern on the floor depicts water,Official Opening Program of the Voortrekker Monument 1949 as does the double chevron hieroglyph from the civilization of ancient Egypt. Moerdijk stated that all roads on the terrain of building art lead back to ancient Egypt. Based on Moerdijk's reference to the watery floor of the Hall of Heroes, as well as his statements about ancient Egypt, the floor opening may be identified with the watery abyss, as in the creation theology of ancient African civilization. Rising out of this watery abyss, was the primeval mound, the Benben stone, to symbolize a new creation. Religious sun ray Gerard Moerdijk was the chief architect of 80 Protestant churches in South Africa. Moerdijk adhered to Reformed church tradition and thus his Renaissance trademark, the Greek-cross floorplan, always focused on the pulpit and preacher. In Protestant theology, the word of God is central. Moerdijk created a similar central focus in the Voortrekker Monument, but in vertical instead of horizontal plane, and in African instead of European style. The monument's huge upper dome features Egyptian backlighting to simulate the sky, the heavenly abode of God. Through the dome a sun ray penetrates downwards, highlighting words on 16 December at noon. The sky oriented words: \\"US FOR YOU SOUTH AFRICA\\", are Moerdijk's focus point. These words are taken from an anthem, Die Stem: \\"We will live, we will die, we for thee South-Africa\\". The same anthem ends: \\"It will be well, God reigns.\\" Thus the sun ray simulates a connection between the words on the Cenotaph and the heavenly abode above, a communication between God and man. The actual sun ray itself forms a 33rd sun ray shining onto the stone in the midst of floor opening. Heavenly vow In Moerdijk's biblical theology, God communicates in two ways: through scripture and nature.Heidelberg Catechism Moerdijk merges both methods, by using the sun in his simulation. Relief of an ox-wagon on the laager wall The Vow of the Trekkers was commemorated on 16 December as the Day of the Vow. On 16 December, the appearance of an illuminating sun disc on the wording of the Cenotaph stone, transform their meaning as per the Philosophers Stone of the alchemists. Instead of man below making an earthly vow, the sun shifts the focus upwards to the trinitarian god of the Trekkers, as it is God who communicates through Moerdijk's sun architecture, making Himself a heavenly vow with the words: WE - as in GOD - FOR THEE SOUTH-AFRICA. Thus God in the trinitarian tradition of the Trekkers, speaks a vow within the sun disc illuminating the words on the Cenotaph. The Trekker belief that God was for South Africa originates from the 9‚Äì16 December 1838 vow of Trekker leader Andries Pretorius at Blood River, who at around the same time made military and political alliances with Christian Zulus like prince Mpande. Egyptian origin Moerdijk was an outspoken supporter of ancient Egyptian architecture.Journal Title: Southern African Humanities Volume 13, Publication Date: 2001, Pages: 139 - 154, Authors: Sabine Marschall, Moerdijk referred to Africa's greatness as imparted by ancient Egyptian constructions at the inauguration of the Voortrekker Monument. Before his Voortrekker Monument proposal was accepted, Moerdijk and Anton van Wouw had been working in alliance for many years on their \\"dream castle\\" project:SECOND GERARD MOERDYK- GEDENKLESING 2005, 'N EGTE LUGKASTEEL: MOERDIJK, VAN WOUW EN DIE VOORTREKKERMONUMENT, prof. Alex Duffey of the University of Pretoria a modern African-Egyptian Voortrekker Temple in South-Africa. Van Wouw and Frans Soff had earlier employed the Egyptian obelisk, a petrified ray of the African Aten, as central motif for the National Women's Monument in Bloemfontein, South Africa, itself likewise inaugurated on the Day of the Vow, 16 December 1913. Whilst finalising the design of the Voortrekker Monument in 1936, Moerdijk went on a research trip to Egypt. There he visited the Karnak Temple Complex at Thebes, where an African Renaissance had flourished under Pharaoh Akhenaten, Nefertiti's husband. The open air temples of Akhenaten to the Aten incorporated the Heliopolitan tradition of employing sun rays in architecture, as well as realistic wall reliefs or friezes. Moerdijk also visited the Cairo Museum, where a copy of the Great Hymn to the Aten is on display, some verses of which remind of Psalm 104. Moerdijk's wife Sylva related that he was intimately acquainted with ancient Egyptian architecture, and was strongly influenced architecturally by his visit to Egypt. Architectural purpose Looking upwards at mid noon on 16 December reveals a dot within a circle, the ancient African-Egyptian hieroglyph for the monotheistic creator god Aten Looking downwards from the dome The architect, Gerard Moerdijk, stated that the purpose of a building had to be clearly visible. The aspect of the sun at mid-noon in Africa, was during Nefertiti's time known as Aten. In Egyptian hieroglyphics, Aten was written as a sun dot enclosed by a circle. The Aten- hieroglyph is depicted in the Voortrekker Monument when the sun shines through an aperture in the top dome. Likewise, looking downwards from the top dome walkway, the round floor opening is seen to encircle the sun disc illumination. Moerdijk's message as implied by the wall frieze: by exodus out of the British Cape Colony, God created a new civilization inland. In order to give thanks to this new creation of civilization, Moerdijk, recalling Abraham of old, outwardly designed the Voortrekker Monument as an altar. Monument complex In the years following its construction, the monument complex was expanded several times and now includes: * An indigenous garden that surrounds the monument.The Wall of Remembrance dedicated to those who lost their lives while serving in the South African Defence Force. * Fort Schanskop, a nearby fort built in 1897 by the government of the South African Republic after the Jameson Raid and now a museum. * The Schanskop open-air amphitheatre with seating for 357 people that was officially opened on 30 January 2001. * A garden of remembrance. * A nature reserve was declared on 3.41 km¬≤ around the Monument in 1992. Game found on the reserve include Zebras, Blesbok, Mountain Reedbuck, Springbok, Black Wildebeest and Impala. * A Wall of Remembrance that was constructed near the Monument in 2009. It was built to commemorate the members of the South African Defence Force who died in service of their country between 1961 and 1994. * An Afrikaner heritage centre, which was built in order to preserve the heritage of the Afrikaans-speaking portion of South Africa's population and their contribution to the history of the country.

The original term literally means \\"third country's citizen\\".  Concept  In the immediate aftermath of the war, the legal status of Koreans and Taiwanese was not clear. The occupying American force enjoyed an immunity from the Japanese legal system. Some Koreans and Taiwanese came to insist that, since they were from a liberated country, they were no longer under the jurisdiction of the Japanese Imperial government. This resulted in many poor Taiwanese and Koreans who were previously suppressed under colonial rule to form criminal gangs such as the Yamiichi (ÈóáÂ∏Ç), a black market which was against the rationing system which continued after the war. The occasional clash of these gangs and Japanese police was widely reported by the newspapers of the time. One such incident was the Shibuya incident. Many of these rioters were referred to by the term \\"Sangokujin\\", which was invented by the American administration. Soon, many Japanese began to associate the term Sangokujin with the criminal behavior of ex-colonial residents.David E. Kaplan, Alec Dubro (2003) Yakuza: Japan's criminal underworld, University of California Press, p35 As the country became more stable, the term became something of an anachronism and was mostly forgotten. However, the use of the term was revived when the nationalist Tokyo Metropolitan Governor Shintaro Ishihara used it in an April 9, 2000 address to the Japanese Self Defense Forces (JSDF). In the speech, Ishihara suggested that the JSDF would be needed to suppress Sangokujin criminal activity in the event of a catastrophic disaster in Tokyo.CALVIN SIMS (2000) Tokyo Chief Starts New Furor, on Immigrants New York Times :I referred to the \\"many sangokujin who entered Japan illegally.\\" I thought some people would not know that word so I paraphrased it and used gaikokujin, or foreigners.

After World War II, when Japan lost, the Chinese of Taiwanese origin and people from the Korean Peninsula persecuted, robbed and sometimes beat up Japanese. It's at that time the word was used, so it was not derogatory. Rather we were afraid of them. :... There's no need for an apology. I was surprised that there was a big reaction to my speech. In order not to cause any misunderstanding, I decided I will no longer use that word. It is regrettable that the word was interpreted in the way it was.\\"'There's No Need For an Apology': Tokyo's boisterous governor is back in the headlines ,\\" TIME Asia, April 24, 2000. The governor later stated, \\"What is wrong with calling Sangokujins 'Sangokujins'?\\" Ishihara insisted that the term is a neutral reference to the Zainichi population for his generation.

Mills was published widely in popular and intellectual journals. He is remembered for several books, such as The Power Elite, which introduced that term and describes the relationships and class alliances among the US political, military, and economic elites; White Collar: The American Middle Classes, on the American middle class; and The Sociological Imagination, which presents a model of analysis for the interdependence of subjective experiences within a person's biography, the general social structure, and historical development. Mills was concerned with the responsibilities of intellectuals in post‚ÄìWorld War II society, and he advocated public and political engagement over disinterested observation. Mills's biographer, Daniel Geary, writes that Mills's writings had a \\"particularly significant impact on New Left social movements of the 1960s era.\\" It was Mills who popularized the term New Left in the US in a 1960 open letter, \\"Letter to the New Left\\".  Early life  Mills was born in Waco, Texas, on 28 August 1916. He lived in Texas until he was 23. His father, Charles Grover Mills, worked as an insurance salesman, while his mother, Frances Wright Mills, worked as a homemaker. His father had moved to Texas from his home state of Florida, but his mother and maternal grandparents were all born and raised in Texas. His family moved frequently when he was growing up and as a result, Mills lived a relatively isolated life as a child, with few continuous relationships. With his family, Mills spent time living in the following cities (in order): Waco, Wichita Falls, Fort Worth, Sherman, Dallas, Austin, and San Antonio. He graduated from Dallas Technical High School in 1934.  College years  Mills initially attended Texas A&M; University but left after his first year. He subsequently graduated from the University of Texas at Austin in 1939 with a bachelor's degree in sociology and a master's degree in philosophy. By the time that he graduated, Mills had already been published in the two leading sociology journals in the US: the American Sociological Review and the American Journal of Sociology. While studying at Texas, Mills met his first wife, Dorothy Helen Smith, who was also a student there seeking a master's degree in sociology. She had previously attended Oklahoma College for Women, where she graduated with a bachelor's degree in commerce. They were married in October 1937. After their marriage Dorothy Helen, or \\"Freya\\", worked as a staff member of the director of the Women's Residence Hall at the University of Texas. She supported the couple while Mills completed his graduate work; she also typed and copy edited much of his work, including his PhD dissertation. There, he met Hans Gerth, a professor in the Department of Sociology. He became a mentor and friend although Mills did not take any classes with Gerth. In August 1940, Freya divorced Mills, but the couple remarried in March 1941. Their daughter, Pamela, was born on 15 January 1943. Mills received his PhD in sociology from the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison in 1942. His dissertation was entitled A Sociological Account of Pragmatism: An Essay on the Sociology of Knowledge. Mills refused to revise his dissertation while it was reviewed by his committee. It was later accepted without approval from the review committee. Mills left Wisconsin in early 1942, after he had been appointed Professor of Sociology at the University of Maryland, College Park.  Early career  Timeline of Mills' life. Click the image for greater detail. During his work as an Associate Professor of Sociology from 1941 until 1945 at the University of Maryland, College Park, Mills's awareness and involvement in American politics grew. During World War II, Mills became friends with historians Richard Hofstadter, Frank Freidel, and Ken Stampp. The four academics collaborated on many topics, and so each wrote about many contemporary issues surrounding the war and how it affected American society. In the mid-1940s while he was still at Maryland, Mills began contributing \\"journalistic sociology\\" and opinion pieces to intellectual journals such as The New Republic, The New Leader, and Politics, the journal established by his friend Dwight Macdonald in 1944. In 1945, Mills moved to New York after securing a research associate position at Columbia University's Bureau of Applied Social Research. He separated from Freya with this move, and the couple divorced in 1947. Mills was appointed Assistant Professor in the University's sociology department in 1946. Mills received a grant of $2,500 from the Guggenheim Foundation in April 1945 to fund his research in 1946. During that time, he wrote White Collar, which was finally published in 1951. In 1946, Mills published From Max Weber: Essays in Sociology, a translation of Weber's essays co-authored with Hans Gerth. In 1953, the two published a second work, Character and Social Structure: The Psychology of Social Institutions. In 1947, Mills married his second wife, Ruth Harper, a statistician at the Bureau of Applied Social Research. She worked with Mills on New Men of Power (1948), White Collar (1951), and The Power Elite (1956). In 1949, Mills and Harper went to Chicago so that Mills could serve as a visiting professor at the University of Chicago. Mills returned to teaching at Columbia University after a semester at the University of Chicago and was promoted to Associate Professor of Sociology on 1 July 1950. Their daughter, Kathryn, was born on 14 July 1955. Mills was promoted to Professor of Sociology at Columbia on 1 July 1956. From 1956 to 1957, the family moved to Copenhagen, where Mills acted as a Fulbright lecturer at the University of Copenhagen. Mills and Harper separated in December 1957, when Mills returned from Copenhagen alone. They were divorced in 1959.  Later years  Mills married his third wife, Yaroslava Surmach, an American artist of Ukrainian descent, and settled in Rockland County, New York, in 1959. Their son, Nicholas Charles, was born on 19 June 1960. In August 1960, Mills spent time in Cuba, where he worked on developing his text Listen, Yankee. He spent some of his time in Cuba interviewing President Fidel Castro, who claimed to having read and studied Mills's The Power Elite. Mills was described as a man in a hurry. Aside from his hurried nature, he was largely known for his combativeness. Both his private life, with four marriages to three women, a child from each, and several affairs, and his professional life, which involved challenging and criticizing many of his professors and coworkers, have been characterized as \\"tumultuous\\". He wrote a fairly obvious, though slightly veiled, essay in criticism of the former chairman of the Wisconsin department, and he called the senior theorist there, Howard P. Becker, a \\"real fool\\". On one special occasion, when Mills was honored during a visit to the Soviet Union as a major critic of American society, he criticized censorship in the Soviet Union through his toast to an early Soviet leader who was \\"purged and murdered by the Stalinist.\\" He said, \\"To the day when the complete works of Leon Trotsky are published in the Soviet Union!\\" In a biography of Mills by Irving Louis Horowitz, the author writes about Mills's acute awareness of his heart condition. He speculates that it affected the way he lived his adult life. Mills was described as someone who worked fast, yet efficiently. That is argued to be a result of his knowing that he would not live long due to his heart health. Horowitz describes Mills as \\"a man in search of his destiny\\". Mills suffered from a series of heart attacks throughout his life and his fourth attack led to his death on 20 March 1962 in West Nyack, New York.  Influences  C. Wright Mills was strongly influenced by pragmatism, specifically the works of George Herbert Mead, John Dewey, Charles Sanders Peirce, and William James. The social structure aspects of Mills's works is shaped largely by Max Weber and the writing of Karl Mannheim, who followed Weber's work closely. Mills also acknowledged a general influence of Marxism; he noted that Marxism had become an essential tool for sociologists and therefore all must naturally be educated on the subject; any Marxist influence was then a result of sufficient education. Neo-Freudianism also helped shape Mills's work. Mills was an intense student of philosophy before he became a sociologist. His vision of radical, egalitarian democracy was a direct result of the influence of ideas from Thorstein Veblen, John Dewey, and Mead. During his time at the University of Wisconsin, Mills was deeply influenced by Hans Gerth, a sociology professor from Germany. Mills gained an insight into European learning and sociological theory from Gerth.  Books  From Max Weber: Essays in Sociology (1946) was edited and translated in collaboration with Gerth. Mills and Gerth had begun collaborating in 1940, and they selected a few of Weber's original German text and translated them into English. The preface of the book begins by explaining the disputable difference of meaning that English words give to German writing. The authors attempt to explain their devotion to being as accurate as possible in translating Weber's writing. The New Men of Power: America's Labor Leaders (1948) studies the \\"Labor Metaphysic\\" and the dynamic of labor leaders cooperating with business officials. The book concludes that the labor movement had effectively renounced its traditional oppositional role and become reconciled to life within a capitalist system. Appeased by \\"bread and butter\\" economic policies, unions had adopted a pliant and subordinate role in the new structure of American power. The Puerto Rican Journey (1950) was written in collaboration with Clarence Senior and Rose Kohn Goldsen. It documents a methodological study and does not address theoretical sociological framework. White Collar: The American Middle Classes (1951) offers a rich historical account of the middle classes in the United States and contends that bureaucracies have overwhelmed middle-class workers, robbing them of all independent thought and turning them into near-automatons, oppressed but cheerful. Mills states there are three types of power within the workplace: coercion or physical force; authority; and manipulation. Through this piece, the thoughts of Mills and Weber seem to coincide in their belief that Western Society is trapped within the iron cage of bureaucratic rationality, which would lead society to focus more on rationality and less on reason. Mills's fear was that the middle class was becoming \\"politically emasculated and culturally stultified,\\" which would allow a shift in power from the middle class to the strong social elite. Middle-class workers receive an adequate salary but have become alienated from the world because of their inability to affect or change it. Character and Social Structure (1953) was co-authored with Gerth. This was considered his most theoretically sophisticated work. Mills later came into conflict with Gerth, though Gerth positively referred to him as, \\"an excellent operator, a whippersnapper, promising young man on the make, and Texas cowboy √† la ride and shoot.\\" Generally speaking, Character and Social Structure combines the social behaviorism and personality structure of pragmatism with the social structure of Weberian sociology. It is centered on roles, how they are interpersonal, and how they are related to institutions. The Power Elite (1956) describes the relationships among the political, military, and economic elites, noting that they share a common world view; that power rests in the centralization of authority within the elites of American society. The centralization of authority is made up of the following components: a \\"military metaphysic\\", in other words a military definition of reality; \\"class identity\\", recognizing themselves as separate from and superior to the rest of society; \\"interchangeability\\" (they move within and between the three institutional structures and hold interlocking positions of power therein); cooperation/socialization, in other words, socialization of prospective new members is done based on how well they \\"clone\\" themselves socially after already established elites. Mills's view on the power elite is that they represent their own interest, which include maintaining a \\"permanent war economy\\" to control the ebbs and flow of American Capitalism and the masking of \\"a manipulative social and political order through the mass media.\\" The Causes of World War Three (1958) and Listen, Yankee (1960) were important works that followed. In both, Mills attempts to create a moral voice for society and make the power elite responsible to the \\"public\\". Although Listen, Yankee was considered highly controversial, it was an exploration of the Cuban Revolution written from the viewpoint of a Cuban revolutionary and was a very innovative style of writing for that period in American history. The Sociological Imagination (1959), which is considered Mills's most influential book, describes a mindset for studying sociology, the sociological imagination, that stresses being able to connect individual experiences and societal relationships. Three components form the sociological imagination: # History: why society is what it is and how it has been changing for a long time and how history is being made in it # Biography: the nature of \\"human nature\\" in a society and what kinds of people inhabit a particular society # Social Structure: how the various institutional orders in a society function, which ones are dominant, how they are kept together, how they might be changing too, etc. Mills asserts that a critical task for social scientists is to \\"translate personal troubles into public issues\\". The distinction between troubles and issues is that troubles relate to how a single person feels about something while issues refer to how a society affects groups of people. For instance, a man who cannot find employment is experiencing a trouble, while a city with a massive unemployment rate makes it not just a personal trouble but an issue. Sociologists, then, rightly connect their autobiographical, personal challenges to social institutions. Social scientists should then connect those institutions to social structures and locate them within a historical narrative. The version of Images of Man: The Classic Tradition in Sociological Thinking (1960) worked on by C. Wright Mills is simply an edited copy with the addition of an introduction written himself. Through this work, Mills explains that he believes the use of models is the characteristic of classical sociologists, and that these models are the reason classical sociologists maintain relevance. The Marxists (1962) takes Mills's explanation of sociological models from Images of Man and uses it to criticize modern liberalism and Marxism. He believes that the liberalist model does not work and cannot create an overarching view of society, but rather it is more of an ideology for the entrepreneurial middle class. Marxism, however, may be incorrect in its overall view, but it has a working model for societal structure, the mechanics of the history of society, and the roles of individuals. One of Mills's problems with the Marxist model is that it uses units that are small and autonomous, which he finds too simple to explain capitalism. Mills then provides discussion on Marx as a determinist.  Legacy  The Mexican writer Carlos Fuentes dedicated his novel The Death of Artemio Cruz (1962) to Mills and called him the \\"true voice of North America, friend and companion in the struggle of Latin America.\\" Fuentes was a fan of Mills's Listen, Yankee and appreciated Mills's insight into what he believed Cubans were experiencing as citizens of a country undergoing revolutionary change. Mills's legacy can be most deeply felt through the printed compilation of his letters and other works called C Wright Mills: Letters and Autobiographical Writings, edited by two of his children, Kathryn and Pamela Mills. In the book's introduction, Dan Wakefield states that Mills's sociological vision of American society is one that transcends the field of sociology. Mills presented his ideas as a way to keep American society from falling into the trap of what is known as \\"mass society\\". Many scholars argue that Mills' ideas sparked the radical movements of the 1960s, which took place after he died. His work was recognized in the United States and was also greatly appreciated abroad, having appeared in 23 languages. Above all, Wakefield remembers Mills's character most as being surrounded by controversy: In 1964, the Society for the Study of Social Problems established the C. Wright Mills Award for the book that \\"best exemplifies outstanding social science research and a great mutual understanding the individual and society in the tradition of the distinguished sociologist, C. Wright Mills.\\"  Outlook  There has long been debate over Mills's intellectual outlook. Mills is often seen as a \\"closet Marxist\\" because of his emphasis on social classes and their roles in historical progress and attempt to keep Marxist traditions alive in social theory. Just as often however, others argue that Mills more closely identified with the work of Max Weber, whom many sociologists interpret as an exemplar of sophisticated (and intellectually adequate) anti-Marxism and modern liberalism. However, Mills clearly gives precedence to social structure described by the political, economic and military institutions and not culture, which is presented in its massified form as means to ends sought by the power elite, which puts him firmly in the Marxist and not Weberian camp, so much that in his collection of classical essays, Weber's Protestant Ethic is not included. Weber's idea of bureaucracy as internalized social control was embraced by Mills as was the historicity of his method, but far from liberalism (being its critic), Mills was a radical who was culturally forced to distance himself from Marx while being \\"near\\" him. While Mills never embraced the \\"Marxist\\" label, he told his closest associates that he felt much closer to what he saw as the best currents of a flexible humanist Marxism than to its alternatives. He considered himself as a \\"plain Marxist\\" working in the spirit of young Marx as he claims in his collected essays: \\"Power, Politics and People\\" (Oxford University Press, 1963). In a November 1956 letter to his friends Bette and Harvey Swados, Mills declared \\"[i]n the meantime, let's not forget that there's more [that's] still useful in even the Sweezy kind of Marxism than in all the routineers of J. S. Mill put together.\\" There is an important quotation from Letters to Tovarich (an autobiographical essay) dated Fall 1957 titled \\"On Who I Might Be and How I Got That Way\\": These two quotations are the ones chosen by Kathryn Mills for the better acknowledgement of his nuanced thinking. It appears that Mills understood his position as being much closer to Marx than to Weber but influenced by both, as Stanley Aronowitz argued in \\"A Mills Revival?\\". Mills argues that micro and macro levels of analysis can be linked together by the sociological imagination, which enables its possessor to understand the large historical sense in terms of its meaning for the inner life and the external career of a variety of individuals. Individuals can only understand their own experiences fully if they locate themselves within their period of history. The key factor is the combination of private problems with public issues: the combination of troubles that occur within the individual's immediate milieu and relations with other people with matters that have to do with institutions of an historical society as a whole. Mills shares with Marxist sociology and other \\"conflict theorists\\" the view that American society is sharply divided and systematically shaped by the relationship between the powerful and powerless. He also shares their concerns for alienation, the effects of social structure on the personality, and the manipulation of people by elites and the mass media. Mills combined such conventional Marxian concerns with careful attention to the dynamics of personal meaning and small-group motivations, topics for which Weberian scholars are more noted. Mills had a very combative outlook regarding and towards many parts of his life, the people in it, and his works. In that way, he was a self-proclaimed outsider: \\"I am an outlander, not only regionally, but deep down and for good.\\" C. Wright Mills gave considerable study to the Soviet Union. Invited there, where he was acknowledged for his criticism of American society, Mills used the opportunity to attack Soviet censorship. He did hold the controversial notion that the US and the Soviet Union were ruled by similar bureaucratic power elites and thus were convergent rather than divergent societies. Above all, Mills understood sociology, when properly approached, as an inherently political endeavor and a servant of the democratic process. In The Sociological Imagination, Mills wrote: Contemporary American scholar Cornel West argued in his text American Evasion of Philosophy that Mills follows the tradition of pragmatism. Mills shared Dewey's goal of a \\"creative democracy\\" and emphasis on the importance of political practice but criticized Dewey for his inattention to the rigidity of power structure in the US. Mills's dissertation was titled Sociology and Pragmatism: The Higher Learning in America, and West categorized him along with pragmatists in his time Sidney Hook and Reinhold Niebuhr as thinkers during pragmatism's \\"mid-century crisis.\\"  See also  * Elite theory * Military‚Äìindustrial complex  Notes  References = Footnotes  Bibliography  : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : :  Further reading  : : : : : : : : : : : Milliband, Ralph. \\"C.

In humans, sebaceous glands occur in the greatest number on the face and scalp, but also on all parts of the skin except the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. In the eyelids, meibomian glands, also called tarsal glands, are a type of sebaceous gland that secrete a special type of sebum into tears. Surrounding the female nipple, areolar glands are specialized sebaceous glands for lubricating the nipple. Fordyce spots are benign, visible, sebaceous glands found usually on the lips, gums and inner cheeks, and genitals. Several related medical conditions involve sebum‚Äîincluding acne, hyperplasia, and sebaceous adenoma. These are usually attributable to overactive sebaceous glands, which produce excess sebum. Structure=Location Sebaceous glands are found throughout all areas of the skin, except the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. There are two types of sebaceous gland, those connected to hair follicles and those that exist independently. Sebaceous glands are found in hair-covered areas, where they are connected to hair follicles. One or more glands may surround each hair follicle, and the glands themselves are surrounded by arrector pili muscles, forming a pilosebaceous unit. The glands have an acinar structure (like a many-lobed berry), in which multiple glands branch off a central duct. The glands deposit sebum on the hairs and bring it to the skin surface along the hair shaft. The structure, consisting of hair, hair follicle, arrector pili muscles, and sebaceous gland, is an epidermal invagination known as a pilosebaceous unit. Sebaceous glands are also found in hairless areas (glabrous skin) of the eyelids, nose, penis, labia minora, the inner mucosal membrane of the cheek, and nipples. Some sebaceous glands have unique names. Sebaceous glands on the lip and mucosa of the cheek, and on the genitalia, are known as Fordyce spots, and glands on the eyelids are known as meibomian glands. Sebaceous glands of the breast are also known as Montgomery's glands. Development Sebaceous glands are first visible from the 13th to the 16th week of fetal development, as bulgings off hair follicles. Sebaceous glands develop from the same tissue that gives rise to the epidermis of the skin. Overexpression of the signalling factors Wnt, Myc and SHH all increase the likelihood of sebaceous gland presence. The sebaceous glands of a human fetus secrete a substance called vernix caseosa, a waxy, translucent white substance coating the skin of newborns. After birth, activity of the glands decreases until there is almost no activity during ages 2‚Äì6 years, and then increases to a peak of activity during puberty, due to heightened levels of androgens.

File:407 Sebaceous Glands.jpg Function Relative to keratinocytes that make up the hair follicle, sebaceous glands are composed of huge cells with many large vesicles that contain the sebum. These cells express Na+ and Cl‚àí ion channels, ENaC and CFTR (see Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 in reference). Sebaceous glands secrete the oily, waxy substance called sebum () that is made of triglycerides, wax esters, squalene, and metabolites of fat- producing cells. Sebum lubricates the skin and hair of mammals.Dellmann's textbook of veterinary histology (405 pages), Jo Ann Coers Eurell, Brian L. Frappier, 2006, p.29, weblink: Books-Google-RTOC. Sebaceous secretions in conjunction with apocrine glands also play an important thermoregulatory role. In hot conditions, the secretions emulsify the sweat produced by the eccrine glands and this produces a sheet of sweat that is not readily lost in drops of sweat. This is of importance in delaying dehydration. In colder conditions, the nature of sebum becomes more lipid, and in coating the hair and skin, rain is effectively repelled. Sebum is produced in a holocrine process, in which cells within the sebaceous gland rupture and disintegrate as they release the sebum and the cell remnants are secreted together with the sebum.Victor Eroschenko, diFiore's Atlas of Histology with functional correlations, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, 10th edition, 2005. p. 41 The cells are constantly replaced by mitosis at the base of the duct. Sebum Sebum, secreted by the sebaceous gland in humans, is primarily composed of triglycerides (‚âà41%), wax esters (‚âà26%), squalene (‚âà12%), and free fatty acids (‚âà16%). The composition of sebum varies across species. Wax esters and squalene are unique to sebum and not produced as final products anywhere else in the body. Sapienic acid is a sebum fatty acid that is unique to humans, and is implicated in the development of acne. Sebum is odorless, but its breakdown by bacteria can produce strong odors. Sex steroids are known to affect the rate of sebum secretion; androgens such as testosterone have been shown to stimulate secretion, and estrogens have been shown to inhibit secretion. Dihydrotestosterone acts as the primary androgen in the prostate and in hair follicles. Immune function and nutrition Sebaceous glands are part of the body's integumentary system and serve to protect the body against microorganisms. Sebaceous glands secrete acids that form the acid mantle. This is a thin, slightly acidic film on the surface of the skin that acts as a barrier to microbes that might penetrate the skin. The pH of the skin is between 4.5 and 6.2, an acidity that helps to neutralize the alkaline nature of contaminants. Sebaceous lipids help maintain the integrity of the skin barrier and supply vitamin E to the skin. Unique sebaceous glands During the last three months of fetal development, the sebaceous glands of the fetus produce vernix caseosa, a waxy white substance that coats the skin to protect it from amniotic fluid. The areolar glands are in the areola that surrounds the nipple in the female breast. These glands secrete an oily fluid that lubricates the nipple, and also secrete volatile compounds that are thought to serve as an olfactory stimulus for the newborn. During pregnancy and lactation these glands, also called Montgomery's glands, become enlarged. Meibomian glands, in the eyelids, secrete a form of sebum called meibum onto the eye, that slows the evaporation of tears. It also serves to create an airtight seal when the eyes are closed, and its lipid quality also prevents the eyelids from sticking together. The meibomian glands are also known as tarsal glands, Zeis glands and palpebral glands. They attach directly to the follicles of the eyelashes, which are arranged vertically within the tarsal plates of the eyelids. Fordyce spots, or Fordyce granules, are ectopic sebaceous glands found on the genitals and oral mucosa. They show themselves as yellowish-white milia (milk spots). Earwax is partly composed of sebum produced by glands in the ear canal. These secretions are viscous and have a high lipid content, which provides good lubrication. Clinical significance Conditions of sebaceous glands. Sebaceous glands are involved in skin problems such as acne and keratosis pilaris. In the skin pores, sebum and keratin can create a hyperkeratotic plug called a comedo. Acne Acne is a very common problem, particularly during puberty in teenagers, and is thought to relate to an increased production of sebum due to hormonal factors. The increased production of sebum can lead to a blockage of the sebaceous gland duct. This can cause a comedo, (commonly called a blackhead or a whitehead), which can lead to infection, particularly by the bacteria Cutibacterium acnes. This can inflame the comedones, which then change into the characteristic acne lesions. Comedones generally occur on the areas with more sebaceous glands, particularly the face, shoulders, upper chest and back. Comedones may be \\"black\\" or \\"white\\" depending on whether the entire pilosebaceous unit, or just the sebaceous duct, is blocked. Sebaceous filaments‚Äîinnocuous build-ups of sebum‚Äîare often mistaken for whiteheads. There are many treatments available for acne from reducing sugars in the diet, to medications that include antibiotics, benzoyl peroxide, retinoids and hormonal treatments. Retinoids reduce the amount of sebum produced by the sebaceous glands. Should the usual treatments fail, the presence of the Demodex mite could be looked for as the possible cause. Other Other conditions that involve the sebaceous glands include: * Seborrhoea refers to overactive sebaceous glands, a cause of oily skin or hair. * Sebaceous hyperplasia, referring to excessive proliferation of the cells within the glands, and visible macroscopically as small papules on the skin, particularly on the forehead, nose and cheeks. * Seborrhoeic dermatitis, a chronic, usually mild form of dermatitis effected by changes in the sebaceous glands. In newborn infants seborrhoea dermatitis can occur as cradle cap. * Seborrheic-like psoriasis (also known as \\"Sebopsoriasis\\", and \\"Seborrhiasis\\") is a skin condition characterized by psoriasis with an overlapping seborrheic dermatitis. * Sebaceous adenoma, a benign slow-growing tumour‚Äîwhich may, however, in rare cases be a precursor to a cancer syndrome known as Muir‚ÄìTorre syndrome. * Sebaceous carcinoma, an uncommon and aggressive cutaneous tumour. * Sebaceous cyst is a term used to refer to both an epidermoid cyst and a pilar cyst, though neither of these contain sebum, only keratin and do not originate in the sebaceous gland and so are not true sebaceous cysts. A true sebaceous cyst is relatively rare and is known as a steatocystoma. * Nevus sebaceous, a hairless region or plaque on the scalp or skin, caused by an overgrowth of sebaceous glands. The condition is congenital and the plaque becomes thicker into adulthood. * Phymatous rosacea is a cutaneous condition characterized by an overgrowth of sebaceous glands. History The word sebaceous, meaning \\"consisting of sebum\\", was first termed in 1728 and comes from the Latin for tallow. Sebaceous glands have been documented since at least 1746 by Jean Astruc, who defined them as \\"...the glands which separate the fat.\\" He describes them in the oral cavity and on the head, eyelids, and ears, as \\"universally\\" acknowledged. Astruc describes them being blocked by \\"small animals\\" that are \\"implanted\\" in the excretory ducts and attributes their presence in the oral cavity to apthous ulcers, noting that \\"these glands naturally [secrete] a viscous humour, which puts on various colours and consistencies... in its natural state is very mild, balsamic, and intended to wet and lubricate the mouth\\". In The Principles of Physiology 1834, Andrew Combe noted that the glands were not present in the palms of the hands or soles of the feet. Other animals The preputial glands of mice and rats are large modified sebaceous glands that produce pheromones used for territorial marking. These and the scent glands in the flanks of hamsters have a similar composition to human sebaceous glands, are androgen responsive, and have been used as a basis for study. Some species of bat, including the Mexican free-tailed, have a specialized sebaceous gland occurring on the throat called a \\"gular gland\\". This gland is present more frequently in males than females, and it is hypothesized that the secretions of the gland are used for scent-marking.Heideman, P. D., Erickson, K. R., & Bowles, J. B. (1990). Notes on the breeding biology, gular gland and roost habits of Molossus sinaloae (Chiroptera, Molossidae). Zeitschrift f√ºr S√§ugetierkunde, 55(5), 303-307. Sebaceous adenitis is an autoimmune disease that affects sebaceous glands. It is mainly known to occur in dogs, particularly poodles and akitas, where it is thought to be generally autosomal recessively inherited. It has also been described in cats, and one report describes this condition in a rabbit. In these animals, it causes hair loss, though the nature and distribution of the hair loss differs greatly.

It has about 288,000 inhabitants. It lies from the border with Poland, at the meeting point of four rivers: Oder, Opava, Ostravice and Luƒçina. In terms of both population and area Ostrava is the third largest city in the Czech Republic, the second largest city in Moravia, and the largest city in Czech Silesia. It straddles the border of the two historic provinces of Moravia and Silesia. The wider conurbation ‚Äì which also includes the towns of Bohum√≠n, Doubrava, Hav√≠≈ôov, Karvin√°, Orlov√°, Pet≈ôvald and Rychvald ‚Äì is home to about 500,000 people, making it the largest urban area in the Czech Republic apart from the capital, Prague. Ostrava grew in importance due to its position at the heart of a major coalfield, becoming an important industrial centre. It was previously known as the country's \\"steel heart\\" thanks to its status as a coal-mining and metallurgical centre, but since the Velvet Revolution (the fall of communism in 1989) it has undergone radical and far-reaching changes to its economic base. Industries have been thoroughly restructured, and the last coal was mined in the city in 1994. However, remnants of the city's industrial past are visible in the Lower V√≠tkovice area, a former coal-mining, coke production and ironworks complex in the city centre which retains its historic industrial architecture. Lower V√≠tkovice has applied for inclusion in the UNESCO World Heritage List. Ostrava is home to various cultural facilities including theatres and galleries. Various cultural and sporting events take place in Ostrava throughout the year, including the Colours of Ostrava music festival, the Jan√°ƒçek May classical music festival, the Summer Shakespeare Festival and NATO Days. Ostrava is home to two public universities: the Technical University of Ostrava and the University of Ostrava. In 2014 Ostrava was a European City of Sport. The city co-hosted (with Prague) the Ice Hockey World Championships in 2004 and 2015. Symbols and logo=Coat of arms The city's coat of arms features a blue shield with a rearing silver horse standing on a green lawn. The horse wears a golden saddle and a red coverlet. At the top right of the shield there is a golden rose with green leaves and a red core. The horse in the coat-of-arms wears no bridle. The oldest known depiction of this coat-of-arms is on a seal dating from 1426. The first coloured version dates from 1728. The horse is often interpreted as a symbol of Ostrava's position on a major trade route, or as a figure taken from the coat-of-arms of Ostrava's first vogt (reeve), while the golden rose probably comes from the family coat-of-arms of the bishop of Olomouc Stanislav Thurzo. This explanation is supported by most modern literature. Another theory suggests that the Bishop granted Ostrava the right to use the horse in its coat-of-arms out of gratitude for the assistance that the town provided to the people of the Bishop's estate in Hukvaldy when the estate was being looted and pillaged. Apparently the help came so quickly that the pillagers did not have time to attach bridles to their horses before making their escape. There is also a legend which tells of a siege of Ostrava during which the besieged townspeople released unbridled horses to run in circles around the town. This is said to have confused the attacking armies so much that they fled. Marketing logo City logo In 2008, Ostrava's new marketing logo was unveiled. Designed by Studio Najbrt, the logo \\"OSTRAVA!!!\\" is used in public presentations of the city both in the Czech Republic and abroad. The three exclamation marks are meant to symbolise the dynamism, energy and self- confidence of Ostrava and its people. The light blue colour of the city's name is based on the heraldic tradition, while the exclamation marks are a contrasting darker blue. History The Church of St. Wenceslaus, one of the oldest and most important monuments of Ostrava The first written mention of Slezsk√° Ostrava (Silesian Ostrava) dates from 1229, when it was described as a settlement. The first mention of Moravian Ostrava (Moravsk√° Ostrava) in 1267 describes it as a township. Ostrava grew on the banks of the Ostr√° River (now the Ostravice) from which it took its name. The river still divides the city into two main parts: Moravian Ostrava (Moravsk√° Ostrava) and Silesian Ostrava (Slezsk√° Ostrava). The settlement occupied a strategic position on the border between the two historic provinces of Moravia and Silesia and on the ancient trade route from the Baltic Sea to the Adriatic Sea known as the Amber Road. Its location helped the town to grow and flourish. However, Ostrava began to decline in importance after the Thirty Years' War, and it was occupied by Swedish forces from 1621 to 1645. Marian Column (1702) at Masaryk square A turning point in Ostrava's history came in 1763 with the discovery of extensive deposits of high-quality bituminous coal on the Silesian bank of the Ostravice River. In 1828, the owner of the local estates, Rudolf Jan, the archbishop of Olomouc, established an ironworks, which was named after him as the Rudolfsh√ºtte. Later, the ironworks passed into the ownership of the Rothschild family and became known as the V√≠tkovice Ironworks. The company became the driving force behind Ostrava's industrial boom. By the second half of the 20th century, the city was nicknamed the country's \\"steel heart\\". After the World War II, the town's German-speaking population was expelled. At a massacre at an internment camp, 231 German-speaking citizens were killed.Ermittlungen in Ostrau eingestellt. Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (dpa), 26. November 2010. The liberation of Ostrava by the Red Army led to the city entering its greatest period of expansion. Initially, the new housing projects were on a relatively-small scale focusing on the Poruba district and featuring architecture in the Socialist realism style. Later, however, the authorities built larger-scale developments of prefabricated apartment blocks in Poruba and created a series of satellite estates to the south of the city (Ostrava-Jih). The city centre was gradually depopulated, and its people were moved out to the suburbs, as part of a long-term plan to destroy the city centre entirely and to turn the land over to coal-mining. Milo≈° S√Ωkora Bridge over the Ostravice River and Silesian Ostrava Town Hall The 1990s brought a rapid decline in the city's traditional industrial sectors: iron, steel, chemicals and coal-mining. The last coal was mined on 30 June 1994, which was accompanied by major investments to rectify ecological damage done by decades of heavy industry. The projects ultimately brought major improvements in the city's environment and quality of life. Ostrava became an important tourist centre that offered easy access to the nearby Hrub√Ω Jesen√≠k and Beskids Mountains. As well as hundreds of hectares of recultivated former mining land, the city also has numerous natural landscape features of interest, many of which are protected nature reserves. They include the Polansk√Ω Forest and the Polansk√° Meadows, both of which form part of the Pood≈ô√≠ (Oder Basin) protected nature reserve. A rare geological feature found in the city is the granite erratic boulders. Originally from Scandinavia, they were left behind after the last Ice Age, when the ice sheets retreated. Another feature is the Ema slag heap, an artificial hill made of mining waste (slag) that offers panoramic views. The waste is still burning deep beneath the surface, which gives the slag-heap its own microclimate. On 10 December 2019, a shooting at a hospital in Ostrava left eight people dead, including the perpetrator. Geography Ostrava is situated at the meeting point of four rivers: Oder, Opava, Ostravice and Luƒçina. Due to its location in a broad river basin known as the Moravian Gate, Ostrava is mostly low-lying, with a highest point of 280m above sea level), and has a Central European climate with typical flora and fauna. It differs from most neighbouring regions by the high concentration of industry, dense population and the geographical conditions of the Ostrava basin. Ostrava is 20.5 km across from north to south (Anto≈°ovice‚ÄìNov√° Bƒõl√°), and 20.1 km across from east to west (Bartovice‚ÄìKr√°sn√© Pole). The total length of the city's road network is . Climate The city has an oceanic (K√∂ppen: Cfb) or humid continental (Dfb) climate, according with the isoterm 0 ¬∞C/-3 ¬∞C, the second most common in the Europe (the average temperature in month most cold is -1 ¬∞C). The climate features hot, humid summers and relatively mild winters, with an average annual temperature of 10.2 ¬∞C (January: -1.2 ¬∞C, July: 23.5 ¬∞C) and average annual precipitation of 580 mm. Administrative divisions Administrative parts of Ostrava Cadastral Districts of Ostrava The city, with a total area of 214 km2, is divided into 23 administrative parts. On 14 September 1990, Ostrava's City Authority decided to divide the city into 22 districts, effective 24 November that year. On 1 January 1994, the district of Plesn√° separated from the Poruba district and become a separate local authority. Some of the local authorities are further subdivided into smaller units. Mayors The first mayor of Moravian Ostrava and the last person to hold the office before 1918, while the Czech lands were part of Austria- Hungary, was Hermann Zwierzina. One of the most influential mayors in the city's history was Jan Proke≈°, who was one of the main driving forces behind Ostrava's rapid expansion and helped to modernize its infrastructure. His achievements are commemorated in the name of the square outside the New City Hall ‚Äì Proke≈°ovo Square. The city's mayor during the Nazi occupation, Emil Beier, merged Moravian Ostrava and Silesian Ostrava to form a single administrative unit. Postwar mayors of the city include Zdenƒõk Kupka, Ev≈æen To≈°enovsk√Ω (who was elected mayor for three successive terms from 1993 to 2001 and went on to become the president of the Moravian-Silesian Region), and Petr Kajnar. The current mayor, elected on 6 November 2014, is Tom√°≈° Macura. Transport Leo≈° Jan√°ƒçek Airport Ostrava Ostrava is the transport and logistics hub of the north-eastern part of the Czech Republic. Air south of the city centre is an international airport, Leo≈° Jan√°ƒçek Airport Ostrava, which links the city with several European destinations (IATA code: OSR; ICAO code: LKMT). It is the first airport in the Czech Republic to have its own rail link. It handles scheduled flights several times a week to London and Warsaw. In the summer season there are also numerous charter flights, mainly to destinations in the Mediterranean region. Roads Railway station Ostrava-Svinov The road infrastructure of the region is centred on the D1 motorway, which runs from Prague via Brno and Ostrava into Poland. Ostrava is from Prague by motorway, from Brno, from the Polish city of Katowice, and from Vienna. Other major roads which pass through Ostrava are the Class I roads 11, 56, 58, and 59, as well as the E75 and E462 trans-European routes. Trams, trolleybuses and buses Ostrava trams in their traditional blue and white livery at the \\"Nov√° Ves vod√°rna\\" stop The city has a dense public transport network consisting of trams, buses and trolleybuses. The first trams, introduced in 1894, were powered by steam engines. The network was rapidly expanded, and in 1901 it was electrified. New tram lines were built mainly to the south and east of the city centre, where they would not have to cross the narrow-gauge railways linking Ostrava with Karvin√° and Bohum√≠n. In 1934 the railway line in V√≠tkovice (operated by the V√≠tkovice Ironworks company) was also electrified. In the late 1940s and early 1950s the various companies providing tram services in Ostrava were merged to create the Ostrava City Public Transport Corporation (). During the communist era new tram lines were built to link the central parts of the city with the new satellite estates (Poruba) and factories (Nov√° Hu≈•). After the Velvet Revolution in 1989 most tram-building projects were stopped, though a new section running along M√≠steck√° Road was opened in the late 1990s. Trolleybuses were introduced in 1952, as in other Czech towns and cities after the World War II. Initially there was one trolleybus route which encircled the city centre. The network was gradually expanded in the 1950s and 60s, replacing the narrow-gauge railways. A route to the Fifejdy housing estate was built in the late 1970s. The last expansion of the trolleybus network came in the mid-1990s, when a route was built out to the suburb of Koblov. 17 tram lines currently operate in Ostrava. There are 52 bus lines and 14 trolleybus lines. Rail Ostrava is also a major railway hub, sited on Railway Corridors II and III and serving as an important centre for cargo and passenger transport between the Czech Republic, Poland and Slovakia. The city's largest railway stations are the main station (Ostrava hl.n.) and Ostrava-Svinov. These stations are important railway junctions. The main line linking Ostrava with Olomouc, Pardubice and Prague is served by three railway companies: ƒåesk√© dr√°hy, RegioJet and LEO Express. Water There are plans to link the Oder River in Ostrava to the proposed canal connecting the Danube with the Oder and Elbe. Environment Ostrava's high concentration of heavy industry created various environmental problems in the city, particularly in relation to air quality. Measurements performed by the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute show that levels of atmospheric benzopyrene and dust particles are among the highest in the country. The Ostravice River Although Ostrava still has to contend with environmental issues, the situation has improved over time. In 2015 ArcelorMittal, then one of the biggest polluters in the region, implemented 13 major ecological investment projects worth CZK 3 billion. One new installation filters out 61 tonnes of dust per year. The City of Ostrava is also involved in a range of projects focusing on environmental improvements, including a web portal, www.zdravaova.cz, which enables citizens to monitor current air quality indicators, and a project funding short \\"health breaks\\" for children from high-risk areas. One of the most pressing environmental problems currently facing the city concerns the oil lagoons at the site of the former Ostramo chemical plant. In 1996 the Czech government took over the site and drew up plans for a cleanup. The state-owned company Diamo was created to implement these plans. The situation has been the subject of government-level discussions, and Finance Minister Andrej Babi≈° visited Ostrava in March 2015. The situation is currently under review by the Ministry of Finance, which is drawing up conceptual documentation and will then announce a public tender for the cleanup work. Air condition in Ostrava is currently very poor, with high concentrations of benzopyrene.http://portal.chmi.cz/files/portal/docs/uoco/isko/grafroc/16groc/gr16cz/png/oIV2-1.png The pollution is so serious that it has been described in folklore; local people refer to \\"ƒåern√° Ostrava\\" (Black Ostrava) and have several songs about it. Culture Inside the Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k Theatre Performing arts Ostrava has four permanent theatres: the National Moravian-Silesian Theatre (with two permanent venues, the Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k Theatre and the Ji≈ô√≠ Myron Theatre), the Petr Bezruƒç Theatre, the Ar√©na Chamber Theatre and the Ostrava Puppet Theatre ‚Äì which hosts the international Spectaculo Interesse festival every odd-numbered year and the Theatre Without Barriers festival every even- numbered year. Colours of Ostrava Ostrava is home to the Jan√°ƒçek Philharmonic Orchestra, and hosts a number of international annual or biennial classical music festivals, including Jan√°ƒçek May, the St Wenceslaus Music Festival and the Ostrava Days new music festival. Since 2002 Ostrava has been the venue for the annual multi-genre music festival Colours of Ostrava, which features an international line-up of artists and attracts crowds of tens of thousands. Other cultural events in Ostrava include the film and theatre festivals One World, Ostrava Camera Eye (), the International Outdoor Films Festival, and the Summer Shakespeare Festival (held on an outdoor stage at the Silesian Ostrava Castle). Folklore festivals include the Harmony () international festival of Advent and Christmas traditions and crafts, Folklore Without Borders, and the Irish Cultural Festival. Museums and galleries Ostrava Puppet Theatre Ostrava has several museums and galleries: * The Ostrava City Museum, a museum located in the 16th-century old city hall building on the main central square, housing permanent exhibitions on the city's history, landscape and people. * The Ostrava Science and Technology Centre, an interactive museum about the world of technology aimed at all ages, including simulators for driving a train, flying a plane, or working as a steelworker or an astronaut. The Science and Technology Centre comprises two parts: the Small World of Technology, and the Large World of Technology (14,000 m2), which is divided into four different \\"worlds\\" within one building. * The Toy Museum, a toy museum including examples from over 60 countries, including some toys from the mid-19th century. * The Railway Museum, featuring model trains, and a collection of original documents from the period of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. * The Brewery Museum, focused on the history and technology of brewing. * The Firefighting Museum, housed in an Art Nouveau (Secession) building in the P≈ô√≠voz district previously used as a fire station. The exhibition includes a video showing firefighting techniques. * Keltiƒçka's Forge Museum, a permanent exhibition of blacksmithing and coal-mining. The building used to be the home of a blacksmith named Keltiƒçka (commemorated in a small memorial outside the building). According to the local legend it was Keltiƒçka who first discovered Ostrava's coal deposits. The museum maps the early beginnings of Ostrava's coal mining industry, including a collection of miners' helmets and lamps from the 17th century and a range of other exhibits. * The Professor F. Po≈°epn√Ω Geology Pavilion, which includes over 15,000 exhibits of minerals, rocks and fossils. * The House of Art (), a gallery of fine art housed in a building from the early 20th century. * The PLATO (Ostrava City Gallery), an exhibition space with no permanent collections, which provides a space for exhibitions of contemporary Czech and international art. * The Zither Museum, a collection featuring examples of the musical instrument. * The Mining Museum at Landek Park, featuring a guided tour of the former Anselm coal mine with a guide who was a miner there, including a descent into a simulated mine tunnel. * The Mill Museum, a museum of mills and milling in the Ostrava region. * The Michal Colliery museum, a museum in a former coal mine presenting the city's history of mining. The guided tour leads along the same route taken by the miners when they started their shift, but it is not possible for visitors to the museum to go underground. The museum is a National Cultural Monument. * Ostrava Planet√°rium Sights New City Hall *Ostrava's New City Hall has the tallest tower of any city hall in the Czech Republic, with a viewing platform 73 metres above ground providing a panoramic view of the city. Masaryk Square Jir√°skovo square (Ku≈ô√≠ rynek) * Komensk√©ho Gardens is a park in the city centre named after the Renaissance- era Czech writer and educator John Amos Comenius, and the site of a statue honouring the Soviet soldiers who liberated Ostrava in 1945. * The Miniuni World of Miniatures, located at the ƒåern√° Louka exhibition grounds, features miniature versions of famous buildings from around the world, including the Pyramids, Eiffel Tower, and Big Ben. * The fairytale clock at Ostrava's Puppet Theatre features figurines which perform a show at two-hour intervals from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. The performance lasts two minutes. It depicts a battle between Kasper the clown and the Grim Reaper, and it also features four other characters ‚Äì an angel, a king, a queen, and a devil. * The Silesian Ostrava Castle, close to Masaryk Square, once stood on higher ground, but over time it has sunk by 16 metres due to mine tunnels collapsing underneath it. The castle is located at the confluence of the Luƒçina and Ostravice rivers. The castle is the venue for the summer Shakespeare festival, among other events. * Stodoln√≠ Street is the city's entertainment district, with more than 60 bars, clubs, restaurants and caf√©s. * Masaryk Square () is located in Ostrava's historical centre and has a plague column with a figure of the Virgin Mary (1702) and a Baroque statue of St Florian, the patron saint of firefighters. There is a series of commemorative paving stones that starts outside the Laso shopping mall, as well as the Sch√∂nhof building, known as \\"the house with seven doors\\", and the Reisz building designed by the Viennese architect Wunibald Deininger. * The Karolina Triple Hall () is an urban space located next to the Forum Nov√° Karolina shopping mall. These large historic buildings ‚Äì formerly part of the Karolina coking plant ‚Äì have been transformed by the architect Josef Pleskot into a new venue for sports, entertainment and culture. * Ostrava Zoo is the second largest zoo in the Czech Republic and home to more than 400 different species of animals. In 2014 a new safari park was built, and in 2015 the zoo opened a new pavilion illustrating the process of evolution. * Lower V√≠tkovice preserves a historic blast furnace and has a glass elevator to the newly built viewing platform at the top, with panoramic views of Ostrava and the surrounding countryside. There are guided tours describing V√≠tkovice's history. The blast furnace, the former power station, compressor hall and coal mine are open to the public. The former gas holder has been repurposed into a multi-functional hall called the Gong. * Ema slag-heap, on the right bank of the Ostravice, is an artificial hill created by piling up slag, or waste material from coal mines. Its top is above sea level. It has a subtropical micro-climate because the waste material is still burning deep beneath the surface. White smoke comes out of cracks in the ground. Snow never settles here, and flowers grow all year round. A yellow-marked hiking path leads to the top, from where there are panoramic views of the city. * The city has developed a mobile app called The Salomon Code, which helps users learn about Ostrava's history based around the story of Baron Rothschild. Architecture Much of Ostrava's architectural heritage is in the city centre, which is a protected heritage zone. The most notable structures in this historic core are theatres, banks, department stores and other public buildings dating from the turn of the 20th century, at the time of Ostrava's greatest boom. The central Masarykovo n√°mƒõst√≠ (Masaryk Square), named after the first President of Czechoslovakia Tom√°≈° Garrigue Masaryk, features the historic old city hall building and a Marian plague column from 1702. Nearby Smetanovo n√°mƒõst√≠ (Smetana Square) features the Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k Theatre and the Functionalist Knihcentrum bookstore. To the west are a series of grand, imposing bank buildings and the Elektra Palace on N√°dra≈æn√≠ Street, while to the north is the New City Hall with its landmark viewing tower, overlooking the large open space of Proke≈°ovo n√°mƒõst√≠. The city centre also has two notable religious buildings ‚Äì the 13th-century Church of St Wenceslaus and the Cathedral of the Divine Saviour, the second largest church in Moravia and Czech Silesia. Ostrava's central district contains works by architects including Karel Kotas, Josef Goƒç√°r, Ernst Korner and Alexander Graf. Poruba is a large district of Ostrava in the western part of the conurbation, noted for its distinctive 1950s Socialist realist architecture. Inspired by the grandiose buildings of Soviet cities, Poruba also incorporates historical pastiche features drawing on ancient, Renaissance and Classicist models. The main entrance to the part of Poruba built at this time is through a grand triumphal arch. The V√≠tkovice district was for several decades the centre of the local iron and steel industry. The influx of workers led the company to build housing for its employees, plus civic amenities, a town hall and a church. The historic parts of the district are built in the company's distinctive style featuring red-brick fa√ßades. Other districts of the city with a distinctive architectural heritage include P≈ô√≠voz (with its grand Secession buildings) and the Jubilee housing development () in Hrab≈Øvka, built as a workers' housing complex in the 1920s.

Its jurisdiction extends to the whole of the Moravian-Silesian Region. The District Court is based in a new building on U Soudu St. in the Municipal District of Poruba. Its jurisdiction covers the territory of the City of Ostrava. The district courts of Ostrava and Brno are the largest in the country in terms of the number of judges. In addition to these courts Ostrava is also home to regional and district Public Prosecutor's Offices, as well as a branch of the Olomouc-based Supreme Public Prosecutor's Office. Sport V√≠tkovice stadium Ostrava has several sports clubs in various sports, and has hosted many major national and international sports events. In 2014 the city was one of the European Cities of Sport. Ostrava is home to a number of top-level sports clubs, including FC Ban√≠k Ostrava (football), HC V√≠tkovice Steel (ice hockey), NH Ostrava (basketball), 1. SC V√≠tkovice and FBC Ostrava (floorball), Arrows Ostrava (baseball and softball), and VK Ostrava (volleyball). Sports venues in the city include athletics facilities, football pitches and stadiums, ice rinks and ice stadiums, multi-purpose sports halls, tennis courts, squash clubs, indoor and outdoor swimming pools, among others. The most important facilities are operated by the City-owned company SAREZA. The company's outdoor swimming pool in Ostrava-Poruba is the largest facility of its kind in Central Europe. Ostrava has opportune conditions for cycling, with its generally flat terrain and an extensive network of cycle routes. There are also several popular leisure and recreation areas in the region surrounding Ostrava; the Beskids and Jesen√≠ky Mountains (about and from Ostrava respectively) are popular with skiers in the winter season, and hikers, cyclists and anglers from spring to autumn. A special \\"cyclebus\\" shuttles between Ostrava and the Beskydy Mountains from May to September, enabling cyclists to transport their bikes on a special trailer. In the winter there is a similar service for skiers known as the \\"skibus\\". There are also several golf courses in the region, including the ≈†ilhe≈ôovice golf club in the grounds of the local ch√¢teau, and courses in ƒåeladn√°, Ropice and Ostravice. About from Ostrava is another golf course in Krava≈ôe. Ostrava has a long tradition of hosting top-level European and world championships. The Golden Spike international athletics meeting has been held in the city every year since 1961. In 2004 and 2015 Ostrava co-hosted (with Prague) the IIHF Ice Hockey World Championship at the Ostrava Ar√©na.

He was only thirteen years of age when he succeeded and of ill health. However, the loyalty of the nobility to his father's memory preserved the peace during his minority. He married Waldrada, daughter of the Lombard king Wacho and his step-aunt (a sister of his father's second wife). This marriage fortified the alliance between Austrasia and Lombardy. Nevertheless, Theudebald could not hold on to the conquests of his father in the north of Italia. The Byzantine Emperor Justinian I sent an army under the command of Narses in 552. The Franks who did not perish of want or plague in Apulia were defeated at Casilinum. Oman, Charles. The Dark Ages, 476-918, Rivingtons, 1908, p. 119 In 550, Theudebald convoked the Council of Toul.

When completed in June 1940, the ship was temporarily assigned to the Home Fleet before she began escorting convoys and conducting anti- submarine patrols. She was badly damaged during a German air raid on Liverpool in May 1941 and her repairs were not completed until the beginning of 1942. Hurricane was then assigned as the flotilla leader of Escort Group B1 assigned to the Mid-Ocean Escort Force, escorting convoys in the North Atlantic for the next two years. The ship was torpedoed by a German submarine on Christmas Eve 1943, and had to be scuttled the next day as she was unable to steam back to port.

For anti-aircraft (AA) defence, Hurricane had two quadruple Mark I mounts for the 0.5 inch Vickers Mark III machine gun. She was fitted with two above-water quadruple torpedo tube mounts for torpedoes. One depth charge rail and two throwers were originally fitted, but this was increased to three sets of rails and eight throwers while fitting-out. The ship's load of depth charges was increased from 20 to 110 as well.English, p. 141Friedman, p. 226 She was fitted with an ASDIC set to detect submarines by reflections from sound waves beamed into the water.Brown, p. 164 Wartime modifications Little data on Hurricanes modifications during the war has survived, although it is known that she had her rear torpedo tubes replaced by a 12-pounder AA gun by October 1940.Friedman, p. 241 The ship's short-range AA armament may have been augmented by two Oerlikon 20 mm guns on the wings of the ship's bridge and the .50-calibre machine gun mounts may have also been replaced by a pair of Oerlikons. The ship's director-control tower and rangefinder above the bridge may have been removed in exchange for a Type 271 target indication radar. A Type 286 short-range surface search radar was probably also fitted midway through the war. The ship probably also received a HF/DF radio direction finder mounted on a pole mainmast. It is not known at what point the dazzle camouflage paint scheme was applied. Service Japura was ordered by Brazil on 6 December 1937 from Vickers-Armstrongs, Barrow-in-Furness. The ship was laid down on 3 June 1938 and she was purchased by the British on 5 September 1939 after the beginning of World War II. Renamed HMS Hurricane, the ship was launched on 29 September and commissioned on 21 June 1940.English, p. 127 She was assigned to the 9th Destroyer Flotilla of the Home Fleet upon commissioning until new construction replaced the losses suffered over the previous few months.

She was struck by a bomb that passed through the hull and detonated underneath her. The explosion blew a large hole in her bottom and flooded her engine room and oil tanks. The ship's structure was badly damaged enough that her stern began to sag downwards and Hurricane was moved to Bidston Dock lest she sink and block traffic in the harbour. No one was killed in the attack, although a few crewmen received minor injuries. The ship was repaired and returned to service in January 1942 as flotilla leader of Escort Group B1 assigned to the Mid- Ocean Escort Force. Hurricane remained as the leader for the next two years.

During the Spanish Civil War of 1936‚Äì1939, the ship enforced the arms blockade imposed by Britain and France on both sides as part of the Mediterranean Fleet. During the first few months of World War II, Hyperion searched for German commerce raiders in the Atlantic Ocean and blockaded German merchant ships in neutral harbours until she returned to the British Isles in early 1940. The ship participated in the Norwegian Campaign before she was transferred back to the Mediterranean Fleet shortly afterwards. Hyperion participated in the Battle of Calabria and the Battle of Cape Spada in July 1940 while escorting the larger ships of the fleet.

On 5 April Hyperion escorted the battlecruiser as she covered the minelayers preparing to implement Operation Wilfred, an operation to lay mines in the Vestfjord to prevent the transport of Swedish iron ore from Narvik to Germany. The ship and her sister pretended to lay a minefield off Bud, Norway on 8 April and reported its location to the Norwegians.Haar 2009, pp. 65‚Äì66, 88‚Äì89 Hyperion escorted the aircraft carriers and from 21 April as their aircraft attacked German targets in Norway.

On 9 July she participated in the Battle of Calabria as an escort for the heavy ships of Force C and unsuccessfully engaged Italian destroyers and suffered no damage. During the Battle of Cape Spada on 19 July, the ship escorted Australian light cruiser and rescued some of the 525 survivors from the together with the other escorting destroyers. Together with her sister and two other destroyers, she bombarded Italian positions around Sidi Barrani on 25 September. Hyperion escorted the carrier during the Battle of Taranto on the night of 11/12 November.Rohwer, pp. 32‚Äì33, 41, 47 With Hereward, she sank the Italian submarine Naiade on 14 December 1940 near Bardia. Hyperion struck a mine on 22 December 1940 off Pantelleria as she escorted the battleship on passage from Alexandria to Gibraltar while covering a convoy to Malta. The destroyer attempted to tow Hyperion, but the tow cable broke twice and the destroyer was ordered to sink her after Ilex took off the crew. Only two members of the crew were not rescued and were presumed killed in the explosion.

His elder brother Gunthar died sometime before their father's death. He shared in the partition of the Frankish kingdom that followed his father‚Äôs death in 561, receiving the old kingdom of Childebert I, with its capital at Paris. Personal life Charibert married Ingoberga and they had four children: *Blithide of Cologne (538-603), possibly married to Ansbertus, Gallo-Roman senator * Chrodobertus (d. 595) * Bertha, who married √Üthelberht of Kent Charibert also had several concubines. By Merofleda, a wool carder's daughter, and her sister Marcovefa, he had daughters: Berteflede (a nun in Tours) and Clothilde (a nun in St. Croix, Poitiers). By Theodogilda (or Theudechild), a cowherd's daughter; Charibert had a son who died in infancy. Charibert married his daughter Bertha to √Üthelberht, the pagan King of Kent. She took Bishop Liudhard with her as her private confessor. Her influence in the Kentish court was instrumental in the success of St. Augustine of Canterbury's mission in 597, effecting the conversion to Christianity of the first Anglo-Saxon ruler. Military campaigns and enthronement In 556, Chlothar sent his sons Charibert and Gunthram (his youngest) against their stepmother, \\"Chunna,\\" and younger stepbrother, \\"Chramn,\\" who were in revolt. During ongoing negotiations, Chramn was hiding out on Black Mountain in the Limousin. When the negotiations failed, the two armies prepared for battle. However, a thunderstorm prevented any engagement, and Chramn (who was hiding out in Black Mountain) sent forged letters to his brothers (Charibert and Gunthram) in which he falsely reported the death of their father (Chlothar). Charibert and Guntram immediately returned to Burgundy to secure their positions. Partition of Chlothar's kingdom, 561; Charibert's realm in pink After the actual death of Chlothar in 561, the Frankish kingdom was divided between his sons in a new configuration (map, left). Each son ruled a distinct realm which was not necessarily geographically coherent but could contain two unconnected regions. Their kingdoms were named after the city from which they ruled. Charibert received Neustria (the region between the Somme and the Loire), Aquitaine, and Novempopulana with Paris as his capital. His other chief cities were Rouen, Tours, Poitiers, Limoges, Bordeaux, Toulouse, Cahors, and Albi. Guntram received Burgundy. Sigebert received Austrasia (including Rheims) with his capital at Metz, and the youngest brother Chilperic received a compact kingdom with Soissons as its capital. Death and legacy Though Charibert was eloquent and learned in the law, Gregory of Tours found him one of the most dissolute of the early Merovingians. He maintained four concurrent wives, two of them sisters,A bishops' council held in Pars under Charibert in 561 or 562 narrowly defined the consanguinities ruled to be incest. (Alexander C. Murray, ed. A Companion to Gregory of Tours p. 454). and this resulted in his excommunication by Germanus.Gregory, Hist. iv.26. This was the first ever excommunication of a Merovingian king. As a result, he was buried in disgrace at Blavia castellum, a stronghold in the Tractatus Armoricani. At his death, his brothers divided his realm between them, agreeing at first to hold Paris in common. His surviving queen (out of four), Theudechild, proposed a marriage with Guntram, though a council held at Paris in 557 had outlawed such matches as incestuous. Guntram decided to house her more safely, though unwillingly, in a nunnery at Arles. The main source for Charibert's life is Gregory of Tours' History of the Franks (Book IV, 3,16,22,26 and IX, 26), and from the English perspective Bede's Ecclesiastic History of the English People.

It was established by Act of Parliament in 1801, and opened partly in 1802 and partly in 1803. It was a toll railway on which carriers used horse traction. The chief goods transported were coal, building materials, lime, manure, corn and seeds. The first to Croydon opened on 26 July 1803, with a branch line off from Mitcham to Hackbridge. The Croydon, Merstham and Godstone Railway was built as an extension of the railway but by a separate company. It opened in 1805 and closed in 1838. The Surrey Iron Railway was commercially successful only briefly, until shortly after the opening of the canal between Croydon and London in 1809. It closed in 1846. Origins By the end of the eighteenth century, a number of short plateways, such as those to the Caldon Low quarries and the Little Eaton Gangway, had been built. Their purpose was to convey a mineral to a nearby canal for onward transport. The original plan for a transport connection between Wandsworth, on the River Thames, and the industries of the Wandle Valley had been a canal scheme, put forward in 1799, but doubts about the availability of water led to the adoption of a plateway. Contrary to popular belief, it was not the world's first railway authorised by Parliament independently of a canal: that was the Middleton Railway (1758). Nor was it the first public railway or the first railway company: both of those honours go to the Lake Lock Railway near Wakefield, Yorkshire. It received the Royal Assent on 21 May 1801, and work commenced immediately with William Jessop as engineer, George Leather as resident engineer, and joint contractor with Benjamin Outram. The line started at a wharf on the Thames at Wandsworth, and ascended gently through Tooting and Mitcham to Pitlake Mead in Croydon. There was a branch from near the site of the Mitcham Junction to oil-cake mills at Hackbridge, and a number of spurs to mills and works. The initial share capital was ¬£50,000 to which a further ¬£10,000 was added in 1805‚Äì1806. The final cost, including the dock at Wandsworth, was between ¬£54,700 and ¬£60,000. The main traffic was coal, building materials, lime, manure, corn and seeds. Horses were the motive power, and passengers were never contemplated. The railway was only briefly successful financially. It lost much traffic after the Croydon Canal opened in 1809, though the full effect was not felt until the canal acquired a rail link to the two railways in 1811. Later it suffered from the closure of the underground stone quarries at Merstham in the 1820s. It covered its costs, but was unable to update its technology or to keep the track in good repair. It closed on 31 August 1846. Operation Plaque and some of the original stone sleepers of the Surrey Iron Railway that were set in the wall of Young's Brewery in Wandsworth until the wall's demolition in December 2014 It was a public toll railway, providing a track for independent goods hauliers to use their own horses and wagons. The company did not operate its own trains. Sometimes it leased out the track and the dock, and sometimes it collected tolls and kept the line in repair itself. It was double-track plateway with a spacing of about five feet between the centres of the stone blocks. The gauge was recorded as ,Parliamentary Archives, 1846 Commons evidence, vol. 40, Surrey Iron Dissolving Railway Bill, 20 June, p. 81. the same as on the Croydon, Merstham and Godstone Railway. The rails were of the Outram pattern long, on the tread except for at the ends where they were thicker. Route Notice of tolls, 1804. The nine-mile route followed the shallow valley of the River Wandle, then heavily industrialised with numerous factories and mills, from the River Thames at Wandsworth southwards to Croydon, at what is now Reeves Corner. A short branch ran from Mitcham to Hackbridge and Carshalton. The railway was extended by a separate company as the Croydon, Merstham and Godstone Railway through Purley and Coulsdon to quarries near Merstham, opened in 1805 and closed in 1838. History The advent of faster and more powerful steam locomotives spelled the end for horse-drawn railways. In 1823, William James, a shareholder in the railway, tried to persuade George Stephenson to supply a locomotive. Stephenson realised that the cast-iron plateway could not support the weight of a locomotive and declined. In 1844 the proprietors sold the railway to the L&SWR;, which sold it to the London and Brighton Railway so that the L&BR; could use the trackbed to extend from Croydon to Earlsfield and then join the L&SWR; line into Nine Elms and eventually Waterloo. However, the sale did not proceed, and on 3 August 1846 the Surrey Iron Railway obtained an Act of Parliament authorising its closure, which took place on 31 August 1846. Part of the route was used for part of the West Croydon to Wimbledon Line, part of the LB&SCR; from 1856, and some of the route is in use by London Tramlink: routes 3 & 4 between Wandle Park & Waddon Marsh, and route 3 at Mitcham. Croydon, Merstham and Godstone Railway Before the railway was completed, it was proposed to extend it to Merstham and Godstone, and an Act for the purpose was obtained on 17 May 1803. The railway's directors were directors of the CM&GR;, supplemented by Colonel Hylton Joliffe and Rev William John Joliffe, who had land and mineral interests on its route. Work started quickly and it opened to Merstham on 24 July 1805 ‚Äì it never reached Godstone. In 1809 or 1811 a short branch was built at Pitlake to the south side of the Croydon Canal basin. The track gauge was .

Engraving c. 1715 Lord Lovat () is a title in the Peerage of Scotland. It was created in 1458 for Hugh Fraser. The holder is also the Chief of Clan Fraser of Lovat. The first Lord Lovat was one of the hostages for James I on his return to Scotland in 1424, and in 1431 he was appointed high sheriff of the county of Inverness. The second Lord Lovat, Thomas, held the office of justiciary of the north in the reign of James IV, and died 21 October 1524. The title descended in a direct line for nine sequential generations from 1458 until the death of the ninth Lord in 1696. He was succeeded by his great-uncle, the tenth Lord. In 1697 the latter's son, Simon Fraser, known as Simon \\"the Fox\\", kidnapped and forcibly married the late ninth Lord's widow, the former Lady Amelia Murray, only daughter of John Murray, 1st Marquess of Atholl. However, Lady Lovat's powerful family, the Murrays, were angered, and prosecuted Fraser, who fled the country. Fraser was convicted in absentia, attainted, and sentenced to death. In 1715, however, Fraser supported the Government against the Jacobite uprising and was rewarded by being pardoned for his crimes. In 1730, he won litigation seeking to confirm his title of Lord Lovat. In 1745, however, Lord Lovat participated in The '45 against the Crown and was therefore sentenced to death. He was beheaded on 9 April 1747, aged 80, on Tower Hill in London, becoming the last man to die in this manner. His titles, furthermore, were forfeit. (Fraser was also created Duke of Fraser, Marquess of Beaufort, Earl of Stratherrick and Upper Tarf, Viscount of the Aird and Strathglass and Lord Lovat and Beaulieu in the Jacobite Peerage of Scotland by James Francis Edward Stuart (titular King James III of England and VIII of Scotland) in 1740.) His eldest son and namesake Simon Fraser became a General in the British Army. He obtained a full pardon but was not restored to the title. His younger brother Archibald Campbell Fraser was a Colonel in the Army and would have succeeded but for the attainder. On his death in 1815 the title was claimed by his kinsman Thomas Fraser, a descendant of Thomas Fraser, second son of the fourth Lord. In 1837 he was created Baron Lovat, of Lovat in the County of Inverness, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. However, it was not until 1854 that the attainder of the eleventh Lord was reversed, and Thomas Fraser became the twelfth Lord Lovat. He was succeeded by his son, the thirteenth Lord, who served as Lord Lieutenant of Inverness. His eldest son, the fourteenth Baron, was a soldier and politician and notably held office as Under-Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs from 1926 to 1927. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the fifteenth Lord. He was a prominent soldier and distinguished himself during the Second World War. the titles are held by his grandson, the sixteenth Lord, who succeeded in 1994. The Conservative politician Sir Hugh Fraser was the younger son of the fourteenth Lord. Another member of the family was Sir Ian Fraser, Chairman of Rolls-Royce Motors. He was the son of Hon. Alastair Thomas Joseph Fraser, younger son of the thirteenth Lord. The family seats now are Beaufort Lodge and Balblair House, near Beauly, Inverness-shire. Clan Fraser The Lordship of Lovat has for some time been linked to the Chiefship of Clan Fraser. The former family seat was Beaufort Castle in northern Scotland. The numbering of the Scottish Lordship used by Clan Fraser differs from the legal numbering in that it ignores the attainder of 1747‚Äì1854, with the result that the 16th Lord is termed by them \\"18th Lord Lovat\\".

He did much to promote union through newspaper editorials. For his efforts, he received a Senate appointment. He later became a judge of the Nova Scotia Supreme Court. McCully was born at his family's farm in Cumberland County, Nova Scotia. He attended various local schools before going to work on the family farm. From 1828 to 1830, he taught school in order to fund his legal studies. One of his pupils was Sir Charles Tupper. He was called to the Nova Scotia bar in 1837, and set up his practice in Amherst. In 1842 he married Eliza Creed. A confirmed Liberal by 1837, he expressed his views in frequent contributions to the Acadian Recorder. In addition, he was a contributor to the Halifax Morning Chronicle, the major Liberal newspaper of the province of Nova Scotia. Although he took a marginal role at the conferences at Charlottetown and Qu√©bec City he was an important promoter of union to Nova Scotians through editorials in both the Morning Chronicle and the Unionist & Halifax Journal. After the passage of the union resolution in 1866 McCully eased this newspaper crusade. His support of Joseph Howe during the 1847 election earned him an appointment to the Legislative Council where he held various offices. When the Liberals were re-elected in 1860 he became solicitor general and railway commissioner. His policy of cost cutting over efficiency, and his lack of personal popularity, caused Joseph Howe to blame him for the 1863 Liberal election loss. Despite being the Liberal leader in the Legislative Council in 1864 Jonathan McCully's name was not on the initial list of delegates to the Charlottetown Conference. After one of the other delegates withdrew Charles Tupper picked McCully as a replacement. Although Jonathan McCully was not previously a strong supporter of union he was converted at the Charlottetown meeting. He was a delegate to the London Conference but made few contributions to the proceedings. For his support of Confederation, McCully was appointed to the Senate of Canada in 1867. He was soon overshadowed by his more prominent colleagues Charles Tupper, Adams George Archibald and eventually even Joseph Howe. He supported the \\"better terms\\" offered to Nova Scotia in 1869. He resigned the Senate of Canada when he was appointed puisne judge of the Nova Scotia Supreme Court in 1870. While his taste for efficiency was unpopular with lawyers, his personal popularity amongst Nova Scotians rose for the first time. He died at his home in Halifax, Nova Scotia on January 2, 1877 and was buried in that city at Camp Hill Cemetery. His Halifax residence was designated as a National Historic Site of Canada in 1975, due to its associations with McCully.

Originally developed for use in television studios or with outside broadcast trucks, they are now also used for music videos, direct-to-video movies, corporate and educational videos, wedding videos, among other uses. Since the 2000s, most professional video cameras are digital (instead of analog) professional video cameras. The distinction between professional video cameras and movie cameras became much smaller as HD digital video cameras with sensors the same size as 35mm movie cameras - plus dynamic range (exposure latitude) and color rendition approaching film quality - were introduced in the late 2010s. Nowadays, HDTV cameras designed for broadcast television, news, sports, events and other works such as reality TV are termed as professional video cameras. A digital movie camera is designed for movies or scripted television to record files that are then color corrected during post-production. The video signal from a professional video camera can be broadcast live, or is meant to be edited quickly with little or no color or exposure adjustments needed. History The earliest video cameras were mechanical flying-spot scanners which were in use in the 1920s and 1930s during the period of mechanical television. Improvements in video camera tubes in the 1930s ushered in the era of electronic television. Earlier, cameras were very large devices, almost always in two sections. The camera section held the lens and tube pre-amplifiers and other necessary electronics, and was connected to a large diameter multicore cable to the remainder of the camera electronics, usually mounted in a separate room in the studio, or a remote truck. The camera head could not generate a video picture signal on its own. The video signal was output to the studio for switching and transmission. By the fifties, electronic miniaturization had progressed to the point where some monochrome cameras could operate standalone and even be handheld. But the studio configuration remained, with the large cable bundle transmitting the signals back to the camera control unit (CCU). The CCU in turn was used to align and operate the camera's functions, such as exposure, system timing, video and black levels. This 1954 RCA TK-41C, shown here mounted on a dolly, weighed 310 lbs. The first color cameras (1950s in the US, early 1960s in Europe), notably the RCA TK-40/41 series, were much more complex with their three (and in some models four) pickup tubes, and their size and weight drastically increased. Handheld color cameras did not come into general use until the early 1970s - the first generation of cameras were split into a camera head unit (the body of the camera, containing the lens and pickup tubes, and held on the shoulder or a body brace in front of the operator) connected via a cable bundle to a backpack CCU. A 1973 Ikegami HL-33 ENG The Ikegami HL-33, the RCA TKP45 and the Thomson Microcam were portable two piece color cameras introduced in the early 1970s. For field work a separate VTR was still required to record the camera's video output. Typically this was either a portable 1\\" reel to reel VTR, or a portable 3/4\\" U-matic VCR. Typically, the two camera units would be carried by the camera operator, while a tape operator would carry the portable recorder. With the introduction of the RCA TK76 in 1976, camera operators were finally able to carry on their shoulders a one piece camera containing all the electronics to output a broadcast quality composite video signal. A separate videotape recording unit was still required. Electronic news-gathering (ENG) cameras replaced the 16mm film cameras for TV news production from the 1970s onwards because the cost of shooting on film was significantly more than shooting on a reusable tape. Portable video tape production also enabled much faster turnaround time for the quick completion of news stories, compared to the need to chemically process film before it could be shown or edited. However some news feature stories for weekly news magazine shows continued to use 16mm film cameras until the 1990s. At first all these cameras used tube-based sensors, but charge-coupled device (CCD) imagers came on the scene in the mid-80s, bringing numerous benefits. Early CCD cameras could not match the colour or resolution of their tube counterparts, but the benefits of CCD technology, such as introducing smaller and lightweight cameras, a better and more stable image (that was not prone to image burn in or lag) and no need for registration meant development on CCD imagers quickly took off and, once rivaling and offering a superior image to a tube sensor, began displacing tube-based cameras - the latter of which were all but disused by the early 1990s. Eventually, cameras with the recorder permanently mated to the camera head became the norm for ENG. In studio cameras, the camera electronics shrank, and CCD imagers replaced the pickup tubes. The thick multi-core cables connecting the camera head to the CCU were replaced in the late seventies with triax connections, a slender video cable that carried multiple video signals, intercom audio, and control circuits, and could be run for a mile or more. As the camera innards shrunk, the electronics no longer dictated the size of the enclosure, however the box shape remained, as it is necessary to hold the large studio lenses, teleprompters, electronic viewfinder (EVF), and other paraphernalia needed for studio and sports production. Electronic Field Production cameras were often mounted in studio configurations inside a mounting cage. This cage supported the additional studio accessories. In the late 1990s, as HDTV broadcasting commenced, HDTV cameras suitable for news and general purpose work were introduced. Though they delivered much better image quality, their overall operation was identical to their standard definition predecessors. New methods of recording for cameras were introduced to supplant video tape, tapeless cameras. Ikegami and Avid introduced EditCam in 1996, based on interchangeable hard drives. Panasonic introduced P2 cameras. These recorded a DVCPro signal on interchangeable flash memory media. Several other data storage device recording systems were introduced, notably XDCAM from Sony. Sony also introduced SxS (S-by-S), a flash memory standard compliant to the Sony and Sandisk-created ExpressCard standard. Eventually flash storage largely supplanted other forms of recording media. In 2000s, major manufacturers like Sony, Philips introduced the digital professional video cameras. These cameras used CCD sensors and recorded video digitally on flash storage. These were followed by digital HDTV cameras. As digital technology improved and also due to digital television transition, digital professional video cameras have become dominant in television studios, ENG, EFP and even in other areas since 2010s. CCD sensors were eventually replaced by CMOS sensors.

There is some commonality between the TK-11/TK-31 and the earlier TK-10/TK-30. * Ikegami introduced the first truly portable hand-held TV camera in 1962. * Philips' line of Norelco cameras were also very popular with models such as PC-60 (1965), PC-70 (1967) and PCP-90 (1968 Handheld). Major US broadcaster CBS was a notable early customer of the PC-60 and PC-70 units. Philips/BTS-Broadcast Television Systems Inc. later came out with an LDK line of camera, like its last high end tube camera the LDK 6 (1982). Philips invented the Plumbicon pick up video camera tube in 1965, that gave tube cameras a cleaner picture. BTS introduced its first handHeld Frame transfer CCD- Charge-coupled device-CCD camera the LDK90 in 1987. * Bosch Fernseh marketed a line of high end cameras (KCU, KCN, KCP, KCK) in the US ending with the tube camera KCK-40 (1978). Image Transform (in Universal City, California) used specially modified 24 frame KCK-40 for their \\"Image Vision\\" system. This had a 10 MHz bandwidth twice NTSC resolution. This was a custom pre HDTV video System. At its peak this system was used to make \\"Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl\\" in 1982. This was the first major high-definition analog wideband videotape-to-film post production using a film recorder for film out. * In the 2000s, major manufacturers like Sony, Philips introduced the flash storage based digital television cameras. Since the 2010s, these digital cameras have become most widely used of all other systems.  Usage types  Most professional cameras utilize an optical prism block directly behind the lens. This prism block (a trichroic assembly comprising two dichroic prisms) separates the image into the three primary colors, red, green, and blue, directing each color into a separate charge- coupled device (CCD) or Active pixel sensor (CMOS image sensor) mounted to the face of each prism. Some high-end consumer cameras also do this, producing a higher-resolution image, with better color fidelity than is normally possible with just a single video pickup. In both single sensor and triple sensor designs, the weak signal created by the sensors is amplified before being encoded into analog signals for use by the viewfinder and also encoded into digital signals for transmission and recording. The analog outputs were normally in the form of either a composite video signal, which combined the color and luminance information to a single output; or an R-Y B-Y Y component video output through three separate connectors. Studio cameras Studio camera with teleprompter Most television studio cameras stand on the floor, usually with pneumatic or hydraulic mechanisms called pedestals to adjust the height and position in the studio. The cameras in a multiple-camera setup are controlled by a device known as a camera control unit (CCU), to which they are connected via a triax, fibre optic or the almost obsolete multicore cable. The CCU, along with genlock and other equipment, is installed in the central apparatus room (CAR) of the television studio. A remote control panel in the production control room (PCR) for each camera is then used by the vision engineer(s) to balance the pictures. When used outside a formal television studio in outside broadcasting (OB), they are often on tripods that may or may not have wheels (depending on the model of the tripod). Initial models used analog technology, but are now obsolete, supplanted by digital models. Studio cameras are light and small enough to be taken off the pedestal and the lens changed to a smaller size to be used handheld on a camera operator's shoulder, but they still have no recorder of their own and are cable-bound. Cameras can also be mounted on a tripod, a dolly or a crane, thus making the cameras much more versatile than previous generations of studio cameras. These cameras have a tally light, a small signal-lamp used that indicates, for the benefit of those being filmed as well as the camera operator, that the camera is 'live' ‚Äì i.e. its signal is being used for the 'main program' at that moment. ENG cameras Sony camera head with Betacam SP dock recorder ENG (electronic news gathering) video cameras were originally designed for use by news camera operators. While they have some similarities to the smaller consumer camcorder, they differ in several regards: * ENG cameras are larger and heavier (helps dampen small movements), and usually supported by a camera shoulder support or shoulder stock on the camera operator's shoulder, taking the weight off the hand, which is freed to operate the zoom lens control. * The camera mounts on tripods with Fluid heads and other supports with a quick release plate. * 3 CCDs or CMOS active pixel sensors are used, one for each of the primary colors * They have interchangeable lenses. * The lens is focused manually and directly, without intermediate servo controls. However the lens zoom and focus can be operated with remote controls with a television studio configuration operated by a camera control unit (CCU). * A rotating behind- the-lens filter wheel, for selecting an 85A and neutral density filters. * Controls that need quick access are on hard physical switches, all in the same general place on the camera, irrespective of the camera manufacturer, such as Gain Select, White/Black balance, color bar select, and record start controls and not in menu selection. * All settings, white balance, focus, and iris can be manually adjusted, and automatics can be completely disabled. * Professional BNC connectors for video out and genlock in. * Can operate an electronic viewfinder (EVF) or external CRT viewfinder. * At least two XLR input connectors for audio are included. * Direct slot-in for portable wireless microphones. * Audio is adjusted manually, with easily accessed physical knobs. * A complete time code section is available, allowing time presets; multiple-camera setups can be time code-synchronized or jam synced to a master clock. * \\"Bars and tone\\" are available in-camera (the SMPTE color bars (Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers) Bars, a reference signal that simplifies calibration of monitors and setting levels when duplicating and transmitting the picture. ) * Recording is to a professional medium like some variant of Betacam or DVCPRO or Direct to disk recording or flash memory. If as in the latter two, it's a data recording, much higher data rates (or less video compression) are used than in consumer devices. EFP cameras EFP camera operator at a baseball game Electronic field production cameras are similar to studio cameras in that they are used primarily in multiple camera switched configurations, but outside the studio environment, for concerts, sports and live news coverage of special events. These versatile cameras can be carried on the shoulder, or mounted on camera pedestals and cranes, with the large, very long focal length zoom lenses made for studio camera mounting. These cameras have no recording ability on their own, and transmit their signals back to the broadcast truck through a fiber optic, triax, radio frequency or the virtually obsolete multicore cable. Others cable car for mobility Remote cameras are typically very small camera heads designed to be operated by remote control. Despite their small size, they are often capable of performance close to that of the larger ENG and EFP types. Block cameras are so called because the camera head is a small block, often smaller than the lens itself. Some block cameras are completely self- contained, while others only contain the sensor block and its pre-amps, thus requiring connection to a separate camera control unit in order to operate. All the functions of the camera can be controlled from a distance, and often there is a facility for controlling the lens focus and zoom as well. These cameras are mounted on pan and tilt heads, and may be placed in a stationary position, such as atop a pole or tower, in a corner of a broadcast booth, or behind a basketball hoop. They can also be placed on robotic dollies, at the end of camera booms and cranes, or \\"flown\\" in a cable supported harness, as shown in the illustration. Lipstick cameras are so called because the lens and sensor block combined are similar in size and appearance to a lipstick container. These are either hard mounted in a small location, such as a race car, or on the end of a boom pole. The sensor block and lens are separated from the rest of the camera electronics by a long thin multi conductor cable. The camera settings are manipulated from this box, while the lens settings are normally set when the camera is mounted in place.

Prior to that, he served as Speaker of the Tennessee House of Representatives from 1973 to 1987, the longest tenure as Speaker up to that time.Billy Stair, The Life and Career of Ned McWherter (State Public Affairs Office, 2011). Early life McWherter was born in Palmersville, Weakley County, Tennessee, the son of Harmon Ray McWherter, a sharecropper, and Lucille (Smith) McWherter. He grew up in the Little Zion community near Palmersville, where he attended a one-room schoolhouse. In the early 1940s, his family moved to Ypsilanti, Michigan, where his father worked in wartime factories. In May 1945, the family moved to Dresden, Tennessee, where McWherter's parents purchased the City Cafe, which they would operate for several years. McWherter attended Dresden High School, where he was co-captain of the football team and president of the school's Future Farmers of America chapter. After graduating, he attempted to play college football, first at the University of Tennessee at Martin, and then at the University of Memphis, and finally at Murray State, but he suffered a knee injury prior to each season at all three schools. His college athletic career cut short, McWherter joined the Martin Shoe Company as a salesman. When the company's line of sandals struggled against competition from cheaper Japanese imports, McWherter travelled throughout the Caribbean and Central America in an attempt to find retailers, eventually finding a market for the sandals in Puerto Rico. In 1964, McWherter founded Volunteer Distributing to distribute Anheuser-Busch beer in the Weakley area. Two years later, he opened Dresden's first nursing home. McWherter served for 21 years (1947-1968) in the Tennessee National Guard before retiring with the rank of captain. He was a member of the United Methodist Church.Tennessee Governor Ned Ray McWherter, National Governors' Association website Tennessee House of Representatives McWherter became actively involved in politics in the late 1950s, when he worked for the successful campaign of 8th district congressional candidate, Robert \\"Fats\\" Everett. In 1968, Doug Murphy, the Mayor of Martin, convinced him to run for Weakley County's seat in the Tennessee House of Representatives. McWherter won the seat without opposition. He was reelected to the seat eight times, usually running unopposed. McWherter entered the House of Representatives at a turbulent time in state politics. During his first term, Republicans controlled the House for the first time in several decades. During his second (1971-1973), Democrats regained control of the House, but a Republican governor, Winfield Dunn, had been elected. To counter Dunn, Democrats chose fiery Nashville attorney James McKinney as Speaker of the House. McKinney vehemently opposed Dunn's initiatives and refused to consider most of his legislation. At the beginning of McWherter's third term (1973-1975), Democratic legislators, who controlled the House by a slim 50-49 margin, were concerned that McKinney's stubbornness was preventing the state from conducting its affairs, and several suggested replacing McKinney with McWherter. In the House Democratic Caucus, McWherter was chosen over McKinney as the party's choice for Speaker by a single vote. Sensing disunity among Democrats, Governor Dunn tried to convince disgruntled McKinney supporters to vote for a Republican in the full House vote, but was unsuccessful, and McWherter was elected Speaker by a 50-49 margin. One of McWherter's first major issues as Speaker was a 1974 bill that sought to establish a medical school at East Tennessee State University in Johnson City. The bill was popular in East Tennessee, parts of which were struggling with a low doctors- per-capita ratio. Governor Dunn, however, vetoed the bill, arguing the medical school in Memphis was adequate for the state's needs. This sparked cries of favoritism from East Tennesseans (Dunn was from Memphis). After the state senate voted to override the veto, McWherter, brushing off a threat from former Memphis mayor Henry Loeb, led the House in overriding the veto, allowing the bill to become law. When Dunn ran for another term as governor in 1986, his lack of support for the medical school in Johnson City came back to haunt him. Despite an overwhelming Republican base in the eastern part of the state, McWherter was able to gain the support of Republican Congressman James H. Quillen to pick up a majority of votes in the state's First Congressional District. In 1976, McWherter supported Democratic presidential candidate Jimmy Carter. At a Carter campaign event in Memphis, McWherter expressed irritation with an ABC cameraman, prompting reporter Sam Donaldson to tell the cameraman, \\"don't mind him, he's a nobody.\\" Years later, when President Ronald Reagan was scheduled to appear before the Tennessee General Assembly, McWherter removed Donaldson's name from the media credentials list. When Donaldson showed up at the state capitol, he was denied admission by the House sergeant-at-arms. After issuing a string of profanities, Donaldson stormed out of the building and returned to Washington. In January 1979, outgoing Governor Ray Blanton issued pardons to over 50 state inmates, including several convicted murderers. His administration had been under investigation for selling pardons, and the FBI and state lawmakers feared more illicit pardons would be issued in his final days in office. To prevent this, McWherter and Lieutenant Governor John S. Wilder engineered a constitutional maneuver that allowed the governor-elect, Lamar Alexander, to be sworn in three days early. During the 1980s, McWherter worked with the Alexander administration on a number of issues, including foreign investment and education. McWherter's support was critical in helping Alexander obtain passage of the \\"Career Ladder\\" bill, which provided income supplements to the state's top teachers. Governor Governor McWherter speaking at a ceremony, December 1988 As the 1986 governor's race approached, Democrats struggled to find a candidate. Neither Bob Clement nor Anna Belle Clement O'Brien was interested in running, and the 1978 nominee, Jake Butcher, was facing bank fraud charges. Sensing an opportunity, McWherter entered the race, and defeated Public Service Commissioner Jane Eskind and Nashville mayor Richard Fulton for the nomination, winning 42% of the vote to 29% for Eskind, and 26% for Fulton. With Alexander term-limited, Republicans nominated former Governor Winfield Dunn. Dunn's campaign tried to portray McWherter as a West Tennessee beer salesman, though McWherter pointed out that Dunn was a co-owner of a hotel in Nashville that sold liquor, and noted that Pilot, a convenience store chain owned by Dunn's campaign treasurer, Jim Haslam, was one of the state's largest beer retailers. Dunn also failed to pick up a critical endorsement from East Tennessee congressman Jimmy Quillen, who was still bitter over Dunn's veto of the ETSU medical school bill. McWherter ran a strong statewide campaign, visiting and organizing in all 95 counties. On election day, he defeated Dunn, 656,602 votes to 553,449.Phillip Langsdon, Tennessee: A Political History (Franklin, Tenn.: Hillsboro Press, 2000), pp. 397-400. During his first term, McWherter insisted that all formal governmental proceedings be open to the public and press, thus implementing the spirit, as well as the letter, of the \\"sunshine law\\" he had helped to author and sponsor while a member of the House. His \\"21st century Schools\\" education reform program launched similar programs in other states and his replacement of the Medicaid program with the TennCare system gained national attention.Carroll Van West, \\"Ned Ray McWherter,\\" Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture, 2009. Retrieved: 8 January 2013. As governor, he also served nationally and locally on various councils and committees, including the board of governors, Council of State Governments, the Executive Committees of the Southern Conference, the Weakley County Head Start Program, and the Executive Committee of the Northwest Tennessee Economic Development District. In the late 1980s, a showdown erupted between Tennessee and North Carolina over the pollution of the Pigeon River, which rises in North Carolina and traverses a mountainous area before emptying into the French Broad River in East Tennessee. East Tennessee residents and environmentalists charged that toxins dumped into the river by the Champion Paper Mill in Canton, North Carolina, damaged the river's economic potential and had led to an unusually high rate of cancer in lower Pigeon Valley communities. Canton residents argued that the town was economically dependent on the mill, which employed 2,000 workers.Nancy Herndon, \\"Upstream Battle Over Polluted River: Job Layoffs at Issue in Cleanup of Pigeon River Along North Carolina-Tennessee Border,\\" Christian Science Monitor, 22 March 1989. Retrieved: 8 January 2013. When the Environmental Protection Agency ordered Champion to upgrade the plant to meet Tennessee's water quality standards, the company threatened to close the plant and lay off all 2,000 workers. East Tennessee residents held demonstrations, and asked that Governor McWherter not renew the plant's water quality variance. Legislators from both states traded barbs, cars with Tennessee license plates were vandalized in North Carolina, and McWherter's office was flooded with calls from angry North Carolina residents. Following an unscheduled trip to Canton, where he was confronted by a sheriff who told him he was \\"trespassing on Champion's River,\\" McWherter announced on Christmas Day, 1988, that he would not renew the plant's water quality variance. McWherter was overwhelmingly re-elected to a second term in 1990, defeating the Republican nominee, first-term state representative Dwight Henry, 479,990 votes to 288,904. A tax study commission appointed during his first term reported at the beginning of his second, recommending a state income tax be implemented. An income tax has long been considered the third rail of Tennessee politics. McWherter gave the idea lukewarm support at first, but the idea was eventually dropped entirely, not to resurface again during his time as governor. In 1990, McWherter was invited to speak at a chapel service at Freed-Hardeman University in Henderson, Tennessee at the request of his lifelong friend, E. Claude Gardner, then President of the University. In 1992, Senator Al Gore was elected Vice President, thus creating a vacancy in the Senate. McWherter appointed his deputy governor, Harlan Matthews, to serve as U.S. Senator until the 1994 election. In 1994, McWherter was named the nation's most outstanding governor by Governing magazine.Richard Locker, \\"Former Tennessee Governor Ned McWherter Dies at age 80,\\" Memphis Commercial Appeal, 4 April 2011. Retrieved: 9 January 2012. Post-Governorship McWherter in 2010 McWherter would have been an overwhelming favorite for a third term if he had been permitted to run for one by the state constitution; when asked about this, he stated that he would not have run for another term even if it had been permissible. Following the end of his second term as governor in 1995, McWherter was appointed to the Board of Governors of the United States Postal Service by President Bill Clinton. McWherter lived the remainder of his life in Tennessee, where he was very active in the Tennessee Democratic Party. In the 2010 gubernatorial race, McWherter's son, Mike, ran against Knoxville mayor Bill Haslam. The 79-year-old McWherter helped his son campaign, and bought a red sports car to ride in campaign parades. Haslam won the election by a landslide.Jeff Woods, \\"Former Governor Ned McWherter Dead at age 80,\\" Nashville City Paper, 4 April 2011. Retrieved: 8 January 2013. McWherter died on April 4, 2011, at Centennial Medical Center in Nashville, where he was being treated for cancer. Former President Clinton delivered remarks at McWherter's memorial service, and numerous other public figures issued statements of condolence. McWherter is buried in Sunset Cemetery in Dresden. Family and legacy McWherter married Bette Jean (Beck) McWherter in 1953. She died of cancer in 1973. His son Michael Ray McWherter is a businessman and former candidate for governor, and his daughter Linda Ramsey is a doctor of physical education at the University of Tennessee at Martin.\\"Family, Truman Day and How Surrogates Help Us ,\\" Traveling Tennessee: The Campaign Blog of Team McWherter, 2010.

AD 532 in Soissons ‚Äì 28 March AD 592 in Chalon-sur- Sa√¥ne)Guntchramn Fmg, also called Gontran, Gontram, Guntram, Gunthram, Gunthchramn, and Guntramnus, was the king of the Kingdom of Orl√©ans from AD 561 to AD 592. He was the third eldest and second eldest surviving son of Chlothar I and Ingunda. On his father's death in 561, he became king of a fourth of the Kingdom of the Franks, and made his capital at Orl√©ans.Ian Wood, The Merovingian Kingdoms 450‚Äì751 (Longman Group, 1994), 56. The name \\"Gontrand\\" denotes \\"War Raven\\". Personal life King Gontrand had something of that fraternal love which his brothers lacked; the preeminent chronicler of the period, St. Gregory of Tours, often called him \\"good king Gontrand\\", as noted in the quotation below from the former's Decem Libri Historiarum, in which St. Gregory discussed the fate of Gontrand's three marriages: > The good king Gontrand first took a concubine Veneranda, a slave belonging > to one of his people, by whom he had a son Gundobad. Later he married > Marcatrude, daughter of Magnar, and sent his son Gundobad to Orl√©ans. But > after she had a son Marcatrude was jealous, and proceeded to bring about > Gundobad's death. She sent poison, they say, and poisoned his drink. And > upon his death, by God's judgment she lost the son she had and incurred the > hate of the king, was dismissed by him, and died not long after. After her > he took Austerchild, also named Bobilla. He had by her two sons, of whom the > older was called Clothar and the younger Chlodomer.Medieval Sourcebook: > (St.) Gregory of Tours: History of the Franks (Decem Libri Historiarum) Gontrand had a period of intemperance. He was eventually overcome with remorse for the sins of his past life, and spent his remaining years repenting of them, both for himself and for his nation. In atonement, he fasted, prayed, wept, and offered himself to God. Throughout the balance of his prosperous reign he attempted to govern by Christian principles. According to St. Gregory of Tours, he was the protector of the oppressed, caregiver to the sick, and the tender parent to his subjects. He was generous with his wealth, especially in times of plague and famine. He strictly and justly enforced the law without respect to person, yet was ever ready to forgive offences against himself, including two attempted assassinations. Gontrand munificently built and endowed many churches and monasteries. St. Gregory related that the king performed many miracles both before and after his death, some of which St. Gregory claimed to have witnessed himself. Politics Later statue depicting Gontrand In 567, his elder brother Charibert I died and his lands of the Kingdom of Paris were divided between the surviving brothers: Gontrand, Sigebert I, and Chilperic I. They shared his realm, agreeing at first to hold Paris in common. Charibert's widow, Theudechild, proposed a marriage with Gontrand, the eldest remaining brother, though a council convened at Paris as late as 557 had forbidden such tradition as incestuous. Gontrand decided to house her more safely, though unwillingly, in a monastery in Arles. In 573, Gontrand was caught in a civil war with his brother Sigebert I of Austrasia, and in 575 summoned the aid of their brother Chilperic I of Soissons. He reversed his allegiance later, due to the character of Chilperic, if we may give him the benefit of the doubt in light of St. Gregory's commendation, and Chilperic retreated. He thereafter remained an ally of Sigebert, his wife, and his sons until his death. When Sigebert was assassinated later in 575, Chilperic invaded the kingdom, but Gontrand sent his general Mummolus, who was always Gontrand's greatest weapon, for he was the greatest general in Gaul at the time, to remove him. Mummolus defeated Chilperic's general Desiderius and the Neustrian's forces retreated from Austrasia. In 577, Chlothar and Clodomir, his two surviving children, died of dysentery and he adopted as his son and heir Childebert II, his nephew, Sigebert's son, whose kingdom he had saved two years prior. However, Childebert did not always prove faithful to his uncle. In 581, Chilperic took many of Gontrand's cities and in 583, he allied with Childebert and attacked Gontrand. This time Gontrand made peace with Chilperic and Childebert retreated. In 584, he returned Childebert's infidelity by invading his land and capturing Tours and Poitiers, but he had to leave to attend the Baptism of Chlothar II, his other nephew, who now ruled in Neustria. Supposed to take place on 4 July, the feast of St. Martin of Tours, in Orl√©ans, it did not and Gontrand turned to invade Septimania. Peace was soon made. St. King Gontrand and Childebert II, from the Grandes Chroniques de France. In 584 or 585, one Gundowald claimed to be an illegitimate son of Chlothar I and proclaimed himself king, taking some major cities in southern Gaul, including Poitiers and Toulouse, which belonged to Gontrand. Gontrand marched against him, calling him nothing more than a miller's son named Ballomer. Gundowald fled to Comminges and Gontrand's army proceeded to besiege the citadel. He could not capture it, but did not need to: Gundowald's followers gave him over and he was executed. In 587, Fredegund attempted to assassinate him, but failed. He went, on 28 November, to Trier to conclude a treaty with Childebert; Brunhilda, his sister-in-law, Sigebert's wife, whose ally he had always been; Chlodosind, Childebert's sister; Faileuba, Childebert's queen; Magneric, Bishop of Trier; and Ageric, Bishop of Verdun. This was called the Treaty of Andelot and it endured until Gontrand died. Also in 587, Gontrand compelled obedience from Waroch II, the Breton ruler of the Vannetais. He forced the renewal of the oath of 578 in writing and demanded 1,000 solidi in compensation for raiding the Nantais. In 588, the compensation was not yet paid, as Waroch promised it to both Gontrand and Chlothar II, who probably had suzerainty over Vannes. In 589 or 590, Gontrand sent an expedition against Waroch under Beppolem and Ebrachain, mutual enemies. Ebrachain was also enemy of Fredegund, who sent the Saxons of Bayeux to aid Waroch.Howorth, 310. Beppolem fought alone for three days before dying, at which point Waroch tried to flee to the Channel Islands, but Ebrachain destroyed his ships and forced him to accept a peace,Gregory, 10, 9. the renewal of the oath, and the surrender of a nephew as a hostage. This was all to no effect. The Bretons maintained their independent mindedness. In 589, Gontrand made a final advance on Septimania, to no avail. He fought against the barbarians who menaced the kingdom and quelled a rebellion of his niece Basina at a Poitevin monastery with the aid of many of his bishops in 590. Death and veneration He died at Chalon-sur-Sa√¥ne in 592, and his nephew Childebert II succeeded him.Ian Wood, The Merovingian Kingdoms 450‚Äì751, 91. He was buried in the Church of Saint Marcellus, which he had founded in Chalon. Almost immediately, his subjects proclaimed Gontrand a saint and the Catholic Church celebrates his feast day on 28 March. The Huguenots, who scattered his ashes in the 16th century, left only his skull untouched in their fury. It is now kept there in a silver case. ReferencesFurther reading *Henry H.

He registered his design at the United Kingdom Patent Office on 1 March 1849 under the Ornamental Designs Act of 1842. As he was the editor of The Illustrated London News, the newspaper where Howard Staunton wrote a regular chess column, he asked Staunton to advertise his chess set. Staunton did so in his column on 8 September 1849, and the set became famous under the name Staunton chess set. In addition, Cooke was an ambitious London-based publisher who, as Ingram, Cooke & Co., produced many volumes of history, travel guides, and other works. Ingram and Cooke were the proprietors of the mid-Victorian National Illustrated Library that failed in 1854 due to carrying an excess amount of titles: \\"When the 'National Illustrated Library' was started, all were pleased and surprised at the appearance and price of the volumes, and it is certain that they would have paid; but a fatal error was made, almost at once, in commencing the publishing of other libraries at the same office, and in the purchasing at high prices old plates for republication; so many series came from the publisher . . . that their advertisements were confusion worse confounded, and everybody was lost in the maze. The proprietor has now given up the business, not without a very serious loss\\" (Norton's Literary Gazette and Publishers Circular Vol. 1, 1854, p. 467). Herbert Ingram, Cooke's brother-in-law and publishing house partner, was the co-founder of the London Illustrated News. Herbert Ingram died in a boating accident while traveling in the United States with his son. His steamer, the Lady Elgin, sank in Lake Superior when another passenger steamer, the Augusta, crashed into the Lady Elgin. Of the Lady Elgin's 400 passengers, only 100 survived. The accident occurred near Winetka, Wisconsin during an early September storm (Charles Mackay Forty Years' Recollections of Life, Literature, and Public Affairs from 1830 to 1870, 1877, 2:72-73). Spelling Nathaniel Cooke's listings in the London Directories Marriage announcement in The Illustrated London News, 31 January 1860 Cooke's name was misspelled as \\"Cook\\" on the 1849 patent and the misspelling has propagated in chess literature since then. The correct spelling can be found in numerous documents, including his listings in the London Directories (see sidebar) as well as official announcements of the marriage of his daughter Harriet Ingram Cooke, to John Jaques II, son of John Jaques, owner of the company that first manufactured the Staunton pieces in 1849 (see sidebar).

It stars Walter Matthau and Tatum O'Neal. The film was followed by two sequels, The Bad News Bears in Breaking Training in 1977 and The Bad News Bears Go to Japan in 1978, a short-lived 1979‚Äì80 CBS television series, and a 2005 remake. Notable was the score by Jerry Fielding, which is an adaptation of the principal themes of Bizet's opera Carmen. Plot Morris Buttermaker, an alcoholic and former minor- league baseball pitcher, is recruited by Bob Whitewood, a city councilman and attorney who filed a lawsuit against an ultra-competitive Southern California Youth Baseball League which excluded the least skilled athletes (including his son) from playing. In order to settle the lawsuit, the league agrees to add an additional team - the Bears - which is composed of the worst players. Buttermaker becomes the coach of the unlikely team, which includes (among others) a near-sighted pitcher, an overweight catcher, a foulmouthed shortstop with a Napoleon complex, an outfielder who dreams of emulating his idol Hank Aaron, two non-English-speaking Mexican immigrants, a withdrawn and bullied boy named Timmy Lupus, and a motley collection of other \\"talent\\". Shunned by the more competitive teams (and competitive parents), the Bears are the outsiders. They play their opening game, and do not even record an out, giving up 26 runs before Buttermaker forfeits the game. Realizing the team is nearly hopeless, he recruits a couple of unlikely prospects: sharp-tongued Amanda Whurlitzer, a skilled pitcher (trained by Buttermaker when she was younger) who is the 11-year-old daughter of one of Buttermaker's ex-girlfriends. At first, she tries to convince Buttermaker that she has given up baseball, but then she reveals that she had been practicing \\"on the sly\\". Before agreeing to join the team, Amanda makes a number of outlandish demands (such as imported jeans, modeling school, ballet lessons, etc.) as conditions for joining. Upon hearing her demands, Buttermaker asks, \\"Who do you think you are, Catfish Hunter?\\" Amanda responds by asking, \\"Who's he?\\" Rounding out the team, Buttermaker recruits the \\"best athlete in the area,\\" who also happens to be the local cigarette-smoking, loan-sharking, Harley-Davidson-riding troublemaker, Kelly Leak. With Amanda and Kelly on board, the team starts gaining more confidence, and the Bears start winning games. Eventually, the unlikely Bears make it to the championship game opposite the top-notch Yankees, who are coached by aggressive, competitive Roy Turner. As the game progresses, tensions are ratcheted up as Buttermaker and Roy engage in shouting matches, directing their players to become increasingly more ruthless and competitive against each other, going as far as fighting, spiking on slide, or the batter getting hit on purpose. The turnaround point of the game comes after a heated exchange between Roy's son (and Yankees pitcher) Joey and the Bears at-bat catcher Engelberg. Roy orders his son to walk Engelberg, the only Bears hitter he cannot overcome, despite Joey's wish to give it a try. In response, Joey intentionally throws a wild beanball nearly striking Engelberg in the head. Horrified, Roy goes to the mound and slaps his son. On the next pitch, Engelberg hits a routine ground ball back to Joey who exacts revenge against his father by holding the ball until Engelberg has an inside the park home run. Joey then leaves the game, dropping the ball at his father's feet. Buttermaker, realizing that he has become as competitive as Roy, puts the benchwarmers on the field, thus giving everyone a chance to play. In spite of this, the finish-up brings up the best team-play from the Bears. After loading the bases with smart tactics (two walks and a bunt) they nearly recover a four run difference, with the last runner getting taken out at the last moment. After having narrowly lost the game 7 to 6, Buttermaker gives the team free rein of his beer cooler. Although they did not win the championship, they have the satisfaction of having come a long way. The condescending Yankees congratulate the Bears telling them that although they are still not that good, they have \\"guts.\\" Tanner, the shortstop, replies by telling the Yankees where they can put their trophy. The Bears cheer and Timmy Lupus overcomes his chronic shyness enough to yell \\"Wait 'til next year!\\", then they spray their beers all over each other. The movie ends with a field celebration that makes it look as if they won the game. Cast=Adults *Walter Matthau as Morris Buttermaker, coach of the Bears: A drunken, loud, ex-professional baseball pitcher and part-time pool cleaner, who drives a rundown blue Cadillac convertible *Vic Morrow as Roy Turner, coach of the Yankees who is competitive and aggressive *Joyce Van Patten as Cleveland, league manager who favors Roy and the Yankees *Ben Piazza as Bob Whitewood, city councilman and lawyer who sued the league to allow the Bears (in particular, his son) to play and who convinces (and pays) Buttermaker to coach the team Kids *Tatum O'Neal as Amanda Whurlitzer, the 11-year-old pitcher who feels insecure about her tomboy image. She is recruited by Buttermaker to help the team start winning. She is no-nonsense and a great pitcher who was taught by Buttermaker when she was young. The boys grow to be very protective of her, picking a fight with their rivals during a game when Amanda is kicked in the chest. Her mother is Buttermaker's ex-girlfriend and she looks to him as a father figure. Amanda and Tanner butt heads a lot, but respect each other. She also has a secret crush on Kelly. *Chris Barnes as Tanner Boyle, the short-tempered shortstop with a Napoleon complex; after suffering a horrible loss on their first game, he picks a fight with the entire seventh grade from his school (and loses). He tends to curse more than the others, and initially insults and bullies Timmy before realizing he's treating Timmy no better than the kids from their rival team and becomes protective of him, leading to an unlikely friendship between them. He is also close friends with Ahmad. *Jackie Earle Haley as Kelly Leak, the local troublemaker who smokes and rides a mini Harley-Davidson motorcycle. Kelly is also the best athlete in the neighborhood. At first, he doesn't want to join when Amanda attempts to recruit him, but he changes his mind when Coach Turner threatens him. He alternates between left- and center-field and has a crush on Amanda. After joining the team, he forms close friendships with Tanner, Ahmad and Ogilvie. *Erin Blunt as Ahmad Abdul-Rahim, a black Muslim boy who plays in the outfield, is liked by everyone on the team and adores Hank Aaron; Ahmad strips off his uniform in shame after committing several errors in the Bears' first game, but is convinced to return to the team by Buttermaker and is used for bunts in games due to his speed. He is shown to be close friends with Tanner. *Gary Lee Cavagnaro as Mike Engelberg, an overweight boy who plays catcher; a great hitter, he frequently teases Tanner about his size. He breaks Buttermaker's windshield with a baseball at the first practice. He has a deep rivalry with Yankee pitcher Joey causing them to throw insults at each other. *Alfred W. Lutter as Alfred Ogilvie, a bookworm who memorizes baseball statistics. He's mostly a bench-warmer who assists the coach with defensive strategy. A backup outfielder/first baseman, but reluctant to play because he feels he's one of the lesser-skilled players on the team. *David Stambaugh as Toby Whitewood, an unassuming boy who plays first base. He knows about the other players' personalities, is intelligent and well-spoken, and at times speaks on behalf of the team. He is the son of councilman Bob Whitewood, who secretly paid Buttermaker to coach the team. *Quinn Smith as Timmy Lupus, initially described by Tanner as a \\"booger-eating spaz;\\" plays right-field and is considered to be the worst player on the team ‚Äî if not the entire league ‚Äî but he surprises everyone in the final game by making a key play to keep the Bears in the game. He is the most quiet and shy player, but shows the odd ability to properly prepare a martini for Coach Buttermaker while the team was assisting the coach with pool cleaning. *Jaime Escobedo as Jose Aguilar, Miguel's older brother who plays second base; doesn't speak English. *George Gonzales as Miguel Aguilar, Jose's younger brother; mostly plays right-field. He does not speak English. He is so short that the strike zone is practically non-existent. *David Pollock as Rudi Stein, a nervous relief pitcher with glasses who is a terrible hitter; at times he is asked by Coach Buttermaker to purposely get hit by pitches in order to get on base. Also a backup outfielder. *Brett Marx as Jimmy Feldman, a fairly quiet third baseman with curly blond hair. *Scott Firestone as Regi Tower, a fairly quiet, red-headed third baseman whose dad vocally attends practices and games. Also plays first base. *Brandon Cruz as Joey Turner, the star pitcher for the Yankees. Coach Roy Turner's son. He has a rivalry with Engleberg and regularly bullies Tanner and Timmy. Allows Engleberg an inside-the-park home run, then quits the team after Roy slaps him in anger for almost beaning the Bears' catcher. Production The Bad News Bears was filmed in and around Los Angeles, primarily in the San Fernando Valley. The field where they played is in Mason Park on Mason Avenue in Chatsworth. In the film, the Bears were sponsored by an actual company, Chico's Bail Bonds. One scene was filmed in the council chamber at Los Angeles City Hall. Matthau was paid $750,000 plus over 10% of the theatrical rentals. Tatum O'Neal was paid $350,000 plus a percentage of the profits. These were later estimated to be $1.9 million. Reception Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 97% based on reviews from 30 critics and an average rating of 7.6/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"The Bad News Bears is rude, profane, and cynical, but shot through with honest, unforced humor, and held together by a deft, understated performance from Walter Matthau.\\" In his 1976 review, critic Roger Ebert gave the film three stars out of four and called it \\"an unblinking, scathing look at competition in American society\\".Review, The Bad News Bears, Chicago Sun-Times, April 13, 1976 Gene Siskel awarded two-and-a-half stars out of four, calling the film's characters \\"more types than people\\" and the kids' foul-mouth dialogue \\"overdone,\\" though he found O'Neal's performance \\"genuinely affecting.\\"Siskel, Gene (April 14, 1976). \\"'Bad News Bears' takes a swing at Little League\\". Chicago Tribune. Section 3, p. 5. Variety called it \\"the funniest adult-child comedy film since 'Paper Moon',\\" and lauded the \\"excellent\\" script.\\"Film Reviews: The Bad News Bears\\". Variety. April 7, 1976. 23. Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times declared it \\"the best American screen comedy of the year to date,\\" adding, \\"Bright, pugnacious and utterly realistic as most children seem to be today, these kids are drawn with much accuracy and are played beautifully.\\"Thomas, Kevin (April 7, 1976). \\"Matthau, O'Neal Throw Strikes\\". Los Angeles Times. Part IV, p. 1, 9. Vincent Canby of The New York Times found the film only \\"occasionally funny\\" but praised screenwriter Bill Lancaster for \\"the talent and discipline to tell the story of 'The Bad News Bears' almost completely in terms of what happens on the baseball diamond or in the dugout.\\"Canby, Vincent (April 7, 1976). \\"At Bat With Matthau and O'Neal in 'Bad News Bears'\\". The New York Times. 28. Gary Arnold of The Washington Post praised it as \\"a lively, spontaneously funny entertainment\\" that \\"could rally a large parallel audience seeking less innocuous and stereotyped pictures with and about children.\\"Arnold, Gary (April 8, 1976). \\"A hit for 'The Bad News Bears'\\". The Washington Post. 53. Tom Milne of The Monthly Film Bulletin called it \\"miraculously funny and entirely delightful.\\" Awards Walter Matthau was nominated for a BAFTA award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Comedy. The screenplay by Bill Lancaster, son of actor Burt Lancaster, was winner of a Writers Guild of America award. Saturday Night Live did a parody of the film with Matthau as the guest host called The Bad News Bees with John Belushi, Dan Aykroyd and the rest in their recurring bee costumes for what would be their final time. This subtly referenced masturbation which was alluded to as \\"buzzing-off\\".

It was created in 1822 for William Hare, 1st Viscount Ennismore and Listowel, who had earlier represented Cork City and Athy in the Irish House of Commons. He had already been created Baron Ennismore, of Ennismore in the County of Kerry, in 1800, and Viscount Ennismore and Listowel, in 1816, also in the Peerage of Ireland. His grandson, the second Earl, represented Kerry and St Albans in the British House of Commons. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the third Earl. In 1869 he was created Baron Hare, of Convamore in the County of Cork, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, which gave him an automatic seat in the House of Lords. Lord Listowel later held minor office in the second administration of William Ewart Gladstone. His grandson, the fifth Earl, was a Labour politician and notably served as the last Secretary of State for India and Burma. the titles are held by the latter's eldest son, the sixth Earl, who succeeded in 1997. Lord Listowel is one of the ninety elected hereditary peers that remain in the House of Lords after the passing of the House of Lords Act 1999, and sits as a cross-bencher. Another member of the family was the Conservative politician John Hare. He was the third son of the fourth Earl. Listowel is a town in County Kerry, Ireland.

In 1990, Spencer Gifts closed its mail-order catalog division. In 1993 and 1996, respectively, Spencer Gifts acquired the DAPY line of stores and opened its first GLOW! store. The DAPY and GLOW! trademarks were retired sometime before 2007. In 1995, MCA was acquired by Seagram Company Ltd. and was renamed Universal Studios. Spencer Gifts began to operate Universal Studios stores as a subsidiary of its parent company. In 1997, Spencer Gifts opened its first store in Canada. In 1999, Spencer's acquired Spirit Halloween, a seasonal retailer that was founded by Joseph Marver in 1983. At that time, the business had 60 temporary locations. Spirit's stores are only open for the two months leading up to Halloween, though it maintains a website year-round. The stores are generally operated out of the spaces of recently vacated businesses. As of 2013, Spirit had over 1,000 locations, which comprised about half of Spencer's annual revenue of $250 million. In 2000, Spencer's expanded into the United Kingdom. The chain opened up to 14 stores in the United Kingdom before closing them sometime in the mid-2000s. Typical merchandise at a Spencer's Gift shop In 2001, Vivendi acquired Universal Studios and rebranded the entire organization as Vivendi Universal Entertainment. Less than two years later, in 2003, GB Palladin, a joint venture between Gordon Brothers Group and Palladin Capital Group, acquired Spencer Gifts from Vivendi, around the same time that Vivendi was preparing to sell majority of the shares of Universal Studios to General Electric's NBC division. As a result of the sale, Steven Silverstein became Spencer Gifts' CEO and also the CEO and president of Spirit Halloween. In the fall of 2004, Spencer's began redesigning its stores. In 2006, Spencer's began its \\"Spirit of Children\\" program, which raises donations through its Spirit Halloween stores for, and hosts Halloween parties in, children's hospitals in Canada and the United States. Since 2007, the program has raised over $16 million for over 130 children's hospitals. ACON Investments acquired the company in 2007 and sold it to Spencer's management in 2015. Legal issues The company has been investigated by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for its advertising practices. In 1962, Spencer Gifts was found by the Federal Trade Commission to have violated the Federal Trade Commission Act by making misleading statements in advertising its \\"Reduce-Eze\\" girdles and ordered to cease making false claims. The girdles were advertised with statements such as \\"Slim 4 Inches Without Diet\\" and \\"Trims 4 Inches Off Your Figure\\". In 1969, Spencer Gifts was found by the FTC to, through the use of words like \\"stone\\", \\"birthstone\\", and \\"gold\\", have misrepresented its jewelry products. As its jewelry did not contain any \\"genuine precious or semiprecious stones\\", nor was its metal 24 karat gold, Spencer Gifts was ordered to stop use of deceptive statements in the promotion of its jewelry. In 1970, Spencer Gifts was found by the FTC to have misled its customers as to the efficacy of its \\"non- prescription magnifying spectacles\\" by failing to disclose that correction of vision defects is limited to older persons who do not have any eye diseases, like astigmatism, but only need \\"simple magnifying or reducing lenses\\". The FTC ordered the retailer to cease the use of advertisements that misrepresented the quality of its optical products. Controversies Spencer Gifts has come under fire for its merchandise, which has been considered to be sexually explicit and racist. In 1989, the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC) mailed thousands of pamphlets to Arab-Americans across the United States to campaign against Spencer's 'sheik' and 'Arafat' Halloween masks, which were marketed as part of its \\"Fright Stuff\\" line of products. The pamphlet featured a picture of the 'sheik' mask and claimed that it \\"was the only ethnic one in the product line and being marketed alongside traditional monster masks reinforced the notion Arab people are scary.\\" Spencer Gifts pulled the two masks from its stores in October following a \\"three-day protest and telephone campaign\\" by the ADC, but decided later that month to place the masks back on sale, prompting the ADC to boycott and picket Spencer's stores. In a letter to ADC spokesperson Faris Bouhafa, Spencer's general counsel Ronald Mangel said that \\"after re-reviewing the 'Sheik' and 'Arafat' masks and discussing the look of the masks with others\\", Spencer's president John Hacala decided to reverse the earlier decision and place the masks back in stores. \\"We will not reorder the masks for next year,\\" the letter added. Spencer Gifts has been criticized for allowing children access to adult toys and other explicit products. While adults-only products are ostensibly kept in areas off-limits to children, there have been several instances where that is not the case. In one instance, police seized adult materials from the Spencer Gifts in Rapid City, South Dakota as \\"possible evidence for the national retailer's failure to register as an adult-oriented business\\". In February 2014, the Ancient Order of Hibernians, the largest Irish organization in the United States, called on Spencer's to cease the sale of merchandise it felt propagated stereotypes about Irish Americans, such as a T-shirt with the slogan \\"F*** me I'm Irish\\" and a hat sporting the phrase \\"Irish Girl Wasted\\". AOH National Anti-Defamation Chairman Neil Cosgrove protested, \\"We note that Spencer's Gifts is a recidivist when it comes to denigrating the heritage and culture of Irish Americans. Spencer's St. Pat's merchandise seems to plumb new lows with each year.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Category:1947 establishments in New Jersey Category:1967 mergers and acquisitions Category:2003 mergers and acquisitions Category:2007 mergers and acquisitions Category:Companies based in Atlantic County, New Jersey Category:Egg Harbor Township, New Jersey Category:Novelty items Category:Retail companies established in 1947 Category:Retail companies of the United States ","title":"Spencer Gifts"},{"id":"464139","text":"Coat of Arms of the Lord Napier of Merchistoun, Baron Ettrick of Ettrick, Baronet of Nova Scotia: Napier (arms of feudal Earls of Lennox, a title inherited by King James I & VI from his father Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley) quartering ScottThe Scots Peerage Lord Napier, of Merchistoun, is a title in the Peerage of Scotland. It was created in 1627 for Sir Archibald Napier, 1st Baronet. Earlier that year, he already held the Napier Baronetcy, of Merchistoun in the County of Midlothian, created in the Baronetage of Nova Scotia. The titles remained united until 1683, when the Baronetcy became dormant. It was revived in the early 19th century and is now held by another branch of the Napier family. Between 1683 and 1686, the Lords of Napier also held the Nicolson Baronetcy, of Carnock in the County of Stirling, and since 1725 the Scott Baronetcy, of Thirlestane in the County of Selkirk, both baronetcies created in the Baronetage of Nova Scotia. The latter one is held till today. Additionally, the tenth Lord was created Baron Ettrick, of Ettrick in the County of Selkirk in the Peerage of the United Kingdom on 16 July 1872. Lord Napier is the hereditary Clan Chief of Clan Napier. The family seat is Thirlestane Castle, near Ettrick, Selkirkshire. History=Napier Arms of Napier (same arms as Earl of Lennox): Argent, a saltire engrailed between four roses gules The earliest recorded mention of the name Napier occurred in 1290, in a charter of Maol Choluim I, Earl of Lennox, granting lands at Kilmahew to the Napiers. They are said to have taken their name from a saying by King Alexander II of Scotland to one of the Earls of Lennox, after a battle, that Lennox had na peer (no equal). Archibald Napier, son of John Napier, the inventor of logarithms, served as a Gentleman of the Bedchamber to King James VI of Scotland (I of England) and as a Lord of Session. On 2 March 1627 he was created a baronet, \\"of Merchistoun in the County of Midlothian\\", in the Baronetage of Nova Scotia. A few months later he was raised to the Peerage of Scotland as Lord Napier, of Merchistoun. His grandson, the third Lord, obtained an extension of the patent with limitation to (1) his heirs female and their heirs male and female, and (2) failing which to his sisters and their heirs whatsoever, the female heir being obliged to assume the name and arms of Napier. On his death in 1683 the baronetcy became dormant (it was later revived, see the Napier Baronetcy of Merchistoun) while he was succeeded in the Lordship (according to the new patent) by his nephew Sir Thomas Nicolson, 4th Baronet, of Carnock, who became the 4th Lord Napier. He was the son of Sir Thomas Nicolson, 3rd Baronet, of Carnock by his wife the Hon. Jean Napier, eldest daughter of the second Lord Napier. The 4th Lord Napier died unmarried at an early age and was succeeded in the Baronetcy by his cousin and heir male (see the Baron Carnock for later history of this title) and in the Lordship by his aunt, the fifth Lady Napier, the wife of John Brisbane. Scott Arms of Scott (of Buccleuch, Scotland): Or, on a bend Azure a mullet of six points between two crescents of the first Lady Napier was succeeded by her grandson, the sixth Lord. He was the son of Sir William Scott, 2nd Baronet, of Thirlestane by his wife Elizabeth, Mistress of Napier. In 1725 he also succeeded his father as third Baronet of Thirlestane. (The Scott Baronetcy, of Thirlestane in the County of Selkirk, had been created in the Baronetage of Nova Scotia on 22 August 1666 for Francis Scott). The titles remain united. His grandson, the eighth Lord, sat in the House of Lords as a Scottish Representative Peer from 1796 to 1806 and from 1807 to 1823 and also served as Lord Lieutenant of Selkirkshire from 1819 to 1823. He was succeeded by his son, the ninth Lord. He was a Scottish Representative Peer from 1824 to 1832 and served as Ambassador to China in 1833. His son, the tenth Lord, was a prominent diplomat. In 1872 he was created Baron Ettrick, of Ettrick in the County of Selkirk, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. This peerage gave him and his descendants an automatic seat in the House of Lords until the passing of the House of Lords Act 1999. the titles are held by his great-great-great- grandson, the fifteenth Lord, who succeeded his father in 2012.

Adrien Arcand (October 3, 1899 ‚Äì August 1, 1967) was a Canadian journalist who led a series of fascist political movements between 1929 and his death in 1967. During his political career, he proclaimed himself the Canadian F√ºhrer. He was detained by the federal government for the duration of the Second World War under the Defence of Canada Regulations.Betcherman, Lita-Rose The Swastika and the Maple Leaf (1978) p. 146 Rise to prominence Arcand was the son of Marie-Anne (Mathieu) and Narcisse-Joseph-Philias Arcand, who was a carpenter and trade union leader.http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/arcand_narcisse_15F.html He is also the great uncle of the movie director, Denys Arcand. Arcand was born into a family of 12 children and grew up in a house on Laurier street in Montreal. Narcisse Arcand was active in the Labour Party that called for free education, old age pensions, health insurance and universal suffrage. The appeal of the Labour Party in Quebec was dented by the Catholic Church, which at the time held a position of omnipotent power in Quebec, as priests instructed their flocks should not to vote for the Labour Party. Through the Labour Party stated it was open to all, but in fact the party's rules explicitly banned Asians from joining and the party's platform called for the \\"absolute prohibition of Chinese immigration\\" to Canada, who were seen as economic competitors to the white working class. Through the number of Chinese immigrants to Quebec was very small as the 1901 census showed that were 1,648,898 people living in Quebec, of whom only 1,037 were Chinese immigrants, but their presence was sufficient to lead an \\"Anti-Yellow Peril League\\" being formed, many of whose members were also Labour Party's members. Narcisse Arcand was very active in lobbying against Asian immigration, testifying in 1909 before the Royal Commission on Education that as long as Asian immigration continued, it would be impossible for the white working class to economically advance. From advocating a ban on Asian immigration to advocating a ban on all immigration was not a large step, and soon Arcand was arguing that all immigration must cease. His son inherited his father's belief that immigration was a mortal threat. However, Montreal at the time had a large English-speaking minority and Adrien Arcand later recalled that he \\"was raised in an atmosphere not conductive to separatist and Anglophobic sentiments\\" as he knew many English- speakers as he was growing up and came to speak English fluently. Through Narcisse Arcand was often at odds with the Catholic Church, all of his children were educated in Catholic schools (Quebec did not a public education system until 1963 and all schools prior to 1963 were run by churches). Adrien Arcand was educated at the College de St. Jean d'Iberville, College Saint- Stanislas and College de Montreal in Montreal. He received the standard 8 year \\"classical college\\" education offered in Quebec Catholic schools with a focus on French, Latin, Greek, religion, math, the classics, and French history. Arcand initially considered studying to be a priest, but changed his mind as \\"weakness\\" made a life of celibacy unappealing to him. The College de Montreal was run by the Sulpician monks, who had been active in Quebec since the 17th century, and most of the Sulpicians at the college were from France. The self- image of Quebecois at the time was that Quebec was the last remnant of the Catholic ancien-regime France that had been ended by the French Revolution, and Arcand's education at the Catholic schools emphasised royalist and Catholic values. The Sulpicians from France tended to be very hostile to French republicanism and many had relocated in Quebec, a society dominated by the Catholic Church, because it was considerably closer to their idealized version of ancien-regime France than the French Third Republic was. By Arcand's own account, his education by the Sulpicians at the College de Montreal was \\"decisive\\" in making his world-view. In 1918, he studied science as a part-time student at McGill University, but the great \\"Spanish flu\\" pandemic of 1918-1919 led to public places being closed as Montreal went into lockdown after the Spanish flu arrived in October 1918. The virulent \\"Spanish flu\\" (which despite its name actually came from the United States) killed hundreds of thousands of people and led to all theaters, cinemas, concert halls, libraries, schools, meeting halls and hockey areas in Montreal being shut down. During the lockdown, Arcand turned to writing to help ease the boredom, and several of his articles he submitted to newspapers were published, sparking his interest in journalism. In 1919, he was hired by La Patrie newspaper and in 1920 he began to write a weekly column dealing with labour issues. In 1921, he went to work for the Montreal Star, reporting the news in English. From there, he moved to La Presse, the largest newspaper in Quebec. A keen amteaur violin player, Arcand worked as a music critic for La Presse. As Montreal was the largest and wealthiest city in Canada at the time, many prominent musicians such as Ignacy Paderewski often played at concerts in Montreal, and Arcand was there to interview him for La Presse. Besides for Paderewski, Accand's work as a reporter for La Presse allowed him to interview many famous people in the 1920s when they visited Montreal such as the Canadian prime minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, Anna Pavlova, Vincent d'Indy, Vladimir de Pachmann, Alfred Cortot, Feodor Chaliapin, C√©cile Sorel, Jascha Heifetz, Isadora Duncan, Mario Chamlee, Queen Marie of Romania, Jacques Thibaud, Stanley Baldwin, Fritz Kreisler, Douglas Fairbanks, Maurice de F√©raudy, Tom Mix, Mary Pickford, Efrem Zimbalist and Lord Birkenhead. In 1923, he joined the Ch√¢teauguay regiment of the militia. On 14 April 1925, he married Yvonne Gigu√®re. In the late 1920s, he became active in organising for Catholic trade unions and became the first president of the first union local at La Presse. His trade unionism led him to be fired in 1929. Arcand later recalled that his sacking came as \\"a surprise, cruel and hard, with the result that my wife and my young babies suffered the effects of painful, abject poverty\\". For a time, the water and electricity at his home was cut off due to his inability to pay the bills. Arcand's sacking led him with a lifelong grudge against his former employer, Pamphile R√©al Du Tremblay, and led him to found a new newspaper, Le Goglu, in August 1929. His sudden fall from the respectable, lower middle-class into poverty radicalised him. Arcand was assisted in founding Le Goglu by a printer, Joseph M√©nard, who wanted to launch his own newspaper. In joual (Quebec French), goglu is slang for someone who is jovial and who loves to laugh, and Le Goglu belonged to a type of satirical newspaper mocking society that was popular in Quebec at the time. Le Goglu was an eight-page-long broadsheet full of cartoons that mocked various prominent people, for an instance showing Mackenzie King as a clueless ape staring vacantly into space. The newspaper was based in a lower class part of Montreal, described by Arcand as an area \\"where are found Chinese gambling dens, Negro shacks, Greeks, cutthroat Slavs, Bulgarian ruffians, Oriental grocers, nauseating Palestinian restaurants, European ex-convict scum, diamond importers from Chicago, and dives of every kind, where officers of the Canadian militia will get it on for 50 cents\\". The major target of Le Goglu's humor was what Arcand called \\"the clique that is stifling the province\\", by which he mainly meant his former employer, de Tremblay, whom he was relentless in attacking as an exploitative boss and a hypocrite who failed to live up to the Catholic social teachings he professed to believe in. Le Goglu was a successful newspaper and by 1929 for the Christmas special edition Arcand could afford to print his paper in color for 12 pages. The cartoons that mocked the ministers in the cabinet of Premier Louis-Alexandre Taschereau as corrupt led to several libel suits, which increased the paper's circulation. The major advertisers for Le Goglu were at first was the famous Bronfman family of Montreal who ran ads promoting their brands of alcohol, but ceased their advertising after Le Goglu took an anti-Semitic line. In August 1929, Arcand started publishing in Le Goglu a serialization of a novel he was writing, Popeline, chronicling the story of the eponymous heroine, a 18-year old beauty \\"who had drunk long and deep from the cup of woe which gave her a heady feminine aura\\". Popeline was notable as one of the first novels written in joual instead of Parisian French which had been the standard in Quebec until then. In November 1929, Arcand launched his own political movement, the Ordre Patriotique des Goglus for the \\"general purification, on preserving our Latin character, our customs and our habits, on protecting our rights and our privileges\\". In December 1929, Arcand launched a sister newspaper for Le Goglu, the Sunday weekly Le Miroir, which was more serious. In March 1930, Arcand launched a third newspaper Le Chameau that soon folded in 1931 as it was unprofitable. He published and edited several newspapers during this period, most notably Le Goglu, Le Miroir, Le Chameau, Le Patriote, Le Fasciste Canadien and Le Combat National. Fascist Until 1964, there was no public school system in Quebec and instead there were two school systems; one operated by the Catholic Church and another operated by the Protestant churches. Since the late 19th century in an uncomfortable arrangement, Jewish children had been educated in the Protestant school system. In late 1929, the Taschereau government agreed to set up a separate Jewish school system in Montreal, an agreement that led to an intense, visceral reaction by the Catholic Church, which was stoutly opposed to Jewish schools, generating so much popular opposition that by 1931 the plan was scrapped by Taschereau. Arcand used the pages of Le Goglu to attack the plans for Jewish schools, and in May 1930 he published his anti-Semitic editorial in Le Goglu, \\"Why Semitism is a Danger\\". This was followed up by several anti-Semitic editorials in the spring and summer of 1930 such as \\"How Does Semitism Advance?\\", \\"The Word of God and the Jews\\", and \\"Semitism: Persecuted and Persecutor\\". By the summer of 1930, Le Goglu had been transformed from the populist, humorous newspaper into a full blown anti-Semitic journal. Arcand credited much of his turn towards anti-Semitism as a result of reading the pamphlet The Jewish World Problem by Lord Sydenham of Combe. Arcand shared the idea widely accepted in French- Canada that Confederation in 1867 was a \\"pact\\" between two \\"nations\\" that agreed to work together for their common betterment. Acrand added his spin to the idea of two founding \\"nations\\" by arguing Canada existed only for the \\"two founding nations\\" and to accept the claim by any other group to \\"nationhood\\" would by necessity reduce the living standards of the \\"two founding nations\\". In this way, Arcand argued \\"to recognize the Jewish race as an official entity would violate the Confederation pact, eliminate our rights, and force us to officially recognize as national entities all the other groups, such as Polish, Greek, Syrian, Russian, Serbian, German who may request it later\\". Arcand's anti-Semitism was at least in part motivated by the fact that the majority of Ashkenazim (Yiddish-speaking Jews) immigrants from Eastern Europe usually arrived in Montreal, where a great many chose to settle. Arcand saw the Jews as economic competitors, drawing a contrast between his idealized, rural French-Canadian Catholic small grocer who was honest and hard-working vs. the stereotype of the greedy and unscrupulous big city Jewish immigrant capitalist who only succeeded because of \\"his dishonesty, not his skill or ability\\". Like many other French-Canadian intellectuals at the time, Arcand had considerable hatred for \\"godless\\" France, seen as abandoning Roman Catholicism, leaving Quebec as the last remnant of the \\"true\\" France that ended in 1789. Arcand also profoundly disliked the egalitarianism of French republicanism, writing with disgust how Josephine Baker, the \\"richest and most famous Negress\\" in France who became a millionaire \\"after showing her derri√®re at the Folies B√©rg√®res\\". For Arcand, it was unacceptable for someone like Baker to become rich at a time when whites were suffering with the Great Depression, which for him reflected a distorted social order. In May 1930, Arcand met with the millionaire Conservative leader Robert Bennett to ask him for his financial support in exchange for which Arcand would campaign against the Liberals in the coming election. French-Canadians tended to vote as a bloc for the Liberals at the time, and the fact that the Liberals usually won the majority of the seats in Quebec gave them an advantage in elections. The perception that the Conservatives, identified as the party of \\"imperialism\\" (i.e. support for the British empire), were anti-French and anti-Catholic made it difficult for the Conservatives to win seats in Quebec since the late 19th century. The fact that the Liberal leader William Lyon Mackenzie King was a protege of Sir Wilfrid Laurier and had run as an anti-conscription Liberal in the 1917 election gave him the image as the friend of Quebec despite the fact that he did not speak French. In a letter to Bennett dated 22 May 1930, Arcand asked for some $15, 000 dollars in exchange for which he would run what he himself called a \\"smear campaign\\" against Mackenzie King, a request that Bennett agreed to. Arcand received covert funds from the Conservative Party to operate his newspapers and campaign for R. B. Bennett in the 1930 Canadian federal election. In an editorial in Le Goglu, Arcand called Mackenzie King together with Premier Taschereau \\"two notorious stinkers\\". In another editorial, Arcand called Mackenzie King \\"the enemy of the people\\". The main line of Arcand's attacks was that Mackenzie King was a man who did not care about the suffering caused by the Great Depression, and using his well known \\"Continentalism\\" (i.e moving Canada closer to the United States) as a weapon, Arcand portrayed King as the friend of American billionaires. In the election of 28 July 1930, the Conservatives won a majority of 134 seats, 24 of which were in Quebec. Given that the Conservatives had much difficulty winning seats in French-Canada, the 24 seats won in Quebec were an impressive achievement and Arcand was quick to take the credit in his letters to Bennett, arguing that the Conservatives would had won no seats in Quebec as they usually did without him. Relations became increasingly strained afterwards as Bennett had little use for Arcand following the election. Despite pleas from Arcand and his comrades to get more money to make up for their expenses, the subsidy they received from the Tories was both sporadic and insufficient.Betcherman, Lita~Rose (1975). The Swastika and the Maple Leaf: Fascist Movements in Canada in the Thirties; Fitzhenry & Whiteside, p.10-11. In October 1932, Arcand first made contact with the German NSDAP when Kurt L√ºdecke representing the Nazi Party visited Montreal and met Arcand, suggesting that the two movements had much in common and should cooperate. In his report to Adolf Hitler about his visit to Montreal, L√ºdecke described Arcand as a \\"man of lively intelligence\\" whose movement was growing in support and whom was very close to Prime Minister Bennett. Arcand promised to set up a meeting between L√ºdecke and Bennett, and through he did sent a letter to Bennett requesting that he see L√ºdecke, it appears that the promised meeting never came off. Arcand was always a staunch federalist and an anglophile. He received secret funds from Lord Sydenham of Combe, former governor of Bombay and a prominent fascist sympathizer in the British Conservative Party after he translated into French Syndenham's pamphlet The Jewish World Problem . He also maintained correspondence with Arnold Spencer Leese, chief of the Imperial Fascist League. Arcand was most strongly influenced by British fascism as he maintained an active correspondence with various British fascists such as Lord Sydenham, Henry Hamilton Beamish and Admiral Sir Barry Domvile. With the aim of forming a fascist leadership for the British empire, Arcand started a correspondence that continued until his death with Sir Oswald Mosley, the leader of the British Union of Fascists (BUF). Many of the articles that appeared in Le Fasciste Canadien were translations of articles from Action and Blackshirt, the two journals of the BUF. In 1934, Arcand established the Parti National Social Chr√©tien (Christian National Social Party), which advocated anti-communism and the banishment of Canadian Jews to the Hudson Bay area. The latter idea was inspired by his friend, noted British Rhodesian fascist Henry Hamilton Beamish, who suggested sending Jews to Madagascar. In 1935 the desperate Bennett ministry again turned to Arcand, who was appointed at the urging of Senator Rainville to the post of Tory publicity director in Quebec. However, many of Arcand's friends were more sympathetic to the Reconstruction Party, so Le Patriote supported H. H. Stevens while its editor was campaigning for Bennett.Betcherman, Lita~Rose (1975). The Swastika and the Maple Leaf: Fascist Movements in Canada in the Thirties; Fitzhenry & Whiteside, p.43-43. Bennett secretly hired Arcand as his chief electoral organizer in Quebec for the 1935 federal election. In 1938, Arcand was chosen as the leader of the fascist National Unity Party of Canada, born of the fusion of his Parti National Social Chr√©tien with the Prairie provinces' Canadian Nationalist Party and Ontario's Nationalist Party, which had grown out of the Toronto Swastika Clubs of the early 1930s. Postcard used by Arcand's movement Arcand's party statutes called for the following oath to be taken at the beginning of every party meeting: :\\"Moved by the unshakable faith in God, a profound love for Canada, ardent sentiments of patriotism and nationalism, a complete loyalty and devotion toward our Gracious Sovereign who forms the recognized principle of active authority, a complete respect for the British North America Act, for the maintenance of order, for national prosperity, for national unity, for national honour, for the progress and the happiness of a greater Canada, I pledge solemnly and explicitly to serve my party. I pledge myself to propagate the principles of its program. I pledge myself to follow its regulation. I pledge myself to obey my leaders. Hail the party! Hail our Leader!\\"Frederick EDWARDS. ¬´ Fascism in Canada ¬ª, Maclean's Magazine, 15 April 1938, p. 66. Arcand always was steadfastly opposed to Quebec nationalism. He wanted to build a powerful centralized Canadian Fascist state within the British Empire. :\\"‚Ä¶ Arcand insists that his organisation has no sympathy with the extreme French nationalist movement represented by the group which split from Premier Duplessis after he was returned to power because he would not go all the way they wished. \\"We were the first in Quebec to fight Separatism,\\" Arcand declared, \\"and we are carrying on that fight very satisfactorily, swallowing many ex-members of that failing movement.\\" Frankly, the National Social Christian Party was aiming for Dominion power, Arcand admitted, describing Dominion power as the real key to the vital problems of this country.\\" On May 30, 1940, he was arrested in Montreal for \\"plotting to overthrow the state\\" and interned for the duration of the war as a security threat. His party, then called the National Unity Party, was banned. In the internment camp, he sat on a throne built by other prisoners and spoke of how he would rule Canada when Hitler conquered it.This story is told in Dangerous Patriots: Canada's Unknown Prisoners of War, by William Repka and Kathleen Repka, New Star Books, Vancouver, 1982 ( or ), in the section by Charlie Murray, who was imprisoned with him for being a union organizer. After the war Arcand ran for the House of Commons of Canada on two occasions. Despite being shunned by mainstream Quebecers in the post-war years, he managed to come second with 29 percent of the vote when he ran as a National Unity candidate in the riding of Richelieu‚ÄîVerch√®res in the 1949 federal election.http://www2.parl.gc.ca/Sites/LOP/HFER/hfer.asp?Language=E&Search;=Det&Include;=Y&rid;=608 He came second again with 39 percent of the vote when he ran as a \\"Nationalist\\" in Berthier‚ÄîMaskinong√©‚ÄîDelanaudi√®re in the 1953 election.House of Commons website On 2 February 1952, the British fascist Peter Huxley-Blythe wrote to Arcand asking for permission to publish in German his anti-Semitic pamphlet La Cl√© du myst√®re, writing: \\"I‚Äôm anxious to obtain two hundred (200) copies of your excellent work, The Key to the Mystery as soon as possible to fulfill an order I have received from Germany\\". Permission was granted, and on 27 February 1952 he wrote to Arcand for permission to print up 300 more copies of La Cl√© du myst√®re for sale in Great Britain. In 1957, he campaigned for Progressive Conservative candidate and future Quebec cabinet minister Remi Paul. Arcand never wavered in his belief in Adolf Hitler, and, in the 1960s, was a mentor to Ernst Z√ºndel, who became a prominent Holocaust denier and neo- Nazi propagandist in the latter part of the 20th century. Arcand often corresponded with Issa Nakhleh, a Palestinian Christian who served as the chief of the Palestine Arab Delegation. The Canadian Fuhrer: The Life of Adrien Arcand. By Jean-Francois Nadeau, James Lorimer & Company, Sep 30, 2011, p.351 On November 14, 1965, he gave a speech before a crowd of 650 partisans from all over Canada at the Centre Paul-Sauv√© in Montreal which was draped in the blue banners and insignia of the National Unity Party. As reported in La Presse and Le Devoir, he took the occasion to thank the newly elected Liberal Member of Parliament for Mount Royal, Pierre Trudeau, and former Conservative leader George Drew, for speaking in his defence when he was interned. However, Trudeau and Drew denied that they had ever defended Arcand or his views, and insisted that they had in fact been defending the principle of free speech even for fascists. Among those present at the rally were Jean Jodoin, a Progressive Conservative candidate in the 1965 federal election and Gilles Caouette, future Social Credit Party of Canada Member of Parliament.\\"Fascist Steps Out Of Past For Banquet\\", Globe and Mail, November 15, 1965  In popular culture  * Arcand is portrayed by Haley Joel Osment in Kevin Smith's 2016 comedy horror film Yoga Hosers. * In the 2016 grand strategy video game Hearts of Iron IV, Arcand can become the leader of Canada if it switches to fascist ideology.

Ice Age pluvial lakes in the western United States A pluvial lake is a body of water that accumulated in a basin because of a greater moisture availability resulting from changes in temperature and/or precipitation. These intervals of greater moisture availability are not always contemporaneous with glacial periods. Pluvial lakes are typically closed lakes that occupied endorheic basins. Pluvial lakes that have since evaporated and dried out may also be referred to as paleolakes.Goudie, A.S., 2013. and semi-arid geomorphology. Cambridge University Press. Etymology The word comes from the Latin pluvia, which means \\"rain\\". Geology Pluvial lakes represent changes in the hydrological cycle: wet cycles generate large lakes, and dry cycles cause the lakes to recede. Accumulated sediments show the variation in water level. During glacial periods, when the lake level is fairly high, mud sediments will settle out and be deposited. At times in between glaciers (interglacial), salt deposits may be present because of the arid climate and the evaporation of lakewater. Several pluvial lakes formed in what is now the southwestern United States during the glaciation of the late Pleistocene. One of these was Lake Bonneville in western Utah, which covered roughly . When Lake Bonneville was at its maximum water level, it was higher than the Great Salt Lake. Fresh water mollusks have been found in mud deposits from Searles Lake in California and suggest that the water temperature was about 7 degrees Fahrenheit (or 4 degrees Celsius) cooler than current temperatures. Radiocarbon dating of the youngest mud beds yield dates from 24,000 to 12,000 years ago. Formation When warm air from arid regions meets chilled air from glaciers, cloudy, cool, rainy weather is created beyond the terminus of the glacier. That humid climate was present during the last glacial period in North America and caused more precipitation than evaporation. The increase in rainfall fills the drainage basin and forms a lake. During interglacial periods, the climate becomes arid once more and causes the lakes to evaporate and dry up.

A professor at UCLA's Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science, he made several important contributions to the field of computer science, in particular to the theoretical foundations of data transmission in computer networking. He played an influential role in the development of the ARPANET, the precursor to the Internet, at UCLA. Education and career Kleinrock was born in New York City on June 13, 1934 to a Jewish family, and graduated from the noted Bronx High School of Science in 1951. He received a Bachelor of Electrical Engineering degree in 1957 from the City College of New York, and a master's degree and a doctorate (Ph.D.) in electrical engineering and computer science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1959 and 1963 respectively. He then joined the faculty at the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA), where he remains to the present day; during 1991‚Äì1995 he served as the Chairman of the Computer Science Department there. Achievements=Queueing theory Kleinrock's best-known and most- significant work is on queuing theory, a branch of operations research that has applications in many fields. He applied it to message switching in the early 1960s and later as a key mathematical background to packet switching in computer networks in the early 1970s. His initial contribution to this field was his doctoral thesis at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1962, published in book form in 1964; he later published several of the standard works on the subject. After Larry Roberts learned about packet switching at the 1967 Symposium on Operating Systems Principles, he asked Kleinrock to carry out the theoretical work to measure the performance of packet switching in the ARPANET, the forerunner of the Internet. Kleinrock's mathematical work underpinned the development of packet-switching networks in the 1970s. In 2004, Kleinrock described this work as: > Basically, what I did for my PhD research in 1961-1962 was to establish a > mathematical theory of packet networks which uncovered the underlying > principles that drives today's Internet. However, Kleinrock's claims that his work in the early 1960s originated the concept of packet switching and that this work was the source of the packet switching concepts used in the ARPANET are disputed, \\"... there is nothing in the entire 1964 book that suggests, analyzes, or alludes to the idea of packetization.\\" including by Robert Taylor, Paul Baran, and Donald Davies. Baran and Davies are recognized by historians and the U.S. National Inventors Hall of Fame for independently inventing the concept of digital packet switching used in modern computer networking including the Internet.; ARPANET The first message on the ARPANET was sent by a UCLA student programmer, Charley Kline, supervised by Kleinrock. At 10:30 p.m, on October 29, 1969 from Boelter Hall 3420, the school's main engineering building, Kline transmitted from the university's SDS Sigma 7 host computer to the Stanford Research Institute's SDS 940 host computer. The message text was the word \\"login\\"; the \\"l\\" and the \\"o\\" letters were transmitted, but the system then crashed. Hence, the literal first message over the ARPANET was \\"lo\\". About an hour later, having recovered from the crash, the SDS Sigma 7 computer effected a full \\"login\\". The first permanent ARPANET link was established on November 21, 1969, between the IMP at UCLA and the IMP at the Stanford Research Institute. By December 5, 1969, the initial four-node network was established.Kleinrock tells the story of the first Internet connection (UCLA video) Kleinrock claims to have committed the first illegal act on the Internet, having sent a request for return of his electric razor after a meeting in England in 1973. At the time, use of the ARPANET for personal reasons was unlawful.Still, tapping into the ARPANET to fetch a shaver across international lines was a bit like being a stowaway on an aircraft carrier. The ARPANET was an official federal research facility, after all, and not something to be toyed with. Kleinrock had the feeling that the stunt he'd pulled was slightly out of bounds. 'It was a thrill. I felt I was stretching the Net'. ‚Äì \\"Where Wizards Stay Up Late: The Origins of the Internet\\", Chapter 7.  Hierarchical routing  His theoretical work on hierarchical routing in the late 1970s with student Farouk Kamoun remains critical to the operation of the Internet today.  Later work  In 1988, Kleinrock was the chairman of a group that presented the report Toward a National Research Network to the U.S. Congress, concluding that \\"There is a clear and urgent need for a national research network\\". Although the U.S. did not build a nation-wide national research and education network, this report informed the development of the High Performance Computing Act of 1991, which was influential in the development of the Internet as it is known today. Funding from the bill was used in the development of the 1993 web browser Mosaic, at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA). Awards and recognition 2012 Internet Hall of Fame inductees, including Leonard Kleinrock (seated, fifth from the left) He has received numerous professional awards. In 2001 he received the Draper Prize \\"for the development of the Internet\\". Kleinrock was selected to receive the prestigious National Medal of Science, the nation's highest scientific honor, from President George W. Bush in the White House on September 29, 2008. \\"The 2007 National Medal of Science to Leonard Kleinrock for his fundamental contributions to the mathematical theory of modern data networks, and for the functional specification of packet switching, which is the foundation of Internet technology. His mentoring of generations of students has led to the commercialization of technologies that have transformed the world.\\" In 2010 he shared the Dan David Prize. UCLA Room 3420 at Boelter Hall was restored to its condition of 1969 and converted into the Kleinrock Internet Heritage Site and Archive. It opened to the public with a grand opening attended by Internet pioneers on October 29, 2011. In 2012, Kleinrock was inducted into the Internet Hall of Fame by the Internet Society. Leonard Kleinrock was inducted into IEEE-Eta Kappa Nu (IEEE-ŒóŒöŒù) in 2011 as an Eminent Member. The designation of Eminent Member is the organization's highest membership grade and is conferred upon those select few whose outstanding technical attainments and contributions through leadership in the fields of electrical and computer engineering have significantly benefited society. He was elected to the 2002 class of Fellows of the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences. In September 2014, Leonard Kleinrock was awarded the ACM SIGMOBILE Outstanding Contribution Award at MobiCom 2014. Leonard Kleinrock has been granted with the 2014 BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award \\"for his seminal contributions to the theory and practical development of the Internet,\\" in the words of the jury's citation.

A function of the complex variable z defined on an open set in the complex plane is said to be antiholomorphic if its derivative with respect to exists in the neighbourhood of each and every point in that set, where is the complex conjugate. There is an entry about the concept of an anti-holomorphic function in the Encyclopedia of Mathematics.Encyclopedia of Mathematics, Springer and The European Mathematical Society, https://encyclopediaofmath.org/wiki/Anti-holomorphic_function, As of 11 September 2020, This article was adapted from an original article by E. D. Solomentsev (originator), which appeared in Encyclopedia of Mathematics, . According to this entry the term anti-analytic function refers to the same concept. Anti-holomorphic function and anti-analytic function are synonyms of each other.

One can show that if f(z) is a holomorphic function on an open set D, then f() is an antiholomorphic function on , where is the reflection against the x-axis of D, or in other words, is the set of complex conjugates of elements of D. Moreover, any antiholomorphic function can be obtained in this manner from a holomorphic function. This implies that a function is antiholomorphic if and only if it can be expanded in a power series in in a neighborhood of each point in its domain. Also, a function f(z) is antiholomorphic on an open set D if and only if the function is holomorphic on D. If a function is both holomorphic and antiholomorphic, then it is constant on any connected component of its domain.
