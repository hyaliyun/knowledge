The Quinque vi√¶ (Latin for \\"Five Ways\\") (sometimes called \\"five proofs\\") are five logical arguments for the existence of God summarized by the 13th-century Catholic philosopher and theologian St. Thomas Aquinas in his book Summa Theologica. They are: #the argument from \\"first mover\\"; #the argument from causation; #the argument from contingency; #the argument from degree; #the argument from final cause or ends (\\"teleological argument\\"). Aquinas expands the first of these ‚Äì God as the \\"unmoved mover\\" ‚Äì in his Summa Contra Gentiles. Background=Need for demonstration of the existence of God Aquinas did not think the finite human mind could know what God is directly, therefore God's existence is not self-evident to us.ST, I, Q 2, A 1 (Latin and English) So instead the proposition God exists must be \\"demonstrated\\" from God's effects, which are more known to us.ST, I, Q 2, A 2 (Latin and English) By the end of each argument, Aquinas' concept of God has only minimal content which he fleshes out through the rest of the Summa theologiae. For example, the general question of whether \\"God\\" has a body or is composed of matter is answered in question three, immediately following the Five Ways. However, Aquinas did not hold that what could be demonstrated philosophically (i.e. as general revelation) would necessarily provide any of the vital details revealed in Christ and through the Church (i.e. as special revelation), quite the reverse. For example, while he would allow that in all creatures there is found the trace of the Trinity yet a trace shows that someone has passed by but not who it is. Categorization All five ways are generally considered to be cosmological arguments.Online Encyclopaedia Britannica\\"Philosophy of religion\\", 2018 Aquinas omitted various arguments he believed to be insufficient or unsuited, such as the ontological argument made by St. Anselm of Canterbury. Source A summary version of the Five Ways is given in the Summa theologiaeST, I, Q 2, A 3 (Latin and English) The Summa uses the form of scholastic disputation (i.e. a literary form based on a lecturing method: a question is raised, then the most serious objections are summarized, then a correct answer is provided in that context, then the objections are answered), and the Five Ways follow Medieval Theories of Demonstration. A subsequent, more detailed, treatment of the Five Ways can be found in the Summa contra gentiles. Aquinas further elaborated each of the Five Ways in more detail in passing in multiple books. Essential and Accidental Causal Chains The first two Ways relate to causation. When Aquinas argues that a causal chain cannot be infinitely long, he does not have in mind a chain where each element is a prior event that causes the next event; in other words, he is not arguing for a first event in a sequence. Rather, his argument is that a chain of concurrent or simultaneous effects must be rooted ultimately in a cause capable of generating these effects, and hence for a cause that is first in the hierarchical sense, not the temporal sense. Aquinas follows the distinction found in Aristotle's Physics 8.5, and developed by Simplicius, Maimonides, and Avicenna that a causal chain may be either accidental (Socrates' father caused Socrates, Socrates' grandfather caused Socrates' father, but Socrates' grandfather only accidentally caused Socrates) or essential (a stick is moving a stone, because a hand is simultaneously moving the stick, and thus transitively the hand is moving the stone.) His thinking here relies on what would later be labelled \\"essentially ordered causal series\\" by John Duns Scotus. (In Duns Scotus, it is a causal series in which the immediately observable elements are not capable of generating the effect in question, and a cause capable of doing so is inferred at the far end of the chain. Ordinatio I.2.43Duns Scotus ‚Äì Ordinatio I/D2/Q2B logicmuseum.com) This is also why Aquinas rejected that reason can prove the universe must have had a beginning in time; for all he knows and can demonstrate the universe could have been 'created from eternity' by the eternal God. He accepts the biblical doctrine of creation as a truth of faith, not reason. For a discussion of a causal chain argument that is based on a created beginning, see Kalam cosmological argument. The Five Ways=Prima Via: The Argument of the Unmoved MoverSummary= In the world, we can see that at least some things are changing. Whatever is changing is being changed by something else. If that by which it is changing is itself changed, then it too is being changed by something else. But this chain cannot be infinitely long, so there must be something that causes change without itself changing. This everyone understands to be God. =Explanation= Aquinas uses the term \\"motion\\" in his argument, but by this he understands any kind of \\"change\\", more specifically a transit from potentiality to actuality. (For example, a puddle growing to be larger would be counted inside the boundaries of Aquinas' usage.) Since a potential does not yet exist, it cannot cause itself to exist and can therefore only be brought into existence by something already existing. Secunda Via: The Argument of the First CauseSummary= In the world, we can see that things are caused. But it is not possible for something to be the cause of itself because this would entail that it exists prior to itself, which is a contradiction. If that by which it is caused is itself caused, then it too must have a cause. But this cannot be an infinitely long chain, so, there must be a cause which is not itself caused by anything further. This everyone understands to be God. =Explanation= As in the First Way, the causes Aquinas has in mind are not sequential events, but rather simultaneously existing dependency relationships: Aristotle's efficient cause. For example, plant growth depends on sunlight, which depends on gravity, which depends on mass. Aquinas is not arguing for a cause that is first in a sequence, but rather first in a hierarchy: a principal cause, rather than a derivative cause. Tertia Via: The Argument from ContingencySummary= In the world we see things that are possible to be and possible not to be. In other words, perishable things. But if everything were contingent and thus capable of going out of existence, then, nothing would exist now. But things clearly do exist now. Therefore, there must be something that is imperishable: a necessary being. This everyone understands to be God. =Explanation= The argument begins with the observation that things around us come into and go out of existence: animals die, buildings are destroyed, etc. But if everything were like this, then, at some time nothing would exist. Some interpreters read Aquinas to mean that assuming an infinite past, all possibilities would be realized and everything would go out of existence. Since this is clearly not the case, then there must be at least one thing that does not have the possibility of going out of existence. However, this explanation seems to involve the fallacy of composition (quantifier shift). Moreover, it does not seem to be in keeping with Aquinas' principle that, among natural things, the destruction of one thing is always the generation of another.Commentary on De Anima, Bk. 2, lect. 1, n.16. Alternatively, one could read Aquinas to be arguing as follows: if there is eternal change, so that things are eternally being generated and corrupted, and since an eternal effect requires an eternal cause (just as a necessary conclusion requires necessary premises), then there must exist an eternal agent which can account for the eternity of generation and corruption. To hold the alternative, namely that an infinite series of contingent causes would be able to explain eternal generation and corruption would posit a circular argument: Why is there eternal generation and corruption? Because there is an eternal series of causes which are being generated and corrupted. And why is there an infinite series of causes which are being generated and corrupted? Because there is eternal generation and corruption. Since such an explanation is not acceptable, there must be (at least one) eternal and necessary being. Quarta Via: The Argument from DegreeSummary= We see things in the world that vary in degrees of goodness, truth, nobility, etc. For example, well-drawn circles are better than poorly drawn ones, healthy animals are better than sick animals. Moreover, some substances are better than others, since living things are better than non-living things, and animals are better than plants, in testimony of which no one would choose to lose their senses for the sake of having the longevity of a tree. But judging something as being \\"more\\" or \\"less\\" implies some standard against which it is being judged. For example, in a room full of people of varying heights, at least one must be tallest. Therefore, there is something which is best and most true, and most a being, etc. Aquinas then adds the premise: what is most in a genus is the cause of all else in that genus. From this he deduces that there exists some most-good being which causes goodness in all else, and this everyone understands to be God. =Explanation= The argument is rooted in Aristotle and Plato but its developed form is found in Anselm's Monologion. Although the argument has Platonic influences, Aquinas was not a Platonist and did not believe in the Theory of Forms. Rather, he is arguing that things that only have partial or flawed existence indicate that they are not their own sources of existence, and so must rely on something else as the source of their existence. The argument makes use of the theory of transcendentals: properties of existence. For example, \\"true\\" presents an aspect of existence, as any existent thing will be \\"true\\" insofar as it is true that it exists. Or \\"one,\\" insofar as any existent thing will be (at least) \\"one thing.\\" The premise which seems to cause the most difficulty among interpreters of the fourth way is that the greatest in a genus is the cause of all else in the genus. This premise does not seem to be universally true, and indeed, Aquinas himself thinks that this premise is not always true, but only under certain circumstancesQuaestiones Quodlibetales, III, q.3, a.1: namely, when 1) the lesser things in the genus need a cause, and 2) there is nothing outside the genus which can be the cause. When these two conditions are met, the premise that the greatest in the genus is the cause of all else in that genus holds, since nothing gives what it does not have. Since Aquinas is dealing specifically with transcendentals like being and goodness, and since there is nothing outside the transcendentals, it follows that there is nothing outside the genus which could be a cause (condition 2). Moreover, if something has less than the maximum being or goodness or truth, then it must not have being or goodness or truth in itself. For example, how could what has circularity itself be less than fully circular? Therefore, whatever has less than the maximum being or goodness or truth must need a cause of their being and goodness and truth (condition 1). Quinta Via: Argument from Final Cause or Ends Summary= We see various non-intelligent objects in the world behaving in regular ways. This cannot be due to chance since then they would not behave with predictable results. So their behavior must be set. But it cannot be set by themselves since they are non-intelligent and have no notion of how to set behavior. Therefore, their behavior must be set by something else, and by implication something that must be intelligent. This everyone understands to be God. =Explanation= This is also known as the Teleological Argument. However, it is not a \\"Cosmic Watchmaker\\" argument from design (see below). Instead, as the 1920 Dominican translation puts it, The fifth way is taken from the governance of the world. The Fifth Way uses Aristotle's final cause. Aristotle argued that a complete explanation of an object will involve knowledge of how it came to be (efficient cause), what material it consists of (material cause), how that material is structured (formal cause), and the specific behaviors associated with the type of thing it is (final cause). The concept of final causes involves the concept of dispositions or \\"ends\\": a specific goal or aim towards which something strives. For example, acorns regularly develop into oak trees but never into sea lions. The oak tree is the \\"end\\" towards which the acorn \\"points,\\" its disposition, even if it fails to achieve maturity. The aims and goals of intelligent beings is easily explained by the fact that they consciously set those goals for themselves. The implication is that if something has a goal or end towards which it strives, it is either because it is intelligent or because something intelligent is guiding it. It must be emphasized that this argument is distinct from the design argument associated with William Paley and the Intelligent Design movement. The latter implicitly argue that objects in the world do not have inherent dispositions or ends, but, like Paley's watch, will not naturally have a purpose unless forced to do some outside agency. The latter also focus on complexity and interworking parts as the effect needing explanation, whereas the Fifth Way takes as its starting point any regularity. (E.g., that an eye has a complicated function therefore a design therefore a designer) but an argument from final cause (e.g., that the pattern that things exist with a purpose itself allows us to recursively arrive at God as the ultimate source of purpose without being constrained by any external purpose). Proofs or Ways? Many scholars and commenters caution against treating the Five Ways as if they were modern logical proofs. This is not to say that examining them in that light is not academically interesting. Reasons include: *Purpose: The purpose of the Summa theologica \\"is to help Dominicans not enrolled in the university prepare for their priestly duties of preaching and hearing confessions\\" by systematizing Catholic truth utilizing mainly Aristotelean tools. *Precis: Aquinas subsequently revisited the various arguments of the Five Ways in much greater detail. The simple list in the Summa theologica is not written to be clear (to a 21st-century reader) and complete, and should be considered a sketch or summary of the idea, suitable for presentation in a lecture or a quick browse. *Via negativa: Aquinas held that \\"we are unable to apprehend (the Divine substance) by knowing what it is. Yet we are able to have some knowledge of it by knowing what it is not.\\" (SCG I.14) Consequently, to understand the Five Ways as Aquinas understood them we must interpret them as negative theology listing what God is not (i.e. not a moved mover, not a caused causer, etc.). It invites logical fallacy to use the statements as positive definitions rather than negative exclusions. *Name: Each Way concludes not with \\"It is proven\\" or \\"therefore God exists\\" etc., but with a formulation that \\"this everyone understands as God\\" or \\"to which everyone gives the name of God\\" or \\"this all men speak of as God\\" or \\"this being we call God\\", etc. In other words, the Five Ways do not attempt to prove God exists, they attempt to demonstrate what we call God, which is a subtly different thing. Some commentators state that \\"He did not write them as demonstrations of God's existence but arguments for something we already accept.\\" *Medieval science not epistemology: Demonstration in the medieval theology of Aquinas comes from Aristotle's Posterior Analytics: *Further treatments: In the Question of the Summa theologica: in Article I, Aquinas finds that the existence of God is not self-evident to humans. In Article II, he says that the approach of demonstration a postiori can be used to go trace back to assert the a priori existence of God. Article III (i.e., the Five Ways) is a summary or application of this approach, but not intended to be complete or exhaustive. Fuller arguments are taken up in later sections of the Summa theologiae, and other publications. For example, in the Summa contra gentiles SCG I, 13, 30, he clarifies that his arguments do not assume or presuppose that there was a first moment in time. A commentator notes that Thomas does not think that God could be first in a temporal sense (rather than ontological sense) because God exists outside of time. *Terminology: In the Summa theologica presentation, Aquinas deliberately switched from using the term demonstrabile (a logical or mathematical proof) to using probile (an argument or test or proving ground).https://www.catholic.com/magazine/print-edition/five-ways-or-five- proofs A more accurate translation would be \\"The existence of God can be argued for in five ways.\\" That he deliberately switched terms away from a term used for proof indicates a signal of an intent or nuance. Controversy=Philosophical Criticism of the cosmological argument, and hence the first three Ways, emerged in the 18th century by the philosophers David Hume and Immanuel Kant. Kant argued that our minds give structure to the raw materials of reality and that the world is therefore divided into the phenomenal world (the world we experience and know), and the noumenal world (the world as it is \\"in itself,\\" which we can never know). Since the cosmological arguments reason from what we experience, and hence the phenomenal world, to an inferred cause, and hence the noumenal world, since the noumenal world lies beyond our knowledge we can never know what's there. Kant also argued that the concept of a necessary being is incoherent, and that the cosmological argument presupposes its coherence, and hence the arguments fail. Hume argued that since we can conceive of causes and effects as separate, there is no necessary connection between them and therefore we cannot necessarily reason from an observed effect to an inferred cause. Hume also argued that explaining the causes of individual elements explains everything, and therefore there is no need for a cause of the whole of reality. The 20th-century philosopher of religion Richard Swinburne argued in his book, Simplicity as Evidence of Truth, that these arguments are only strong when collected together, and that individually each of them is weak. The 20th-century Catholic priest and philosopher Frederick Copleston devoted much of his work to a modern explication and expansion of Aquinas' arguments. More recently the prominent Thomistic philosopher Edward Feser has argued in his book Aquinas: A Beginner‚Äôs Guide that Dawkins, Hume, Kant, and most modern philosophers do not have a correct understanding of Aquinas at all; that the arguments are often difficult to translate into modern terms. He has defended the arguments in a book at length. Atheist philosopher J.H. Sobel offers objections to the first three Ways by challenging the notion of sustaining efficient causes and a concurrent actualizer of existence. Leading Atheist philosopher Graham Oppy has offered critiques of the arguments in his exchanges with Edward Feser and in his published work. Popular Biologist Richard Dawkins' book The God Delusion argues against the Five Ways. In Why there almost certainly is a God: Doubting Dawkins, philosopher Keith Ward claims that Richard Dawkins mis-stated the five ways, and thus responds with a straw man. For example, for the fifth Way, Dawkins places it in the same position for his criticism as the Watchmaker analogy- when in fact, according to Ward, they are vastly different arguments. Ward defended the utility of the five ways (for instance, on the fourth argument he states that all possible smells must pre-exist in the mind of God, but that God, being by his nature non-physical, does not himself stink) whilst pointing out that they only constitute a proof of God if one first begins with a proposition that the universe can be rationally understood. Nevertheless, he argues that they are useful in allowing us to understand what God will be like given this initial presupposition. Eastern Orthodox theologian David Bentley Hart says that Dawkins \\"devoted several pages of The God Delusion to a discussion of the 'Five Ways' of Thomas Aquinas but never thought to avail himself of the services of some scholar of ancient and medieval thought who might have explained them to him ... As a result, he not only mistook the Five Ways for Thomas's comprehensive statement on why we should believe in God, which they most definitely are not, but ended up completely misrepresenting the logic of every single one of them, and at the most basic levels.\\" Hart said of Dawkins treatment of Aquinas' arguments that: ReferencesFurther reading *Reality: A Synthesis of Thomistic Thought: Chapter 7: The Proofs Of God's Existence by Reginald Garrigou-Lagrange *  External links  * New Advent, Translation of the Summa Theologica * External links section of Wikipedia's Summa Theologica article.

In 1998 he was promoted to associate professor, and in 1999, McCartin took a position at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., where he is now a professor and the executive director of the Kalmanovitz Initiative for Labor and the Working Poor. His brother is noted Catholic historian James McCartin. Research focus McCartin is a historical institutionalist whose research focuses on the history of labor unions in the United States during the 20th century. McCartin is a strong advocate of industrial democracy, an economic arrangement in which workers share in the management of the workplace. He has challenged many of the labor movement's closely held beliefs, including the idea that the PATCO air traffic controllers' strike of 1981 began, rather than culminated, an attack on labor rights in the United States.Joseph A.

G. Wodehouse. It first appeared in 1921 as a serial in the Woman's Home Companion in the United States under the title Three Men and a Maid. It was first published as a book in the United States on April 26, 1922, by George H. Doran, New York, and as The Girl on the Boat in the United Kingdom by Herbert Jenkins, London, on June 15, 1922.McIlvaine, E.; Sherby, L.S.; and Heineman, J.H. (1990) P.G. Wodehouse: A Comprehensive Bibliography and Checklist. New York: James H. Heineman, pp. 39-40. . Plot The maid of the title is red-haired, dog- loving Wilhelmina \\"Billie\\" Bennett, and the three men are: * Bream Mortimer, a long-time and long-suffering suitor of Billie; * Eustace Hignett, a shy poet who is cowed by his domineering mother but secretly engaged to Billie at the opening of the tale; * Sam Marlowe, Eustace's dashing cousin, who falls in love with Billie \\"at first sight\\". The four of them find themselves together on a White Star ocean liner called the Atlantic, sailing for England. Also on board is a capable young woman, Jane Hubbard, who is in love with Eustace. Wodehousian funny stuff ensues, with happy endings for all except Bream Mortimer. Film adaptation A film adaptation was made in 1961, starring Norman Wisdom as Sam Marlowe, Richard Briers as Eustace Hignett, Philip Locke as Bream Mortimer, and Millicent Martin as Billie Bennett. It was directed by Henry Kaplan. The screenplay was adapted from Wodehouse's novel by Reuben Ship. Some scenes from the novel (e.g., Sam Marlowe's blackface performance at the ship's concert) were not included in the film. The romance between Eustace and Jane Hubbard (played by Sheila Hancock) was also altered; Eustace stands up to his domineering mother in the film but not in the book. See also * The Girl on the Boat (film) Historical Reference The White Star Line had a ship called the Atlantic, which operated from 1871 to 1873, when it struck a rock off Nova Scotia and sank with the loss of about 535 lives. As this disaster occurred 48 years before the publishing of the story, and 8 years before Wodehouse was born, it is unlikely that he knew about it. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Atlantic ReferencesExternal links *The Russian Wodehouse Society's page, with numerous book covers and a list of characters *Free eBook of The Girl on the Boat at Project Gutenberg *Free eBook of Three Men and a Maid at Project Gutenberg * and * Category:Novels by P.

Matthew Silver appeared as an infant Ben between 1996 and 1998, and Morgan Whittle played him as a toddler between 1999 and 2001. After a five- year absence from the series, Charlie Jones assumed the role of Ben in 2006. In 2010, the character was recast with Joshua Pascoe in the role, who made his first appearance on 13 December 2010. Pascoe quit the role in 2012 and Ben departed on 24 August 2012. Ben's return was announced in May 2014 with actor Harry Reid in the role; Ben returned on 22 September 2014. Reid was written out of the series in 2017 and Ben departed on 12 January 2018. The character was reintroduced in 2019 with the role recast to Max Bowden. Ben returned on 1 April 2019. Ben's storylines include: a feud between the show's Mitchell and Beale families for his custody; developing a love of dance and the arts, which is a source of tension between him and his father, Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden); being physically and mentally abused by Phil's girlfriend Stella Crawford (Sophie Thompson); struggling to come to terms with his homosexuality and then attempting to hide it before coming out; being imprisoned for manslaughter after unintentionally killing Heather Trott (Cheryl Fergison); having a daughter, Lexi Pearce, with Lola Pearce (Danielle Harold), finding out his mother is alive, supporting Louise after her bullies cause her burnt injury, relationships with Paul Coker (Jonny Labey) and the closeted Callum \\"Halfway\\" Highway (Tony Clay), coming to terms with Paul's death, being shot by Hunter Owen (Charlie Winter), blackmailing Martin Fowler (James Bye), helping his dad figure out who the father of Sharon's baby is, losing his hearing after sustaining an injury during the boat crash and going into crime with Danny Hardcastle (Paul Usher). As played by Jones, Ben received generally poor reviews from critics. Grace Dent of The Guardian wrote several negative opinion pieces on the character, and contacted the BBC with a list of suggestions for humorous storylines in which he could be killed off. However, the storyline where Ben was abused by Stella won \\"Best Storyline\\" at the 2007 Inside Soap Awards, and was nominated for the \\"Best Soap Storyline\\" accolade at the TV Quick and TV Choice Awards. In 2012, Pascoe was nominated \\"Villain of the Year\\", but lost out to Andrew Lancel (Coronation Street). Lisa O'Connell, also writing for The Guardian, was complimentary of Ben's later, protracted coming out storyline, which she called \\"a perfect foundation for years of dramatic conflict\\". Storylines=1996‚Äì2012 Ben is born to Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) and his then wife Kathy Beale (Gillian Taylforth) in March 1996. Ben becomes ill and is rushed to hospital, where he is diagnosed with meningitis and he is left partially deaf in one ear. As Kathy gives Ben all her affection, Phil turns to alcohol and has an affair with Lorna Cartwright (Janet Dibley), resulting in the breakdown of their marriage. In 1998, Kathy moves to South Africa and takes Ben with her. He accompanies her on two return visits in 1999 before returning with her to South Africa in early 2000. In 2001, Kathy marries a man named Gavin Sullivan (then an unseen character; later played by Paul Nicholas). The same year, Ben briefly returns to stay with Phil who then takes him back to South Africa. In 2006, the residents hear that Kathy and Gavin have been killed in a car accident, so Ben (now played by Charlie Jones) returns to England to live with his half-brother, Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt). He eventually moves in with Phil, after Phil wins a long custody battle. Ben dislikes Phil's new girlfriend Stella Crawford (Sophie Thompson), who in turn feels that Ben is intruding on their relationship. She abuses Ben physically and psychologically, from burning him with a hot spoon, also attempting to spoil his friendship with Abi Branning (Lorna Fitzgerald) when she discovers this, to threatening to kill Phil if Ben tells anyone about her actions. Phil and Stella become engaged. On their wedding day in July 2007, Ben admits that Stella has been abusing him; she commits suicide by jumping from a roof. Phil, a recovering alcoholic, begins drinking again in the aftermath, but resumes a life of sobriety for Ben's sake. Unbeknown to Phil, Ben develops an interest in dancing. He secretly takes classes, passing a dance exam, and is ultimately able to gain Phil's approval. In March 2010, Phil's daughter Louise Mitchell (Brittany Papple) comes to stay with the Mitchell family. She steals Ben's diary and fakes an entry which suggests he is gay. In retaliation, Ben burns Louise's hand the same way Stella burnt his. He later locks Louise in a summerhouse for a day in May 2010, then pretends to find her to earn approval from his father. Louise blames Jordan Johnson (Michael-Joel David Stuart), an acquaintance of Ben's, but when Phil sees burn marks on Louise's arm, she reveals that Ben is to blame. Phil worries Ben is copying Stella, and punches him when he catches Ben about to burn Louise again. Questioned as to why he hurt Louise, Ben claims that Jordan is bullying him. Phil advises Ben to fight back; soon after, Ben attacks Jordan with a spanner, leaving him with a fractured skull. Phil warns him against admitting to the attack, but Ben confesses and moves in with Ian. After hearing from Crown Court Ben could spend time in juvenile detention, Phil plans to send him to live with his brother Grant Mitchell (Ross Kemp) abroad, but Ben refuses thanks to his grandmother, Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor), making him change his mind, after Phil's girlfriend Shirley Carter (Linda Henry) overhears Phil discussing the plans to Ben and receives an eight-month sentence as a result. In July 2010, Phil indeed blames Peggy for Ben's sentencing. Ben tells Peggy and Phil he is coping despite being bullied by Cal Childs (Danny Barnham), and when the Mitchell family discovers this Ben asks them not to visit him. Ben, (now played by Joshua Pascoe) is released, and arrives home to discover Jay Brown (Jamie Borthwick), the foster child of Phil's relative Billy (Perry Fenwick), has usurped his place in Phil's affections. Ben is jealous of Jay initially but does develop a 'brotherly' relationship with him. Ben vents his anger at those who cross him, punching Phil in the face and pushing Phil's aunt Glenda Mitchell (Glynis Barber) down a flight of stairs for ruining his home coming party. Ben attends a gym and shares his first kiss with boxer, Duncan Willis (Steven France). When they are seen kissing by shopkeeper Patrick Trueman (Rudolph Walker), Ben throws a brick through Patrick's window and tries to intimidate him into not going public about his homosexuality. Phil observes and misinterprets their altercation, believing Patrick is assaulting Ben. He launches a vendetta against Patrick. After Duncan confronts Ben about his victimisation of Patrick he tells him their kiss didn't mean anything and cuts ties with him, Ben confesses to Phil. Disgusted his son is gay, Phil pushes Ben away, terrified his homosexuality will ruin his reputation. Ben develops feelings for Christian Clarke (John Partridge), who is also gay but engaged to his boyfriend Syed Masood (Marc Elliott). Ben tries to split them up and attempts to kiss Christian. After being rejected, Ben claims Christian touched him inappropriately as revenge. Phil goes into a violent rampage, hitting Christian with a baseball bat, which prompts Ben to admit the truth. In the wake of this, Phil tries to accept Ben's homosexuality. Billy's granddaughter, Lola Pearce (Danielle Harold), offers to have sex with Ben to test his sexuality. Ben loses his virginity to Lola in October 2011 and concludes that he is definitely gay. Ben is later concerned to discover Lola is pregnant, however she denies he is the father. Ben continues to feel angst towards Phil for rejecting him. He anonymously stalks Phil, terrorising him with evidence about his past crimes, including a newspaper clip of the death of Steve Owen (Martin Kemp). DCI Jill Marsden (Sophie Stanton), who has been attempting to imprison Phil for over a decade, opens an investigation. She interviews Ben regarding Stella's death in 2007. Ben tells her that Phil forced Stella to jump off a building on threat of being pushed. Phil plans to flee the country before arrest, but is stalled by Ben, who reveals himself as his father's stalker. Phil is charged with Stella's murder and when the Mitchell family discover Ben's involvement in his father's arrest, they disown him. Ben's brother Ian eventually discovers Ben lied to DCI Marsden and informs the police. Phil is released; however, Ben mistakingly believes he has been betrayed by Heather Trott (Cheryl Fergison), who also knows he set Phil up. He confronts Heather in fear and desperation, and hits her over the head with a metal picture frame, killing her. Phil returns from prison moments after Heather's murder. Feeling responsible for his son's behaviour, Phil covers up Ben's involvement with Jay's help, who was present when Heather was killed. Shirley, Phil's fianc√©e, discovers Heather's body, and as she was her best friend, she vows to find the killer. Worried she will discover the truth, Ben convinces Phil to break-up with Shirley and she is thrown out of their home, while Jay is so traumatised by Heather's murder that he moves out of the Mitchells'. Ben and Phil wrestle with guilt and argue regularly, with Phil turning to alcohol. Needing to confide in someone, Ben admits his crime to Ian; the confession contributes to Ian's mental breakdown, and amidst threats from Phil to stay silent, Ian absconds, leaving Phil and Ben searching for him to no avail. Ben fails to dispose of the photo frame and it is taken by Jean Slater (Gillian Wright), who is collecting for charity. It is put into the charity shop and later is discovered by Shirley, who realises it is the murder weapon. Tracing it back to the Mitchell house, she confronts Phil, believing him to be the killer, but Ben gives himself away during the argument. Shirley is furious and nearly drowns Ben, but Phil intervenes and convinces Shirley to talk to Ben about why he killed Heather. However, they find Ben gone and he confesses to the police. DCI Marsden does not believe him at first, but he is later arrested for murder. He is charged the next day, and Phil's solicitor Ritchie Scott (Sian Webber) informs Phil that Ben could face up to 10 years in prison. Phil tries to persuade Ben to change his statement, however Ben insists that he needs to be punished. Ben refuses to have any contact with anyone until he is released. In October 2012, Ben's murder charge is dropped and Phil is told he will be tried for manslaughter, to which he will plead guilty. Ben then agrees to a visit from Phil, and Phil plans to tell Ben that he is the father of Lola's daughter, Lexi Pearce, though he decides not to. Ben is sentenced to four years imprisonment and discovers he is Lexi's father after a visit from Lola. 2014‚Äì2018 After witnessing Ian's grief following his daughter Lucy Beale's (Hetti Bywater) murder (see \\"Who Killed Lucy Beale?\\"), Phil decides to get in touch with Ben; however, Ritchie reveals that Ben was released the previous month. Phil cannot get hold of him, although Jay has seen Ben twice since his release. In September Ben (now played by Harry Reid) returns to Walford when he learns that Phil is having an affair with Shirley days before his wedding to Sharon Rickman (Letitia Dean). Ben initially tries to convince his father to reunite with Shirley, but forms a bond with Sharon when she accepts him into the family and acts as Phil's best man at the wedding. After the wedding, Shirley shoots Phil whilst struggling with Sharon. Ronnie asks Ben and Jay to get rid of the gun. Ben meets Johnny Carter (Sam Strike) and is attracted to him, but when Johnny makes a move Ben reacts badly and says he is not gay and that his interest in men was a phase. He then starts a relationship with Abi in an effort to prove it to Phil and Johnny. When Johnny later leaves the square, he tells Ben not to hide who he truly is. Although Ben continues to deny his attraction to men, he later misinterprets a brotherly moment with Jay and tries to kiss him. Jay later tells Abi, but then lies and says he made it up when he sees how upset she is. Ben eventually confesses to Abi that he's still attracted to men but, desperate to keep him, Abi decides to stay with him, saying their relationship is about more than sex. However, Ben is later seen looking at a gay contacts app on his smartphone. Ben had instructed Jay to bury Lucy's purse and phone, which has been missing since her death. Denise Fox (Diane Parish) digs them up in Patrick Trueman's (Rudolph Walker) allotment and takes them to Ian, who calls the police before Ben convinces him that he found them on Good Friday in a bag in the Square and had no part in Lucy's murder. Ian lies to the police and protects Ben. When Phil is arrested on suspicion of attempting to kill Ronnie, he puts Ben in charge of his garage. Max Branning (Jake Wood) starts helping him with deals, only to trick Ben into signing over the garage to him as revenge for the death of his girlfriend Emma Summerhayes (Anna Acton), which Max has blamed Phil for, though Phil eventually gets the garage back. Ben then starts a sexual relationship with Paul Coker (Jonny Labey), whilst maintaining his relationship with Abi. Ben grows frustrated with Abi's controlling behaviour, and she is suspicious, so Ben has sex with her to allay her fears. Phil catches Ben and Paul half-naked together at the car lot, and angrily tells Ben to leave as he broke his trust, both in hiding his homosexuality and being loyal to Abi. Ben ends his relationship with Paul, leaving Paul heartbroken. Paul tries to speak to Ben on numerous occasions, but fails to win Ben's affections over. Ben and Abi decide to find their own home after realising they can no longer stay with Phil after Sharon leaves him. Ben and Paul flirt and arrange to go to the cinema but when Abi finds them and leaves in anger feeling Ben is not taking their plans seriously, Ben follows her, leaving Paul alone. Paul later tells Ben that he loves him and says Ben must decide who really wants and accept who he really is. To give himself more time, Ben books tickets for Abi to visit a friend on holiday, and then tells Paul he loves him back. Jay sees them kissing, and tells Ben to admit to Abi that he loves Paul. When Phil is later sent to hospital and informed that he will be dead within 12 months unless he has a liver transplant, Ben, alongside Sharon and Jay, refuse to visit him, and Sharon has him change the locks on the house so Phil cannot enter when he is discharged. Ben comes to terms with the fact that his mother Kathy has returned to Walford after faking her own death at the hands of her husband, Gavin. He initially refuses to talks to her, disgusted at the fact that she pretended to be dead for almost ten years, but they reconcile. After Abi returns from her trip to Paris with her friend, she realises that Ben may be having an affair with Paul. Ben plans to break up with Abi, but Abi has been manipulated by Babe Smith (Annette Badland), who tells her to announce she is pregnant so that Ben will not leave her. Abi does this publicly and then plans to get pregnant for real but Ben says they cannot have sex because he thinks he may have caught an STI from a stranger, so Abi resorts to having sex with Lee Carter (Danny-Boy Hatchard) to try to get pregnant. Ben discovers he has chlamydia, and Abi also has it. She later fakes a miscarriage in an attempt to end her pregnancy lie, but when she upsets Babe, Babe writes Ben a letter revealing the truth. The letter is read by Louise (now played by Tilly Keeper), who has returned, and to keep her from showing it to Ben, Abi allows her to use Phil's credit card. When Ben finds the card, he confronts Abi, but she believes he found the letter so inadvertently reveals she was never pregnant and says that Louise was blackmailing her. Ben takes revenge on Louise in The Queen Vic by putting her head in the toilet. He then seduces Abi and takes her top off, but then drags her into the main bar of the pub, revealing via a karaoke microphone that she invented the pregnancy. Ben then resumes his relationship with Paul with the support of most of his friends and family. Following an agreement with Les and Pam, who make plans to retire and leave Walford, Ben and Paul make arrangements to become the new managers of Coker and Sons. In celebration, they spend a night out together, and are not seen again the next day. Ben's family are alerted by the police that a dead young man whom they believe to be Ben has been found, having been involved in a fight, but upon inspection, the victim is revealed to be Paul. Ben is found by Buster Briggs (Karl Howman) after managing to make his way back to Walford, albeit with major injuries. He explains that he and Paul were cornered by four large men and chased after coming out of a night club, and were separated when running away. When informed of Paul's death, he lashes out in a violent rage, before breaking down in tears in Kathy and Phil's arms. Ben later visits the Queen Vic to join his neighbours in a toast to Paul's memory, but Paul's grandmother Pam Coker (Lin Blakley) blames him for Paul's death and dubs him the worst thing to ever happen to Paul, wishing he had died instead. Ben wishes the same, and later confesses to Johnny (now played by Ted Reilly) that he and Paul were victims of homophobic namecalling, and despite Paul insisting they ignore the culprits, Ben confronted the men, causing the attack, and thus blames himself for Paul's death. Johnny encourages Ben to report this to the police, and Ben recognises one of the attackers outside the police station. Using the man's car registration number, he gets an address and demands a gun from Phil to seek revenge. Phil tricks Ben and does not get a gun, so Ben goes missing. He returns, having failed to find the man. Paul's body is released, and Ben realises Jay has been using cocaine. Jay and Ben decide to help each other move on from their problems, so Ben decides to let the police find the attackers. However, Ben and Jay change their minds, agreeing to take revenge and then leave Walford together. Louise worries that Ben may be about to get into trouble so asks help from Paul's grandfather, Les Coker (Roger Sloman), who tells Ben not to put his family through what he and Pam are going through, as Ben could be killed too. Ben does promise not to track down Paul's killers but when Jay finds an address and says Ben will regret doing nothing, Ben and Jay leave. They return to Walford after Louise calls to the police, but are then kidnapped by the attackers at the Mitchell home. Ben is rescued by his uncle, Grant, and Grant's son Mark Fowler (Ned Porteous). Jay, who the killers trapped in a van, flees when the police appear. Ben later says a farewell to Jay, who leaves Walford shortly after Paul's funeral and Jay says that they will always be brothers. However, he returns not too long after. Not wanting Phil to die, Ben decides to donate part of his liver to him, but a doctor tells them it will still take time. Despite Ben's discovery that Phil has cut him out of his will, he proceeds with his plan to donate part of his liver, but he is refused by the hospital who are unsatisfied with his answers and emotional responses when interviewed. However, Phil eventually gets a liver transplant. While Phil and Sharon are on holiday, Ben and Jay move to their own house (18 Albert Square). On Ben's 21st birthday, Jay throws the pair a housewarming party, where Ben and Johnny have a one-night stand after getting drunk. The next day, they both worry that the other wants a relationship but are relieved to realise they just see each other as friends. After Louise suffers severe burns following a disaster at a school prom, against Sharon's request Ben calls Phil who is Italy recovering from his transplant. Ben signs the paperwork for The Arches when Phil decides to hand it over to him and Sharon is left stunned when he decides to give Jay the car lot land. Kathy insists to Phil that he justifies his reasons to Ben about giving Jay the car lot land that is worth more than The Arches. Ben finds a solicitor's letter of Phil's that mentions Raymond and after confronting Phil, Phil tells Ben that Raymond is his half-brother. Ben is angry with Phil for making him feel second best to Phil and Sharon's other children. Ben learns that Phil offered Jay the car lot out of guilt for killing his apparent biological father, Alan Hall, a victim of the car lot fire that Phil had caused 23 years previously in an insurance scam. After a fight with Jay, they make amends. Ben meets Luke Browning (Adam Astill), the son of James Willmott-Brown (William Boyde), who raped Kathy 30 years previously but is unaware of his identity. They end up kissing and start a sexual relationship, until Ben learns of Luke's family background when Willmott-Brown secretly visits Kathy, and Ben goes to visit Luke with the intention of confronting Willmott-Brown. When Ben meets Willmott-Brown in his office, he confronts him over his actions towards Kathy with a crowbar. Willmott-Brown tells Ben that the sex was consensual and convinces him that he should doubt Kathy's honesty. Ben almost attacks Willmott-Brown but Luke stops him. Feeling that Ben does not trust her, Kathy considers leaving Walford. Ben reluctantly decides to end his relationship with Luke due to the conflicts of interest between Kathy and Willmott-Brown. After a heart to heart with Ben, Kathy decides to remain in Walford and gives Ben and Luke's relationship her blessing. Ben plays a prank on Luke, which backfires when Luke grabs Ben's wrist and threatens him. However, Luke later apologises. Ben accidentally takes Luke's wallet and finds a business card with the words 'Project Dagmar', and confronts Luke about the project as the Dagmar was the bar that Willmott-Brown owned and Kathy worked in when he raped her. Luke lashes out at Ben and physically threatens him. Realising that Ben is a risk to the project being exposed, Luke ends their relationship. Hurt and confused, Ben asks Abi's sister Lauren Branning (Jacqueline Jossa), who works for Luke's firm, Weyland & Co, about the project but she does not know about it. Luke tries to apologise to Ben by buying him a car but Ben continues to reject Luke and he attacks and brutally beats Ben, so Phil asked his old prison cellmate Aidan Maguire (Patrick Bergin) for help and have Luke kidnapped and he is not seen again; it later transpires that Luke was brutally killed by Aidan despite Phil's merely requesting that they scare Luke and not kill him. Following Luke's death and Willmott-Brown's eventual downfall, Phil joins Aidan in a planned heist and they use The Arches to steal the money. However, the stolen money and jewellery goes missing and it is revealed that Ben realized what was going on and stole it from the funeral home where it was being hidden. He sells the jewellery but keeps one necklace, giving it to Kathy, and then plans to leave the country. He leaves after writing a note for Jay. He is cornered on the ferry by Ian's former wife Mel Owen (Tamzin Outhwaite) who warns him to give her the money or he will soon be dead. Ben refuses, saying he only took what he deserved. Mel makes a phone call to someone, telling them that Ben is all theirs. When Ben arrives in France, he is stunned to find the money has been replaced by newspapers. However, he is relieved to discover an envelope full of cash in his pocket. Ben gleefully heads for a new life, unaware that Aidan's former wife Ciara (Denise McCormack) is watching him. 2019‚Äìpresent When Phil and Keanu Taylor (Danny Walters) end up in some trouble in Spain, Phil forges Ben's signature, causing Kathy to call Ben to come home, Ben (now played by Max Bowden) returns with Lola and their daughter, Lexi, and after seeing the trouble Phil is in, he agrees to help him. However, it is soon revealed Ben is planning to steal Phil's money and leave him broke and he makes Lola follow every instruction, causing him to get annoyed when she ignores him and ends up kissing Jay in The Queen Vic, however it's soon revealed Lola has a fianc√© called Ewan. Ben secretly witnesses Callum \\"Halfway\\" Highway (Tony Clay) attempting to harm himself in the playground. After Ben talks to Halfway about the incident, Halfway then purchases a van from Ben as a gift to his girlfriend Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty), although he is later pulled over by the police, who inform him that the van is stolen. Halfway confronts Ben and demands a refund; when Halfway attacks him, Ben realises that Halfway is attracted to men, which Halfway denies. He then punches Ben when he mocks him. The two later share a kiss. Halfway continues to deny his attraction men while Ben knows he is living a lie so Halfway proposes to Whitney and she agrees. When Ben learns that Phil has replaced him with Keanu in his will, he is furious. However, he later witnesses Stacey Fowler (Lacey Turner) attack Phil with a wrench, to stop the latter from killing her husband Martin Fowler (James Bye). He tells them to leave the scene, saying he will sort it out. Martin and Stacey go on the run to avoid prison. Ben incriminates Keanu in the attack which leads to the latter's arrest. Ben later attempts to kill Phil in hospital, but is stopped by Jay. When Phil regains consciousness, Ben tells him that Keanu, who has gone on the run with Louise, who is pregnant with his child, attacked him. However, Phil does not believe him and Stacey's cousin Kat Moon (Jessie Wallace) tells him that she attacked him to stop him killing Martin, thereby covering for Stacey. Ben later admits to Phil that Keanu had nothing to do with the attack and that he framed him because he knows about Phil's will. Furious, Phil disowns Ben. On the day before Halfway and Whitney's wedding, Halfway confesses to Whitney that he kissed Ben, leading her to call off their wedding. Just as Whitney is about to expose Halfway's secret to the packed pub, all of the residents are held hostage by Hunter Owen (Charlie Winter), who has escaped prison. Ben is shot in the siege, but is revived by Sonia Fowler (Natalie Cassidy). The attack on Ben leads to Phil forgiving his son and Ben and Halfway also get together. Martin soon returns to Walford to care for his daughter, Bex Fowler (Jasmine Armfield). He pleads with Ben to dispose of the wrench Stacey used to attack Phil, so that she and his kids can return home. However, Ben blackmails Martin into getting involved in criminal jobs for him, saying he will let Stacey come home when he wants to. Ben does dispose of the wrench but further blackmails Martin with footage of him stealing a car. An angry Martin punches Ben and it is then that a past incident of Martin dangling Ben from a railway bridge when he was a child is revisited. Ben says that he is bigger now and will not back down easily. Martin turns to Jack Branning (Scott Maslen), who has recently rejoined the police for advice, and he gets Ben and his accomplices arrested. Ben is however released on bail. He confronts Martin and the next morning, he tells Martin that he is sorry for what he has put him through and that Stacey is free to return to Walford. However, that evening, Ben and his henchmen kidnap Martin and hang him off the railway bridge, just as Martin did to Ben when he was younger. Ben threatens to have Stacey and their kids killed if she does not stay away and if Martin does not continue working for him. Phil, who was told by Louise's mother Lisa Fowler (Lucy Benjamin) that Sharon's unborn child is not his, coerces Ben and Keanu to kidnap Jack, who he thinks is the father of the baby. After several hours of interrogation, Phil has a bloodied and bruised Jack released and Ben takes him home, witnessed by Halfway, who becomes suspicious. Ben tries to reason with Phil, who wants to kill the father, but relents and agrees to help Phil. A few days later, Halfway questions Ben about his encounter with Jack and where their relationship is going. To protect Halfway from the Mitchells, Ben breaks up with Halfway, claiming that he does not love him. On Christmas Eve, after hearing identical stories from Keanu and Sharon about a hotel, Phil works out that Keanu is the father and Ben vows to have him killed. On Christmas Day, Ben orders Martin to kill Keanu. However, a hungover Linda Carter (Kellie Bright), who on Christmas Eve had drunkenly fallen asleep in the back of the van Martin uses to kidnap Keanu, saves Keanu's life and helps Martin fake the recording of Keanu's \\"murder\\" later shown to Ben. Unaware of this, Ben begins to feel guilty about causing Keanu's \\"death\\" and when Halfway returns and proclaims he wants him back, Ben admits his part in having Keanu killed, causing a stunned Halfway to storm out on him. During the 35th Anniversary week, the Queen Vic boat crashes due to a fight between Keanu, Phil and Ben. When the boat goes down, Ben hits his head and damages his hearing aid. This created the storyline about Ben becoming permanently deaf. Casting and characterisation Ben as portrayed by Charlie Jones in 2007 (left) and Joshua Pascoe in 2011 (right), with a \\"harder edge\\" in the latter depiction. Having previously appeared as a baby and a toddler, Ben returned to EastEnders in 2006 played by child actor Charlie Jones. Jones was cast alongside Megan Jossa, who would play his cousin Courtney Mitchell. While Ben is partially deaf, Jones is a hearing actor. The Guardian Rebecca Atkinson suggested that, as only the second disabled character in EastEnders history, Ben was introduced to fulfil a BBC quota. She criticised Jones' casting, and opined, \\"The use of able-bodied actors to play disabled characters is endemic. Maybe in theory there's nothing wrong with that, but while real disabled people are invisible it is downright offensive to persistently cast able-bodied people in disabled roles.\\" Scott Matthewman of The Stage sympathised with Atkinson's complaint, but defended Jones' casting: \\"it's hard enough to find good child actors who can cope with a soap opera environment at age 10, let alone ones that fit a character‚Äôs physical requirement set out the best part of a decade earlier.\\" Journalist Charlie Swinbourne, himself deaf, welcomed Ben's re-introduction for increasing high- profile deaf representation on television. During Jones' tenure, Ben was portrayed as being physically weak. McFadden described him as unable \\"to look after himself\\" when Ben was on the verge of being sent to a young offenders' institute. He subsequently took boxing lessons, and TV Mag Gemma Quade noted that Ben \\"refuse[d] to take the coward's way out\\" and flee the country with his father, but nonetheless was reduced to tears upon receiving a custodial sentence. In May 2010, it was announced that Ben would be written out of EastEnders as part of the show's revamp by executive producer Bryan Kirkwood. A spokesperson said that his departure would be \\"one of the biggest storylines of the summer\\", with long-lasting repercussions. Confirmation followed that Ben would be recast; Joshua Pascoe assumed the part and expressed his enthusiasm to \\"[make] the role of Ben [his] own.\\" Pascoe first appeared on 13 December 2010. Allison Maund of Inside Soap observed upon Ben's re- introduction that he bore \\"very little resemblance to the naive young boy he was before being sent down.\\" A later comment in the same publication contrasted the two portrayals; it described the character under Jones as \\"sweet young Ben, dancing around to Girls Aloud songs\\", and observed that as played by Pascoe, he seems \\"to be dancing to the Devil's tune these days\\". Pascoe took a break from the series in May 2011, during which Kirkwood stated that viewers may have failed to connect with his portrayal of Ben, as it differed significantly from Jones'. He deemed Ben a \\"very complex character\\" and said, \\"we will see a softer side to Ben when he returns, but the character has evolved. The character has been brutalised in his young offenders' institute and he's also the son of Phil.\\" Considering the character's potential, Kirkwood envisioned Ben and Jay Mitchell (Jamie Borthwick) becoming the new generation of Mitchell brothers, following on from Phil and Grant. In May 2012 it was announced that Pascoe would be leaving the role at the end of his current storyline. Pascoe made his last appearance on 24 August 2012 when Ben went to prison for manslaughter. On 14 May 2014, Digital Spy revealed Ben would be returning, with another recast later in the year. Harry Reid's casting as Ben was announced on 18 July. Reid made his first appearance in the role on 22 September 2014. On 2 October 2017 it was announced that Reid would be leaving the show after the character was axed by Executive Producer John Yorke. He confirmed that he would finish filming in December 2017. He made his final appearance on 16 January 2018. One-year later, in January 2019, it was announced that Ben would be returning to the show with the role recast again to Max Bowden who began filming that same month. He made his first appearance on 1 April 2019. Bowden's incarnation of Ben remained hard-edged and struggled to find a softer side. Bowden believed that the most interesting story was about finding who Ben is \\"deep down\\". Ben has \\"a lot of bravado and a lot to be said about who he portrays himself on the outer, but there's so much history and so much darkness.\\" But he believed that there is a softer side to Ben which he hoped could be fully explored. Storyline development=Introduction (1996) Shortly after Ben's birth in 1996, he became the second character in EastEnders history to contract meningitis‚Äîthe first being Vicki Fowler in 1989. As a result, he lost his hearing in one ear.Smith 2005, p. 185. This launched a storyline which highlighted \\"the depth of ignorance surrounding HIV and Aids in Walford\\", when Ben's parents blamed HIV-positive resident Mark Fowler (Todd Carty) for causing his illness.Smith 2005, pp. 105‚Äì06. Phil and Kathy's marriage collapsed by the end of the year;Smith 2005, p. 83. jealous of having to share his wife's attention with Ben, Phil became an alcoholic, and at one point snatched Ben and abandoned him beside a fire. In April 1998, Kathy took Ben and moved to South Africa, where her brother Ted lived.Smith 2005, p. 126. For many years afterwards, Ben and Phil had a long- distance relationship. This led Kate Lock, author of Who's Who in EastEnders to assess in 2000 that away from his father's influence, \\"the chances of Ben developing normally are probably better than most.\\" Car crash In 2007, Ben was part of a storyline in which he, his father, Ian and Peter Beale (Thomas Law) were involved in a car accident, when the Range Rover they were travelling in crashed into a lake. The scenes cost ¬£1 million to produce and were filmed in Surrey over four days, partly in a specially designed stunt tank. Jones had both a stunt double and dummy to supplement his scenes. Despite being one of the most expensive stunts ever filmed by a soap opera, the episode drew EastEnders lowest ever audience share and second lowest ratings due to a scheduling conflict with ITV's Emmerdale. Child abuse by Stella Crawford EastEnders scriptwriters worked closely with the NSPCC on the storyline which saw Ben abused by his soon-to-be stepmother, Stella Crawford (Sophie Thompson). According to Thompson, the best aspect of the storyline was that she and Jones \\"felt so safe and comfortable with each other as actors. And obviously we knew that we were both just telling a story and it was far from real.\\" Explaining the motivation behind Stella's abuse of Ben, she revealed: \\"As far as Ben's concerned, she sees him as an obstacle which she has to overcome to get what she wants. And the fact she doesn't understand unconditional love, the fact she's never experienced it, goes a long way in explaining why she's treating Ben the way she is. Ultimately, Ben's in her way and she realises that she has a hold over him and she'll use that power to get him out of the way and to get that ring on her finger she has longed for.\\" Sexuality It was reported in July 2011 that Ben would come out as a homosexual. He became the third gay character in the series at the time, and the sixteenth in its history. Kirkwood commented, \\"For EastEnders viewers, it was never a question of if, but more like when Ben Mitchell was going to come out as gay. The Mitchells represent the spirit of EastEnders ‚Äì tough, loyal and uncompromising. To see a man like Phil learn to deal with, and ultimately accept, his gay son, is a valid story for a drama like EastEnders to embark on.\\" McFadden stated that Phil had never considered the possibility of Ben's being gay, rather, he held an idealised view of his son and hoped he would become more like Jay, interested in \\"normal macho things\\". He explained that, while Phil could see his son was in turmoil, he was unaware of the depth of it, and believed Ben to be confused about his sexuality because of a prison assault. In contrast, Kirkwood stated his belief that Ben's coming out would not be a surprise to Phil, and that he had \\"probably been dreading this news for many years.\\" Scriptwriter Christopher Reason said that Ben's storyline would be a long-running one, which would see him \\"learn wrath\\" from his father. Heather Trott's murder and 2012 exit It was announced Fergison would be leaving EastEnders in 2012. Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy later reported Heather would be murdered by Ben during an argument at her flat. Kilkelly revealed further details of Heather's exit on 11 March 2012. He reported that Heather would die when Ben hits her with a picture frame, causing her to fall back and hit her head on a kitchen counter. In May 2012, it was announced that Pascoe had decided to leave the role. It was confirmed that the truth would come out about Heather Trott's (Cheryl Fergison) murder which would ultimately lead to Ben's departure, but how the truth would be revealed was being closely kept under wraps by EastEnders bosses although they did say it will be the outcome everyone is hoping for. He made his final appearance on 24 August 2012. Departure (2018) On 2 October 2017, it was announced that Ben would be written out of the soap again as part of an \\"explosive storyline\\". A show spokesperson confirmed the departure and commented, \\"Harry has been a great addition to the cast and we wish him all the best for the future.\\" Following the news of Reid's departure, EastEnders fans started to launch a petition to save Ben Mitchell from the axe and \\"don't lose the best Ben\\" that EastEnders had. After stealing a large sum of money, Ben leaves Walford for Calais after departing on a ferry. Ben's departure and Reid's final episodes in the role is originally broadcast on 12 January 2018. Reid explained that Ben leaves following the deaths of Abi and his boyfriend, Paul Coker (Jonny Labey), and a failed relationship with Luke Browning (Adam Astill). The actor believed that Ben had made the correct choice about leaving, but admitted his method was not ideal. He added that Phil would feel \\"very angry\\" and \\"betrayed\\" if he discovered Ben stole the money. Reid was pleased with his exit storyline and told Kilkelly (Digital Spy) that he would miss portraying \\"a very layered character\\". Reintroduction and recast (2019) Bowden began filming with the show in January 2019. Ben returns with his daughter, Lexi Pearce, and her mother, Ben's cousin Lola Pearce (Danielle Harold). He returned in the episode broadcast on 1 April 2019. Relationship with Callum Highway Producers lined up a new romance story between Ben and Callum \\"Halfway\\" Highway (Tony Clay), who is in a heterosexual relationship with Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty). The story was part of senior executive producer Kate Oates' plan to further diversify the show with more LGBT stories. She also believed that Callum was ideal for a story about exploring sexuality. Their involvement begins when Ben witnesses Callum injuring himself to avoid going back to the army. Ben sells a stolen van to Callum which is later detained by police. Callum confronts Ben about the scam and an argument ensues. The scene becomes sensual as the pair get close and Ben realises Callum's attraction to men. Ben teases Callum, who denies the accusations and states that he is happy with Whitney. Callum becomes violent and punches Ben when he continues to mock his sexuality. The scenes were not publicised in advance spoilers and came as a surprise to viewers. The following day at the British Soap Awards, Clay revealed that the story would be explored further. He said that the scene demonstrated that \\"something's clicked there, and something's sparked between them.\\" The story progressed rapidly over a weeks worth of episodes. Ben taunts Callum over his sexuality and he fears that Whitney will discover the truth. Callum asks his brother Stuart Highway (Ricky Champ) for help. Stuart locates Ben and threatens him to leave Callum alone. Writers also created scenes to get Ben and Callum closer, which play out at the latter's house warming party. Callum's flat was previously occupied by Ben's dead boyfriend Paul. Ben gets drunk and goes into Paul's old bedroom where he confides in Callum about how Paul's murder affected him. The show soon aired the pair's first kiss after Callum admits to Ben that he is lonely. They get into a passionate embrace and begin an affair. Clay told Daniel Kilkelly from Digital Spy that the Ben and Callum's affair would create typical EastEnders drama with \\"a bit of a fallout\\". He described the kiss as a \\"moment of ecstasy\\" and Callum felt \\"wonderful\\" with Ben. When the realisation of his infidelity occurs, Clay believed Callum feels ashamed for his treatment of Whitney. Callum's guilt spurs him on to proposing marriage to Whitney. Clay explained that there is \\"a massive contrast\\" between Ben and Callum but noted they shared some similarities and connections. He added \\"Callum may not just be someone that Ben can toy with ‚Äì there's something there.\\" Ben and Callum may be \\"polar opposites\\" but they both have a difficult relationship with their fathers. Bowden told Kilkelly that the \\"most interesting thing\\" is exploring their family backgrounds with similar upbringings. He stated that \\"they have common ground and Ben sees that. It is the first time I've been on the square and I've found common ground with someone.\\" Bowden also believed that Callum never really found \\"common ground\\" with another character until he met Ben. Clay agreed and added that their understanding of each other creates their romantic connection. The story provoked an instant positive reaction from media and viewer interest. Metro's Lindsay branded them \\"soap's most exciting couple in years.\\" He opined that \\"vengeful and bitter\\" Ben getting together with \\"awkward chap\\" Callum \\"sounds preposterous\\". But their \\"electric\\" kiss scene sent \\"fans wild\\". Samantha Bartlett from the Daily Star observed that \\"the smooch whipped viewers into a frenzy, judging by the online reaction.\\" When asked by Lindsay about the \\"fandom\\", Clay stated \\"I'm ready, bring it on! I'm prepared! [...] It‚Äôs really exciting to be part of a storyline in EastEnders that grips people.\\" Reception In 2007, Ben's abuse by Stella won Best Storyline at the Inside Soap Awards, and was nominated as the Best Soap Storyline at the TV Quick and TV Choice Awards. Ben as played by Jones received generally negative reviews from critics. The Guardian Grace Dent called him a \\"spooky little git\\", and her fellow Guardian writer Daniel Martin deemed him \\"gormless\\". As part of an EastEnders-themed drinking game, Digital Spy Alex Fletcher instructed players to drink beer every time Ben \\"is spotted whimpering on the stairs\\". Dent suggested that Phil and Ian's fighting over custody of Ben would turn him into \\"the next Jeffrey Dahmer\\", and in an article on the future of Britain's soap opera adolescents, noted that: \\"Albert Square will no doubt reap what it's sown with tiny, cursed, abused, accident- prone, 11-year-old Ben Mitchell. Oh it's going to be fun and games when Ben turns 16 and finds his inner anger.\\" Continuing this theme, Dent questioned \\"how far are they going to push this little boy?\\". She listed the many setbacks and problems Ben had encountered, and suggested that within five years, he would be \\"on top of the community centre with a rifle using [Peggy's] wig as target practice.\\" Dent later criticised a string of storylines which saw Ben endangered, from his abuse by Stella, to a car accident in which he almost drowned. She stated that his numerous pitfalls were becoming \\"a touch daft\\" and likened Ben to the often-killed South Park character Kenny McCormick. Dent hypothesised that the EastEnders scriptwriters \\"cheer themselves by conjuring up fresh ways to dispense with [Ben]\\" and said she had contacted the BBC with her own suggestions for creative deaths that might befall him. Kevin O'Sullivan of the Daily Mirror commented on \\"ballet- loving Ben's obsession with West End musicals, Judy Garland and dancing,\\" and in 2008 suggested that Ben was gay, pre-dating the character's coming out by three years. The Guardian Lisa O'Connell welcomed the eventual decision to have Ben come out, and called the plot \\"a perfect foundation for years of dramatic conflict\\", which would \\"no doubt test the filial relationship to the limits.\\" The November 2011 storyline which featured Ben's false molestation accusation against Christian, and Phil's subsequent attack on him, drew criticism from singer George Michael, who stated that EastEnders depiction of homosexuality was \\"insulting to the gay community.\\" A BBC spokesperson responded, \\"EastEnders reflects a wide range of issues. All soap characters face their own trials and tribulations in order to create drama, however EastEnders viewers will know that this is a story about Phil Mitchell who, while struggling with his own relationship with his son, will do anything to protect him.\\" On several occasions during his tenure, bookmakers have offered odds on Ben's storylines. In 2010, William Hill named him the 11/4 favourite to be found responsible for the whodunnit murder of Archie Mitchell. The culprit was revealed during the series' first live episode ‚Äì Jones was in third place at 7/1 odds to make a mistake during transmission. After Jones' departure was announced, despite confirmation that the role would be recast, Ben became the favourite to be the next character killed off.

The chronicles are listed under the name by which they are commonly referred to. Some chronicles are known under the name of the chronicler to whom they are attributed, while some of these writers also have more than one work to their name. Though works may cover more than one reign, each chronicle is listed only once, with the dates covered. Only post-conquest dates have been included. Though many chronicles claim to describe history \\"from the earliest times\\" (from Brutus, from the creation, ab urbe condita), they are normally only useful as historical sources for their own times. Some of the later works, such as Polydore Vergil and Thomas More, are as close to history in the modern sense of the word, as to medieval chronicles.

Film and Performing Arts  West Point Grey Academy's Fine and Performing Arts faculty is hosted in a dedicated Arts Wing (made up of several visual arts studios, a ceramics room, band room, drama room, choir room, recording studio, and wood-shop). Since 1997 the school's drama program has annually produced a large scale production with ticket sales open to the Greater Vancouver community. In 2005, the school produced its first musical, The Sound of Music, and has since strived to produce a musical every other year. In 2007 it put on The Wizard of Oz at the Richmond Gateway Theatre. The department put on Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice as adapted for the stage in 2009 with a production of Anne of Green Gables in 2010. In 2014, WPGA produced the musical, Grease. Their most recent production was Auntie Mame. The school's band and strings programs are quickly growing, regularly performing in the community. In April 2007 the school's concert band and choirs undertook their first international band trip to Disneyland in Anaheim, California. They've been going to numerous festivals and competitions every year including Kiwanis and Con Brio. Every May the school hosts a week-long celebration of the arts called Arts Week. During this week, classes are shortened to allow for artistic workshops and guest artists to give presentations. The evenings also feature large scale musical productions, including Coffee House Night, Mic-Night, and Cabaret Night.  Community service  The West Point Grey Academy campus The school and its student body continually stress the importance of community stewardship. The school hosts groups which regularly volunteer at the Union Gospel Mission as well as other local community based initiatives. In March 2006, six students and two teachers joined a Canadian team to travel to Tanzania to summit Mount Kilimanjaro in order to raise funds for the Stephen Lewis Foundation. They worked to generate HIV/AIDS Awareness in schools around the Lower Mainland, and succeeded in raising over $40,000 for charity. West Point Grey Academy was also responsible for reinstating the Vancouver Independent Schools' Charity Ball in February 2005, and in July 2007 successfully completed a school- building service trip to Ecuador. During the 2006-2007 school year, a number of WPGA students collaborated to plan, organize, and run Urban Aid, a benefit concert to raise money for Covenant House Vancouver. The concert showcased a number of Vancouver independent groups and artists, and was attended by over 300 high school students from around the Lower Mainland. The event raised over $5,000 for charity.  Debate and public speaking  WPGA's senior school competitive debate team is one of the most decorated teams on the national circuit. As the current home of the 2015 Canadian national champions, WPGA has won the national title more times than any other school. WPGA debaters have also qualified as one of two Canadian teams at the Oxford Finals (U.K. championships) five times in the past seven years, and six national debate squad teams, which represent Canada at the World Schools Debate Championships, have included WPGA students. Most recently, WPGA '15 alumni Lloyd Lyall was a member of the national debate team that appeared in the Grand Finals of the 2015 World Championship in Singapore. WPGA head coach, Ms. Tracey Lee, was national team coach from 2009 to 2011 and led the team that captured the 2010 World Champions title.

A coronary care unit (CCU) or cardiac intensive care unit (CICU) is a hospital ward specialized in the care of patients with heart attacks, unstable angina, cardiac dysrhythmia and (in practice) various other cardiac conditions that require continuous monitoring and treatment. Characteristics The main feature of coronary care is the availability of telemetry or the continuous monitoring of the cardiac rhythm by electrocardiography. This allows early intervention with medication, cardioversion or defibrillation, improving the prognosis. As arrhythmias are relatively common in this group, patients with myocardial infarction or unstable angina are routinely admitted to the coronary care unit. For other indications, such as atrial fibrillation, a specific indication is generally necessary, while for others, such as heart block, coronary care unit admission is standard. Utilization In the United States, cardiac conditions accounted for eight of the eighteen conditions and procedures with high ICU utilization (ICU utilization in more than 40% of stays) in 2011. Local differences In the United States, coronary care units are usually subsets of intensive care units (ICU) dedicated to the care of critically ill cardiac patients. These units are usually present in hospitals that routinely engage in cardiothoracic surgery. Invasive monitoring such as with pulmonary artery catheters is common, as are supportive modalities such as mechanical ventilation and intra-aortic balloon pumps (IABP). Certain hospitals, such as Johns Hopkins , maintain mixed units consisting of both acute care units for the critically ill, and intermediate care units for patients who are not critical. Acute coronary care Acute coronary care units (ACCUs), also called \\"critical coronary care units\\" (CCCUs), are equivalent to intensive care in the level of service provided. Patients with acute myocardial infarction, cardiogenic shock, or post-operative \\"open-heart\\" patients commonly abide here. Subacute coronary care Subacute coronary care units (SCCUs), also called progressive care units (PCUs), intermediate coronary care units (ICCUs), or stepdown units, provide a level of care intermediate to that of the intensive care unit and that of the general medical floor. These units typically serve patients who require cardiac telemetry, such as those with unstable angina. History Coronary care units developed in the 1960s when it became clear that close monitoring by specially trained staff, cardiopulmonary resuscitation and medical measures could reduce the mortality from complications of cardiovascular disease. The first description of a CCU was given in 1961 to the British Thoracic Society by Dr. Desmond Julian, who founded the first CCU at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh in 1964. Early CCUs were also located in Sydney, Kansas City, Toronto and Philadelphia. The first coronary care unit in the US was opened at Bethany Medical Center in Kansas City, Kansas by Dr Hughes Day, and he coined the term. Bethany Medical Center is also where the first \\"crash carts\\" were developed.Unplugged: Reclaiming Our Right to Die in America, William H. Colby Studies published in 1967 revealed that those observed in a coronary care setting had consistently better outcomes. DF Beck performed the first successful resuscitation of a physician with myocardial infarction in 1953, and pioneered the use of open-chest defibrillation. Dr. Zoll introduced external defibrillation in Boston in 1956, and Dr. Kouwenhoven and colleagues at Johns Hopkins highlighted the effectiveness of a combo of mouth-to-mouth, sternal compression, and closed chest defibrillation in restoring cardiac function in ventricular fibrillation patients. The first diagnostic angiogram was discovered by Dr. Mason Sones in 1958, due to an accidental injection of dye directly into the coronary artery rather than into the entire circulation - something that was previously believed to be fatal. These developments led to an interest in intensive care for myocardial infarction. In 1967, Thomas Killip and John Kimball published a report of 250 patients with acute MI's, who had experienced significantly better survival rates in CCUs compared to other institutions. This, along with other reports, led to an increase in coronary care units. Now catheterization units are commonplace in large cities.

The SGH-D500 was popular with consumers because of the large screen-size to front-surface ratio, the smooth button and sliding action, powerful flash, and good video/photograph/sound quality. The D500 was regarded as compact and as having a good feature set for its time. Samsung experienced remarkable success with the introduction of the D500 and has therefore introduced several other slider-style mobile phones in recent years, some fairly successful, others not so much. This phone helped to popularise the 'active' sliding phone concept across all brands. The SGH-D500 has been succeeded by the Samsung SGH-D600. There is a very similar variant handset, the SGH-D500E. Due to wireless networks supplying the D500 to customers with branded software, this phone is very often 'flashed' by owners. This removes/changes onscreen branding, the unpopular shortcut sidebar and non-optional sounds (e.g. branding sound on power-on/off). The new software can add features such as voice-dial and voice- command, and increased memory availability. The SGH-D500 received some criticism for not having expandable memory (via a memory slot). There are known issues with the screen of this phone. The screen connector can disconnect, resulting in no display ('white screen problem'). The screen is also vulnerable to being damaged through careless use or accidental impact.Discussion of D500 screen problems The phone was popular and sold 12 million units worldwide, also making it Samsung's first phone to sell over a million. side view ReferencesExternal links D500 Category:Mobile phones introduced in 2004 ","title":"Samsung SGH-D500"},{"id":"3763468","text":"The Courtauld Talks is a live album by English post-punk band Killing Joke, released in 1989 by Invisible Records.

It works by passing a multipacket buffer to the network interface card (NIC). The NIC then splits this buffer into separate packets. The technique is also called TCP segmentation offload (TSO) when applied to TCP, or generic segmentation offload (GSO). A similar concept to large segment offload for ingress traffic is large receive offload (LRO). LSO and LRO are independent and use of one does not require the use of the other. Operation When a system needs to send large chunks of data out over a computer network, the chunks first need breaking down into smaller segments that can pass through all the network elements like routers and switches between the source and destination computers. This process is referred to as segmentation. Often the TCP protocol in the host computer performs this segmentation. Offloading this work to the NIC is called TCP segmentation offload (TSO). For example, a unit of 64 KiB (65,536 bytes) of data is usually segmented to 45 segments of 1460 bytes each before it is sent through the NIC and over the network. With some intelligence in the NIC, the host CPU can hand over the 64 KB of data to the NIC in a single transmit-request, the NIC can break that data down into smaller segments of 1460 bytes, add the TCP, IP, and data link layer protocol headers ‚Äî according to a template provided by the host's TCP/IP stack ‚Äî to each segment, and send the resulting frames over the network. This significantly reduces the work done by the CPU. many new NICs on the market support TSO. Some network cards implement TSO generically enough that it can be used for offloading fragmentation of other transport layer protocols, or for doing IP fragmentation for protocols that don't support fragmentation by themselves, such as UDP.

(CCR) is a progressive non-profit legal advocacy organization based in New York City, New York, in the United States. It was founded in 1966 by Arthur Kinoy, William Kunstler and others particularly to support activists in implementation of civil rights legislation and achieve social justice. CCR has focused on civil liberties and human rights litigation, and activism. Since winning the landmark case in the United States Supreme Court of Rasul v. Bush (2004), establishing the right of detainees at Guantanamo Bay detainment camp to challenge their status in US courts and gain legal representation, it has provided legal assistance to people imprisoned there and gained release for many who were unlawfully held or proven not to be a risk to security. History Jules Lobel, current President of the Center for Constitutional Rights, testifying before Congressional subcommittee about the War Powers Act. The Center, originally the Law Center for Constitutional Rights, was set up to give legal and financial support to lawyers who were representing Civil Rights Movement activists in Mississippi at the height of the struggle against racial segregation and economic injustice. Its founders were Morton Stavis, Arthur Kinoy, Ben Smith and William Kunstler. The Center identified as a \\"movement support\\" organization; that is, an organization that concentrated on working with political and social activists to use the courts to promote the activists' work. Cases were chosen to raise public awareness of an issue, generate media attention, and/or energize activists being harassed by local law enforcement in the South. In this regard, the Center differed from more traditional legal non-profits, such as the ACLU, which was more focused on bringing winnable cases in order to extend precedents and develop the law, as well as pursuing First Amendment issues. The current organization was formed from the merger of the original Center for Constitutional Rights (formed in 1966 by Kunstler, Kinoy, Stavis and Smith) and the Emergency Civil Liberties Committee (ECLC). Since 9/11, it has been known for bringing a variety of cases challenging the Bush administration's detention, extraordinary rendition, and interrogation practices in the so-called \\"Global War on Terror\\". With its president Michael Ratner filing Rasul v. Bush in 2002, this was the first lawsuit to challenge President George W. Bush's wartime detentions at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba in the early days of the \\"war on terror.\\"David Cole, \\"Michael Ratner‚Äôs Army: The Fight Against Guant√°namo\\", NYR Daily, 15 May 2016 > It was the first time in history that the Court had ruled against the > president on behalf of alleged enemy fighters in wartime. And it was the > first of four Supreme Court decisions between 2004 and 2008 that rejected > President Bush's assertion of unchecked executive power in the \\"war on > terror.\\" According to pbs website, primary issues for advocacy and public education include: illegal detentions, particularly with regards to the Guantanamo Bay detainment camp; surveillance and attacks on dissent, which fights the U.S. government's involvement in unlawful surveillance, monitoring and intimidation of activists such as the Black Panthers; criminal justice and mass incarceration, including jail expansions and unjust detentions; corporate and human rights abuse both domestic and international; government abuse of power, primarily encompassing CCR's challenge to the Bush administration's policy of extraordinary rendition; racial, gender and economic justice; and international law and accountability. In 2005 the organization was recognized with the Domestic Human Rights Award by Global Exchange, in San Francisco.\\"Global Exchange Human Rights Awards Ceremony to be Held on May 12 in San Francisco\\" May 4, 2005 Activities and litigation *Rasul v. Bush, 215 F. Supp. 2d 55 (2004): CCR represented Guantanamo detainees seeking fair trials and an end to their indefinite imprisonment without charge. The Supreme Court case established precedent for U.S. courts' jurisdiction over the Guantanamo Bay prison camp, affirming detainees' right to habeas corpus review, including legal representation. This right was later putatively revoked when President Bush signed the Military Commissions Act into law. CCR brought many of the same habeas corpus petitioners to the Supreme Court again in Boumediene v. Bush (2008), in which the Supreme Court declared the relevant parts of the MCA unconstitutional and restored the rights won in Rasul. (see below) *Al Odah v. United States, 127 S. Ct. 3067 (2007): the latest in a series of habeas corpus petitions on behalf of people imprisoned at the Guantanamo Bay detention center. The case challenges the Military Commissions system's suitability as a habeas corpus substitute and the legality, in general, of detention at Guantanamo. It was consolidated under Boumediene v. Bush, which was decided by the US Supreme Court in 2008, ruling that the MCA was unconstitutional and restoring habeas corpus rights established under Rasul v. Bush (2004). *Arar v. Ashcroft, 585 F. 3d 559 (2009): challenges U.S. government's extraordinary rendition policies and highlights the experience of Maher Arar, a Canadian citizen allegedly sent by the United States to be tortured in Syria. He has never been charged, and has been found by the Canadian government not to be involved with terrorism. He and CCR seek an acknowledgment of the U.S.'s alleged involvement and an end to the rendition program. *Abtan v. Blackwater, 611 F.Supp.2d 1 (2009): CCR filed suit on behalf of the civilian victims of the September 16, 2007, Blackwater Baghdad shootings in Nisoor Square, Baghdad, by Blackwater USA's armed contractors. The suit charges that Blackwater \\"created and fostered a culture of lawlessness amongst its employees, encouraging them to act in the company's financial interests at the expense of innocent human life.\\" Blackwater is also accused of extrajudicial killing and war crimes, assault and battery, wrongful death, intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress, and negligent hiring, training and supervision. *CCR v. Bush: This lawsuit challenges the constitutionality of the NSA's surveillance of people within the United States without warrant or prior court approval. *Daniels v. City of New York, 291 AD 2d 260 (2002) / Floyd v. City of New York, 739 F. Supp. 2d 376 (2010): This case forced the New York City Police Department to end their practice of stopping and frisking people solely on the basis of their race or national origin. The case also highlighted the practices of the NYPD Street Crimes Unit (responsible for the 1999 shooting of Amadou Diallo), leading to its disbandment. The case's settlement created an internal audit system of officers engaged in stop and frisks, the results of which are turned over to CCR on a quarterly basis. In addition, the settlement required the NYPD to begin \\"know your rights\\" public education programs. CCR is working to compel the NYPD to comply with the terms of the settlement. *Estate of Ali Hussamalde Albazzaz v. Blackwater Worldwide: This is a civil suit filed on behalf of the family of an Iraqi man killed by Blackwater personnel. CCR is charging Blackwater Worldwide with war crimes. *Khan v. Bush: This suit is filed on behalf of Majid Khan, a U.S. asylum-holder who was held by the United States in secret detention at a C.I.A. \\"black site\\" for three years, after which he was transferred to the Guantanamo Bay detention camp. CCR has filed a habeas corpus submission on his behalf. *Kunstler v. City of New York, 439 F.Supp.2d 327 (2006): This lawsuit charges the New York Police Department with unlawfully arresting allegedly peaceful anti-war protesters and holding them for allegedly excessively long periods of time. *Mamani v. Sanchez de Lozada / Mamani v. Sanchez Berzain, 636 F.Supp.2d 1326 (2009): These two suits have been filed against the former President of Bolivia, Gonzalo Daniel S√°nchez de Lozada S√°nchez Bustamante and former Minister of Defense, Jose Carlos S√°nchez Berza√≠n for their alleged roles in the deaths of civilians during popular protests against the government of Bolivia in September and October 2003. *Matar v. Dichter, 500 F. Supp. 2d 284 (2007): CCR presented a federal class action lawsuit against the former Director of Israel's General Security Service (GSS), Avi Dichter, on behalf of Palestinians killed or injured in a 2002 \\"targeted killing\\" air strike in Gaza. It charged him with extrajudicial killing, war crimes and other gross human rights violations. The case was dismissed, and the dismissal upheld on appeal. *Saleh v. Titan, 361 F. Supp. 2d 1152 (2005): Saleh is a federal class action lawsuit against Titan and CACI International Incorporated, contractors who provided interrogation services at Abu Ghraib. The lawsuit accuses the contractors of cruel and humiliating treatment of prisoners during interrogations. *Turkmen v. Ashcroft: This suit, filed on behalf of a class of Muslim, South Asian, and Arab non-citizens, is a class action civil rights lawsuit contesting their being swept up by the INS and FBI in a racial profiling dragnet following 9/11. *United States v. City of New York (formerly Vulcan Society v. City of New York): This is an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission charge filed by CCR on behalf of the Vulcan Society, an organization of Black firefighters in New York City. The lawsuit charges the Fire Department of New York with discriminatory hiring practices. *Wiwa v. Royal Dutch Petroleum, 626 F.Supp.2d 377 (2009), Wiwa v. Anderson, and Wiwa v. Shell Petroleum Development Company: These are three lawsuits focusing on the human rights abuses against the Ogoni people in Nigeria by officers of corporations related to petroleum production. They are being brought against the Royal Dutch Petroleum Company and Shell Transport and Trading Company (Royal Dutch/Shell), the head of its Nigerian operation, and Royal Dutch/Shell's Nigerian subsidiary for their complicity in the abuses. *Zalita v. Bush, 127 S. Ct. 2159 (2007): This case forwards a habeas corpus petition for Al Qassim, a Libyan refugee detained in Guantanamo for nearly six years. It challenges the U.S. government plan to transfer him to his native country despite his risk of torture and persecution there. *International Criminal Court Complaint, 2011 On September 13, 2011, attorneys from the Center for Constitutional Rights and leaders of SNAP, the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, formally filed a complaint with the International Criminal Court (ICC) charging top Vatican officials for tolerating and enabling the concealment of rape and child sex crimes worldwide. At least 20,000 pages of reports, policy papers, and crime evidence by Catholic clergy supplemented the complaint. *The Amicus Brief in Ragbir v. Holder (2011) The Amicus Brief in Ragbir v. Holder was submitted on May 23, 2011. Amici are several community, immigrant justice, and civil rights organizations who argue that the Second Circuit interfered with Ragbir's right to introduce relevant evidence. The Second Circuit wrongfully did not remand Ragbir v. Holder to the Board of Immigration Appeals to apply broader evidentiary standards established in the Nijhawan v. Holder case. *Brown, et al. v. Snyder, et al. (2011) This June 22, 2011 case was filed on behalf 28 Michigan residents, and it effectively challenges the Emergency Manager law and Local Government and School Fiscal Accountability Act under the State Supreme court of Michigan. The amended complaint, filed by the CCR on September 14, 2011, challenged the constitutionality of the application of the Emergency Manager law. *Civic Association of the Deaf of New York City, Inc. v. Rudolph Giuliani, et al. (1995) When New York City introduced a plan to remove fire alarm boxes and replace them with payphones, the Civic Association of the Deaf of New York City filed this suit under the Americans with Disabilities Act to block that action because pay phones are not easily accessible to the deaf or the hard of hearing. This federal class action lawsuit resulted in a victory for the Plaintiffs. When the New York City Fire Department and the City of New York requested that the court modify or dispose of the injunction in June 2010, the court again ruled in favor of the Civic Association of the Deaf of New York City on August 15, 2011. *Doe, et al. v. Jindal, et al. (2011) On February 16, 2011 the CCR filed a suit that challenged the registration of persons convicted of \\"Crime Against Nature\\" on the state sex offenders list. The defendants in this case were several Louisiana state officials. On October 31, 2011, the CCR moved for a Summary Judgement. *Amicus Brief in Glik v. Cunniffe, et al. (2011) On January 25, 2011, CCR submitted an amicus brief on behalf of Glik and several Copwatch groups. The essential argument is that recording police activities by individuals or organizations within a community is protected by the First Amendment. In September 2011, the judge ruled in favor of Glik stating that his First Amendment rights had been violated. *Aref, et al. v. Holder, et al. (2010) This case, filed on March 30, 2010, challenged policies and conditions of experimental state prisons in Indiana and Illinois. One year later, the court partially dismissed the case, but allowed the CCR to pursue procedural due process and retaliation claims. Notable cases *Dombrowski v. Pfister, 380 US 479 (1965): The CCR's first major case was a successful suit against the Louisiana Un-American Activities Committee to challenge the use of state anti-subversion laws to intimidate civil rights workers. CCR won the case in the Supreme Court, which ruled that such intimidation had a \\"chilling effect\\" on First Amendment rights and was therefore unconstitutional. *Chicago 7, (1969): CCR attorneys William Kunstler and Leonard Weinglass defended the \\"Chicago 8,\\" a group of social movement figures arrested following the 1968 Democratic National Convention demonstrations and consequent police repression. The eight defendants: including David Dellinger, Rennie Davis, Tom Hayden, Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin, and Bobby Seale, were anti-war, civil rights and human rights activists, and Students for a Democratic Society and Black Panther Party members. The eight were found not guilty of their conspiracy charges, but five were found guilty of crossing state lines to incite a riot. The Center appealed and ultimately overturned these charges, based on the judge's bias and the refusal of the court to screen jurors for possible cultural and/or racial bias. *Abramowicz v. Lefkowitz, (1972): Abramowicz challenged New York state laws that restricted abortion, and served as a model for challenges to similar laws in other states. This case marks the first instance of challenge to abortion statutes being argued by women plaintiffs in terms of women's right to choice rather than a doctor's right to practice. *Monell v. Department of Social Services, 357 F.Supp. 1051 (1972): This case began as a challenge to New York City's forced maternity leave policies. Its resolution created a precedent that established local government accountability for unconstitutional acts and created the right to obtain damages from municipalities in such cases. Since 1978, this precedent has been used by lawyers and non-profits as a tool to challenge police misconduct, civil rights violations, and other local unconstitutional acts. *United States v. Banks and Means (Wounded Knee), (1974) *Fil√°rtiga v. Pe√±a-Irala, 630 F. 2d 876 (1980): Fil√°rtiga established a precedent for the use of the Alien Tort Statute to allow foreign victims of human rights abuses to seek justice in U.S. courts. CCR represented the family of Joelito Fil√°rtiga, the son of a left-wing Paraguayan dissident who had been tortured and killed by Paraguayan police. The precedent created by this case has facilitated subsequent international human rights cases, including Doe v. Karadzic and Doe v. Unocal. These cases have established that multinational corporations and other non-state actors can be held responsible for their complicity in human rights violations. *Crumsey v. Justice Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, (1982): *Paul v. Avril, (1994): In 1991, on behalf of six Haitian political activists, including Evans Paul, Mayor of Port-au-Prince, and under the Alien Tort Statute, the CCR sued former military dictator Prosper Avril for human rights violations. The suit sought compensation for damages that the plaintiffs suffered under Avril's rule. In November 1993, CCR attorneys moved for a default judgment. In July 1994, in an unprecedented decision in which a Haitian dictator or member of the military was held accountable for human rights abuses, a federal magistrate awarded a $41 million damage judgment to the victims of Prosper Avril. *Doe v. Karadzic, (2000): In 1993, the Center for Constitutional Rights and co-counsel filed a lawsuit seeking compensation for victims and survivors of Serb leader Radovan Kardzic's campaign of genocide and torture in Bosnia. Karadzic defaulted in 1997. On September 25, 2000, the jury decided on a verdict of $4.5 billion. *Rasul v. Bush, 215 F. Supp. 2d 55 (2004): CCR represented Guantanamo detainees seeking fair trials and an end to their indefinite imprisonment without charge. The Supreme Court case established precedent for U.S. courts' jurisdiction over the Guantanamo Bay prison camp, affirming detainees' right to habeas corpus review, including legal representation. This right was later putatively revoked when President Bush signed the Military Commissions Act into law. CCR brought many of the same habeas corpus petitioners to the Supreme Court again in Boumediene v. Bush (2008), in which the Supreme Court declared the relevant parts of the MCA unconstitutional and restored the rights won in Rasul. *Floyd, et al. v. City of New York, et al. (2013) CCR filed a federal class action lawsuit against the New York City Police Department (NYPD) and the City of New York that challenges the NYPD's practices of racial profiling and \\"stop-and frisk.\\" These NYPD practices had led to a dramatic increase in the number of suspicion-less stop-and-frisks per year in the city, with the majority of stops in communities of color. On August 12, 2013, a federal judge in a historic ruling found the New York City Police Department (NYPD) liable for a pattern and practice of racial profiling and unconstitutional stop-and-frisks. On January 30, 2014, the City agreed to drop its appeal of the ruling and begin the joint remedial process ordered by the court.

He is best known for being a member of the bands; Tower of Power, Cold Blood, and The Sons of Champlin. He played in the horn section with Tower of Power for 19 years. Biography His father Ray Gillette was a trombonist, playing with acts such as Harry James, Tommy Dorsey, Stan Kenton, and other big bands. A child prodigy, Gillette picked up the trumpet and was reading music by age four. At age 15, he joined the band that would later be known as Tower of Power, playing various brass instruments for the band including the trumpet, trombone, baritone horn and tuba. He took a brief break from Tower of Power to tour in the 1970s and record with the band Cold Blood. He re-joined Tower of Power a year later, touring and opening for Santana and Creedence Clearwater Revival. As its reputation as a premier horn band grew, Tower of Power toured with Heart, Rod Stewart, and The Rolling Stones, among others. In addition, Gillette appeared on hundreds of recordings as a session player. In 1984, Gillette quit touring to be a full-time father to his daughter Megan. In 1998 he returned to music. Shortly after joining the Sons of Champlin that year, he missed one of their concerts due to a split lip. According to Gillette himself, he had split his lip due to not playing for 14 years after leaving Tower of Power. He spent those years running a landscaping business in the San Francisco Bay Area. An outstanding brass player with a great range and a funky style, Gillette played a Marcinkiewicz Rembrandt Model SC3X.351 Large-Bore Trumpet and a King 3B trombone with an F-attachment (he also played a Pan American E-flat Tuba and an Olds 3-valve baritone). He used and endorsed Marcinkiewicz mouthpieces on all of this equipment. Gillette was a member of the Sons of Champlin (he departed in 2006), fronted by Chicago vocalist and keyboardist Bill Champlin; he had also a member of Tortilla Soup, a 10 piece northern California band. He played with comedian Danny Marona, the Stevie \\"Keys\\" Roseman All Star Band, the Strokeland Superband, and Funky Loophole (Gillette's own band). He toured and recorded with The Doobie Brothers (appearing on the Doobie's \\"Live At Wolf Trap\\" DVD), Blood, Sweat & Tears, and Santana. After a 25-year absence, Gillette rejoined Tower of Power in August 2009 for touring, replacing Mike Bogart; but he left the band again after just more than a year and a half on February 14, 2011. In the last years of his life, Gillette continued to do session work as well as live appearances; fulfilling a long-time dream to assemble his own band, he brought together Megan Gillette McCarthy (his daughter), Greg Barker, Dave Hawkes, Clint Day, and Matt Martinez to create the Mic Gillette Band (the MGB). Gillette spent much of his time teaching doing clinics at middle schools & high schools. He was the music director and taught clinics at Northgate High School in Walnut Creek, California and taught music classes at Stanley Middle School in Lafayette, California. He raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for music departments in schools across the United States. Death Gillette died on January 17, 2016 of a heart attack, aged 64. He was survived by his wife Julia and his daughter Megan Gillette McCarthy. Discography= Band Albums  He was featured on \\"Hip Li'l Dreams,\\" a disc of originals released by the Sons of Champlin in 2005 and appeared on the Doobie Brother's Live at Wolf Trap DVD. Gillette worked on various side projects. After a chance meeting with Tony Adamo, Gillette wrote the horn arrangements for Adamo's albums, Straight Up Deal and Dance of Love. His arrangements can be heard on Adamo tunes \\"No Strings\\", \\"Up in It\\" and \\"Groove Therapy\\". Gillette also performed with vocalist Josh Pfeiffer in Northern California with an eight-piece group featuring guitarist Dave Schramm and keyboard player Kent Gripenstraw. He is included on the Cold Blood album, Sisyphus (1970) playing trombone, trumpet and flugelhorn.

The Tosafists composed critical and explanatory glosses (questions, notes, interpretations, rulings and sources) on the Talmud, which are collectively called Tosafot (\\"additions\\"). The Tosafot are important to the practical application of Jewish law, because the law depends on how the Talmud is understood and interpreted. Alphabetical list of Tosafists Of the great number of tosafists not all are known by name. The following is an alphabetical list of them; many, however, are known only through citations. A (HaRA) Quoted in the edited Tosafot to Kesubot 14b, 19a, 20b, 21a etc. Avigdor Cohen of Vienna Also known as Avigdor ben Elijah ha-Kohen. Flourished in the middle of the thirteenth century; his tosafot are mentioned in the edited tosafot to Ketuvot 63b. Abraham ben Joseph of Orleans French Talmudist; lived at Orleans, and perhaps at London, in the twelfth century. One of the older tosafists, his interpretations of the Talmud are quoted several times in the Tosafot. He is mentioned as the father of three daughters. He was the father-in-law of Judah ben Isaac Messer Leon, and therefore a contemporary of Rabbenu Tam of Rameru, the head of the tosafistic school in the middle of the twelfth century. Asher ben Jehiel (RoSH) Resided in Cologne and later in Toledo, Spain. His tosafot, entitled Tosefot ha-Rosh or Tosefei Tosafot, appeared in various epochs and works. Many of them were inserted by Bezalel Ashkenazi in Shitah Mekubetzet; those to Yebamot and Ketubot appeared separately at Livorno, 1776; to Sotah, partly at Prague, 1725, and partly in Jacob Faitusi's Mar'eh haOfannim (1810); to Megillah and Shevuot, in Elijah Borgel's Migdanot Natan (1785); and to Kiddushin, in the Ma'aseh Rokem (Pisa, 1806). They are included in the Vilna Romm edition of the Talmud.  Baruch ben Isaac  Born in Worms, he lived in Regensburg.

Eliezer ben Nathan Wrote about the Persecution of 1096. Eliezer ben Samuel of Metz (Re'EM) Author of tosafot to several tractates, of which those to Hullin were seen by Azulai. Eliezer of Toul French tosafist of the beginning of the thirteenth century, whose tosafot are mentioned in Shibbolei HaLeket. Eliezer of Touques French tosafist of the late 13th century. Elijah ben Menahem Ha- Zaken His tosafot are mentioned in \\"Haggahot Maimuniyyot,\\" Kinnim, No. 20. I (RI, probably R. Isaac, but not to be confused with Isaac ben Samuel, who occurs most often as RI) His tosafot, in which the older RI is quoted, are mentioned by Samson b. Zadok (\\"Tashbetz,\\" ¬ß 336). Isaac ben Abraham of Dampierre Brother of Samson ben Abraham of Sens. Succeeded his teacher Isaac ben Samuel as head of the school of Dampierre, and as a result is also known as Rabbi Isaac ha-Ba·∏•ur, or RIBA (\\"Rabbi Isaac the Younger\\").  Isaac ben Asher ha-Levi  The earliest known Tosafist, a student of Rashi. Isaac ben Jacob ha-Laban Student of Rabbeinu Tam and one of the earlier tosafists (\\"ba'ale tosafot yeshanim\\"). He was the author of a commentary on Ketubot quoted by Or Zarua.see Judah Minz, Responsa, No. 10 He is quoted very often in the edited tosafot (Yevamot 5b; Bava Kamma 72a; et al.). Isaac ben Meir (Rivam) of Ramerupt Grandson of Rashi, and brother of RaSHBaM and Rabbeinu Tam; died before his father, leaving four children.Jacob Tam, \\"Sefer ha-Yashar,\\" No. 616, p. 72b, Vienna, 1811 Although he died young, Isaac wrote tosafot, mentioned by Eliezer ben Joel HaLevi,Avi haEzri, ¬ß 417 to several tractates of the Talmud. Isaac himself is often quoted in the edited tosafot (Shabbat 138a; Ketuvot 29b et passim). Isaac ben Mordecai of Regensburg (RIBaM) Flourished in the twelfth century; student of Isaac ben Asher ha- Levi. He corresponded with Jacob Tam and was a fellow student of Moses b. Joel and Ephraim b. Isaac. His tosafot are quoted by Eliezer ben Joel HaLevil.c. ¬ß 420 and Meir of Rothenburg.\\"Semachot,\\" ¬ß 73; \\"Haggahot Maimuniyyot,\\" Abelot, p. 294a He is often quoted also in the edited tosafot.Ketuvot 55a; Bava Kamma 22b et passim Isaac ben Reuben His tosafot are mentioned in Shitah Mekubetzet, Ketubot 43a. He may be identical with the Isaac b. Reuben who made a comment on Rashi to Bava Kamma 32d. Isaac ben Samuel haZaken (Ri haZaken) French tosafist and Biblical commentator who flourished in the twelfth century. Isaiah di Trani (RID) Italian tosafist of the first half of the thirteenth century. The greater part of his tosafot were published under the title \\"Tosefot R. Yesha'yahu\\" (Lemberg, 1861‚Äì69); and many were inserted by Betzalel Ashkenazi in Shitah Mekubetzet. Israel of Bamberg Lived in the middle of the thirteenth century; mentioned as an author of tosafot in \\"Mordechai\\"Mordechai, Avodah Zarah, 1244, 1279, 1295, 1356 and \\"Haggahot Mordechai\\" (to Shabbat 14). Extracts from the tosafot of Israel's students were reproduced by Bezaleel Ashkenazi (l.c.). J. Cohen Supposedly a contemporary of Meir of Rothenburg, and perhaps identical with Judah ha-Kohen, Meir's relative. In the extracts from his tosafot to Baba Kamma, inserted in Shitah Mekubetzet, he quotes (among many other authorities) his still living teacher, the Kohen whom Zunz\\"Z. G.\\" p. 42 supposes to be identical with Avigdor Cohen of Vienna. From Shitah Mekubetzet to Baba Metzia it is seen that J. Cohen wrote tosafot to the same tractate. Jacob of Chinon Lived in the thirteenth century; student of Isaac ben Abraham, author of a \\"Shi·π≠·π≠ah\\"\\"Mordechai,\\" Sanhedrin, 928 He himself is quoted in the edited tosafot (Berachot 12a; Nazir 53a; et al.).

Jacob ben Meir (Jacob Tam, Rabbeinu Tam) Leading tosafist, who lived in the twelfth century. Grandson of Rashi. Yechiel of Paris 13th century French tosafist. Defended Judaism in the Disputation of Paris. Reported to have moved to Acre, Israel in about 1258, approximately ten years before his death. Joseph (or Yehosef) Flourished, according to Zunz,\\"Z. G.\\" p. 33 about 1150. Zunz identifies this Joseph with the student of Rashbam whose glosses are quoted in the edited tosafot (to Ket. 70a), and thinks he may be identical with the Joseph of Orleans often cited in the edited tosafot (Shabbat 12a et passim). If so, he must be identified, according to Henri Gross,Gallia Judaica, p. 34 with Joseph ben Isaac Bekhor Shor. Weiss, however, suggests that this Joseph might have been either Joseph Bonfils, Rabbeinu Tam's teacher, or Joseph b. Isaac of Troyes, one of Rashi's students. Thus it seems that in any case the tosafist mentioned in the \\"Sefer haYashar\\" must be distinguished from the one mentioned in Tosafot Ketuvot 70a, as the latter was a student of Rashbam.

It is the most important work of Kurdish writer and poet Ahmad Khani (1651-1707). Mam (Mamo) and Zin is based on a true story, laid down from generation to generation through oral tradition. The content is similar to a Romeo and Juliet story. The Mem-u Zin Mausoleum in Cizre province has become a tourist attraction. Synopsis It tells the tragic story of two young people in love. Mem, a young Kurdish boy of the \\"Alan\\" clan & heir to the City of the West, who falls in love with Zin, of the \\"Botan\\" clan and the daughter of the governor of Botan. They meet during Festival of \\"Newroz\\" (the ancient national ceremony of Kurds) when the people are celebrating. Their union is blocked by Bakr of the Bakran clan, Mem‚Äôs antagonists throughout the story, who is jealous of the two star-crossed lovers. Mem eventually dies during a complicated conspiracy by Bakr. When Zin receives the news, she collapses and dies while mourning the death of Mem at his grave. The immense grief leads to her death and she is buried next to Mem in Cizre. The news of the death of Mem and Zin spreads quickly among the people of Jazira Botan. When Bakr's (Beko) role in the tragedy is revealed, Tacd√Æn, the best friend of Mem, kills him. Bakr (Beko) will be buried next to Mem and Zin's graves. Because before dying, Z√Æn gives his testimony and says that \\"It was because of Beko that we could not come together, so I want him to witness our love, If he dies, bury him next to me and Mem\\". However, a thorn bush, nourished by the blood of Bakr, grows out of his grave: the roots of malice penetrate deep into the earth among the lovers‚Äô graves, thus separating the two even in death. Texts Among the various versions the work of Ahmad Khani is the best known. Roger Lescot, a French Orientalist, added in the 1930s, the Meme Alan narrative with the help of several Kurdish Dengb√™j singers from Syria. The forecast is partly historical roots, probably originated in the 14th century has been handed down by the Dengb√™j. She describes in a precise and poetic language, the story of the ill-fated love of Mem and Zin. Against the background of chivalric traditions and social conventions .... This version is the version of the folk tale the next. The full version of the legend Meme Alan is now an integral part of the Kurdish literature. Filming of the epic In 1992, on the basis of the book Mem u Zin, √úmit El√ßi directed a film with the same name. Since the Kurdish language in Turkey was prohibited from 1980 until the late 1990s / early 21st century, the Kurdish epic had to be released in Turkish. In 2002, the Kurdistan satellite channel Kurdistan TV produced a dramatised series of Memi Alan, Nasir Hassan, the director of the successful drama said, \\"Memi Alan\\" is the most substantial and the most sophisticated artistic work done.

There is only one known class III PI 3-kinase, Vps34, which is also the only PI 3-kinase expressed in all eukaryotic cells. In humans it is encoded by the PIK3C3 gene. In human cells Vps34 associates with a regulatory subunit, PIK3R4(p150, Vps15). Substrate specificity Vps34 is more accurately described as a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. In vivo Vps34 can phosphorylate only phosphatidylinositol to form phosphatidylinositol (3)-phosphate (PtdIns(3)P). Functions Vps34 was first identified in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae (budding yeast) screen for proteins involved vesicle- mediated vacuolar protein sorting (hence Vps). A number of proteins containing a phosphoinositide binding domain specific for PtdIns(3)P that function in cellular protein trafficking have been identified. Vps34 has been shown to interact with Vps15 (PIK3R4, p150), a protein kinase. Vps15 can activate the lipid kinase activity of Vps34 and interact with Rab5, which has been hypothesized to recruit the Vps34/15 complex to early endosomes. Vps15 has a myristoylation tag that associates the complex with the membrane. The Vps34/15 complex also can interact with Rab7. Together, the complex can function at early to late endosomes. Vps34 has a calmodulin binding domain, but its activity has been clearly shown to be calcium-independent in vitro and in vivo. The functional role of its interactions with calmodulin in vivo are not understood. Vps34 activity is required for autophagy in yeast, and has been strongly implicated in this process in mammals. Vps34 has also been implicated in amino acid sensing. Vps34 is necessary for mTORC1 activity in response to amino acids in cultured cells, as siRNA knockdown completely inhibits mTORC1 signaling as determined by S6K phosphorylation. Sequestration of the Vps34 product by FYVE domain overexpression also disrupts mTOR signaling. However, genetic ablation of Vps34 in Drosophila does not affect dTORC1 signaling. Thus, the role of Vps34 in amino acid signaling to mTORC1 remains controversial. One recent paper suggested that the human ortholog is regulated by intracellular calcium, but this was later shown to be due to a calcium- independent inhibition of Vps34 by EGTA, an effect not seen with other calcium chelators. The mechanisms that regulate Vps34 activity in mammalian cells are not yet understood.

On a hill near the water's edge a handsome old house overlooks the river. This plantation, was the seat of the Browne family for two hundred years. The first owner, Colonel Henry Browne, was a member of Sir William Berkeley's Council in 1643. The plantation house constructed circa 1745 remains well-preserved in its original historical state. Description The Four Mile Tree Plantation House is a brick structure, one-and-one-half-stories with hip-on-gambrel roof, pedimented dormers and four interior end chimneys. The brick is laid in Flemish bond above the beveled watertable raith English bond below. The entire brick surface was stuccoed and scored in imitation ashlar in the nineteenth century but the stucco has deteriorated on portions of the facade and fallen off. All openings on the five-bay facade, except for the central entranceway, were altered in the late nineteenth century or early twentieth century and have two-over-two sash; the entranceway, sheltered by a nineteenth-century Roman Ionic porch, consists of a transom over three-paneled double doors, the top panel of each being scrolled. A modillioned cornice is used on the eaves. Four Mile Tree's oldest interior woodwork is in the central stairhall where the turned balustrading on the stair, the heavy hand rail and the high dado place the date in the first half of the eighteenth century. The southwest room, which probably dates from the early nineteenth century, has two framed niches flanking a simple mantel and overmantel topped by an architrave, frieze and cornice; only the cornice and a paneled dado ornament the other walls of the room. The remaining rooms have mantels which seem to date from the first half of the nineteenth century but only in the southeastern room is there a paneled room. Four Mile Tree is a successor to two of the earliest plantations in Virginia (\\"Burrow's Hill\\" and \\"Pace's Paines\\"). It is \\"ancient\\" in its own right having been founded in the first half of the seventeenth century; its grave-site contains the oldest legible tombstone in Virginia (1650). Four Mile Tree was the seat of the Brownes, a leading Surry family, from the Reign of Charles I until the death of their last male heir in 1799. The plantation, named for its distance from Jamestown, was one of Surry County's more prosperous; its owners served as viewers of tobacco and had slaves from an early period. The Brownes were regularly Justices of the County Court throughout the colonial period. Several members of the family served on the Governor's Council or in the House of Burgesses during the seventeenth century. During the War for Independence, William Browne was a member of the Surry Committee of Safety and Lieutenant Colonel of Militia. His son, the last of his name to be Master of Four Mile Tree, was a lieutenant in the revolutionary militia. The British sacked the plantation during the War of 1812 according to the then Colonel of county militia. In 1815 the plantation passed to William Browne, Jr.'s granddaughter, Sally Elizabeth Bowdoin, and her husband, General Philip St. George Cocke. The Cockes lived at Four Mile tree until 1840 when they moved to another plantation, Belmeade, in Powhatan County, Virginia. After the Cockes' departure no significant changes were made to the house until the late 20th century when a modern addition was added to the south side of the house. Four Mile Tree was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1970. The plantation is a private residence.

Key facilities and features include the Manulife Financial Sportsplex and Healthy Living Centre, the heritage Elam Martin farmstead, The Benchwarmer sports bar, and the Grey Silo Golf Course. The eastern edge of the park borders on the Grand River for 1.5 km, and the park grounds have about 7 km (4 miles) of asphalt trail loops. In the planning stages, the multi-amenity park had been called Millennium Recreation Park, however the name RIM Park was chosen to acknowledge the large contributions from its primary donor, the employees of Research In Motion (RIM) (doing business as BlackBerry Limited since January 2013), who contributed $2 million in 2001. The up-front cost of building the park was $56.7-million, most of which was financed by a lease-style loan. Parts of the park opened in June 2001, and the grand opening was held on November 3, 2001.  Indoor Sporting Complex  Manulife Financial Sportsplex RIM Park's indoor multi-use recreation facility is called the Manulife Sportsplex and Healthy Living Centre, and is funded by Manulife Financial. Facilities in the complex include 4 rinks, 1 field, 2 gymnasiums, and 1 stage.  Ice Rinks RIM Park's Sportsplex houses 4 Olympic-sized ice pads with 36 large players' dressing rooms, and 6 officials' dressing rooms with showers. For hosting indoor events, the rinks are covered and have a 1000-person capacity per rink.  Amenities = Food and Beverage  RIM Park is home to The Benchwarmer (a full-service restaurant and sports bar), The Dugout (the main concession, featuring a variety of fast-service spots that offer beverages, snacks, full meals, and treats), and On the Go (quick snacks and warm beverages). For events, RIM Park also offers catering services and custom packages.  Waterloo Sports Medicine Clinic  The Waterloo Sports Medicine Clinic (WSM) has been in operation since 1986, with one location at the University Square Plaza, and their other location opening in 2001 at RIM Park. WSM has served over 100,000 clients, and offers custom foot orthotics, massage therapy, occupational therapy, physiotherapy, pilates training, sport biomechanical analysis, sports nutrition, and sports psychology.  Outdoor Sports Facilities  There are 22 outdoor sporting facilities at RIM Park: 12 multi- purpose fields with nighttime field lighting (including 2 international-sized artificial turf fields and 4 natural grass fields), 6 official ball diamonds with fencing and portable bleacher seating, and 4 sand beach-volleyball courts. These facilities received funding from the Waterloo Minor Soccer Club. The outdoor area has a playground, player benches, spectator seating, a pavilion, washrooms, accessible parking, and a one-kilometre walking/running loop.  Environment  There are two main ecological areas that the RIM Park land encompasses: an east floodplain, and a west upland system; since both of these environments are regularly disturbed, they provide an ideal habitat for weedy, invasive, non-native species. This type of intact, native floodplain community is an increasingly vanishing and thereby valued ecosystem.  GreenLab  The City of Waterloo's GreenLab pavilion is located at RIM Park's outdoor sport-field facilities. The project teaches people about environmental best practices with a demonstration featuring RIM Park's water harvesting system that stores water underneath one of the astro-turf fields to water the four natural-grass fields, and is commonly used for class field-trips.  Water Harvesting System  The water harvesting system is a strategy contrived by the City of Waterloo to conserve water at RIM Park by collecting storm water underneath one of the artificial astro-turf fields and using this water to maintain the four natural-grass fields for competitive play.  Trails  RIM Park grounds offer about 7 km (4 miles) of asphalt trail loops partially alongside the Grand River. The trails also access the Walter Bean Trail.  Heritage  RIM Park is situated amidst two of Waterloo's key heritage points. The perimeter of the Park's area borders the Grand River, which was designated as a heritage river in 1994 due to its centrality in the agricultural and industrial settlement of Ontario by European settlers. RIM Park gives Waterloo area residents and tourists direct access to 1.5 km (about 1 mile) of the Grand River along the eastern perimeter of the Park. RIM Park is also home to a sixth-generation Mennonite farm house, called the Elam Martin farmstead. The Elam Martin Farmstead was constructed in ~1820, and was purchased by The City of Waterloo in 1999 as part of a long-term heritage preservation plan. The property is currently located on about 4.5 hectares (11 acres) of land incorporated into RIM Park.  Funding controversy  The park is notorious in local politics due to the cost of its financing. A Mississauga-based company, MFP Financial Services (now Renasant Financial Partners) provided financing for the park. On September 25, 2000, Waterloo council unanimously approved a lease-style loan of $48.3 million after being told that the interest rate was 4.73 per cent, and the total payout over 30 years was $112.9 million. More than six months after the deal closed, after an investigation by The Record, the city found out that the real interest rate was 9.2 per cent and that its total payout would be $227.7 million. In June 2001, the City of Waterloo filed suit against MFP, one of its sales representatives, and two companies that bought part of the debt from MFP: Clarica ‚Äînow Sun Life Financial‚Äîand Maritime Life. The matter was settled out of court in 2002, reducing the city's payments to $145.7 million over 30 years. A public judicial inquiry was held to look into the funding process, headed by Justice Ronald C. Sills. He issued his report in October 2003, making 31 recommendations. Not one member of city council during the RIM Park ordeal‚Äîincluding mayor Lynne Woolstencroft‚Äîwas re-elected in the municipal elections in November 2003.\\"Legal setback in RIM Park scandal,\\" The Record, August 4, 2006, p. A1. All were either defeated or chose not to run again (Mike Connolly ran for a seat on regional council and was elected; Sean Strickland had run for a seat in the provincial election a month earlier and finished a close second to incumbent Elizabeth Witmer). The city's chief administrative officer and its treasurer both left their jobs as a result of the funding fiasco.

Notably, she has a major acting role in this film, something that save for 1943's Cabin in the Sky, Stormy Weather and a few later films she would rarely enjoy. The original top-billed star, Ralph Cooper, was host of Amateur Night at the Apollo Theater for 50 years.Richard Corliss, \\"Top 25 Important Movies On Race\\", TIME, February 6, 2008. He also served as the movie's production manager. Plot Duke Davis (Cooper) is a stage-show promoter in love with Ethel Andrews (Horne), a popular singer in his company dubbed \\"the Bronze Venus\\". Duke finds out that big-time promoters from New York City want to propel Ethel into the big leagues, but Ethel, out of loyalty and love for Duke, refuses to leave his small-time show. Duke, in a selfless act, orchestrates a deception to force Ethel to leave his show in order to better her career. However, the loss of the Bronze Venus causes Duke's own career to collapse and he soon finds himself working on a travelling medicine show where he goes from town to town, introducing a series of specialty musical acts and helping to sell Doc Dorando's all-purpose elixir. But when he hears that Ethel's New York gig is a flop, Duke goes to New York, where he is reunited with her. Soon after, Duke combines his stage show, the medicine show and Ethel's singing into a top nightclub act.

Background In 1643, the Parliamentarians made an overture to the Covenanters of Scotland for military assistance in the First English Civil War. On 29 November, the Covenanters and the Parliamentarians signed a military treaty in which the Scots would enter the war as an ally of the Parliamentarians and attack Royalist position in northern England. In January 1644, the Covenanters entered Northumberland with an army of 18,000 foot and 3,000 horse commanded by Alexander Leslie, 1st Earl of Leven. The immediate expectation on the part of the Parliamentarians was that the Covenanters would capture the strategic Royalist stronghold of Newcastle. The town of Newcastle, however, was a medieval walled fortress complete with a ‚ÄúHigh Castle.‚Äù The Royalist garrison was only 500 men but the town had access to the North Sea and international trade including guns, ammunition, and grains. The Royalist forces in northern England and Newcastle were commanded by the Marquis of Newcastle and before the Scots approached he took refuge in Newcastle and reinforced the garrison with the addition of a Royalist force of 5,000 commanded by Colonel Sir Thomas Glemham. Before the battle The Covenanter army began arriving in the vicinity of Newcastle on 2 February. Covenanter musketeers fired on the city forts from open fields and the Royalists responded with musket and cannon shots from inside the fortification. Nothing came of the initial exchange and the Covenanters backed away and retired for the night a mile from Newcastle. On 3 February, Lord Leven attacked an outlying fort in Shieldfield and summoned Newcastle to surrender. Glemham, now serving as the Governor of Newcastle, requested five days to consider the proposition and respond. Lord Leven granted the request as it would give him the time that he needed to bring up the siege guns and prepare for an assault. As the full Covenanter army reached the vicinity of Newcastle over the next couple of days it had to be quartered all across the surrounding countryside. Time passed. Newcastle did not surrender and Lord Leven did not attack. Unwilling to simply sit in Newcastle and wait for an attack, the Royalists on 19 February sent thirty-five troops of horse out in an attempt to spring a surprise attack on their besiegers. The attack took place west of Newcastle at Corbridge. Although the attack was not a complete surprise, the Royals killed or captured over one hundred of the Scots. The attack caused Lord Leven to take action. On 22 February, Leven ended the siege and began to move his army across the River Tyne south into Sunderland and toward Durham. At Newcastle, Leven left six regiments with Sir James Lumsden as a covering force. Meanwhile, the Royalist forces in Newcastle were reinforced with twelve troops of horse from Yorkshire commanded by Sir Charles Lucas. This brought the total number of Royalist forces at Newcastle to 14,000. Given the increased size of the Royalist forces at Newcastle, the Marquis decided to pursue Lord Leven‚Äôs army in an attempt to keep them from traveling further south and linking up with the Parliamentarians. As such, the Royalists left a force of 1,700 at Newcastle to defend against the regiments of Lumsden and followed the Covenanters to the vicinity of Boldon Hill where on 7 March they drew up in battle order two miles from the Scots. The Scots recognized the threat and responded by marching north and drawing up in battle order facing the Royalists. A clash, however, did not occur as the field between the two armies was impassable with many ditches and hedges between the two forces. So the two armies stood facing each other for several hours until the Royalists left the field at sunset. The next day there was minor skirmishing between small parties of horse, however, the Royalists did not challenge the Scots as they had done the day before. Over the next couple of weeks the respective leaders of the two armies repositioned their forces. The Royalists traveled to Durham; linked up with additional reinforcements; and returned back north to confront the Scots. The Covenanters traveled to the north side of the River Wear at Sunderland; added provisions as they could; and then attacked and captured the Royalist fort at South Shields near the mouth of the River Tyne east of Newcastle. Battle of Boldon Hill On about 22 March, the two armies became aware of each other‚Äôs respective positions and initiated the preparations for another confrontation. Over next two days the two armies retook positions near where they had faced each other earlier in the month. The Royals were again atop Boldon Hill while the Scots positioned themselves at Whitburn Lizard (Cleadon Hills) three miles away. On Sunday 24 March, the battle began when the Royalists advanced toward the Scots at ‚ÄúSermon time.‚Äù The Royalist musketeers took positions at hedges and stopped as the field between them and the Scots was impassable as before. The Covenanters responded with their musketeers taking positions and returning fire from the hedges on their end of the field. Cannon fire from both armies then commenced and continued without stop. In the afternoon, Scot dragoons attacked Royalist musketeers in East Boldon but otherwise the cannon dual which continued until midnight became the primary means of exchange during the battle. Eventually the Royalists retreated back to Boldon Hill and the Scots retired back to Whitburn Lizard. The exchange of musket and cannon fire in this battle was ultimately hampered by the terrain and was largely ineffective. Both sides claimed victory. The actual number of casualties is unknown; the Royalists claimed to have killed or captured 1,000 Scots to their admitted loss of 240 common soldiers while the Scots claimed to have killed 1,500 Royalists to their admitted casualties of 60 killed and 300 wounded. Aftermath After the battle, the Royalist army withdrew to Durham in route to York. Five days later the Covenanters followed the Royalist south. The two armies would meet again at the Siege of York in April and at the Battle of Marston Moor in July. After the Parliamentarian victory at Marston Moor, Leven and the Covenanters would return to Newcastle where on 15 August the siege of Newcastle would resume in earnest ultimately resulting in the formal surrender of the fortress on 27 October 1644.

It extends the Marvel 2099 imprint, which features other future versions of popular Marvel characters, such as Spider-Man 2099 and Hulk 2099. The series was written by John Francis Moore and largely pencilled by Ron Lim. The series began in October 1993 and lasted 35 issues along with two specials. It spawned a line of action figures, mostly featuring the more popular characters in the book. In issue #20, the title received a minor makeover, officially joining the 2099 imprint and changing its name to X-Men 2099 A.D., the \\"A.D.\\" standing for \\"After Doom\\". At the series' end, it was folded into 2099: World of Tomorrow, though members of the team were rarely seen after that point. The first issue featured a blue foil cover on cardstock and the double-sized 25th issue's cover was extra-glossy with foil letters, metallic silver ink, and embossed characters on a heavier wraparound cover.

Life Gregory of Valencia was born in Medina del Campo around 1549‚Äì50. He received his Bachelor of Arts from the University of Salamanca, where he undertook the Jesuit novitiate in 1565. In 1567, he went on to study theology at Salamanca, where through his instructor, Mancio, he became interested in the theological renewal movement initiated by Francisco de Vitoria. He studied theology at Valladolid (1568‚Äì1571). In 1571, he was called by St. Francis Borgia, superior general of the Jesuit order, to teach philosophy in Rome. There he was ordained a priest. He continued his studies at Salamanca (1572). Gregory of Valencia was appointed Professor at the University of Dillinguen (1573‚Äì1574), and at Ingolstadt (1575‚Äì1597) where he taught scholastic theology. He was a member of the Jesuit College of Ingolstadt while teaching at the University of Ingolstadt. He then became Professor and Director of the Jesuit College in Rome (1598) at the request of Pope Clement VIII.

He wrote a work in four volumes, covering the whole field of scholastic theology. He held the position of prefect of studies in the Collegio Romano until, broken in health through incessant work, he died at Naples on 25 March 1603. Pope Clement VIII honored him with the title of Doctor doctorum. Work Commentarii theologici, 1603 Gregory's work is characterized by a renewed Scholasticism in which natural reason is employed to delve deeper into preexisting theological sources. His magnum opus, the Theological Commentaries, employs the method of Francisco de Vitoria to comment on the Summa of Thomas Aquinas. Apart from various works of controversy and several apologies and speeches, his main doctrinal treatises are: * Analysis fidei Catholicae (1585). * Libri quinque de Trinitate (1586). * De reali Christi praesentia in eucharistia... libri tres (1587). * De rebus fidei hoc tempore controversis libri (1591). *Commentariorum theologicorum tomi quatuor.

Portrayed by Tupele Dorgu, the character first appeared on-screen during the episode airing on 6 September 2004. On 6 November 2009, it was announced that Dorgu had decided not to renew her contract which meant that her character would depart the show in March 2010. She made her last appearance on 19 March 2010. Storylines Karen heads to work and is waiting outside the factory and starts talking to Kelly Crabtree, a machinist at Underworld who is leaving as she is getting married. Karen tells Kelly that she will buy her a drink at lunchtime in the Rovers. Kelly comments about there being a clique and Karen says that Underworld is too small for that. Karen leaves her partner Steve and lets Sonia, Janice, Kelly and Hayley have a look through her stuff and pick what they want. Kelly is back after not getting married. Her husband-to-be slept with her chief bridesmaid after catching her with a cocktail waiter. Kelly asks Danny for her job back but is told she has been replaced by Sean. Danny winds Kelly and Sean up about who can have the job then tells them that they can both work at Underworld. In 2005, Kelly starts seeing Lloyd Mullaney (Craig Charles) but after she finds out he is cheating on her, she puts laxatives in his drink. Lloyd is rushed to hospital but recovers. Kelly later admits that she put the laxatives in his drink and they break up. Later, Lloyd wants to reconcile but she isn't prepared to forgive his cheating. In December 2005, Kelly wins ¬£2,500 on a scratch card. However, she is mugged the day after she wins it but the police return some of what was stolen. In a moving scene with Lloyd in his taxi following the attack, she asks whether it was her skin colour that made her a target. In 2006, Kelly's old friend Becky Granger (Katherine Kelly) appears on the scene. Much to Kelly's annoyance, Becky starts becoming obsessive with Kelly. She gets a job at Underworld and starts hanging around with her mates. She later buys Kelly a watch for her birthday, but because of Becky's criminal past, Kelly is suspicious that the watch is stolen. Becky later shows Kelly the receipt, and Kelly feels bad for not having trusted her friend. It is later revealed that Becky has spent too much on the watch and is unable to pay her rent. She is kicked out of her flat by her landlord, and, feeling guilty, Kelly offers to let her stay with her and Lloyd for a few days. A few days turn into a few weeks, and Kelly, who has become annoyed with Becky for coming between her and Lloyd, tells her that it is time for her to move out. Becky appears to \\"take it on the chin\\", but later swears to get revenge on Kelly. Becky starts flirting with Lloyd and plants a kiss on him, which he rejects, ordering her to leave. She also steals some of her workmates' jewellery and money and plants them in Kelly's locker. Kelly is arrested for theft and is sacked from Underworld. Kelly's criminal past is revealed to her workmates, who disown her as a friend. Becky disappears and Kelly is left to face the consequences of a crime she didn't commit. Lloyd advises Kelly to plead guilty to the thefts and receive a lesser charge. Eventually, her friends come to believe her. She is given a suspended sentence and given back her job at Underworld. Her relationship with Lloyd, however, takes a turn for the worse, as she thinks it was wrong for him to have suggested to her to plead guilty. She decides that she needed some time apart from Lloyd. During a drunken night out, Kelly ends up drowning her sorrows with Steve McDonald (Simon Gregson). One thing leads to another, and they have a one-night stand. The next morning, they agree it was a \\"one off\\" and to keep it quiet. However, Steve needs to prove he was with Kelly to get an alibi for a hit-and-run case, which he is a suspect in; this leads to everyone finding out. Even though they were on a break, Lloyd can't believe that Kelly had slept with Steve and calls off the relationship permanently. Kelly later gets another job working for Carla Connor (Alison King). She falls for Liam Connor (Rob James-Collier), Carla's brother-in-law, and is outraged when she discovers that he is seeing her best mate, Joanne Jackson (Zaraah Abrahams). As revenge, she gets Joanne sacked, but is shocked to discover that arch enemy Becky is Joanne's replacement. In early 2008, Kelly, desperate to earn some extra cash, begins stealing leftover material from the knicker bins at the factory. She then proceeds to sell her own products on the side. Fellow factory worker Wiki Dankowska (Wanda Opalinska) soon discovers what Kelly is up to and urges her to come clean. It all comes out when barmaid Lauren Wilson (Lucy Evans) gets a drink spilt down her top in the Rovers. As she takes her top off Liam notices that she is wearing one of Underworld's reject bras. Both Carla and Liam pretend to put the blame onto Wiki and sack her. After that Kelly comes clean and is nearly sacked but Wiki intervenes and gets her rehired (to make up for her wrongful accusation) and is placed on a lower wage with a six-month probation period. In October 2008, she begins dating bookmaker Dan Mason (Matthew Crompton) following his split from Leanne Battersby (Jane Danson). However, Dan soon tires of Kelly asking him to lend her money and dumps her just as they are due to go on holiday, leaving the Street without her. In March 2009, Kelly's bitterness towards Becky resurfaces when they get into a blazing row in The Rovers Return. Ignoring Becky's excuses that she is under pressure to serve her, due to a large group of music fans wanting food, Kelly goes behind the bar and starts helping herself. Becky is furious and throws her out of the pub just as landlady Liz McDonald (Beverley Callard) arrives back from lunch. Liz, to Becky's outrage, apologises to Kelly and offers her free drinks. In early 2010, Kelly has a lot of friction with boss Carla regarding time off, being angry that Sally Webster (Sally Dynevor) has got a lot of time off. On discovering that Sally has breast cancer, Kelly shows little sympathy towards her, calling her colleagues hypocrites for suddenly liking someone they hated, over an illness, causing further rivalry. Kelly's hatred of Carla boils over in March 2010, when she complains about her being lazy at work and labels her a \\"slapper\\" much to Kelly's indignation. Nick Tilsley (Ben Price), wanting to buy into the factory, spots an opportunity to use Kelly in his quest to attain shares. After sleeping with her, he persuades her to help him get access to the factory's accounts behind Carla's back. She complies with his request. Nick successfully buys into Underworld but Carla guesses correctly that Kelly has supplied him with information. Both Nick and Carla sack her. After an angry confrontation with Nick outside the factory for betraying her, Kelly then insults the factory girls in the Rovers about their dead-end working class lives as machinists. She announces that she is leaving Weatherfield before having an emotional goodbye with close friend Janice Battersby (Vicky Entwistle) who understands her anguish. She walks away, shouting, \\"I'm Kelly Crabtree with the legs!\\" before disappearing. Casting Kelly has been described as a feisty girl, who has a mouthy and outspoken nature, also she is from a mixed race background. The official Coronation Street website describes the character as \\"brash and bolshy, Kelly is the sort of girl who goes for what she wants and rarely thinks of the consequences of her actions\\". Dorgu has also described Kelly as \\"sexy and uses her sexuality to get what she wants. She doesn't take any prisoners and is incredibly selfish. She looks a bit like a dolly bird, but she is not to be underestimated.\\" Natalie Gumede, who would later play Kirsty Soames, had originally auditioned for the part of Kelly, but lost out to Dorgu. Development Kelly first appeared in September 2004. She had been working in the background of the Underworld clothing factory for some time. On the day that the rest of the workers take any notice of her, she is leaving to get married and move away. She quits her job and Sean Tully (Antony Cotton) takes over. However, her fianc√© has cheated on her and she decides to leave him. After begging for her job back at the factory, Danny Baldwin (Bradley Walsh) keeps both her and Sean. She begins a short-lived flirtation with her boss who gives her the nickname of \\"Legs\\", although it never quite develops into an affair. Always one for a challenge, Kelly tries to seduce gay best friend Sean Tully but fails. It was announced on 26 December 2007 that the character was to receive a big storyline during 2008, featuring a wager between the new father and son bookies on the street. Also lined up for the character in 2008 were parties selling underwear, which Kelly would model herself. It is also noted that Kelly's residence has never been seen or mentioned despite being on the soap for six years.

A native of Toronto, he joined the Tigers in 1965 and was a member of the 1968 Detroit Tigers team that won the World Series. He set a major league record by starting a game with six consecutive strikeouts in 1968. In January 1971, Hiller suffered a heart attack and underwent intestinal surgery to control his body's absorption of cholesterol. After missing the 1971 season, Hiller returned in 1972, helping the Tigers win the American League (AL) East title and winning Game 4 of the 1972 AL Championship Series. In 1973, he compiled a 1.44 earned run average (ERA) and broke the major league single-season saves record with 38. The Sporting News awarded Hiller its 1973 Comeback Player of the Year and Fireman of the Year awards. In 1974, Hiller set an AL record with 17 relief wins and was selected as a member of the All-Star team. He continued to rank among the AL's elite relief pitchers through the 1978 season. He retired from playing in May 1980 with a career win‚Äìloss record of 87‚Äì76, a 2.83 career ERA, and 1,036 strikeouts. He continues to hold the Tigers' club record with 545 career games pitched. Hiller returned to professional baseball in the mid-1980s as a minor league pitching coach for the Tigers. He was inducted into the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame, the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame, and Canada's Sports Hall of Fame. Early years Hiller was born in Toronto in 1943. He grew up in Scarborough, the son of an auto body repairman. He was a fan of the Toronto Maple Leafs while growing up and played ice hockey as a goaltender. He attended David-Mary Thompson Public School and West Hill High School, but dropped out after the 11th grade. He competed as a sprinter in the 220- and 440-yard dashes while in high school. He excelled in baseball as a pitcher, and reportedly once struck out 22 batters in a seven-inning game, including one batter who got on base due to a wild pitch (an Uncaught third strike). Detroit Tigers=Minor leagues from 1962 to 1965 In June 1962, Hiller, at age 19, signed a contract with the Detroit Tigers for $400 a month, a pair of spikes, and an old glove. Detroit scout Edwin \\"Cy\\" Williams discovered Hiller playing for the Scarborough Selects, an All-Star team composed of local sandlot players. Hiller played for the Tigers' Jamestown, New York, club in the New York-Pennsylvania League during the 1963 season. He appeared in 29 games, 22 as a starter, and compiled a 14‚Äì9 record with a 4.03 ERA, 11 complete games, and 172 strikeouts in 181 innings pitched. Hiller spent most of the 1964 season with the Duluth-Superior Dukes of the Northern League. He appeared in 30 games for the Dukes, 19 as a starter, and compiled a 10‚Äì13 record with a 3.45 ERA. In 1965, Hiller was assigned to the Montgomery Rebels in the Southern League where he was converted to a relief pitcher. In 47 games for Montgomery (43 in relief), he compiled a 5‚Äì7 record with a 2.53 ERA. Hiller noted in early 1966 that he initially viewed the assignment to the bullpen as a demotion, but became accustomed to the role: \\"You don't have to worry about pacing yourself. You just come in and throw hard all the time. It's more exciting, too, once you accustom yourself to pitching with men on base.\\" 1965 to 1967 seasons On September 5, 1965, the Tigers purchased Hiller from Montgomery. He made five relief appearances for the 1965 Tigers and did not allow a run in six innings pitched. Hiller began the 1966 season with the Tigers, but appeared in only one game, pitching two innings in relief against Washington on April 17, giving up two hits and two earned runs. Three days later, Hiller flew back to Detroit where he was hospitalized at Detroit Osteopathic Hospital with pneumonia and pleurisy. On May 11, he was sent down to the Syracuse Chiefs of the International League. He compiled a 4.45 ERA in 54 relief appearances for Syracuse in 1966. Hiller started the 1967 season with the Toledo Mud Hens of the International League, compiling a 5‚Äì1 record with a 3.00 ERA. He was called up by the Tigers in late June for his third stint with the club. Farm director Don Lund noted at the time that Hiller had recently mastered his control on breaking pitches to balance his excellent fastball. Over the last three months of the 1967 season, Hiller appeared in 11 games, eight as a starter, and compiled a 4‚Äì2 record with a 2.50 ERA. 1968 and 1969 seasons Hiller spent his first full season in the majors as a reliever and spot starter for the 1968 Tigers team that won the American League pennant and the 1968 World Series. Hiller appeared in 39 games, 12 as a starter, and compiled a 9‚Äì6 record with a 2.39 ERA and 78 strikeouts in 128 innings pitched. On August 6, he set a major league record when he struck out six consecutive batters against Cleveland to start a game. On August 20, he pitched a one-hit complete game shutout against the Chicago White Sox; the one hit came in the eighth inning on a ball that just missed Hiller's glove. Hiller also had two relief appearances in the 1968 World Series against the St. Louis Cardinals, pitching the last two innings in the 7‚Äì3 Game 3 loss, and facing five batters without recording an out in Game 4, a 10‚Äì1 loss. He allowed six hits and three walks, posting a 13.50 ERA, but the Tigers recovered to win the Series in seven games. Following a players' strike in the spring of 1969, Hiller returned to the Tigers. He appeared in 40 games for the 1969 Tigers, but his ERA increased by more than a point-and-a-half to 3.99. During the 1969 season, Hiller acquired the nickname \\"Ratso\\" after he went with teammates to see the movie Midnight Cowboy. The character \\"Ratso\\" Rizzo, played by Dustin Hoffman, had a limp, as did Hiller at the time. Hiller returned to form in 1970, appearing in 47 games, 42 in relief, and compiling a 6‚Äì6 record with a 3.03 ERA. On October 1, in the final game of the season, he pitched a two-hit, complete-game shutout and struck out 11 batters, including seven in a row. With Hiller pitching quickly, the game was played in only one hour and 41 minutes ‚Äì the fastest game of the year at Tiger Stadium. Heart attack On January 11, 1971, Hiller, at the age of 27, suffered a heart attack at his home in Duluth, Minnesota. Hiller described the attack as follows: \\"I had just gotten up and was having a cup of coffee. I lit up a cigarette. It was strange ‚Äì a heaviness in my chest. It felt like the pneumonia I had in 1966 so I put the cigarette out. Later I had another cigarette and had the same feeling. So I didn't smoke the rest of the day.\\" He went to the hospital when the pain returned that night. He was hospitalized for three weeks and notified the Tigers of his heart attack in mid-February. Hiller was placed on a strict diet, quit smoking cigarettes, and lost 20 pounds in the month after his heart attack. By late March, he weighed 180 pounds, 30 pounds lighter than he had been during the 1970 season. By the time of his 28th birthday, Hiller had lost 40 pounds and four pant sizes in the waist. He reported at the time: \\"The doctors have never even hinted that I'd be able to pitch again.\\" Despite the pessimism of doctors, Hiller made a birthday promise to himself that he would pitch again. In April, Hiller underwent an ileo-bypass, a surgery in which about the doctors removed seven feet of his small intestines ‚Äì the portions that are responsible for absorbing cholesterol. The Tigers announced in May that Hiller would not return to the team during the 1971 season. In August 1971, Hiller reported that he had lost 50 pounds (down to 160 pounds) and was selling furniture in Duluth and playing golf and paddleball. The comeback begins in 1972 In February 1972, the Tigers invited Hiller to training camp as a minor league coach for the Lakeland Tigers. After spending the first half of the 1972 season as a pitching coach for Lakeland, Hiller announced in late June that he was running two miles a day, in top shape at 170 pounds, and ready to return to pitching. He said: \\"I'm ready to go. I'm just waiting for that call from Detroit. It's up to them now if they want me.\\" Hiller suspected that the Tigers' willingness to take a chance on him was impacted by the sudden heart attack and death of Detroit Lions receiver Chuck Hughes during a game at Tiger Stadium in October 1971. On July 7, 1972, the Tigers reinstated Hiller to their roster. He returned to the mound the next day, having had no rehab games in the minors and after not facing a batter in 18 months. He gave up a two-run home run to the first batter, Dick Allen, but Detroit manager Billy Martin opined that Hiller had pitched well, and Hiller confirmed after the game \\"this is what I want. I really want it.\\" Two days later, Hiller returned to the mound and retired the side in a victory that gave the Tigers sole possession of first place in the American League East. On October 1, Hiller pitched a complete- game, five-hit victory over Milwaukee Brewers that Jim Hawkins of the Detroit Free Press called the \\"biggest win of the season\\". After the game, which was Hiller's first win since October 1, 1970, he told reporters: \\"I go at this game with a little different attitude than I used to. Before my sickness, I was more uptight every time I pitched. I used to get nervous warming up. Now I don't worry about tomorrow. If I do well, I do well. If I don't ‚Äì well, there'll aways be another day.\\" In the last half of the 1972 season, Hiller helped the Tigers win the American League East pennant, appearing in 23 games with a strong 2.03 ERA. He also pitched in three games in the 1972 American League Championship Series against the Oakland Athletics, winning Game 4 when Detroit scored three times in the bottom of the 10th inning. The comeback peaks in 1973 Hiller's comeback peaked in 1973 with what baseball historian Bill James rated as the most valuable season by a relief pitcher in baseball history. Hiller appeared in 65 games, all in relief, and compiled a 10‚Äì5 record. He broke Clay Carroll's Major League Baseball record with 38 saves. His single-season saves record stood for 10 years until Dan Quisenberry tallied 45 saves in 1983, and remained a Tigers team record until broken by Todd Jones in 2000. Hiller also accumulated a career-low 1.44 ERA in 125 innings to win the American League ERA title; Rollie Fingers ranked second at 1.92. Demonstrating how dominant Hiller was during the 1973 season, his Adjusted ERA+, which adjusts a pitcher's ERA according to the pitcher's ballpark and the average ERA of the pitcher's league in a given year, was 285. Only two pitchers in major league history are known to have recorded a higher rating: Hall of Famers Tim Keefe in 1880 (293) and Pedro Martinez in 2000 (291). Hiller also led the American League's pitchers with 65 appearances and 60 games finished. On September 30, Hiller became the last man to win a game and the last to throw a pitch in the original Yankee Stadium, getting Yankees' first baseman Mike Hegan to fly out to center field in an 8‚Äì5 Detroit win. As the first major league player to suffer a heart attack and then return an active competitor, Hiller's comeback was rated as \\"one of the most heartwarming sagas in sports.\\" Slugger Frank Howard called it \\"the kind of thing you see once in a lifetime.\\" After the 1973 season, Hiller won numerous awards for his remarkable accomplishments, including the following: * The Sporting News Comeback Player of the Year Award for the American League. * The Sporting News Fireman of the Year Award for the American League. * The Hutch Award as the player who \\"best exemplified the fighting spirit\\" of Fred Hutchinson. * Detroit baseball writers selected him as the \\"Tiger of the Year\\". Hiller received 32 votes (out of 33 votes cast) for the award, more than any other player in the history of the award to that time. * Detroit sports writers and broadcasters also selected him as Detroit's \\"Sportsman of the Year\\" for 1973. * In May 1974, the American Heart Association presented Hiller with its Heart of the Year Award which had not previously been awarded to an athlete and which been presented to President Richard Nixon the previous year. The Heart Association cited Hiller \\"for his courage in meeting the personal challenge of heart attack . . . and for his inspiring example to other heart attack victims.\\" In an era where no relief pitcher had ever won a Cy Young Award (Mike Marshall became the first one year later), Hiller finished fourth in the voting for the 1973 American League Cy Young Award behind starters Jim Palmer, Nolan Ryan, and Catfish Hunter. He also tied for fourth in the voting for the American League Most Valuable Player Award, behind Reggie Jackson and Rod Carew. In January 1976, he was honored in Philadelphia with a Most Courageous Athlete award and acknowledged that, prior to the heart attack, he smoked too much, drank too much and ate too much. He described the broader life lesson that he hoped would be drawn from his comeback: \\"I hope I've helped a lot of people by talking to them. I hope they understand when you have a heart attack you haven't come to the end of your life or the end of your career.\\" 1974 and 1975 seasons John Hiller in the 1970s In 1974, Hiller had another strong season as he broke the American League record with 17 relief wins. He appeared in 59 games, all in relief, compiled a 17‚Äì14 record with 2.64 ERA and a career-high 134 strikeouts. Hiller won his 10th game of the season on July 1 and was on pace to break Roy Face's major league record of 18 relief wins set in 1959. Two weeks later, he was named to the American League All-Star team for the only time his career, though he did not pitch in the game. On September 13, Hiller recorded his 17th relief win of the season against the Milwaukee Brewers. The win broke the American League record of 16 relief wins set by Dick Radatz in 1964. Bill Campbell tied the record in 1975, but it has not been broken. In 1975, the Tigers compiled one of the worst seasons in club history with 102 losses and a team ERA of 4.27. However, Hiller had another outstanding season. He opened the season without allowing a run in his first five appearances totaling over 14 innings. He continued to pitch well and, during a stretch from late June to late July, he did not allow a hit in 10 games and 16-2/3 innings. He also struck out 87 batters in 70-2/3 inning pitched ‚Äì giving him a career-high average of 11.1 strikeouts per nine innings. Hiller noted in late July: \\"I've never struck out people like this before.\\" While pitching against Cleveland on July 25, 1975, Hiller \\"felt something tear\\" in his throwing arm and was sidelined for the remainder of the season. While trying to come back in September, Hiller reported that, although the pain had subsided, he could still feel a lump under his left arm where the injury occurred. Despite playing only half the season, he led the team with 36 appearances and 14 saves and compiled a 2.17 ERA. 1976 to 1980 seasons In 1976, Hiller returned to the Tigers' spring training with a shaved head. Sports writers joked that Hiller's head was as smooth as his delivery and compared the new look to Fu Manchu or \\"a cross between Genghis Khan and Kojak.\\" Hiller got off to a slow start in the early weeks of the 1976 season, holding a 1‚Äì3 record and a 3.47 ERA in late May. However, he then regained his form and won 11 of 15 decisions for the balance of the season; his 2.38 ERA was on par with the 2.34 ERA recorded by the team's rookie sensation Mark Fidrych, who won the 1976 Rookie of the Year award. Hiller ranked fourth in the American League in games finished (46) and ninth in both adjusted pitching runs and adjusted pitching wins. He closed the 1976 season with a rare start (his first since 1972) and threw a four-hit, complete-game shutout against the Milwaukee Brewers. In April 1977, the Tigers traded Willie Horton to the Texas Rangers for relief pitcher Steve Foucault. Foucault edged out Hiller as the Tigers' stopper, as Hiller was asked to pitch both in relief and as a spot starter. He started eight games and threw three complete games. However, his ERA jumped by more than a point to 3.56, and he compiled a record of 8‚Äì14 with only seven saves. In late September 1977, doctors diagnosed Hiller with an enlarged liver, possibly caused by the intestinal surgery he received after his heart attack; doctors advised that he should never have another drink for the rest of his life. Hiller reclaimed his role as the Tigers' closer in 1978. He appeared in 51 games, all in relief, and his total of 46 games finished ranked sixth in the American League. He led the 1978 Tigers with a 2.34 ERA and 15 saves. The Tigers honored Hiller on June 25, 1978, with a John Hiller Recognition Day at Tiger Stadium. In 1979, Hiller had 43 relief appearances, but Aurelio Lopez (acquired in a trade with the St. Louis Cardinals before the season began) took over as the Tigers' closer as Hiller's ERA soared to 5.22. Hiller played with pain in his left shoulder during the 1979 season, and his season ended on August 27 when he was placed on the disabled list. Hiller believed that he injured his shoulder in mid-May while \\"messing around trying to throw a screwball.\\" Hiller broke Hooks Dauss' team record of 538 games pitched. Hiller returned to the Tigers briefly in 1980, just long enough to break Hooks Dauss' franchise record of 538 games pitched. Hiller broke Dauss' record on April 29 and ended his career having appeared in 545 games as a Tiger. He was the last member of Detroit's 1968 World Series championship team to remain with the club. During the 1970s, Hiller appeared in 426 games for the Tigers, nearly double the total of any other Detroit pitcher. On May 30, 1980, after finishing a clubhouse card game with teammates, Hiller called a team meeting and announced that he was retiring. The Tigers interrupted the game that night to announce Hiller's decision. Hiller stepped out of the dugout in street clothes and waved to the crowd. The crowd reacted with polite applause at the surprise announcement and then began chanting, \\"We want Hiller! We want Hiller!\\" until the game was interrupted to allow Hiller to step onto the field for a final bow. Hiller told reporters after the game: \\"I just don't think I can compete here anymore. . . . I don't want to embarrass myself. I always said the hitters would let me know when it was time to retire, and they did.\\" After his retirement, the Detroit Free Press paid tribute to Hiller, not on its sports page but on its editorial page: > \\"[W]hat sets the John Hiller story apart is neither the professional skill > nor the personal grace and style that were his in such an abundant measure. > Detroiters have a special affection for Hiller for what he had to overcome > and for the dogged persistence with which he fought his way back from a > heart attack. By will and discipline, he made himself a fit professional > athlete again. He overcame.\\" Hiller ended his career with a record of 87‚Äì76, a 2.83 ERA, 545 appearances, and 1,036 strikeouts in 1,242 innings pitched. At the time of his retirement, his 125 saves ranked behind only Sparky Lyle (231), Hoyt Wilhelm (154) and Rollie Fingers (136) in major league history, and remained a Detroit Tigers club record until 1993. Family, later years, and honors Hiller married Janis Patricia Baldwin in 1965. They had three children, including son Steve and daughter Wendy. His first marriage ended in divorce in February 1985, and he married his second wife, Linette, later that year. After retiring from baseball, Hiller returned to his home in Duluth, Minnesota. Hiller and his first wife had lived in Duluth since 1966. In 1982, he bought an abandoned farm near Felch in Michigan's Upper Peninsula and played baseball for the Felch Rangers. He was appointed constable for Felch in 1983. Hiller later lived for more than 30 years in Hermansville and then Iron Mountain, both in the Upper Peninsula. He also supported himself with jobs selling insurance, owning a pet shop, operating a country store, and working as a Pepsi distributor. From 1985 to 1987, he returned to professional baseball as a minor league pitching coach for the Tigers. His coaching career ended when he was diagnosed in 1988 with a blockage behind his right knee that had caused the arteries in his lower leg to deteriorate. Doctors recommended amputation, but Hiller declined. Hiller has been inducted into several halls of fame, including the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame (inducted 1985), Michigan Sports Hall of Fame (inducted 1989), Canada's Sports Hall of Fame (inducted 1999), and the Ontario (Canada) Sports Hall of Fame (inducted 2017).

Square D is a flagship brand of Schneider Electric, which acquired Square D in 1991. The company was listed on the New York Stock Exchange for 55 years prior to its acquisition without reporting financial loss in any calendar quarter, paying out 220 consecutive quarterly dividends to shareholders.  History  The Square D plant on Rivard Street in Detroit, 1920. 1900s The classic \\"Square D\\" logo can be found on their products. Adopted circa 1910. safety switch, utilizing cartridge fuses. The company was founded on December 15, 1902 by Bryson Dexter Horton and James B. McCarthy. In 1903 they incorporated as the McBride Manufacturing Company. During the first decade of business, the company expanded into various other electrical products. In 1908, the company was renamed Detroit Fuse and Manufacturing. Horton, an 1895 electrical engineering graduate of the University of Michigan, was credited with the invention of the safety switch, which encased high voltage switches and started the company's main line of business of circuit breakers and encased control panels. Their first enclosed safety switch was introduced in 1909. Soon after their renaming to Detroit Fuse and Manufacturing, the company adopted their famous logo ‚Äî a capital \\"letter D\\" for Detroit, enclosed in a square. The logo was stamped on all Square D's switches and products. The combination of an easily remembered monogram logo and their great popularity resulted in customers referring their products as \\"Square D\\". Consequently, the company trademarked the logo and in 1917 they renamed the company Square D. Horton served as Square D's president until 1928 1920s-1930s In the early 1920s Square D sold the majority of their fuse business in order to focus more on their safety switches and other safety products. The company began an aggressive marketing campaign to promote their safety switches. Their advertisements, which became known as \\"Jones is Dead!\\", directed public attention to the safety hazards of exposed electrical switches in factories. Square D hoped to capitalize on the growing concern of factory safety. One such fully working Square D safety switch from 1922 was donated in November 2003 to the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History. By 1929, Square D merged with a Milwaukee-based industrial controller company and began producing Westinghouse-licensed circuit breakers. In 1935 Square D began producing its own range of circuit breakers for both commercial and residential uses.  1940s-1970s  1970s-present  In 1991, the company was acquired and became a subsidiary of Schneider Electric.http://www.schneider-electric.us/about-us/company-profile/history/ In 2003, the Square D by Schneider Electric brand celebrated its 100th anniversary.  Product lines  A 20-ampere double-pole Square D circuit breaker. Introduced in 1955, the Square D \\"QO\\" line of miniature 3/4-inch circuit breakers may be their best-known product line, used in the electrical distribution boards of many residences in North America. The \\"QO\\" designation stands for \\"Qwik-Open\\"; Square D claims these are the fastest-opening breakers in the industry, responding within 1/60th of a second, or just one full power cycle on a 60 Hz AC line. QO breakers feature a window with a visual trip indication flag, making it easy to identify a tripped breaker in a panel. A \\"QOB\\" version is also offered, which stands for \\"Qwik-Open Bolted\\", featuring a screw that secures the breaker in the panel. This is useful in industrial installations where vibration might cause a QO snap-in breaker to loosen and prevents them from accidentally being popped out while an adjacent breaker is being changed. A QO breaker could easily be clipped into a QOB panel. The QO and QOB series breakers are by far their most popular commercial products. A second miniature circuit breaker line is sold under the brand name Homeline, marked \\"HOM\\". Designed for value, they lack the fast-trip feature and the visual trip flag of the \\"QO\\" series, cost one-third to half less, and are physically not interchangeable with \\"QO\\" breakers. In the 1960s Square D introduced the Safety Line distribution centers for large industrial electrical power loads. This design had solid or tubular busing with each large fused switch clamping onto the busing. The company also sold the B line 277-480 volt panels, generally used for lighting in the 1970s and 1980s. Another well-known Square D product line is the Powerlink circuit breaker, created for lighting control in commercial buildings. B Line and D Line were the breaker panels in which Powerline breakers were used. Eventually, the company branded Powerline and Powerlink panels and breakers. Powerlink was a heavy duty 277-volt lighting breaker, used in large buildings with 277-volt lighting loads. These were also favored for their robust design, and functional reliability. This means less panel space and wire are needed. The I-Line series of distribution panelboards is favored by many electricians for its ease and safety of adding new breakers. The panel uses a stacked bus system that protects the energized bus from accidental contact and the breaker can be easily installed using a flat blade screwdriver contacting only de- energized parts of the backplane of the panel. The design of the breakers and panel require that extra attention be paid to phase rotation, as the right (even-numbered) side of the panel will have the phases in a C-B-A configuration whereas the left (odd-numbered) side of the panel will have a more standard A-B-C arrangement. Square D also made disconnect switches, both fused, and unfused, as well as Heating Air Conditioning and Refrigeration (HACR) rated switch boxes that held an HACR breaker for use as a disconnect. The QO type breaker fits this disconnect box. These were popular with food service, grocers, and other cold storage users. Other companies used terms like \\"Quick Lag\\" and similar brand name letter coding on their circuit breakers, e.g., QL, QLRB, etc. No one knows who started the brand coding for sure. These brand-specific letter codes had nothing to do with National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) specifications or coding, although they appear to have been intended to emulate NEMA codes.

Palm Products GmbH (commonly abbreviated to PPG) was a manufacturer of audio synthesizers. Founded and owned by Wolfgang Palm, PPG was located in Hamburg, Germany and, for 12 years from around 1975 to 1987, manufactured an acclaimed and eclectic range of electronic musical instruments, all designed by Palm. In March 2020, it was announced that PPG had been acquired by the software company Plugin Alliance.  Beginnings  Wolfgang Palm was active as a keyboardist in bands in the Hamburg area before becoming aware of the then- burgeoning synthesizer market. Palm started his company in 1975. Although he had reportedly built many synthesizers on his own, his first commercially available synthesizer was a modular synthesizer, dubbed the 300 Series, which, despite being fairly sophisticated, failed to sell in large quantities. Motivated by his failure and inspired by the design of the popular Minimoog, Palm introduced the 1002 and 1020 synthesizers. Both were portable, analog, monophonic, and relatively compact. The 1002 used voltage-controlled oscillators; however, the 1020 was revolutionary in its implementation of digitally controlled oscillators, which were much more stable and had a distinctive sound that later became PPG's trademark.  The Wave  PPG continued to develop and release digital synthesizers, most of which were met with little success. In 1979, PPG introduced the 340/380 System, a complex digital synthesizer which consisted of the 340 Processor Unit, the 340 Generator Unit, and the 380 Event Generator (a 16-track sequencer). It also came with a \\"Computer Terminal\\" which included a monitor, 8-inch floppy disk drives, and a 5 octave keyboard used for manual playing of events into the sequencer and for polyphonic playing with the 340 Wave Generator). Despite its own shortcomings, which included its complex functionality and its high price, it received publicity when it was used by Tangerine Dream and Thomas Dolby during the early 1980s. In 1980, Wolfgang Palm introduced a new concept, dubbed \\"wavetable synthesis\\". Wavetable synthesis allowed for the storage of short samples of a larger soundwave into individual slots of a ‚Äúwavetable‚Äù that was stored in the memory of the system. The first PPG synthesizer to implement wavetable synthesis was the Wavecomputer 360, released in 1980 in two versions - the 360A, with 4 oscillators, and the 360B, with 8. However, the synthesizer sounded relatively thin, a consequence of having only one oscillator per voice and the typical limited polyphony of most synthesizers of its era. PPG soon found success with the release of the Wave 2, which debuted in 1981, priced at around US$10,000 (GB¬£5,500). It contained analog envelopes, LFOs, filters, and digital wavetable oscillators. Whereas traditional analog synthesizers were only capable of 5 or 6 waveforms per oscillator, the PPG Wave 2 offered for each oscillator 64 selectable waveforms available from 30 individual wavetables. There were a total of 1,920 waveforms per oscillator available for use. Tangerine Dream helped with developing the synthesizer, and the analog VCF and VCA were added to in order to bring more warmth to the sound to prevent it from sounding tinny like the Wavecomputer 360 had. In total, around 1,000 Waves were manufactured between 1981 and 1987 with two different updates to the model: the PPG Wave 2.2, which added more waveforms and samples, and the 2.3, which added multitimbrality and MIDI. It was the most successful product PPG manufactured. The PPG Wave has been used by artists such as David Bowie, The Fixx, Thomas Dolby, Depeche Mode, Art of Noise, The Cars, Jean Michel Jarre, Pet Shop Boys, Rush, Gary Numan, Robert Palmer, The Psychedelic Furs, Talk Talk, Tangerine Dream, Tears For Fears, Ultravox, Steve Winwood, Stevie Wonder, and many others.  Computer- controlled synthesizers and the Realizer  By 1982, Wolfgang Palm was set on introducing computers to music with the Waveterm, a rack-mounted computer system with a built-in monitor, two 8-inch floppy drives (later upgraded to 5.25-inch), and a proprietary Flex9-based operating system running on a Eurocom II motherboard created by the German company Eltec. In the Waveterm B, this was replaced by a proprietary Motorola 68000-based motherboard running an entirely proprietary operating system. It was designed to be used with many of PPG's synthesizers, including the Wave, by specifying points on a graph displayed on the screen. One could also sample acoustic sounds, or use sounds provided by PPG on disks. The Waveterm was manufactured through 1985. By this time, to raise sales, PPG had dropped the prices of many of their synthesizers, including the Wave, which would now be sold at around US$6,500 (GB¬£3,500). In 1986, Wolfgang Palm designed and began work on a prototype for the Realizer, an all-in-one studio machine not unlike modern day music workstations which combined production, recording, sequencing, and mixing tools into one machine in addition to a sophisticated sampling and synthesis system. It also had the ability to load emulations of other popular synthesizers, such as the Minimoog. The system was too complicated and unfeasible for its time period, and its expensive manufacturing costs caused a projected retail price of almost US$60,000 (GB¬£34,000). As such, it was never sold, and never got beyond the prototype phase. There are rumored to be two prototype versions in existence, each with slightly different front panel controls. As interest in Palm's other products waned, the cost of developing the Realizer put PPG into debt. As such, PPG officially ceased business operations and closed its doors in 1987 after shelving the Realizer project.

For Waldorf Music he designed the digital ASIC for the first Waldorf product, the Microwave (1989), which essentially contained the complete sound engine of the PPG wave 2.2. Used by many professional artists (including Ace of Base and Depeche Mode), the Waldorf Wave continues to be used even after production has ended. Later Waldorf products like the MicroWave II, XT, Q, microQ, and the Blofeld had all or several of the original wavetables and waveshapes of the PPG Waves. In 2002, Steinberg released PLEX, a software synthesizer by big numbers. Palm had a large influence on synthesis and electronic music as a whole. The PPG wave's unique sound, and its widespread usage on numerous electronic and new wave records could be argued to be a cause for the rise in the popularity of digital synthesis in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Wavetable synthesis is still prevalent and used in various hardware and software synthesizers alike, and the Wave's unique integration of analogue and digital circuitry influenced synthesizers such as the Monowave and the E-mu Emulator.

In Chilean historiography, where the event is often called the Disaster of Curalaba (), the battle marks the end of the Conquest of Chile (la conquista) period in Chile's history, although the fast Spanish expansion in the south had already been halted in the 1550s. The battle contributed to unleash a general Mapuche uprising that resulted in the Destruction of the Seven Cities. This severe crisis reshaped Colonial Chile and forced the Spanish to reassess their mode of warfare. History On December 21, 1598, governor Mart√≠n Garc√≠a O√±ez de Loyola traveled to Pur√©n leading 50 men. On the second day they camped in Curalaba without taking protective measures. The Mapuche people, aware of their presence, with their cavalry led by Pelantaru and his lieutenants, Anganam√≥n and Guaiquimilla, with three hundred men, shadowed his movements and made a surprise night raid. Completely surprised, the governor and almost all of his soldiers and companions were killed. This event was called the Disaster of Curalaba by the Spaniards. It not only involved the death of the Spanish governor, but the news rapidly spread among the Mapuche and triggered a general revolt, long- prepared by the toqui Paillamachu, that destroyed Spanish camps and towns south of the B√≠o-B√≠o River over the next few years.

Since 2001 WCLZ has been broadcasting an Adult Alternative format. It operates on FM frequency 98.9 and is under ownership of Saga Communications. Programming WCLZ operates 24 hours a day with an adult album alternative format. History The 98.9 frequency debuted on April 11, 1965 as WCME-FM, licensed to Brunswick, Maine about 30 miles north of Portland. The station began as a simulcast of WCME (900 AM). The stations played middle of the road (music) and aired local information. The WCME-AM-FM call sign eventually became WKXA-AM-FM. By 1980, WKXA-FM was a full-time country music station with an 80,000 watt signal which was easily heard in Portland and was giving established country station WPOR (1490 AM, now WBAE, and 101.9 FM) some competition. The WCLZ call letters were installed on 98.9 in 1984, when the station picked up an adult contemporary format. Several years later, the station adopted the Adult Album Alternative (AAA) format for which it is known today. The WCLZ call letters remained on 98.9 until 1999, when the station was sold from Fuller-Jeffrey Broadcasting to Citadel Communications. Following the sale, the WCLZ call letters and format moved to 95.5 (now WPPI), and 98.9 became WTPN \\"98.9 The Point\\", with a modern hot adult contemporary format. The call letters and format of WCLZ returned to the frequency in 2001, after 95.5 became WJJB-FM and began simulcasting sports programming from WJAE (1440 AM, now WRED) and WJJB (900 AM, the former and present WCME). WCLZ was sold to Saga Communications in 2007 after the FCC required Citadel to sell two Portland stations due to the company's acquisition of ABC Radio. The other station sold was WCYI (93.9 FM, now WARX) in Lewiston, Maine, which for a time simulcast WCLZ, when held in The Last Bastion Station Trust, LLC, the trust Citadel set up to sell the two Portland stations, as well as several other stations across the United States in order to get under the market cap (WCYI would be separately sold to the Educational Media Foundation). Several of WCLZ's shows moved to WBLM and other Citadel owned stations before the transfer into the trust.

The species is a relatively small member of the family, growing to about in total length (including tail). V. beccarii is endemic to the Aru Islands off New Guinea, living in an arboreal habitat. The skin color of adults is completely black, to which one common name refers. Taxonomy V. beccarii was first described as Monitor beccarii by Doria, in 1874. Years later, it was classified as a subspecies of the closely related emerald tree monitor (V. prasinus), but a 1991 review of the complex returned V. beccarii to species status, based on its black colouration and keeled scales on the neck. Arguably, it should be maintained as a subspecies of the emerald tree monitor based on similarities in their hemipeneal structures,B√∂hme W, Ziegler T (1997). \\"Varanus melinus sp. n., ein neuer Waran aus der V. indicus-Gruppe von den Molukken, Indonesien \\". Herpetofauna 19 (111): 26‚Äì34. but genetic evidence supports their treatment as two different species.Ziegler T, Schmitz A, Koch A, B√∂hme W (2007). \\"A review of the subgenus Euprepiosaurus of Varanus (Squamata: Varanidae): morphological and molecular phylogeny, distribution and zoogeography, with an identification key for the members of the V. indicus and the V. prasinus species groups\\". Zootaxa 1472: 1-28. Nevertheless, it is part of the V. prasinus species complex. Etymology The generic name Varanus is derived from the Arabic word waral (Ÿàÿ±ŸÑ), which translates as \\"monitor\\" in English. Its specific name, beccarii, is named after the Italian explorer Odoardo Beccari.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (\\"Beccari\\", pp. 20-21). Description leftHatchlings and juveniles of V. beccarii are a dark grey in colour, with regular rows of bright yellow-green dots which are particularly noticeable on their backs. As they mature, they turn completely black, losing the colourful dots. Fully grown specimens reach in overall length (including tail), with the males slightly larger than the females. The black tree monitor is generally well adapted for living in trees. Its tail is particularly long, sometimes two-thirds of the overall length, and is used in a prehensile manner to stabilize the animal in the branches. In fact, the tail is used solely for this purpose, as the animal does not evince the defensive tail-lashing behaviour seen in other monitor species. Like other tree monitors, they sport some of the longest and most slender forelimbs of all monitors, which end in elongated digits tipped with large claws and adhesive soles, helping it maintain grip in the trees and catch prey. It also has unusually long teeth for a monitor of its size, which may help it to hold on to prey it catches in the canopy. In the wild, the black tree monitor is reported to be nervous and high-strung; it will flee if threatened, and if handled carelessly, will bite, scratch, and defecate on the offender. Geographic range and habitat V. beccarii is native to the Aru Islands in Indonesia, where it is known locally as waweyaro. It mainly inhabits humid forests and mangrove swamps, being highly arboreal. Feeding habits The black tree monitor is primarily insectivorous, consuming mostly insects but also smaller lizards, small mammals such as shrews, scorpions, eggs, and the nestlings of birds. Like other members of the V. prasinus species complex, they are occasionally seen eating plants in captivity, although the gut contents of wild monitors were not reported to contain plant matter. In captivity, newly hatched members of the V. prasinus species complex often refuse food for more than two weeks, although force feeding may be recommended before then and until they begin feeding by themselves. Like other monitor lizards, this species is highly intelligent amongst reptiles, and like others of the V. prasinus species complex, demonstrates complex problem solving abilities, fine motor coordination, and skilled forelimb movements when hunting prey. When it cannot reach prey in tight crevices and hole with its jaws, it will instead extract prey by reaching for it with a forelimb and hooking it out with its claws, allowing it to exploit a wider range of niches.  Predators  It is preyed upon by larger lizards and snakes, as well as foxes, which were introduced to the region. It is also hunted by humans. The hunting threat by humans has gone down, but humans still are a threat.  Reproduction  Little is known about this species' reproduction in the wild. Some report that this species and the rest of the V. prasinus species complex lay their eggs in arboreal termite nests. The surfaces of such nests would be relatively dry, despite very high relative humidity.  Breeding in captivity  Captive breeding has been met with mixed success. A common problem is the death of embryos shortly prior to hatching. Possible causes include substrate humidity being too high at least at the last third of the incubation period, nutritional deficits of minerals and vitamins experienced by the mother prior to laying, or an increased gestation period due to lack of suitable sites for laying thus causing thickened eggshells too difficult to be broken to hatch. The study below suggests that the latter is likely not the case as eggshells were not particularly thick compared to the successfully hatched eggs of other tree monitors, and dead embryos had not yet begun attempting to perforate the shell. Incubation with dryer substrate or even suspended without substrate might possibly be better alternatives, to replicate the conditions of termite nests. However failures even when eggs are suspended are reported as well. Courtship involves the larger male aggressively chasing after the smaller female. Copulation may occur while suspended off the ground, and can last for two hours. Eggs are buried by the female in damp substrate. After hatching, the neonate may refuse food for more than 2 weeks, although force feeding may be recommended before then and until they begin feeding by themselves. In one study, three eggs were incubated in moistened vermiculite. Incubator humidity was set at 85%, while the relative humidity was 95%. Incubator temperature was 30.5C, and substrate surface temperature was 30C. By 161 days, all three embryos had fully developed, although only one survived, and only after it was forcibly hatched and taken out of the egg, after which it was further incubated with the yolk sac still intact. A cooked puree was force fed daily, consisting of 25% (by weight) egg, 50% insects, and 25% banana and spinach, plus supplements such as calcium citrate and Herpetal Complete T. This was further supplemented by beef, chicken, and live flies. The plant matter was included to increase levels of carbohydrate and fibers. Growth of the hatchling was slow, and after 147 days only grew from 7.9g to 13.8g, but was otherwise a very active and alert monitor. The study further evaluates that force feeding was likely not necessary as its weight greatly varied even after beginning to feed on its own. Conservation As of 2020, the species is listed as \\"data deficient\\" on the IUCN list, as insufficient information is available to make reliable population assessments. Deforestation, encroachment by farmland, and the international pet trade are noted as possible current threats.

Originally exhibited as a short in 2004, it was expanded to feature length in 2006. Both versions were produced by Lene Bausager, starring Sean Biggerstaff and Emilia Fox. Plot Aspiring artist Ben Willis develops insomnia after a painful breakup with his girlfriend, Suzy. To take his mind off Suzy and to occupy the extra waking hours he has recently gained, Ben begins working at a local Sainsbury's supermarket, where he meets colourful co-workers. Among them is his colleague Sharon, with whom he soon develops a mutual crush. As his personal means to escape the boredom inherent in the night shift, Ben lets his imagination run wild. In particular, he imagines that he can stop time so that he can walk around in a world that is \\"frozen\\" like the pause of a film. He imagines female patrons of the supermarket stopped in time, allowing him to undress and draw them. Finally the ability to stop time becomes real. A series of flashbacks occur with each progression of the plot, accompanied by Ben's narration and an examination of the effect the situation had had upon him. He explains how he always has been impressed by the beauty of the female body: how he, as a young boy, witnessed a Swedish boarder walk naked from the shower to her room. In another flashback, the young Ben and his best friend Sean share Sean's discovery of his parents' adult magazines, and Sean pays a neighbourhood girl called Natalie fifty pence to show him her vulva. Other neighbourhood boys repeat this trade. Ben's boss, Alan Jenkins, recruits the staff for a weekend football game and, after an embarrassing defeat, 26-Nil, Ben freezes time again. This time he discovers that he is not alone when he sees a mysterious stranger who is able to move inside the frozen world as he can. When Jenkins throws a party to honour his own birthday and as a consolation for their defeat, Sharon asks Ben to be her date, to which he eagerly but nervously agrees. While there, Ben encounters Natalie, who is now a stripper, as well as his ex-girlfriend Suzy, who implores him to try their relationship again. Ben refuses her advance but she kisses him, just as Sharon witnesses from afar. Sharon angrily leaves the party. Ben realizes Sharon has seen the kiss, and freezes time. After spending several days \\"frozen\\", Ben concludes that although he can stop time, he cannot reverse it to correct the mistake. He eventually seeks to explain himself to Sharon at her apartment, and a confrontation similar to the film-opening breakup occurs. Sharon henceforth does not show up to work at the supermarket. As a practical joke, colleagues Barry and Matt phone Ben; Matt poses as an art gallery owner who is interested in displaying Ben's drawings, and schedules an appointment for Ben to present more to him. When Ben arrives as agreed, the reaction of the owner quickly reveals that he has been pranked. However, the gallery owner is nonetheless interested in Ben's work and decides to exhibit Ben's drawings. Sharon receives an invitation to the exhibition and visits. She is moved as most of the pieces depict her and she happily greets Ben, congratulating him on his success. The finale occurs as Ben shares his ability to stop time with her and the two step outside into a time-frozen snowfall.

The feature film includes nearly all of the content of the short. Following a decision in December 2005 to proceed with the feature, Ellis completed the expanded script in seven days. After getting commitments from his cast in March he secured financing and the film went into production in May. This schedule was exceedingly condensed by modern film making standards.Interview with Sean Ellis appearing on DVD version of Cashback As all of the key players were available to appear in the feature, it was possible to incorporate the original short virtually without change. The feature film uses an original score composed by Guy Farley including one piece, \\"Frozen\\" which featured on the Classic FM album, The Quiet Room in July 2006. Release The feature had its North American premiere on September 10, 2006, at the Toronto International Film Festival. It was later screened at a number of other international festivals. The film got a limited theatrical release in the US on 17 July 2007 and in the UK May 2008. The DVD for the European region was released in September 2007. The UK DVD was released in September 2008. Critical response The feature received mixed reviews from critics, garnering a 45% (\\"Rotten\\") rating on Rotten Tomatoes, which concluded that the film is \\"full of unlikable characters, messy editing, and gratuitous nudity\\".Cashback Movie Reviews, Pictures - Rotten Tomatoes In contrast, Justin Chang of Variety described it as \\"slickly charming, gently erotic and directed with supreme polish\\". Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times said the film is \\"lightweight, as it should be\\", adding that Ben and Sharon \\"are delighted to be admired by such wonderful partners, and we are happy for them. And that's about it.\\" Matt Seitz of The New York Times called the film a \\"crock\\", criticizing its \\"validation of Ben‚Äôs adolescent concept of beauty, its wafer- thin characterizations, its gorgeous but overwrought widescreen photography and its abundance of 'How did they do that?' trick shots.\\" Steven Rea of The Philadelphia Inquirer gave the film three of four stars, calling it \\"a sleek little meditation on beauty, desire, love and time\\", but saying it \\"isn't as deep as it pretends to be.\\" Scott Tobias of The A.V. Club graded the film as a \\"C‚Äì\\", noting its \\"luscious imagery\\" but ultimately calling it trite and unremarkable. Jeff Shannon of The Seattle Times gave the film a positive review, commending its account of love and its visual style. Ed Gonzalez of Slant Magazine gave a particularly negative review, criticizing it for misogyny and sexual objectification, adding that Ben is \\"just as skuzzily self-absorbed as his perpetually horny mates.\\" Jim Ridley of The Village Voice said \\"[t]he movie is too cute by half, made close to unbearable whenever Ben's narration spews glib pseudo-profundities about memory and temporal stillness\\", while also complimenting some of its comic and visual elements. Desson Thomson of The Washington Post was also critical, describing Ben and Sharon's romance as uninventive and the film as shallow.

It marked the \\"middle entrance to St. George's Sound,\\" between St. George and Dog Islands, during the nineteenth century, until its collapse by a hurricane in 1873. History The first lighthouse, a brick tower, was completed in 1839. A storm in 1842 destroyed the keeper's house and badly damaged the lighthouse tower. A wooden tower was completed in 1843 to replace the brick tower. This second tower was destroyed by a hurricane in 1851. A brick tower was built in 1851. This is the lighthouse in the photo above. The obsolete lamp and reflector system in the light was replaced by a Forward drop lens in 1856, which was more efficient. During the Civil War, Confederate forces burned the stairs in the tower and damaged the lens to prevent the tower from being used as a lighthouse or a watchtower. The light was repaired and put back into service after the war. In 1872 beach erosion undermined the tower and caused it to fall. The lantern was salvaged and was moved to the top of the keeper's dwelling. On September 18, 1873 a hurricane destroyed both the tower and the keeper's dwelling. Congress appropriated funds for a replacement in 1874, but the Lighthouse Board stated, \\"This light can only serve a local commerce, of which, for several years, there has been little or none; and it is therefore recommended that the new work be indefinitely postponed.\\" The Dog Island Light was never replaced. The Crooked River Light (built near Carrabelle on the mainland in 1895) serves as a leading light for the same channel that was formerly marked by the Dog Island Light. Discovery and investigations In 1999, a team of maritime archaeologists led by Chuck Meide, as part of Florida State University's Dog Island Shipwreck Survey, discovered the remains of the Dog Island Lighthouse using side-scan sonar. The submerged brick ruins are now located on the offshore side of the island, as the island itself is slowly migrating towards land and has passed completely over the lighthouse's original position inside the island.Meide et al. 2000 Dog Island Shipwreck Survey 1999: Report of Historical and Archaeological Investigations, FSU Program in Underwater Archaeology Research Reports No. 4, pp. 60-66 (can be viewed or downloaded as 252 pages in pdf format on Academia.edu) The site was re-investigated by Florida State University archaeologists as part of a 2006 summer field school, and various features of the lighthouse‚Äîincluding remains of the keeper's house, were found.

At around 75 cm (30 in) in length, it is the smallest species of frigatebird. It occurs over tropical and subtropical waters across the Indian and Pacific Oceans as well as off the Atlantic coast of Brazil. The lesser frigatebird is a lightly built seabird with brownish- black plumage, long narrow wings and a deeply forked tail. The male has a striking red gular sac which it inflates to attract a mate. The female is slightly larger than the male and has a white breast and belly. Frigatebirds feed on fish taken in flight from the ocean's surface (often flying fish), and sometimes indulge in kleptoparasitism, harassing other birds to force them to regurgitate their food. Taxonomy The lesser frigatebird was first described as Atagen ariel by the English zoologist George Gray in 1845 from a specimen collected on Raine Island, Queensland, Australia. The lesser frigatebird is one of five closely related species of the genus Fregata. The other four are: the great frigatebird (Fregata minor), the Christmas frigatebird (Frigata andrewsi), the magnificent frigatebird (Fregata magnificens) and the Ascension frigatebird (Fregata aquila). The genus is the only member of the family Fregatidae. Subspecies Three subspecies are recognised: *F. a. ariel occurs in the central and eastern Indian Ocean, the seas off South East Asian and from northern Australia to the west and central Pacific Ocean. *F. a. iredalei named by the Australian ornithologist Gregory Mathews in 1914. It occurs in the western Indian Ocean and breeds on the Aldabra atoll. *F. a. trinitatis was named by the Brazilian zoologist Al√≠pio de Miranda-Ribeiro in 1919. It occurs in the South Atlantic off the coast of Brazil and breeds on the Trindade Archipelago. It has disappeared as a breeding bird from the main island, but very small numbers (less than 40 breeding pairs) remain on a small offshore islet. Some ornithologists have questioned the validity of these subspecies as they appeared to differ only in their size. Few museum specimens of the isolated Atlantic F. a. trinitatis exists, making comparisons difficult, but a comprehensive study published in 2017 found that it differed in both color of plumage and skeletal details, leading to the recommendation of treating it as a separate species (Fregata trinitatis). Description The lesser frigatebird is the smallest species of frigatebird and measures in length with a wingspan of and long forked tails. Male birds weight . Female birds are heavier and weight . Like all frigatebirds the male has a large red sac on the front of the throat which is inflated during courtship. Courtship display also involves a variety of calls, bill rattling and spreading of the wings. The male is mostly all black save for a white patch on the flank which extends on to the underwing as a spur. Males also have a pale bar on the upper wing. Females have a black head and neck with a white collar and breast as well as a spur extending on to the underwing. The female also has a narrow red ring around the eye. Juveniles and immature birds are more difficult to differentiate but the presence of the spurs of white in the armpits is a helpful distinguishing sign. Frigate birds are built for flying; they rarely swim and cannot walk but can manage to climb around the trees and bushes in which they nest. They have a very light skeleton and long narrow wings and are masters of the air. Their name probably derives from the fact that they harass other sea birds such as boobies and tropicbirds as they return to their nests from feeding, forcing them to disgorge their catch, which is then swooped upon and caught by the frigate birds before it reaches the water below. This practice seems to be more common among female frigate birds, but probably only accounts for a fairly small proportion of the diet, which mainly consists of squid and flying fish scooped up from the surface of the sea. Distribution Lady Elliot Island, Queensland, Australia The lesser frigatebird is said to be the most common and widespread frigatebird in Australian seas (Lindsey, 1986). It is common in tropical seas, breeding on remote islands, including Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean in recent years. These birds are most likely to be seen from the mainland prior to the onset of a tropical cyclone, and once this abates they disappear again. Breeding Breeding seems to occur between May and December in the Australian region. They nest in trees (on Christmas Island) and both sexes contribute to nest building and incubation and feeding of the young. One egg is laid which takes 6‚Äì7 weeks to hatch. Fledglings are not left alone for another seven weeks or so for fear that they may be attacked and eaten by other birds including other frigate birds. They remain in the nest for another 6 months or so until fledged but they are cared for and fed by their parents for quite a long time after that. Status The total world population is estimated to be several hundred thousand birds. At least 6,000 pairs breed on the Aldabra Islands in the Indian Ocean and another 15,000 pairs breed on islands off the north coast of Australia. The largest colonies are on the Phoenix Islands and Line Islands in the central Pacific Ocean. Nests placed on the ground are very vulnerable to predation by introduced species such as feral cats. The elimination of cats from Howland, Baker and Jarvis Islands has led to the reestablishment and growth of colonies. Baker Island had no nesting lesser frigatebirds in 1965 but after the elimination of the feral cats on the island in around 1970 the birds returned and in 2002 16,200 individuals were recorded. Because of the large overall population and extended range the species is classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of Least Concern. In the South Atlantic, lesser frigatebirds (subspecies F. a. trinitatis) once bred on Fernando de Noronha, Saint Helena and Trindade. The Fernando de Noronha and Saint Helena populations disappeared in ancient times and are only known from subfossil remains, estimated to be a few hundred years old. More recently, it disappeared as a breeding bird from the main island of Trindade, effectly restricting its known breeding range to a small rocky islet off the main island. It is unclear whether it breeds on the Martim Vaz Islands, another part of the Trindade archipelago. The main island of Trinidade was once covered in forest but after this was destroyed, overgrazing by the introduced goats prevented any recovery. A series of eradication programs in the second half of the 20th century eliminated all the introduced vertebrates other than house mice. Feral cats that had seriously depleted ground nesting birds were finally eradicated in 1998. The islands are part of a Brazilian military area and the human population consists only of a few Brazilian Navy personnel, limiting easy access for ornithologists. In 1975‚Äì1976 the ornithologist Storrs Olson visited the island and reported seeing a small colony of 15 nests on a rocky islet just off the southern coast. Ornithologists reported sightings in 1987 in the same general area as the 1975‚Äì1976 sightings, followed by a few sightings off the northeastern coast during a 1994‚Äì2000 seabird survey, and sightings of a minimum of six individuals in 2014 at the rocky islet of the 1975‚Äì1976 sightings. Combined, these sightings suggest that the remaining South Atlantic population is tiny, possibly numbering less than 20 breeding pairs. If recognized as a separate species, as proposed in 2017, this South Atlantic endemic qualifies as Critically Endangered. In Brazil it is considered Critically Endangered.

It is not far from Gogarloch, Edinburgh Park and Maybury. The Fife Circle Line is to the north. Etymology The name of Gogar first appears in a clearly datable context in 1233.Bethany Fox, 'The P-Celtic Place- Names of North-East England and South-East Scotland', The Heroic Age, 10 (2007), http://www.heroicage.org/issues/10/fox.html (appendix at http://www.heroicage.org/issues/10/fox-appendix.html). The etymology is uncertain.Bethany Fox, 'The P-Celtic Place-Names of North-East England and South-East Scotland', The Heroic Age, 10 (2007), http://www.heroicage.org/issues/10/fox.html (appendix at http://www.heroicage.org/issues/10/fox-appendix.html). It may be derived from \\"cog\\" or \\"gowk\\", a Scots term for cuckoo, a bird with known ritual significance in ancient times, or from the Brythonic term for red, \\"coch\\" (cf \\"Red Heughs\\" in the vicinity). The name also appears as a compound in several places in the area, notably Gogarloch named after the drained Gogar Loch; Gogarburn, Gogarbank, Gogarstone and Castle Gogar. History There are several standing stones and hill fort sites of ancient origin in the vicinity. Gogar was the site of a medieval village, Nether Gogar, which has long since disappeared, although the small Gogar Kirk (church) still stands as a reminder of the village it once served. The church was dedicated by the Bishop of St Andrews in 1247.https://archive.org/stream/fastiecclesiasco08scotuoft/fastiecclesiasco08scotuoft_djvu.txt The present building was mostly rebuilt by J. A. Williamson between 1890 and 1891, but the 16th-century south transept is still intact. The church fell out of use by 1602 and was thereafter used as a mausoleum. It is currently a cabinet-maker's workshop. On 27 August 1650, a skirmish took place around Gogar between the forces of Oliver Cromwell and General Leslie, who was camped in the area around Gogar Kirk. While the marshy ground prevented the opposing sides meeting at close quarters, both sides fired cannon upon the other, inflicting some casualties. Cromwell described the incident, which lasted from 3pm-6pm, thus:T Carlyle, Oliver Cromwell's Letters and Speeches, London 1888, p.175 > We marched westward of Edinburgh towards Stirling, which the Enemy > perceiving, marched with as great expedition as was possible to prevent us; > and the vanguards of both the Armies came to skirmish, - upon a place where > bogs and passes made the access of each Army to the other difficult. We, > being ignorant of the place, drew up, hoping to have engaged: but found no > way feasible, by reason of the bogs and other difficulties. We drew up our > cannon, and did that day discharge two or three hundred great shot upon > them; a considerable number they likewise returned to us; and this was all > that passed from each to the other.

The most notable historical building is probably Castle Gogar, an A-Listed Scottish Baronial L-plan mansion. It was built in 1625 by the master architect William Ayton for John Cowper, whose father had bought the estate in 1601, and his wife, Helen Skene of Hallyards Castle. The castle replaced an earlier building of 14th-century origin, traces of which can be found in the castle's foundations. The original Castle Gogar (Gogar House), built about 1300, belonged to the Forresters of Corstorphine; in the 16th century, the owner was Robert Logan of Restalrig who sold the house and lands to Adam Couper in 1601.Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland http://canmore.rcahms.gov.uk/en/site/50717/details/edinburgh+glasgow+road+castle+gogar/ The property was extended in the mid-1700s and again in the 19th century when the Scots Baronial features such as the tower and turrets were added. Castle Gogar was owned for over 200 years by members of the Gibson-Maitland and the Steel-Maitland families,Castle Gogar until the death of Brenda Steel-Maitland in 2002.

She was the first ship named for Admiral John Kennedy Barton. Barton was launched on 31 January 1942 by Bethlehem Steel Corporation, Quincy, Massachusetts; sponsored by Miss Barbara Dean Barton, granddaughter of Admiral Barton; and commissioned on 29 May 1942, Lieutenant Commander Douglas Harold Fox in command. Service history Barton departed the east coast 23 August 1942 and steamed to the Pacific, arriving at Tongatapu, Tonga Islands, 14 September 1942. During October she participated in the Buin-Faisi-Tonolai raid (5 October) and the Battle of Santa Cruz (26 October) where she claimed shooting down seven Japanese planes. On 29 October she successfully rescued 17 survivors of two downed air transports near Fabre Island. Arriving off Guadalcanal on 12 November 1942 having safely escorted a supply convoy to the island, Barton was ordered to join up with Rear Admiral Daniel J. Callaghan's force of five cruisers and seven other destroyers to repel a force of Japanese warships reported by recon aircraft to be heading down the body of water known as 'The Slot' towards Guadalcanal. Assuming her position in the eleventh spot of the US force just before sundown, Bartons crew settled into their battle stations to wait out the Japanese, expected to arrive around midnight. As darkness overspread the body of water known as Ironbottom Sound, several tropical rain storms and squalls began to cross the area, limiting visibility for both the Americans and the Japanese as they steamed towards each other, however several American ships were equipped with long range radar systems which began to detect the approaching Japanese ships at approximately 00:30hrs (12:30am). Consisting of two battleships, one cruiser and eleven destroyers, the Japanese fleet rounded the northwestern coast of Savo Island and entered Ironbottom Sound at approximately 01:10hrs (1:10am) and shaped their course for Henderson Field; the American airbase they were sent to destroy. Steaming through a heavy rain squall, the Japanese ships were totally unaware of the presence of the American force directly ahead of them, and the heavy rain prevented the US fleet from sighting the Japanese ships for over an hour after the first radar contact. At approximately 01:30hrs (1:30am), both sides finally made visual contact with each other as the first Japanese ships emerged from the squall line only away from the entire US formation. Despite the Americans having steamed directly into the middle of the Japanese force, neither side opened fire for almost ten minutes as they passed by each other, with the Japanese ships enveloping the American battle column as they emerged from the darkness in three separate groups. In the second position of the rear, US Destroyer van USS Barton began to train her deck guns and torpedo tubes on several Japanese ships in her immediate area and awaited the order to open fire from the flagship. At 01:48hrs (1:48am) the order to open fire was precluded when lit its searchlights onto the cruiser , causing both sides to immediately open fire on each other and starting the First Naval Battle of Guadalcanal. Now fully enveloped by Japanese battle lines, Barton and steaming astern, broke to the northwest into the main group of Japanese ships while firing at point blank range on nearby Japanese destroyers and making violent maneuvers to avoid collisions with both friendly and enemy ships in the melee. Barton had just fired a full spread of torpedoes at the battleship when the light cruiser appeared suddenly out of the darkness and cut directly across the bow of Barton. Making an emergency stop to avoid colliding with Helena, Barton found herself at a dead stop as her engineering crew tried to get her engines back into gear to get her moving again. However, before she could get underway two 'Long Lance' torpedoes fired by the slammed into the midsection of Barton; one in her boiler room and one in her engine room. The massive explosions broke the Barton in two, and both sections sank only minutes after the first torpedo struck, carrying with her 164 men: 13 officers and 151 of her crew. Forty-two survivors were rescued by and twenty-six by Higgins boats from Guadalcanal. Awards In her short six months of active service to the US Navy Barton received four battle stars for her service in World War II. Rediscovery The forward section of the wreck of Barton was discovered in 1992 by Robert Ballard, with only the hull section and superstructure ahead of the boiler room found intact. To date the stern section of Barton has not been located. References * Brown, David. Warship Losses of World War Two.

Built by Scottish shipbuilder Harland and Wolff and completed in 1929, Westralia was operated by the Huddart Parker company until 1939, when she was requisitioned for service with the RAN as an Armed Merchant Cruiser (AMC). Fitted with guns and commissioned in early 1940, Westralia was initially used to escort convoys in the Pacific and Indian oceans. In November 1940, the largest mutiny in RAN history occurred aboard the ship, with 104 men charged. In 1943, Westralia was converted into a Landing Ship, Infantry (LSI). The ship was used to transport units of the United States Army and United States Marine Corps, and took part in numerous amphibious landings. After being used to repatriate personnel at the end of the war, Westralia was decommissioned in 1946. Before she could be returned to her owners, the vessel was requisitioned again, this time for use as a troop transport supporting the British Commonwealth Occupation Force (BCOF). Westralia was not commissioned again, and operated by a merchant navy crew until 1951, when she was returned to Huddart Parker. In 1959, the ship was sold to the Asian and Pacific Shipping Co Ltd for use as a livestock carrier. Initially operated as Delfino, she was renamed Woolambi in 1960, before being sold for scrap in 1961. Construction and acquisition Westralia was built at the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Govan for the Huddart Parker company as a twin screw motor vessel.Royal Australian Navy, HMAS Westralia (I) Assigned the yard number 843, Westralia was launched on 25 April 1929, and completed later that year. Westralia was requisitioned for war service by the Australian government on 2 November 1939 as an armed merchant cruiser (AMC). She was fitted with seven guns and two anti-aircraft guns. The ship was commissioned into the RAN on 17 January 1940, and assigned the pennant number F95. Operational history Westralia in her pre-war configuration, on the Brisbane River Westralias time as an AMC was spent escorting convoys in the Pacific and Indian oceans, primarily from Australia and New Zealand. In early November, the ship escorted a floating dock from Brisbane to Darwin, then commenced patrols of the Arafura Sea.Frame & Baker, Mutiny!, p. 158 Departing on the morning of 10 December 1941 Westralia with 445 troops aboard escorted with another 957 troops of Sparrow Force from Darwin to Timor. The ships arrived Koepang without incident on 12 December. The two ships returned to Darwin on 16 December, then were instructed to make for Cairns; Westralia arrived on 25 December, with 117 soldiers aboard.Frame & Baker, Mutiny!, pp. 158‚Äì9 The calls to transport troops had come at short notice, and feeding the soldiers had put a significant dent in Westralias supplies, with the sailors spending most of December on short rations.Frame & Baker, Mutiny!, p. 159 After sailing to Cairns for replenishment (most of the commissaries in Darwin had been drained to supply Australian and Dutch forces securing the Dutch East Indies against a pending Japanese invasion), the sailors had to work all day to disembark the troops, and when the planned evening departure was cancelled because the ship's floatplane could not be reembarked, shore leave was not granted. At midnight, the change of watch did not occur, as the sailors meant to start work did not report for duty.Frame & Baker, Mutiny!, p. 160 At around 01:50, the deck officer noticed around 100 sailors gathered near the anchor winches, blocking them from use. After the sailors disobeyed orders to disperse, Westralias captain ordered the bridge machine guns trained on the men, then took the ship to Action Stations and noted who did not report for duty. The ship's master-at-arms was ordered to arrest those refusing to report for duty; 104 men were arrested and charged with mutiny (the largest number in RAN history), with the ringleaders confined in cells, and the rest agreeing to resume duties. Westralia arrived in Darwin on 30 December, then was ordered to Sydney so an inquiry into the incident could be held: the records relating to the legal proceedings and punishments have been lost. During May 1942, Westralia was present in Sydney Harbour during the Japanese midget submarine attack.Jenkins, Battle Surface!, pp. 193‚Äì4 Between February and May 1943, Westralia was converted into a Landing Ship, Infantry (LSI). She was recommissioned with the pennant number C61.Bastock, Australia's Ships of War, p. 220 In this role, Westralia had a capacity of 933 soldiers, and was used primarily to transport units of the United States Army and Marine Corps. The ship was assigned to Port Stephens for use as an accommodation ship while the combined operations training school (later commissioned as ) was developed. The ship took part in landings at Cape Cretin, Hollandia, Leyte Gulf, the Philippines, Borneo. After the end of the war, Westralia was one of the ships at Ambon on 22 September 1945 for the surrender and occupation of the island where the 164 survivors of Gull Force prisoners had already been taken off on 10 September. She was later used for the repatriation of Australian troops, before being paid off in September 1946. The ship earned five battle honours for her wartime service: \\"Pacific 1941‚Äì45\\", \\"New Guinea 1943‚Äì44\\", \\"Leyte Gulf 1944\\", \\"Lingayen Gulf 1945\\", and \\"Borneo 1945\\". Westralia sailed from Japan via Rabaul for Brisbane, due about 17 July 1946, and thereafter Sydney where she was to be converted to coastal passenger service. However, as she was being refitted for a return to civilian service, Westralia was taken up again for use as a troop transport between Sydney and Kure for the British Commonwealth Occupation Force (BCOF). She was not commissioned into the RAN in this role, and operated with a merchant navy crew. She ended her time with the BCOF in April 1949, then was chartered as a troop carrier by the British Ministry of Transport, and served in the Mediterranean until March 1950. Westralia was finally reconverted and returned to her owners on 27 March 1951. Westralia was sold to the Asian and Pacific Shipping Co Ltd in 1959, serving as a livestock carrier. Initially operated as Delfino, she was renamed Woolambi in 1960, before being sold for scrap and towed to Japan for breaking up in December 1961.

Her most famous work was her utopian novel A Description of Millenium Hall and the Country Adjacent, followed closely by the sequel The History of Sir George Ellison. Early life Sarah's father, Matthew Robinson, and her mother, Elizabeth Drake, were both from distinguished families, and Sarah was the youngest of nine children. Although born in Yorkshire, she spent much time with her siblings in Cambridge, England, where her grandmother, Sarah Morris Drake, lived with her stepgrandfather, Dr. Conyers Middleton, a famous scholar at Cambridge University. All but one of her brothers would go on to a highly accomplished career, yet her elder sister, who would later become the writer and social activist Elizabeth Montagu, became the most accomplished, earning fame in literary circles as a critic of Shakespeare and founder of the Bluestockings, of which Sarah also became a member. The sisters were emotionally close in their early years. Although Elizabeth was much more acclaimed as an author, Elizabeth often considered Sarah to be \\"superior in certain respects, particularly intellectual and literary interests, in which she encouraged her.\\"Kelly, Gary. \\"Scott, Sarah (1720‚Äì1795).\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Oxford UP, 2004.

Ed. Martin C. Battestin. Detroit: Gale, 1985. Dictionary of Literary Biography. Vol. 39. Literature Resource Center. Web. 6 October 2015. Sarah contracted smallpox in 1741, a disease that would often leave its victims scarred and disfigured, \\"lowering [their] value in the marriage market.\\" Scholars have traced the impact that smallpox left on Scott literary output: \\"Scott's pronounced concern [with deformity...] was motivated by her own experience of being left marked by a severe bout of smallpox [...], a trauma which had played a key role in redirecting her away from emulating the social success of her equally beautiful sister Elizabeth (Robinson), towards a life dedicated to writing, domestic female friendship and Christian philanthropy.\\"Shuttleton, David E. Smallpox and the Literary Imagination 1660‚Äì1820. Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 2007. p. 135. Sarah would later create a fictional character in Millenium Hall who had the telltale marks of smallpox that diminished her complexion but not her character. A year after Sarah's illness, her sister Elizabeth, after being befriended by Lady Margaret Harley and introduced to the highest circles of London life, married the wealthy 50-year-old Edward Montagu, grandson of the Earl of Sandwich. Sarah stayed home to tend to her mother, who was dying of cancer. After her mother died in 1746, Sarah visited Elizabeth and Edward in Bath. She chose to stay and care for the invalid Lady Barbara Montagu, or Lady Bab, with whom she developed a very close friendship. In 1748, the two women combined their finances and set up house together. Marriage In the late 1740s, Sarah contracted to marry George Lewis Scott, a friend of the family from Canterbury who was twelve years older than she. He had no profession or private income, however, and Sarah's dowry amounted to only ¬£1500; so, before the two could wed, Sarah helped to secure George a position as a sub-preceptor to George, Prince of Wales (later King George III), who had lately succeeded his father, Frederick, upon Frederick's death in March 1751. Sarah and George Lewis Scott were married on 15 June 1751. The marriage, according to family letters, was never consummated. In April 1752, Sarah's father and brothers came to London to remove her from her husband's house for undisclosed reasons. Speculations persisted of incompatibility, abuse, an illicit affair, or even nondisclosure of a prior marriage. It was also rumored that Sarah's friendship with Lady Bab and her insistence upon her friend moving into their household may have instigated the rift, or that Sarah had a personal aversion to marriage and/or conjugal relations. Regardless of the reason, the scandal if made public would have damaged George Scott's career; he agreed to pay Sarah a settlement of ¬£100 a year. When she was no longer with her husband, she became her father's charge, and he gave her no money at all. Further, he forbade Elizabeth or Sarah's brother Matthew from relieving Sarah's poverty. Sarah and Lady Barbara Montagu settled in Bath and Batheaston, where they lived frugally and became active in helping the poor through the creation of a \\"cottage industry\\" for poor and disgraced women and children, and they organized programmes to educate poor children in such subjects as reading, maths, and needlework. Literary career Frontispiece of Millenium Hall Sarah wrote her first novel before her marriage, The History of Cornelia (1750), a portrait of an ideal and pious young woman. To help with the household expenses and philanthropy, Sarah decided to write and pursue \\"professional literary translation.\\" In 1754, she translated Le Laideur aimable as An Agreeable Ugliness, an exaggeratedly moralistic French novel. Later that same year, she wrote A Journey through every Stage of Life, which is an Arabian Nights-styled series of tales told by a young servant girl to her mistress, a princess exiled by her brother. After publishing her first novels and completing a translation of another, Sarah began to write educational texts. In the late 1750s, Sarah and Lady Barbara followed their earlier endeavors to educate poor children by writing a series of cards that concentrated on teaching history and geography. In 1761, with the accession of George III, Sarah wrote a political history about Gustav I of Sweden, The History of Gustavus Ericson, King of Sweden; it emphasized the concept of the \\"patriot king,\\" or the selfless ruler acting for the greater good of the country. She succeeded this with The History of Mecklenburgh in 1762 to capitalize on the public's interest in George III's wife, Charlotte. Also in 1762, Scott published her most successful novel, A Description of Millenium Hall and the Country Adjacent (her spelling). The utopian tale depicts a community of women devoted to artistic pursuits and education, Christian virtues, and philanthropy. The populations they serve include children, the poor, the elderly, the disabled, and the deformed. Millenium Hall provided a fictional example of the ideals of the bluestocking circle; the Bluestockings were a social group of middle- and upper-class men and women who would meet for intellectual discussions and philanthropic service. Like the Bluestockings, Scott's utopian novel presents a \\"critique of court politics, culture, and society.\\"Kelly, Gary, ed. Introduction. Millenium Hall. Peterborough, ON: Broadview P, 1995. Millenium Hall went through four editions by 1778. Interest in its feminist meaning brought it back into public attention in the late twentieth century. Later life In 1763, Lady Barbara gained a pension of ¬£300, which floated the household finances sufficiently, and Sarah did not write for a couple of years. But with Lady Barbara's death in 1765 and with the encouragement and insistence of her sister, Sarah again began writing. The History of Sir George Ellison was published in 1766. This sequel to Millenium Hall portrays the eponymous narrator's \\"charitable deeds\\" inspired by his visit to Millennium Hall. His actions include \\"institut[ing] reforms on his plantations in Jamaica and devis[ing] schemes to relieve the poor in England, employing aged laborers on the grounds of his house, initiating a fund for the release of prisoners, and paying for the educations of females of different ranks.\\" Again, the novel was utopian, but it also contained elements of the \\"patriot kings\\" that Sarah wrote about in her political writings. The next year, Sarah attempted to create a real Millennium Hall in Buckinghamshire, a \\"communal household\\" that would include \\"a school and other charitable institutions for the impoverished community.\\" Sarah invited fellow writer Sarah Fielding, among others, to come live with her. Each member invested ¬£50 into the project. Sarah's sister Elizabeth Montagu donated livestock, land, and staff. Even though the project began with success, \\"financial difficulties, ill health, and quarrels between the members of the community led to the eventual dissolution of this real-life Millenium Hall.\\" After some work in translation and educational writing that was never published, Sarah published in 1772 The Life of Theodore Aggrippa d'Aubigne. As a response to emerging populism this work was about the life of a Protestant who fought against both mob rule and the absolute monarchy of the king. Sarah published in that same year her final novel, The Test of Filial Duty, which was an epistolary novel addressing the rights of a daughter to choose her husband. In 1775, Edward Montagu, Elizabeth's husband, died, and Elizabeth gave Sarah ¬£200 a year. In 1778, Sarah's father died, which gave her more money. She produced no more published works in her lifetime. After a lengthy illness, Sarah died on 11 November 1795 in Catton, Norwich. Per instructions Sarah left, most of her letters were destroyed by executor of her estate. By the 19th century, her name was largely forgotten, and her works were attributed to other writers, including novelist and playwright Oliver Goldsmith.

It is also found in Tonga, where it was probably introduced by humans. It is one of the few species of iguanas found outside of the New World and one of the most geographically isolated members of the family Iguanidae. Populations of these iguanas have been declining over the past century due to habitat destruction, and more significantly, the introduction of mongoose and house cats to the islands. The species is diurnal, spending their days foraging, basking and watching over their territories by day and retreating to the treetops at night. Fiji iguanas are considered a national treasure by the government of Fiji, and its likeness has been featured on postage stamps, currency, and phone book covers. Taxonomy and etymology This species was first described by French zoologist Alexandre Brongniart in 1800.Brongniart,Alexandre. (1800). Essai d'une classification naturelle des reptiles. Bull. Soc. Philomath. 2 (36): 89-91 The generic name, Brachylophus, is derived from two Greek words: brachys (Œ≤œÅŒ±œáœçœÇ) meaning \\"short\\" and lophos (ŒªœåœÜŒøœÇ) meaning \\"crest\\" or \\"plume\\", denoting the short spiny crests along the back of this species. The specific name, fasciatus, is a Latin word meaning \\"banded\\". This species is closely related to B. bulabula, B. gau and B. vitiensis. The genus Brachylophus is thought to be descended from ancestors that rafted west across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas, where their closest relatives are found. It has also been suggested that they descended from a more widespread lineage of (now extinct) Old World iguanids that diverged from their New World relatives in the Paleogene. However, no other members of the putative lineage, living or fossil, have been found outside Fiji and Tonga. Distribution and habitat The Lau banded iguana is endemic to the Lau Islands of Fiji. Its recent range is known to extend from Vanua Balavu in the north to Fulaga and Ogea in the south, including at least eleven islands. Previously it was reported from Moce and Oneata, and it may have once been present throughout the Lau group. It was introduced to the Tonga Islands 300 years ago, probably after the native Brachylophus gibbonsi was driven to extinction. Description Close-up of a male Fiji banded iguana. Sexually dimorphic, males have two or three white or pale-blue bands wide crossing their emerald green background with a pattern of spots and stripes on the nuchal region. Females, on the other hand, are solid green with occasional spotting or partial bands. Both sexes have a yellow underside. Fiji banded iguanas reach in length when measured from snout to tail tip and bodyweights of up to . The crests of these iguanas are very short reaching a length of . Although there appear to be slight variations between insular populations, none have been well-described. The animals from Tonga are smaller and leaner, and were previously described as B. brevicephalus. The skin of this species is sensitive to light and the lizard can change its skin color to match its background. Captive specimens have been observed matching the pattern left by the screen tops of their cages in as little as 30 seconds. Behavior The species is diurnal, spending their days foraging, basking and watching over their territories by day and retreating to the treetops at night. Male iguanas are highly visual, and aggressively defend their territories from rival males.Carpenter, C.C. and J.B. Murphy (1978). Aggressive Behavior in the Fiji Lizard (Brachyluphus fasciatus), Journal of Herpetology 12(2) 251-2 The iguanas will deepen their green coloration to intensify their bands, and bob their heads and intimidate intruders by lunging at them with open mouths. They often expand and flare their dewlaps to increase the size of their profile, following up with violent battles amongst each other. Diet Fiji banded iguanas are herbivorous, they feed on the leaves, fruit, and flowers of trees and shrubs, particularly hibiscus flowers of the Vau tree (Hibiscus tiliaceus) and fruit such as banana and papaya. Captive hatchlings have been observed eating insects; however, adults usually will not. Reproduction Courtship is similar to other iguanids, with males approaching and tongue flicking the female's back, forelimbs and nuchal regions after a series of rapid head bobs. The breeding season occurs during the month of November. The Fiji banded iguana is oviparous and has a long incubation period of 160-170 days. Females guard the nest of three to six eggs, which is unusual for iguanids. Hatchlings emerge from their eggs in the rainy season and obtain moisture by licking wet leaves. Relations with humans=Folklore The Fijian name for iguana is \\"vokai\\", although some tribes call it \\"saumuri\\". Two tribes regard the iguana as their totem and as such its name is not allowed to be mentioned in the presence of women or the offender may be beaten with a stick. The majority of Fijians, however, are terrified of iguanas because of their behavior when threatened. On such occasions, an iguana turns black, opens its mouth and lunges at attackers. Threats The biggest threats this iguana faces is habitat loss due to fires, storms, agricultural development, and competition from feral goats. A secondary threat is introduced predators in the forms of rats, mongoose, and cats which prey on the iguanas and their eggs. Additionally the iguana has been hunted as a food source and for the illegal exotic animal trade. Captivity Since 1982 the Fijian government has maintained that the entire zoo population of Fiji banded iguanas was obtained illegally or descended from smuggled animals: \\"Virtually all of the estimated 50-100 banded iguanas in American zoos have been obtained without the knowledge or consent of the Government of Fiji\\". The husbandry of Fiji banded iguanas at the San Diego Zoo has been documented as the most successful breeding colony of Fiji banded iguanas in the world.

Bootstrapping is a statistical method for estimating the sampling distribution of an estimator by sampling with replacement from the original sample, most often with the purpose of deriving robust estimates of standard errors and confidence intervals of a population parameter like a mean, median, proportion, odds ratio, correlation coefficient or regression coefficient. It has been called the plug-in principle,Logan, J. David and Wolesensky, Willian R. Mathematical methods in biology. Pure and Applied Mathematics: a Wiley-interscience Series of Texts, Monographs, and Tracts. John Wiley& Sons, Inc. 2009. Chapter 6: Statistical inference. Section 6.6: Bootstrap methods as it is the method of estimation of functionals of a population distribution by evaluating the same functionals at the empirical distribution based on a sample. It is called a principle because it is too simple to be otherwise, it is just a guideline, not a theorem. For example, when estimating the population mean, this method uses the sample mean; to estimate the population median, it uses the sample median; to estimate the population regression line, it uses the sample regression line. It may also be used for constructing hypothesis tests. It is often used as a robust alternative to inference based on parametric assumptions when those assumptions are in doubt, or where parametric inference is impossible or requires very complicated formulas for the calculation of standard errors. Bootstrapping techniques are also used in the updating-selection transitions of particle filters, genetic type algorithms and related resample/reconfiguration Monte Carlo methods used in computational physics. In this context, the bootstrap is used to replace sequentially empirical weighted probability measures by empirical measures. The bootstrap allows to replace the samples with low weights by copies of the samples with high weights. Jackknife Jackknifing, which is similar to bootstrapping, is used in statistical inference to estimate the bias and standard error (variance) of a statistic, when a random sample of observations is used to calculate it. Historically, this method preceded the invention of the bootstrap with Quenouille inventing this method in 1949 and Tukey extending it in 1958. This method was foreshadowed by Mahalanobis who in 1946 suggested repeated estimates of the statistic of interest with half the sample chosen at random. He coined the name 'interpenetrating samples' for this method. Quenouille invented this method with the intention of reducing the bias of the sample estimate. Tukey extended this method by assuming that if the replicates could be considered identically and independently distributed, then an estimate of the variance of the sample parameter could be made and that it would be approximately distributed as a t variate with n‚àí1 degrees of freedom (n being the sample size). The basic idea behind the jackknife variance estimator lies in systematically recomputing the statistic estimate, leaving out one or more observations at a time from the sample set. From this new set of replicates of the statistic, an estimate for the bias and an estimate for the variance of the statistic can be calculated. Instead of using the jackknife to estimate the variance, it may instead be applied to the log of the variance. This transformation may result in better estimates particularly when the distribution of the variance itself may be non normal. For many statistical parameters the jackknife estimate of variance tends asymptotically to the true value almost surely. In technical terms one says that the jackknife estimate is consistent. The jackknife is consistent for the sample means, sample variances, central and non-central t-statistics (with possibly non-normal populations), sample coefficient of variation, maximum likelihood estimators, least squares estimators, correlation coefficients and regression coefficients. It is not consistent for the sample median. In the case of a unimodal variate the ratio of the jackknife variance to the sample variance tends to be distributed as one half the square of a chi square distribution with two degrees of freedom. The jackknife, like the original bootstrap, is dependent on the independence of the data. Extensions of the jackknife to allow for dependence in the data have been proposed. Another extension is the delete-a-group method used in association with Poisson sampling. Comparison of bootstrap and jackknife Both methods, the bootstrap and the jackknife, estimate the variability of a statistic from the variability of that statistic between subsamples, rather than from parametric assumptions. For the more general jackknife, the delete-m observations jackknife, the bootstrap can be seen as a random approximation of it. Both yield similar numerical results, which is why each can be seen as approximation to the other. Although there are huge theoretical differences in their mathematical insights, the main practical difference for statistics users is that the bootstrap gives different results when repeated on the same data, whereas the jackknife gives exactly the same result each time. Because of this, the jackknife is popular when the estimates need to be verified several times before publishing (e.g., official statistics agencies). On the other hand, when this verification feature is not crucial and it is of interest not to have a number but just an idea of its distribution, the bootstrap is preferred (e.g., studies in physics, economics, biological sciences). Whether to use the bootstrap or the jackknife may depend more on operational aspects than on statistical concerns of a survey. The jackknife, originally used for bias reduction, is more of a specialized method and only estimates the variance of the point estimator. This can be enough for basic statistical inference (e.g., hypothesis testing, confidence intervals). The bootstrap, on the other hand, first estimates the whole distribution (of the point estimator) and then computes the variance from that. While powerful and easy, this can become highly computationally intensive. \\"The bootstrap can be applied to both variance and distribution estimation problems. However, the bootstrap variance estimator is not as good as the jackknife or the balanced repeated replication (BRR) variance estimator in terms of the empirical results. Furthermore, the bootstrap variance estimator usually requires more computations than the jackknife or the BRR. Thus, the bootstrap is mainly recommended for distribution estimation.\\" Shao, J. and Tu, D. (1995). The Jackknife and Bootstrap. Springer-Verlag, Inc. pp. 281. There is a special consideration with the jackknife, particularly with the delete-1 observation jackknife. It should only be used with smooth, differentiable statistics (e.g., totals, means, proportions, ratios, odd ratios, regression coefficients, etc.; not with medians or quantiles). This could become a practical disadvantage. This disadvantage is usually the argument favoring bootstrapping over jackknifing. More general jackknifes than the delete-1, such as the delete-m jackknife or the delete-all-but-2 Hodges‚ÄìLehmann estimator, overcome this problem for the medians and quantiles by relaxing the smoothness requirements for consistent variance estimation. Usually the jackknife is easier to apply to complex sampling schemes than the bootstrap. Complex sampling schemes may involve stratification, multiple stages (clustering), varying sampling weights (non-response adjustments, calibration, post-stratification) and under unequal-probability sampling designs. Theoretical aspects of both the bootstrap and the jackknife can be found in Shao and Tu (1995), whereas a basic introduction is accounted in Wolter (2007). The bootstrap estimate of model prediction bias is more precise than jackknife estimates with linear models such as linear discriminant function or multiple regression. Subsampling Subsampling is an alternative method for approximating the sampling distribution of an estimator. The two key differences to the bootstrap are: (i) the resample size is smaller than the sample size and (ii) resampling is done without replacement. The advantage of subsampling is that it is valid under much weaker conditions compared to the bootstrap. In particular, a set of sufficient conditions is that the rate of convergence of the estimator is known and that the limiting distribution is continuous; in addition, the resample (or subsample) size must tend to infinity together with the sample size but at a smaller rate, so that their ratio converges to zero. While subsampling was originally proposed for the case of independent and identically distributed (iid) data only, the methodology has been extended to cover time series data as well; in this case, one resamples blocks of subsequent data rather than individual data points. There are many cases of applied interest where subsampling leads to valid inference whereas bootstrapping does not; for example, such cases include examples where the rate of convergence of the estimator is not the square root of the sample size or when the limiting distribution is non-normal. Cross- validation Cross-validation is a statistical method for validating a predictive model. Subsets of the data are held out for use as validating sets; a model is fit to the remaining data (a training set) and used to predict for the validation set. Averaging the quality of the predictions across the validation sets yields an overall measure of prediction accuracy. Cross- validation is employed repeatedly in building decision trees. One form of cross-validation leaves out a single observation at a time; this is similar to the jackknife. Another, K-fold cross-validation, splits the data into K subsets; each is held out in turn as the validation set. This avoids \\"self- influence\\". For comparison, in regression analysis methods such as linear regression, each y value draws the regression line toward itself, making the prediction of that value appear more accurate than it really is. Cross- validation applied to linear regression predicts the y value for each observation without using that observation. This is often used for deciding how many predictor variables to use in regression. Without cross-validation, adding predictors always reduces the residual sum of squares (or possibly leaves it unchanged). In contrast, the cross-validated mean-square error will tend to decrease if valuable predictors are added, but increase if worthless predictors are added. Permutation tests A permutation test (also called a randomization test, re-randomization test, or an exact test) is a type of statistical significance test in which the distribution of the test statistic under the null hypothesis is obtained by calculating all possible values of the test statistic under all possible rearrangements of the observed data points. In other words, the method by which treatments are allocated to subjects in an experimental design is mirrored in the analysis of that design. If the labels are exchangeable under the null hypothesis, then the resulting tests yield exact significance levels; see also exchangeability. Confidence intervals can then be derived from the tests. The theory has evolved from the works of Ronald Fisher and E. J. G. Pitman in the 1930s. To illustrate the basic idea of a permutation test, suppose we collect random variables X_A and X_B for each individual from two groups A and B whose sample means are \\\\bar{x}_{A} and \\\\bar{x}_{B}, and that we want to know whether X_A and X_B come from the same distribution. Let n_{A} and n_{B} be the sample size collected from each group. The permutation test is designed to determine whether the observed difference between the sample means is large enough to reject, at some significance level, the null hypothesis H_{0} that the data drawn from A is from the same distribution as the data drawn from B. The test proceeds as follows. First, the difference in means between the two samples is calculated: this is the observed value of the test statistic, T_\\\\text{obs}. Next, the observations of groups A and B are pooled, and the difference in sample means is calculated and recorded for every possible way of dividing the pooled values into two groups of size n_{A} and n_{B} (i.e., for every permutation of the group labels A and B). The set of these calculated differences is the exact distribution of possible differences (for this sample) under the null hypothesis that group labels are exchangeable (i.e., are randomly assigned). The one-sided p-value of the test is calculated as the proportion of sampled permutations where the difference in means was greater than or equal to T_\\\\text{obs}. The two-sided p-value of the test is calculated as the proportion of sampled permutations where the absolute difference was greater than or equal to T_\\\\text{obs}. Alternatively, if the only purpose of the test is to reject or not reject the null hypothesis, one could sort the recorded differences, and then observe if T_\\\\text{obs} is contained within the middle (1 - \\\\alpha) \\\\times 100% of them, for some significance level \\\\alpha. If it is not, we reject the hypothesis of identical probability curves at the \\\\alpha\\\\times100\\\\% significance level. Relation to parametric tests Permutation tests are a subset of non-parametric statistics. Assuming that our experimental data come from data measured from two treatment groups, the method simply generates the distribution of mean differences under the assumption that the two groups are not distinct in terms of the measured variable. From this, one then uses the observed statistic (T_\\\\text{obs} above) to see to what extent this statistic is special, i.e., the likelihood of observing the magnitude of such a value (or larger) if the treatment labels had simply been randomized after treatment. In contrast to permutation tests, the distributions underlying many popular \\"classical\\" statistical tests, such as the t-test, F-test, z-test, and œá2 test, are obtained from theoretical probability distributions. Fisher's exact test is an example of a commonly used permutation test for evaluating the association between two dichotomous variables. When sample sizes are very large, the Pearson's chi-square test will give accurate results. For small samples, the chi-square reference distribution cannot be assumed to give a correct description of the probability distribution of the test statistic, and in this situation the use of Fisher's exact test becomes more appropriate. Permutation tests exist in many situations where parametric tests do not (e.g., when deriving an optimal test when losses are proportional to the size of an error rather than its square). All simple and many relatively complex parametric tests have a corresponding permutation test version that is defined by using the same test statistic as the parametric test, but obtains the p-value from the sample- specific permutation distribution of that statistic, rather than from the theoretical distribution derived from the parametric assumption. For example, it is possible in this manner to construct a permutation t-test, a permutation œá2 test of association, a permutation version of Aly's test for comparing variances and so on. The major drawbacks to permutation tests are that they * Can be computationally intensive and may require \\"custom\\" code for difficult- to-calculate statistics. This must be rewritten for every case. * Are primarily used to provide a p-value. The inversion of the test to get confidence regions/intervals requires even more computation. Advantages Permutation tests exist for any test statistic, regardless of whether or not its distribution is known. Thus one is always free to choose the statistic which best discriminates between hypothesis and alternative and which minimizes losses. Permutation tests can be used for analyzing unbalanced designs and for combining dependent tests on mixtures of categorical, ordinal, and metric data (Pesarin, 2001) . They can also be used to analyze qualitative data that has been quantitized (i.e., turned into numbers). Permutation tests may be ideal for analyzing quantitized data that do not satisfy statistical assumptions underlying traditional parametric tests (e.g., t-tests, ANOVA). Before the 1980s, the burden of creating the reference distribution was overwhelming except for data sets with small sample sizes. Since the 1980s, the confluence of relatively inexpensive fast computers and the development of new sophisticated path algorithms applicable in special situations made the application of permutation test methods practical for a wide range of problems. It also initiated the addition of exact-test options in the main statistical software packages and the appearance of specialized software for performing a wide range of uni- and multi-variable exact tests and computing test-based \\"exact\\" confidence intervals. Limitations An important assumption behind a permutation test is that the observations are exchangeable under the null hypothesis. An important consequence of this assumption is that tests of difference in location (like a permutation t-test) require equal variance. In this respect, the permutation t-test shares the same weakness as the classical Student's t-test (the Behrens‚ÄìFisher problem). A third alternative in this situation is to use a bootstrap-based test. Good (2005) explains the difference between permutation tests and bootstrap tests the following way: \\"Permutations test hypotheses concerning distributions; bootstraps test hypotheses concerning parameters. As a result, the bootstrap entails less-stringent assumptions.\\" Bootstrap tests are not exact. Monte Carlo testing An asymptotically equivalent permutation test can be created when there are too many possible orderings of the data to allow complete enumeration in a convenient manner. This is done by generating the reference distribution by Monte Carlo sampling, which takes a small (relative to the total number of permutations) random sample of the possible replicates. The realization that this could be applied to any permutation test on any dataset was an important breakthrough in the area of applied statistics. The earliest known reference to this approach is Dwass (1957). This type of permutation test is known under various names: approximate permutation test, Monte Carlo permutation tests or random permutation tests. After N random permutations, it is possible to obtain a confidence interval for the p-value based on the Binomial distribution. For example, if after N = 10000 random permutations the p-value is estimated to be \\\\widehat{p}=0.05 , then a 99% confidence interval for the true \\\\scriptstyle\\\\ p (the one that would result from trying all possible permutations) is [0.045, 0.055] . On the other hand, the purpose of estimating the p-value is most often to decide whether p \\\\leq \\\\alpha , where \\\\scriptstyle\\\\ \\\\alpha is the threshold at which the null hypothesis will be rejected (typically \\\\alpha=0.05). In the example above, the confidence interval only tells us that there is roughly a 50% chance that the p-value is smaller than 0.05, i.e. it is completely unclear whether the null hypothesis should be rejected at a level \\\\alpha=0.05 . If it is only important to know whether p \\\\leq \\\\alpha for a given \\\\alpha, it is logical to continue simulating until the statement p \\\\leq \\\\alpha can be established to be true or false with a very low probability of error. Given a bound \\\\epsilon on the admissible probability of error (the probability of finding that \\\\widehat{p} > \\\\alpha when in fact p \\\\leq \\\\alpha or vice versa), the question of how many permutations to generate can be seen as the question of when to stop generating permutations, based on the outcomes of the simulations so far, in order to guarantee that the conclusion (which is either p \\\\leq \\\\alpha or p > \\\\alpha ) is correct with probability at least as large as 1-\\\\epsilon . (\\\\epsilon will typically be chosen to be extremely small, e.g. 1/1000.) Stopping rules to achieve this have been developed which can be incorporated with minimal additional computational cost. In fact, depending on the true underlying p-value it will often be found that the number of simulations required is remarkably small (e.g. as low as 5 and often not larger than 100) before a decision can be reached with virtual certainty.

During the 1950s, Dal√≠ painted many of his subjects as composed of rhinoceros horns. Here, the young virgin's buttocks consist of two converging horns and two horns float beneath; \\"as the horns simultaneously comprise and threaten to sodomise the callipygian figure, she is effectively (auto) sodomised by her own constitution.\\"King, Elliott in Dawn Ad√®s (ed.), Dal√≠ (Milan: Bompiani Arte, 2004), 378-379 Dal√≠'s inspiration for the image appears to have come from Vermeer, one of a handful of artists regarded by Dal√≠ as masters. Specifically, Vermeer's The Lacemaker seems to have been the galvanising element, with its convergent curves which focus on the subject's fingers and so to the penetration point of her needle - which as Dal√≠ has pointed out is merely implied and not actually painted. In a stunt, Dal√≠ set up his easel before Vermeer's original with the expressed intent of making a copy. The result however was this painting, which consciously uses Vermeer's focal-point arrangement, albeit to entirely different effect. The painting, formerly in the collection of The Playboy Mansion (Playboy Enterprises sold the painting in London in 2003 for 1.35 million poundsBlack-and-White Night - The New York Observer, 17 February 2003), recalls his depiction of his sister Ana Mar√≠a in Figure at a Window (1925), and has therefore been read by some critics as a nasty jab at his sister, punishing her for publishing a biography on Dal√≠ that presented a quite negative point of view;Bradbury, Kirsten, Dal√≠(Essential Art) (Bath: Paragon Publishing, 2001), p. 30 it has also been interpreted as a painting of Gala, though in fact the figure is based on a photograph from a 1930s sex magazine.Robert Descharnes, Dal√≠, L'h√©ritage infernal (Paris: √âditions Ramsay/La Marge, 2002), 72. In 1958, Dal√≠ wrote, \\"Paradoxically, this painting, which has an erotic appearance, is the most chaste of all.\\"Morse, A. Reynolds, Dal√≠: A Study of His Life and Work (Greenwich: New York Graphic Society, 1958), 81.

Initially, it was to help tenants maintain their social housing tenancies, but it has since been broadened to provide housing related support for anyone regardless of housing status. This includes private and social tenants, home owners, homeless people and those in temporary accommodation as well as people in sheltered accommodation or other specialist housing. It is run by local government and provided by the voluntary sector. It was launched on 1 April 2003. In England, it falls under the responsibility of Dept of Communities and Local Government who provide help to Local Authorities to run provide support programmes. In Wales, Supporting People is administrated by the Welsh Assembly Government The aims of the Supporting People Programme in Wales are: * helping vulnerable people live as independently as possible * providing people with the help they need to live in their own homes, hostels, sheltered housing or other specialist housing * preventing problems in the first place or providing help as early as possible in order to reduce demand on other services such as health and social services * providing help to complement the personal or medical care that some people may need * putting those who need support at the heart of the programme * ensuring quality services, which are delivered as efficiently and effectively as possible through joint working between organisations that plan and fund services and those that provide services * providing funding for support based on need * promoting equality and reducing inequalities. In Wales, a Supporting People Outcomes Framework has been developed to target and monitor the support provided. The aim of the Outcomes Framework is to help understand what Supporting People services achieve and to measure the impact support interventions have on those who receive services. The Welsh Government, local authorities and housing related support providers have been working in partnership to develop an outcomes framework.

He made his first appearance on 27 June 2006. Wood took a four-month break from the show in 2011 and the character was absent between August and November 2011. Wood took a year long break from the show in 2015, with Max departing on 1 October. He returned on 24 December 2016. Wood took another short break from the show in 2018; Max departed on 16 February and returned on 23 April. It was announced in 2018 that Max would be taking a break from the soap in early 2019. He left on 14 February 2019 and returned on 7 May 2019. Max served as the show's main antagonist of 2017 following his release from prison and planning revenge on all his family, friends and neighbours. On 16 September 2020, it was announced that Wood would be departing from the role of Max after more than 14 years. Many of Max's storylines focus on his relationships, including his marriages to Tanya Branning (Jo Joyner), Kirsty Branning (Kierston Wareing) and Rainie Cross (Tanya Franks), and relationships with Gemma Clewes (Natalie J. Robb), Stacey Slater (Lacey Turner), Vanessa Gold (Z√∂e Lucker), Lucy Beale (Hetti Bywater), Emma Summerhayes (Anna Acton), Karin Smart (Denise van Outen), Carmel Kazemi (Bonnie Langford), Fi Browning (Lisa Faulkner) and Ruby Allen (Louisa Lytton) and Linda Carter (Kellie Bright) , many of which are extramarital affairs. Max has also embarked on feuds with his father Jim Branning (John Bardon), brothers Jack Branning (Scott Maslen) and Derek Branning (Jamie Foreman), as well as Sean Slater (Robert Kazinsky), Harry Gold (Linal Haft), Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks), Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden), Cora Cross (Ann Mitchell), Jay Brown (Jamie Borthwick), Carl White (Daniel Coonan), Charlie Cotton (Declan Bennett), Ben Mitchell (Harry Reid/Max Bowden), Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt), Jane Beale (Laurie Brett), Steven Beale (Aaron Sidwell), Mick Carter (Danny Dyer), Martin Fowler (James Bye), Stuart Highway (Ricky Champ) and Kathy Beale (Gillian Taylforth). In 2008, Max became central to a whodunit storyline that saw him run over by a mystery assailant who was eventually revealed to be his daughter Lauren (Madeline Duggan/Jacqueline Jossa). He has also had to come to terms with the death of his son Bradley Branning (Charlie Clements), being framed for attempted murder by Carl White (Daniel Coonan) and his girlfriend Emma's death. In October 2015, Max was wrongly convicted for Lucy Beale's murder, the true murderer was later revealed to be her younger half-brother Bobby (Eliot Carrington). After his release from prison, Max became the show's central antagonist as he sought revenge against Ian and Phil along with everyone else - including his own family - who saw him wrongfully imprisoned, by conspiring with James Willmott-Brown (William Boyde) in his nefarious scheme to redevelop Albert Square. Throughout the events of his revenge storyline, Max arranged for Jack to lose custody over his stepson Matthew Mitchell-Cotton; framed Phil's rival Vincent Hubbard (Richard Blackwood) for drug dealing, resulting in his arrest; blackmailed and later caused the death of Ian's stepson Steven; and forced Jane to leave Walford under the threat of having Bobby harmed in prison. The storyline ultimately concluded with Max attempting to commit suicide after his plan for revenge had failed, but this ended with both his daughters Lauren and Abi (Lorna Fitzgerald) accidentally falling off the roof from The Queen Victoria when they attempted to stop their father; Lauren survived the fall whilst Abi died. A couple of months later in 2018, Max had married Tanya's sister Rainie in his bid to help win his custody case over Abi's daughter. Storylines Max arrives in Walford in June 2006 to confront his father, Jim Branning (John Bardon), after being estranged for 17 years, but Jim throws him out and Max meets his son Bradley Branning (Charlie Clements), and decides to stay to rebuild their relationship. Max's wife Tanya Branning (Jo Joyner) arrives to collect him and a month later, Max, Tanya and their daughters Lauren Branning (Madeline Duggan until June 2010, Jacqueline Jossa thereafter) and Abi Branning (Lorna Fitzgerald) move to Albert Square. Tanya learns about Max's affair with Gemma Clewes (Natalie J. Robb), but she gives their marriage one last try. As an apology, Max buys 10 Turpin Road for Tanya to open as a beauty parlour and begins spending time with Bradley. Max thinks Bradley is too good for his girlfriend, Stacey Slater (Lacey Turner), and when she gets pregnant, he gives Bradley money for an abortion, telling him a baby will ruin his life. However, the abortion ends the relationship. To hurt Bradley, Stacey makes a move on Max and they have an affair, but Tanya tells Max she is pregnant. He tries to save his marriage despite promising Stacey that he will leave Tanya but when Stacey learns of Tanya's pregnancy, Max takes his family to Spain and a few weeks later, tells Bradley they are moving there permanently. Max returns with his family to find that Stacey and Bradley have reconciled and are now engaged. On the night of Bradley and Stacey's wedding, Max kisses Stacey and although she rejects him, Lauren's camcorder captures the kiss on video. Soon after, Tanya and Max's son, Oscar Branning, is born. Max and Stacey's affair is revealed at Christmas after Lauren makes a copy of the recording and gives it to Bradley. Both couples separate and Tanya files for divorce, but Max interferes with Tanya's romance with Stacey's brother, Sean Slater (Rob Kazinsky), and threatens to expose her as an unfit mother. With Sean's help, Tanya drugs Max and puts him in a coffin before burying him alive in the woods, knowing that a similar thing happened to him when he was 13 years old. An attack of conscience prompts Tanya to dig Max up and he decides to leave Walford as he can see how much devastation he had caused. Max returns, and discovers Tanya is now dating his younger brother Jack Branning (Scott Maslen). Max tries to separate them by attempting to buy the house, seducing Jack's ex-girlfriend Ronnie Mitchell (Samantha Womack), and planning to frame Jack for a crime he did not commit. Jack abducts Max and forces him to stay away, after which Max and Tanya kiss. Later that evening, he is the victim of a hit-and-run which Tanya confesses to and is arrested. However, Lauren admits that she was driving the car and turns herself in to the police. Tanya is released and Lauren goes into care. She is found not guilty of attempted murder but guilty of grievous bodily harm and decides to go home. Max and Tanya start a secret relationship and Tanya later allows Max to move back in. Max gets into debt and starts conning people with false insurance claims, including Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden), Heather Trott (Cheryl Fergison), Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) and Masood Ahmed (Nitin Ganatra). However, he is found out and debt collectors arrive and take his assets. Once the extent of Max's debts, lies and cons become clear, Tanya leaves with Lauren and Oscar but Abi stays. Max sinks into depression and sends Abi to live with her mother. Max and Bradley decide to go into business together and Roxy Mitchell (Rita Simons) rents the car lot to them. After Archie Mitchell's (Larry Lamb) murder on Christmas Day 2009, Max discovers that Bradley punched Archie because he raped Stacey, thinking that he is also the father of her baby. When the police come for Bradley two months later, Max helps him and Stacey flee but the police chase him to a rooftop where he stumbles and falls to his death. As Max and Stacey cry, she admits that she killed Archie. Stacey goes missing but Max finds her, and after an emotional confrontation, he takes her home and they agree not to tell anyone about Archie's murder. Max meets Vanessa Gold (Z√∂e Lucker) after she buys a car from him. They start a casual relationship but she realises Max still loves Tanya and ends the affair. When Tanya sends Max their finalised divorced papers, he storms in to her house and tells her he still loves her. However, Tanya says she has moved on and reveals she and her new boyfriend Greg Jessop (Stefan Booth) are engaged, and will be married in a few months. Max attempts to reconcile with Vanessa, but she informs him that their relationship will never be serious. However, when Vanessa's husband, Harry Gold (Linal Haft) finds out about the affair, he throws her out and she moves in with Max. Vanessa's daughter, Jodie Gold (Kylie Babbington), also moves in with Lauren and Abi. Harry takes revenge by throwing a brick through their window, destroying Vanessa's clothes and killing Jodie's cat. Max and Jack threaten Harry, thinking it is over but Jack is kidnapped by orders from Harry, and Max finds him the next day in the boot of his car. Lauren concludes that Max killed Archie, because he has been displaying violent behaviour, but Max tells her that he made a promise to the killer to protect them. After Stacey tells Lauren that Max is looking after her, Lauren tells Max that she has worked out that Stacey is the killer. Lauren gets a confession from Stacey, Lauren informs Janine Malloy (Charlie Brooks) that Stacey killed Archie, and Janine publicly announces that Stacey is a killer, so Max helps her to escape. He drives her to the airport and says he does still love her but she says she only loves Bradley and then leaves the country. Max proposes to Vanessa, and she accepts. They announce their engagement to everyone, but Tanya confronts Max and tells him that she knows that he only proposed to Vanessa to make her jealous. Max and Tanya argue before sleeping together, and they begin an affair, but Lauren discovers this so Tanya decides to end it. However, it continues, despite Tanya marrying Greg. When the affair is revealed after he leaves Vanessa, Max goes to Tanya in hope he will be with her. Unknown to him, she has found out she may have cancer and tells him she does not love him. Kicked out by his children, Max decides to leave. Meanwhile, Tanya chases after Max but is too late, and watches as a tearful Max leaves Walford in his car. Jack later reveals that Max is staying with their older brother Derek Branning (Jamie Foreman), and he wants to bring Max back as Tanya's family is falling apart. Max visits Tanya but ends up insulting her and she throws him out. As Max is about to leave, Lauren stops him, telling him that Tanya has cervical cancer and they need his help. Max talks to Tanya, and she explains her fears about her condition and reveals that she helped her sick father to die. Max then vows to support Tanya and stays with her along with Derek, although Tanya later throws Derek out. The family manage to enjoy Christmas together as they realise it might be Tanya's last one. When Tanya overhears Derek taunting a dying Pat Evans (Pam St. Clement), she furiously brands him a \\"freak\\" and Derek is livid when Max sides with her. Max is unnerved, however, when Derek hints that he knows things about Max that he does not want Tanya to know. Max becomes sexually frustrated as Tanya is never in the mood for sex, and almost starts an affair with Roxy Mitchell (Rita Simons) after he sees her naked. They almost kiss in an alleyway but are interrupted when a shout comes for Roxy. The next day, they text and call each other. Tanya then lies to Max that her nurse has recommended she does not have any sex. They are later shocked to discover Lauren has drunk so much she was passed out in the street. Lauren claims her drink was spiked, then says she is old enough to do what she likes after she is grounded. She then decides to move out. Max later has a change of heart and texts Roxy, telling her that nothing will ever happen between them. Max is relieved when Tanya is given the all-clear from cancer. Tanya is unconvinced however, and remains distant. Tanya's mother, Cora Cross (Ann Mitchell) suspects Max of having an affair with Roxy. Max gets Roxy to admit to Cora that she attempted to seduce him, but that he refused her. However, after a frank discussion with Tanya over their marriage and above all sex life Max reassures Tanya that she is all that matters to him and that he will not be straying again. When Tanya discovers that cars at the car lot are being repossessed, she and Max argue, which leads to passion and they have sex for the first time since Tanya's all-clear from cancer. Derek continues to allude to something Max did when he was staying with him. On Oscar's first day at school, Max claims he cannot attend as he is stuck in traffic, but he is instead seen posting an envelope full of money through somebody's letterbox. Max and Tanya plan to remarry, and Derek continues to remind Max that \\"they\\" want more money. Max gives Derek cash, but does not know that Derek does not pass it on. The day before the wedding, a drunken Lauren angrily tears up Tanya's wedding dress and destroys the cake, then reveals that she was drunk driving when she crashed Derek's car and her cousin Joey Branning (David Witts) took the blame, manipulated by Derek. She also reveals that she has been having a relationship with Joey. Max and Tanya cancel the wedding, and Max tells Derek that he wants nothing more to do with him after Christmas. Derek takes revenge by contacting the person involved in Max's secret, giving them Max's address. Max surprises Tanya with another wedding dress on Christmas Day, saying they can marry, but a woman claiming to be Max's wife, Kirsty Branning (Kierston Wareing), arrives. Max confirms to an angry Tanya that he did marry Kirsty but Derek had told him they were divorced. Kirsty reveals that she was pregnant by Max, but after Max left her to reunite with Tanya, Derek said that Max did not want the child, so she had an abortion. Max did not know about the pregnancy. Max confronts Derek and threatens to kill him for his lies and manipulation and Derek reveals that he always hated Max. Derek is forced out by Max, Jack and Joey and outside, he suffers a heart attack and dies. Max has mixed-emotions over Derek's death, finding it difficult to grieve for his brother. Despite rifts between him and Tanya following Kirsty's reveal, they depart on holiday during the new year after Derek's funeral. On their return, things are relatively healed between them. However, Max passionately embraces Kirsty after a heated argument. He then believes she has left Walford until she arrives at Derek's funeral. When Lauren befriends Kirsty, Kirsty gives Lauren a set of keys, which Max finds in her pocket. Tanya later discovers them and assumes that Max and Kirsty are still involved. However, Kirsty eventually agrees to sign the divorce papers and gives them to Max. Max shows Tanya and says Kirsty is leaving, but she realises Max still loves Kirsty believed because he refuses to have sex with her and is sad about Kirsty leaving. Max confirms this, so Tanya ejects Max from the house saying their relationship is over for good, as Kirsty leaves Walford. When Kirsty posts her wedding ring to Max, he tracks her down and finds her being abused by her ex-boyfriend's brother, who beats Max up. Max and Kirsty return to Walford and live together at the B&B.; Kirsty lies to Max that she is pregnant in an attempt to stop him returning to Tanya. Max encourages Kirsty to abort the pregnancy, but following another refusal by Tanya to rekindle their relationship, he changes his mind and moves into a new flat with Kirsty. Max and Kirsty's relationship comes under pressure due to the meddling of her ex-fianc√©, Carl White (Daniel Coonan), and he and Tanya argue because of her refusal to take him back, as well as Lauren's alcoholism. When Lauren tells Max and Tanya she cannot stand their constant arguing, Tanya agrees and decides to take Lauren out of Walford for treatment. Max later finds out about Kirsty's fake pregnancy after finding a pregnancy test on the floor that she threw in the bin. He ends the relationship with Kirsty and tries to convince Tanya to reunite, but she leaves Walford for Lauren's sake, after telling a heartbroken Max she will always love him. Struggling with losing Tanya, Max rebukes Kirsty's pleas for a reconciliation and struggles to look after Abi. Eventually, with Abi's blessing, they reunite, and Kirsty moves into their house. Lauren returns, having left her rehabilitation clinic early, worrying Max. Max's feud with Carl continues, and, determined to get rid of Max so he can win back Kirsty, he purposefully cuts the brakes on his car, and crashes it, leaving Phil in a critical condition. He frames Max for cutting the brakes, and forces Ian to become a false witness. Max is arrested and released on bail, until Carl goads him into attacking him, and he is remanded in custody. He then ends his relationship with Kirsty under Carl's instructions, who has threatened to harm Lauren. Carl also forces Max to tell his family he is guilty, and Lauren is the only person who believes he is innocent. On the day of Max's trial, Ian fails to turn up, and Max is released without charge, to Carl's fury. Max then heads to a wasteland with Phil, and it is revealed they have kidnapped Ian. They use Ian as bait to trap Carl, and then let him go, and Phil offers Max the chance to kill Carl. Max declines and returns to his family instead, resuming his relationship with Kirsty. however, Carl soon tells Max that he had sex with Kirsty while he was in prison, leading to Max ending his relationship with her. Several months later, Kirsty leaves Walford for good. Max is stunned when Stacey's cousin, Kat Moon (Jessie Wallace), spots Stacey from a bus in London. He helps track Stacey down, but decides he cannot be involved when he realises he may still have feelings for Stacey. Stacey later turns to Max for help, but they end up in a passionate kiss, and Stacey later leaves Walford with Lily to stay with her mother Jean. Max later starts a sexual relationship with his daughter Lauren's best friend, Lucy Beale (Hetti Bywater), which they manage to keep a secret for several weeks. Somebody eventually finds out about Max and Lucy's affair, and e-mails him an image of the pair kissing. Max confronts Lucy, believing it is her trying to blackmail him, but it is revealed it is not. Eventually, Lucy ends her affair with Max due to her new relationship with Lee Carter (Danny-Boy Hatchard), which infuriates Max. A physical struggle ensues, which ends when Lucy falls over and hits her head on a chair. Max and Lucy have an explosive argument outside of the car lot, which sees Max grab Lucy violently by her arm. Later that night, Lucy is murdered by an unknown assailant (see Who Killed Lucy Beale?). Max becomes prime suspect after the police discover that Lucy was having an affair, and Max reveals all to David Wicks (Michael French). David initially tries to encourage Max to confess to the Beales and the police, but he refuses, and David threatens to tell the police everything. After Max's sister Carol Jackson (Lindsey Coulson) collapses and is rushed to hospital, David realises he must protect Max for her so gets rid of all of the evidence of Max and Lucy's fight. Remembering the moving eulogy Max made at Bradley's funeral, Ian turns to him for advice over Lucy's impending funeral. Abi becomes irate when she sees Max supporting Ian and reveals that she knows that he was sleeping with Lucy and was the person that sent him the email of him and Lucy together. Abi's boyfriend Jay Brown (Jamie Borthwick) witnesses the confrontation between them and tells Phil, who in turn reveals the truth to a horrified Ian. At the funeral, Ian attacks Max when he sees him carrying Lucy's coffin and later Phil and Alfie Moon (Shane Richie) visit him and tell him that he is no longer welcome in any of Ian or Phil's businesses or The Queen Vic. Max then begins a sexual relationship with DC Emma Summerhayes (Anna Acton), the detective who is investigating Lucy's murder. Emma ends things when Max's rival, Dot's grandson Charlie Cotton (Declan Bennett) discovers their relationship and threatens to report it. When Stacey is released after an appeal, Max employs her at the car lot, but she decides to leave when he admits he still has feelings for her and it was those feelings that drove him to have the affair with Lucy. Stacey then encourages him to get back in touch with Emma, and she and Max resume their relationship. He impresses Emma's parents when they visit but when Emma wants to end their relationship because of the pressures of the case, Max makes an anonymous call to the police which starts an investigation into Emma's misconduct. Max is angry when Emma gives Lauren's laptop to the police, and as a result, Abi's behaviour regarding Max and Lucy is revealed to both the police and Lauren. After Emma is hit by a car in the Square, Max takes her to hospital where she dies from a bleed to the brain. Max finds Emma's case notes in his kitchen cupboard and rips them up in front of Carol, and then turns to alcohol to deal with his grief. Thinking Phil was responsible for the crash, he takes revenge by tricking his son Ben (Harry Reid) into signing over The Arches to him. When Max discovers Phil has been framed, he refuses to sign the business back to Phil despite Ben later telling him that Nick Cotton (John Altman) was responsible for the crash. After he is banned from Emma's funeral, Max visits Phil in prison to tell him he has taken over ownership of The Arches. Phil swears revenge on Max, and after being released, Phil regains the garage and also takes the car lot from Max. Max struggles with the loss of his business, and stops taking care of himself or paying his bills. Carol discovers this and invites Max to move in with her and rent out his house to pay the mortgage. Desperate for work, Max takes a job at Ian's fish and chip shop. When Ben is arrested for Lucy's murder, Phil manipulates Abi into coming forward about Max's fake alibi to the police. Max is arrested and when Lucy's blood is found on his shoe, from where Jake Stone caused Lucy's nose to bleed on the night she died, he is charged with the murder. He later tells Stacey he knows Abi killed Lucy, and hires Marcus Christie (Stephen Churchett) as his solicitor. Despite Jane Beale (Laurie Brett) giving him a false alibi, he is found guilty thanks to Phil paying off the jury foreman. Upon hearing the verdict, Max escapes from court and manages to confront Jane in the hope of uncovering the truth. Jane simply says she believes Max is innocent and decides to help him escape to Ireland. Max wants to say a final goodbye to Lauren and Abi, so Jane goes to Carol's to find them. Carol realises Max is at Jane's so goes there and decides to go to Ireland with him. When Abi finds out Max is at Jane's, she calls the police. Max soon realises that Jane is covering for her adoptive son, Bobby Beale (Eliot Carrington), and that Lauren knew, so he disowns Lauren. Max is then arrested while shouting that Bobby killed Lucy, though it is dismissed as an act of desperation. He is sentenced to life imprisonment with a recommendation he should serve at least 21 years. Seven months later, the truth about Bobby emerges and he is charged with Lucy's murder. Lauren and Abi attempt to visit Max in prison, but they find out that he has refused to see either of them. Max has a court hearing for his release, which Abi is reluctant to attend so Lauren writes Max a letter for Stacey to pass on, but Stacey misses Max at the court and hands it to his solicitor. Lauren and Abi wait for Max in The Queen Vic but he does not arrive, and when Lauren goes home, Max posts the letter back through the letterbox and quickly leaves in a taxi with Lauren failing to stop him. A week later, Max sends Ian a threatening note, saying he will never forget what he did. Max returns to Walford on Christmas Eve and claims that he has changed, giving up smoking and drinking, but in reality, he has become a dark man. He shakes hands with Ian and Jane, saying he wants to move on from the past. Lauren is glad to see Max but Abi is not as she is still angry with the way Max treated her during his trial. However, Max begs her to give him a chance and invites Abi, Lauren and Jack to have a drink with him. Abi accepts Max but Jack questions his motives. Stacey finds out that Phil bribed the foreman at Max's trial so that he could be found guilty, so tells Max. Max visits Phil at the hospital, but instead of suffocating Phil as Phil asks him to, Max states that he forgives him. Outside, Max burns his wrist with a cigarette, revealing that he has been self-harming. Max attends Jack's wedding to Ronnie, and Roxy slips her bedroom key into his pocket. After the ceremony, Max goes to Roxy's bedroom and waits for her. There, he finds cocaine in Roxy's handbag. The next day, Max hears that Ronnie and Roxy have drowned and disposes of Roxy's cocaine so the police will not find it. Max supports Jack and his mother-in-law Glenda Mitchell (Glynis Barber) as they struggle to cope with their loss and to look after his children, Amy Mitchell (Abbie Knowles), Ricky Mitchell (Henri Charles), and Ronnie's son, Matthew Mitchell Cotton, whose father is Charlie Cotton. When a bus crashes into the market, Max organises the rescue of Stacey's husband, Martin Fowler (James Bye), from under the bus and is hailed a hero. Later, Max meets Hugo Browning (Simon Williams), the chairman of a company called Weyland & Co, and they share a cryptic conversation in which Hugo talks about the development of Walford, to which Max says that the pub is next on his list. It is soon revealed that Max works for Weyland & Co, and they are planning to redevelop the Albert Square area. Lauren meets Max's boss, Josh Hemmings (Eddie Eyre), and they are attracted to each other, so she decides to apply for a job at Weyland & Co, despite Max telling her not to. Max tells Josh not to employ her but Josh does so anyway. Max convinces Shirley Carter (Linda Henry) to sell the freehold of The Queen Vic to a company called Grafton Hill. He also contacts Charlie, who returns to Walford and tells Jack they need to talk about Matthew. Charlie insists he will seek custody of Matthew and starts a fight with Jack in public; Jack punches Charlie. Max later visits Charlie when discovering the incident likely will not influence the legal case over Matthew, revealing their secret scheming, and says they have to take further actions; soon after, the police find Jack and arrest him for assault as Max watches. Jack is accused of badly hurting Charlie, who allowed Max to purposely attack and injure him to frame Jack for serious assault. The charges against Jack are dropped, and Charlie attempts to settle for residence of Matthew and plans to move to Ireland with him. Jack voluntarily gives Charlie residence of Matthew, but Max warns Charlie that he is not doing enough. Max gives him cash as a reward for his assistance and takes his mobile phone, telling him not to contact Jack again, threatening him with violence if he refuses. Charlie agrees and Max smashes Charlie's phone. Max seemingly shows an interest in Carmel Kazemi (Bonnie Langford), who works at Walford Council's planning department. On their first date, he uses the opportunity to secretly look at her files from the council. When Ian and Jane plan to sell the fish and chip shop, they are shocked to discover the buyer is Weyland & Co. Ian pulls out of the deal, fearing Max's motives. However, Max convinces Ian that he does not have any ulterior motives and he just wants to move on. Max hears that Lauren and her boyfriend Steven Beale (Aaron Sidwell) are engaged, despite Steven lying to Lauren that he has a brain tumour. Lauren leaves a message on Max's voicemail, requesting him to refuse Steven when he asks him for permission to marry her. However, Max deliberately gives his permission, pretending he did not get Lauren's message. Max and Carmel have sex after their second date but he leaves before she wakes up and goes home, where his house appears to show him to be wealthy despite telling people that he lives in a bedsit. It is also revealed that he is in a relationship with Fi Browning (Lisa Faulkner), who works for Grafton Hill. Fi knows about Max and Carmel's relationship as it is part of a plan to get information from the council. Max reveals to Steven that he knows about his brain tumour lie and stops Steven confessing to Lauren by telling her that Steven has three months to live. Max blackmails Steven, threatening that he will reveal his lie if he does not do what he tells him. When a group of tenants refuse to leave their flat, Max orders Steven to burn it down but make sure the tenants are out. When Steven does this, he tells Max that he does not know if the tenants got out. Jane finds out about Steven's lie and Steven tells Max that he will tell her that Max lied for him. Max grabs Steven by the throat and tells him if he does, he will kill him. Jane overhears Max and Fi talking about the redevelopment plan, which Max is using as revenge against those who wronged him in the past. Jane confronts Max in Ian's restaurant and at the same time, a gas explosion occurs on the Square so Max leaves Jane alone at the restaurant. Max confronts Steven at The Vic and orders him to kill Jane so she does not tell anyone. Steven sets fire to the restaurant with Jane inside and leaves her there, telling her this would not have happened if she had not let Max go to prison. Max and Steven go back to the restaurant and Max orders Steven to kill her. Steven refuses to allow her to die so Max angrily shoves him and forces him to leave. Max confronts Jane and tells her that while he was in prison, all he could think about was revenge on everyone who turned their back on him. He opens a hatch to allow the fire to spread to Jane and leaves, lying that he could not find Jane. Steven later dies from his injuries but Jane is rescued. Max goes to the hospital to see Jane, pretending to be her husband. He calls Jane's mobile and finds it in a drawer, then takes the SIM card out and bins it. Unable to speak, Jane tries to communicate with Sharon through writing but falls unconscious. Max tries to kill Jane by holding down on her breathing tube but stops when Ian walks in. It is revealed that Weyland & Co is owned by James Willmott-Brown (William Boyde), and Josh, Fi and Max's former prison cellmate, Luke Browning (Adam Astill), are his children. When Jane awakens from her coma, Max orders her to leave Walford. As Jane and Ian make plans, however, James tells Max that Ian must remain in Walford, so Max threatens Bobby's safety to make Jane leaves alone. James tells Max that he wants access to some sealed bids belonging to the council. Carmel offers to help him but he changes his mind. However, Fi meets him at Carmel's house, where they have sex. Unbeknownst to Max, Fi then hacks into Carmel's computer and accesses the sealed bids; Carmel is suspended from her job, though is later cleared. Mick and Linda are asked to pay ¬£60,000 for development funds to The Queen Vic, and Max suggests that Fi reduce it to ¬£50,000 to regain the Carters' trust. Mick and Linda raise the money. Lauren discovers a scale model of Albert Square showing its development, and confronts Max, who assures her that the developers have pulled out. Max buys an engagement ring for Fi, which Carmel finds and assumes that Max is going to propose to her, so she gathers her friends and family in The Queen Vic. However, Max kisses Fi in front of everyone and Camrel leaves in tears. James and Luke then enter The Queen Vic and reveal that the Carters didn't raise the money for Grafton Hill which is owned by Weyland, meaning that they now own the Vic, with Fi denying that she offered any discount. They also reveal Max's involvement in not only this but the whole of the development scam. Everyone is shocked by Max's actions who is smugly delighted that everything has fallen into place for him. Looking for the icing on the cake, Max proposes to Fi but is stunned when she refuses, much to the amusement of everyone in the pub. Max is further horrified when James and Luke betray him by burning his contract, revealing that he was being tricked all along. Speechless, Max sits defeated and alone in the Vic until Jack decides to take him home, fearing for Max's safety since his betrayal is now known to most of the square. Carmel's son, Kush Kazemi (Davood Ghadami), arrives however and punches Max for his treatment of Carmel, sending him flying over a table in a heap. Homeless and unemployed, Max is taken in by Jack who discovers his self-harming. The next day, Max is given his desk belongings by Luke from Weyland and Co and after seeing Wilmott-Brown and Fi in a car, he hysterically shouts at them for their betrayal. He then aggressively shouts at Jack until he is slapped by him. Josh gives Lauren the office copy of Max's contract, stating that he is entitled to the money and Weyland always set out to destroy him. He then lets Lauren decide what to do with the contract. Lauren demands the truth from Max, who says he did what he did to get money for his family. Lauren doesn't believe him and reveals the contract and threatens to burn it if he does not tell the truth; however, Max grabs it and destroys it himself, revealing that he doesn't care about the money and that all he wanted was revenge for everyone who lied or did nothing when he was sent to prison, including his own family. Max rages at Abi, Lauren and Jack who all leave, and he then smashes Jack's family photos. He goes to burn himself, but has no cigarettes left so headbutts a mirror instead. Jack, regretting his decision to abandon Max during his trial, supports him despite Max's rant. He arranges for Oscar to visit Max on his birthday which delights Max. Max convinces Abi to help him bake a cake, but Cora arrives and says she has heard what he did and told Tanya, who has decided to make sure Max never sees Oscar again. Max, close to a mental breakdown over his recent losses, sees Phil, Mick, Vincent Hubbard (Richard Blackwood), Keanu Taylor (Danny Walters) and Aidan Maguire (Patrick Bergin) leaving The Albert bar together and realises they are planning something. He fails to try and manipulate Keanu into thinking that he will be used as collateral damage. Jack continues to support Max and after persuading Mick and Linda to let Max drink the Vic, the two have a day in the pub. Max thanks Jack for his recent help. However, Charlie returns to Walford with Matthew and tells Jack that Max caused his injuries and paid him to take Matthew away. Max pleads with Jack to forgive him but Jack disowns Max. He throws him out onto the street and after both Abi and Lauren give him the brush off, Max briefly leaves Walford. Max returns and, angrier than ever, decides to get revenge on Ian and Phil. He surprises Ian in his house, stating that he is going to kill him. Ian says that Phil is the real culprit as he bribed the jury, but Max says that Phil is next on his list. Ian tries to escape Max by hitting him over the head with a frying pan, but Max pulls him back inside the house and starts to strangle him, just as Lauren walks in. Lauren stops Max from killing Ian, who tells Phil. Stacey hears from Lauren that Max has tried killing Ian and calms him down, letting him stay with her and Martin. The next morning, Martin is unconvinced that Max will not come between Stacey and their family, so asks Stacey to get Max to leave, which she does. After asking Lauren and Abi to forgive him and see him on Christmas Day, which they both agree to think about, Max tricks Stacey into returning to her house and tries to convince her there is still a spark between them. Stacey initially resists but gives in and they have sex. On Christmas Day, Max and Stacey both agree to keep quiet about the night before and Max is thrilled when Abi joins him for Christmas dinner, where he feels his grandchild kick for the first time. However, Stacey's phone is posted through the letter box and Max panics when he realises that Jane has left messages for Stacey about what Max did to her and Steven. After seducing Stacey again, he manages to delete them. To his horror, Tanya returns and reveals to Stacey that Max killed Steven and tried to kill Jane, having heard from Jane what Max did. Max desperately tries to deny it but its clear to Stacey that he's lying, and Tanya then tells him that she's taking their daughters away for their own safety. Under pressure from Stacey, Max finally confesses but tells her that he had good reasons. Stacey rejects him, saying he will never change and that she wishes he had died instead of Bradley. Ian attacks Max for what he did to Steven but is quickly over-powered and Max proceeds to punch him, before their fight is stopped by Lauren. Phil then confronts and beats up Max before brandishing a gun on him, but stops short of killing him when the latter tempts him into firing the gun. Max, having lost everything, goes to the roof of the Vic to jump but is seen by Tanya, Abi and Lauren who were about to leave. Despite Tanya's concerns and objections, Abi and Lauren go to the roof to try to talk him down. Max shouts at them to leave but after they both say they love him, he agrees to come down. Before they can get down, however, Lauren slips on the wet ledge and falls, taking Abi with her. They survive the fall but are taken to hospital in a critical condition. Max tells a police officer that it is his fault, so he is arrested on suspicion of GBH. However, they receive a video filmed by Keegan Baker (Zack Morris), showing Lauren and Abi falling, so he is released. He goes to the hospital where Tanya initially accepts his comfort but pushes him away when a nurse arrives with news about one of their daughters. The nurse informs them that while Lauren is expected to recover, Abi is brainstem dead and has no chance of regaining consciousness. Abi's baby is delivered via cesarean section. Max is hopeful that Abi will recover and does not tell Lauren the truth, but she slaps Max when she finds out. After this, Max obtains a court order to stop Abi's life support being withdrawn and plans to take her to the US for a treatment that will cost ¬£2,000,000, but Dr Harding urges Max to do the dignified thing for Abi as she is already dead and as Abi is not a minor, he has no legal right to take her. Max barricades himself in Abi's hospital room, but is talked into letting the hospital staff in when a nurse tells Max about her own son's death and that she never got to say goodbye. When Dr Harding explains what will happen to Max and Lauren, Max asks if the life support can be withdrawn at Abi's time of birth, 8.32pm. Tanya, Cora and Rainie return but Cora tells Max that Tanya does not want him present when the life support is withdrawn. Max finds Tanya in the hospital's chapel and she is angry with Max that Abi has to die because of him. However, just before Abi's life support is withdrawn, Tanya requests Max to be there. Abi then dies, leaving her family devastated. Max is hurt when he is led to believe that Abi's funeral has taken place, but he discovers it has not and Lauren tells him that none of the family want him present. On the day of the funeral, Max respects Lauren's wishes to not attend the funeral and visits Abi's daughter during the funeral to register her birth, but at the end of Abi's funeral, Jay allows Max to say his goodbyes and Max delivers his eulogy, prompting Max and Lauren to make amends. Abi is toasted in the Vic, her friends let off white balloons and her daughter is named Abi Branning as Max is determined to do things right. Max returns two months later after buying the car lot, with the intention of gaining custody of Abi's daughter. He also marries Tanya's sister, Rainie Cross (Tanya Franks) in order to look like a family man, shocking everyone when she is revealed as his wife. The marriage is a scam and it's revealed he's going pay Rainie when he gains the custody. Phil is furious when he discovers that Max has returned and has one of his former businesses but despite his attempts to con Max, Max fends him off whilst mocking him. Despite a less than easy start, Max settles back into life on the square. Him and Rainie successfully fool their neighbours and social services whilst moving in with Jack. Rainie worries that Jack's girlfriend, Mel Owen (Tamzin Outhwaite) suspects their relationship is fake so they put on a convincing romance, including them passionately kissing. When Max realises that Rainie's kiss was real, he is shocked but she quickly admits it was a mistake. Donna Yates (Lisa Hammond), who was Abi's friend, tries to stop Rainie and Max getting custody of the baby, but Rainie admits to Donna that she wants to bring up the baby because she cannot have children of her own due to her former drug use. Cora also returns and offers Rainie a job in Exeter and a chance to bring up Abi with her and Tanya, but Rainie reveals Cora's ¬£50,000 bribe to social services. Rainie searches for houses so she and Max can bring up Abi on their own, and Max thanks her, asking what she will do once she receives her pay-off. This leaves Rainie upset as she secretly wants to stay with Max and Abi. Feeling lonely, she has a one-night stand with Jack but they both agree to never talk about it again the next day, not realising that Jack's daughter Amy had seen them kissing and taken a video. When Rainie decides to leave, Max realises his own feelings for her and stops her at the train station where they agree to enter a real relationship. Just as the Brannings seem to be back on track, Cora discovers from Amy that Rainie slept with Jack and she smugly informs Max. Devastated, Max punches Jack in the cafe and confronts Rainie, who admits to it but tells him that it happened when her and Max weren't properly together. Max decides to forgive them both for the sake of baby Abi and they agree to deny it since Cora doesn't have any proper evidence. However, in the pub, Cora repeatedly insults Rainie to the point where Rainie slaps her, before Cora punches her back. Whilst outside, Max scolds Rainie for her actions and tells her she may well have ruined his case for Abi. Meanwhile, Jack tends to Cora who tells him that contrary to his, Max and Rainie's beliefs, she does have evidence of the one-night stand because Amy took a video. Jack tells Max and Rainie about this and Rainie decides to confront her mother. She enters the Beale's house from the backdoor and Cora mistakes this as her attempting to kidnap baby Abi. Max finds out where Rainie is and finds both her and Cora arguing. When Cora hits Rainie over the back of the head with a frying pan, Max flees with Abi back to his house where he's joined by Stacy. Social services are called and they arrive to take baby Abi from Max, leaving him heartbroken. The next day, however, Rainie blackmails Cora into dropping her application for Abi after threatening to tell the police that she attacked her. Max receives a call from social services and after persuading Ian and Jack to be present at a meeting, he is given baby Abi to care for. Max is delighted and he later reconciles with Rainie. A year later when Bobby is release, Max is horrified and began a conflict with his family as he can never forgive him for what he has done including his ruined relationship with Lauren and Abi. Max attacks Bobby but is stopped by Ben (now played by Max Bowden). However, Max decides to forgive Bobby, who he helps with hallucinations of Lucy and organises a party to celebrate Bobby's conversion to Islam. Max becomes close to Stacey's old friend Ruby Allen (Louisa Lytton) and after sleeping together, they begin a relationship. Stacey becomes jealous and warns Max not to hurt Ruby. However, Max cannot cope with Ruby's free spirited character, which leads to him neglecting Abi who almost swallows a medicinal pill. Max decides to end the relationship but they reconcile. Max discovers that Ruby slept with Martin and suggests that they have an open relationship that Max struggles to accommodate. Whilst on a boat party Max learns that Jack has been supporting Lauren with her separation from Peter which leads to Jack punching Max. Creation and development=Casting Jake Wood was cast in the role of Max in January 2006. At the time, little was known of the character, who was to move in with Jim (John Bardon) and Dot Branning (June Brown). Wood commented: \\"I'm a great admirer of both John Bardon and June Brown and I'm looking forward to joining the Branning family.\\" In March 2008, Max was temporarily written out of the show when Wood went on paternity leave. Wood said of this \\"It comes at a good time because Max is getting grief over his affair so he will disappear for a while.\\" He returned three months later, in June. In May 2009, Wood signed a new two-year contract with the show after which he took a temporary four-month break from the show in August 2011, which Wood said was down to the fact that after five years of playing Max, he was tired and \\"needed a break\\". Wood returned to filming after signing another two-year contract, and Max returned with his older brother Derek Branning (Jamie Foreman) in November. Characterisation Wood has described Max as \\"damaged\\", with a troubled upbringing, and uses this backstory to justify Max's actions in the series, saying that Max is motivated to be a better father to his children than his own father was to him, and that Max has done nothing that would be out of character. Storyline development In May 2009, Wood said he hoped his character would get back with his wife, Tanya (Jo Joyner), saying: \\"He believes Tanya still loves him. I think she does too.\\" Later in 2009 Max gets into debt and tries to con various Walford residents. On conning single mother Heather Trott (Cheryl Fergison), Wood said \\"Max has got a conscience but he's thinking about his own survival. He wants to keep his family at all costs.\\" On hiding Max's debt problems from Tanya, Wood commented: \\"Max thinks he can wriggle out of situations and admitting to debt would be a blow to his manhood. But Tanya would have understood and he'd have kept his family. [...] The problem between Max and Tanya has always been honesty. If Tanya finds out she may never trust Max again.\\" When Tanya discovers Max's lies, she leaves him. This storyline facilitated Joyner's temporary departure on maternity leave. The show's executive producer Diederick Santer commented: \\"Yet again, Max has messed up, hasn't he? He's learned to keep it in his trousers, but financially, he's corrupt. He's taken his eye off the ball business-wise and like a lot of people in the last year or two, he's found it tough going. His inability to show weakness or to share his problems with Tanya has been his downfall. He has to rebuild his life now and his long-term objective is to get Tanya back. Jo Joyner is of course returning to the Square but whether Max gets Tanya back is another thing. I don't know if he's good enough for her.\\" Santer also revealed that some planned storyline material for Max and Tanya was put on hold until Tanya's return from maternity leave. In March 2010, a new love interest for Max was announced, Vanessa Gold, played by Z√∂e Lucker. A spokesperson for the show said that \\"[Max and Vanessa] are both volatile and explosive characters and their meeting will be like putting a lit match next to a barrel [of] gunpowder.\\" Wood said that Max is weak when it comes to women, although his desire is to have his wife and children back, adding that \\"He always makes mistakes, he's easily led and the grass is always greener. He's his own worst enemy.\\" In March 2011, it was revealed that Max and Abi would suffer severe injuries after their car crashes into a lorry on the way to Tanya's wedding to Greg Jessop (Stefan Booth), prompting Tanya to flee the wedding to help him. The crash scenes were filmed on 6 March 2011. Sabbatical On 28 May 2015, it was announced that Wood had decided to take a year-long hiatus from EastEnders. Of this decision, Wood said, \\"I have been at EastEnders for nine years and I feel the time is right to give Max a break‚Äîbut it won't be for too long as I shall be back next year to see Max face another chapter of drama.\\" Executive producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins added: \\"When I returned to EastEnders, both Jake and I agreed that Max has been through so much over the past nine years that we would give him and Jake a break when the opportunity arose. That opportunity has come and it is the perfect time to send Max Branning out with a bang that will send ripples through the Square for the rest of the year until Jake returns.\\" Max left on 1 October 2015 after being wrongly convicted for Lucy Beale's murder. He made a cameo appearance on 9 June 2016, making a quick return to the square to return Lauren and Abi's letter of apology then leaving again, indicating that he hasn't forgiven them for letting him go to jail when they knew he was innocent. \\" Max's full return aired on 24 December 2016. Departure (2020) In September 2020, it was announced that Wood would be departing from the cast of EastEnders after fifteen years in the role, with Max being written out as part of an \\"explosive exit\\". Reception The storyline which saw Tanya bury Max alive prompted 167 viewer complaints, citing the inappropriate nature of the scenes, which aired prior to the 9.00 pm watershed. The BBC responded with the statement: \\"Whilst we appreciate that these episodes were dramatic, they were carefully filmed and edited in order that Max's ordeal was in the main implicit, rather than explicit, whilst still retaining their powerfulness. It's also important to note that Max made it out alive after Tanya realised she couldn't go through with her plan to leave him for dead. The burial is in no way glamorised or glorified, rather we see that when pushed to the edge, Tanya's behaviour becomes out of character, and indeed that it's Tanya herself who ultimately suffers because of her actions. Once again we are sorry that you did not enjoy these episodes.\\" The UK communications regulator Ofcom later found that the episodes depicting the storyline were in breach of the 2005 Broadcasting Code. They contravened the rules regarding protection of children by appropriate scheduling, appropriate depiction of violence before the 9pm watershed and appropriate depiction of potentially offensive content.Ofcom Broadcast Bulletin 112, June 2008 Following Max's appearance in a single episode in 2016, a reporter writing for the Inside Soap Yearbook 2017 (released in November 2016) expressed their disappointment at \\"one glimpse\\" of Max, adding that it was \\"not good enough\\". Wood has received a number of award nominations for his portrayal of Max. In 2007, he was nominated for Best Newcomer at the TV Quick and TV Choice Awards, and Best Soap Actor the following year and in 2010. In 2008 and 2009, he was nominated for Best Actor at the Inside Soap Awards, Also in 2009 he was nominated for Best Actor at The British Soap Awards. In 2010, he was nominated in the Outstanding Serial Drama Performance category at the National Television Awards, but was not shortlisted, and in February 2011, Wood was nominated for Best Actor in the Soap Bubble Awards for his portrayal of Max. In 2012, Wood and Joyner won the Best On-Screen Partnership category at the British Soap Awards. On Digital Spy's 2012 end of year reader poll, Wood was nominated for \\"Best Male Soap Actor\\" and came third with 15.2% of the vote. In August 2017, Wood was longlisted for Best Actor and Best Bad Boy at the Inside Soap Awards, while the revelation that Max is in a secret relationship with Fi was longlisted for Best Shock Twist. Wood made the shortlist in the Best Bad Boy category, although lost out to Connor McIntyre, who portrays Pat Phelan in Coronation Street.

To the left are other prosphora which will be used during the service. The Lamb (; ) is the square portion of bread cut from the prosphora in the Liturgy of Preparation at the Divine Liturgy in the Eastern Orthodox and Byzantine Catholic churches. The Lamb is cut from a specially prepared loaf of leavened bread and placed in the center of the diskos. The loaf, called a prosphoron, has had stamped in the top of its dough the seal of the Greek letters IC, XC, and NIKA, \\"Jesus Christ conquers\\", divided by a Greek cross, and the portion by the seal is cutout as the Lamb. The loaf must be made only from the finest flour, yeast, salt and water. It is formed in two layers to symbolize the hypostatic union. Liturgy of Preparation The priest cuts the Lamb from the prosphoron using a liturgical knife called a \\"spear\\", with a blade shaped like a spearpoint to recall the spear used at the crucifixion to pierce Jesus' side. Cutting along the each edge, and removing the Lamb, he recites a phrase from : *on the right side: \\"He was led as a sheep to the slaughter.\\" *on the left side: \\"And as a spotless lamb before His shearers is dumb, so he opened not his mouth.\\" *at the top: \\"In his humiliation his judgement was taken away.\\" *at the bottom: \\"And who shall declare His generation?\\" *as he removes the Lamb from the prosphoron: \\"For His life is taken up from the earth.\\" In () St. Philip interprets these as referring to the sacrifice of Christ on the Cross. the Lamb with particles. He then places the Lamb face down on the seal, and cuts it cross-wise almost all the way through, leaving it connected as one piece by the seal. This will facilitate the fraction after the anaphora. As he makes these cuts, he says, \\"Sacrificed is the Lamb of God Who taketh away the sins of the world, for the life of the world, and the salvation thereof.\\" He then stands the Lamb upright again, and pierces it with the tip of the spear on its right (the priest's left) below the seal, saying, \\"One of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and straightway there came forth blood and water. And he that saw it bare witness, and his witness is true.\\" () There are other particles also cut from prosphora as part of the Liturgy of Preparation. These commemorate the Theotokos, nine ranks of saints, the living, and the departed. These smaller particles are arranged around the Lamb on the diskos. A metal frame, the asterisk or star-cover, is placed over the diskos to support the small veil with which it is covered. This veil remains in place until the diskos is set upon the altar. The priest will then cense the a√´r and place it over both the diskos and chalice, where it will remain until just prior to the Great Entrance, when the bread and wine are carried to the Holy Table for the consecration. Communion At the anaphora only the Lamb is actually consecrated; the other particles are considered to remain only bread. When it comes time for Communion, the priest will divide the Lamb into four portions, breaking it along the cuts in the underside made during the Liturgy of Preparation. The deacon will say, \\"Break, Master, the Holy Bread.\\" And, as he breaks it, the priest says, \\"Broken and distributed is the Lamb of God; broken, but not disunited; ever eaten, yet never consumed; sanctifying all who partake thereof.\\" He then puts the four portions of the Lamb on the rim of the diskos in the form of a cross. They remain in this arrangement only briefly. The upper portion (that has IC on the seal) is placed whole in the Chalice to signify the oneness of Christ. The deacon says, \\"Fill, Master, the Holy Cup.\\" As he places the particle in the Chalice, the priest says, \\"The fullness of the Holy Spirit.\\" The lower portion, (with XC on the seal) is cut into smaller particles with which the clergy are communicated. The portions on the left and right (with NI and KA, respectively) are cut into much smaller particles. These are placed into the chalice and used to communicate the faithful. Presanctified Liturgy During Great Lent it is not permitted to celebrate the Divine Liturgy on weekdays and, therefore, on certain weekdays thereof and on the first three days of Holy Week, communion is given from Lambs consecrated on the previous Sunday at the Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts.

(2009). \\"Cape May Canal, New Jersey.\\" Channel Statement. Length calculated from segments \\"Canal Entrance to Cape Island Creek\\" + \\"Cape Island Creek to Inner End of Ferry Basin.\\" There is a long history of unfulfilled plans for a canal across Cape May. available at the Cape May County Library - Villas Branch The canal was finally constructed by the United States Army Corps of Engineers during World War II to provide a protected route to avoid German U-boats operating off Cape May Point and to become part of the Intracoastal Waterway. The canal was dredged as a wartime emergency measure in 1942 and was the final link in a protected waterway intended to allow coastal shipping to travel along the coast with a greatly reduced risk of attack from German submarines. History Albert Gallatin, the Secretary of the Treasury, recommended in an 1808 report that \\"a series of canals be constructed along the seacoast, cutting across the necks of many peninsulas so as to provide an inland passage for seagoing vessels from Massachusetts Southward through North Carolina.\\" Nathaniel Holmes proposed government aid for a canal across Cape May in the 1840s and the Risley brothers detailed a plan and started dredging a canal from Stone Harbor to Bidwell's Creek. More serious plans developed after 1905 when Cape May Sound was dredged to form part of the Intracoastal Waterway. Later Cape May Harbor was formed by dredging, and Cold Spring Inlet was dredged to form an entrance to the harbor for larger seagoing vessels. The importance of these extensions to the Intracoastal Waterway was underlined when the Navy built a base in 1917 on the south shore of Cape May Harbor. (The base later became a Coast Guard facility, today called the United States Coast Guard Training Center Cape May.) Seashore Road (Rt. 162) bridge across the canal The first congressional bill to build the canal was introduced in 1935, but never reported out of committee. A 1940 bill passed both houses of Congress, but was vetoed by President Franklin Roosevelt. A November 1941 bill authorizing construction was signed into law, but did not provide funding. Federal and state funding became available in 1942 after several ships were sunk by German U-boats in early 1942. The canal created Cape Island, which includes Cape May, Cape May Point, West Cape May and the southernmost portions of Lower Township. The island is separated from the mainland and the rest of Cape May County by the Cape May Canal, Cape Island Creek and Cape May Harbor which cut it off from the rest of the peninsula. There are three bridges across the canal: Route 109 (the link from the Garden State Parkway into Cape May), Route 162 (Seashore Road into West Cape May), and the railroad swing bridge of the Cape May Seashore Lines. The canal is used heavily by recreational boat traffic during the summer.

So, in present times Baisakhi occurs near 13 April every year). They formed the nucleus of the Khalsa: the first five persons to receive Khanda di Pahul initiation and rites (baptism) of the two-edged sword. In Sikh theology, as in the Indian classical tradition generally, panj (‡®™‡©∞‡®ú), the number five in Punjabi, has a special significance. Guru Nanak in Japji Sahib refers to five khands, i.e. stages or steps in spiritual development, and calls a spiritually awakened person a panch. The ancient Indian socio- political institution panchayat meant a council of five elders. Something like an inner council of five existed even in the time of earlier Gurus. Five Sikhs accompanied Guru Arjan on his last journey to Lahore, each given 100 armed Sikhs to command by his successor, Guru Hargobind. Guru Tegh Bahadur set out on his journey to Delhi to court execution attended by five Sikhs. Until the Vaisakhi of AD 1699, the Sikh initiation ceremony was known as Charan Pahul. The calling of 5 volunteers Keshgarh Sahib Gurudwara at Anandpur Sahib, Punjab, the birthplace of Khalsa Guru Gobind Singh, abolished the institution of masands and replaced charan pahul with Khanda di Pahul. He summoned a special assembly at Keshgarh Fort in Anandpur on Baisakhi day of 1756 Bk/30 March 1699. After the morning devotions and kirtan, Guru Gobind Singh suddenly stood up with sword in hand. By written reference from Bhai Santokh Singh, Sri Gur Pratap Suraj Granth, the Guru spoke: ‚ÄúThe entire sangat is very dear to me, but is there a devoted Sikh who will give his head to me here and now? A need has arisen at this moment which calls for a head.‚Äù A hush fell over the assembly. Daya Ram, a shopkeeper of Lahore, arose and offered himself. He followed behind the Guru to a nearby tent. Guru Gobind Singh emerged alone from the tent with his sword dripping blood and asked for another head. This time Dharam Singh from Hastinapur (today Meerut), presented himself to the Guru following the footsteps of Daya Ram. Guru Gobind Singh repeated the call three times. Three more courageous Sikhs individually answered the Guru's call: Mohkam Chand, a calico printer/tailor from town (now city) Dwarka, Gujarat. Himmat Rai, a water-bearer from town (now city) Puri, Orissa. Sahib Chand, a barber from town (now city) Bidar in Karnataka, each stood up one after another and advanced to offer their heads. These five men were the first Sikhs of the Khalsa as understood in modern parlance and verified written history. Guru Sahib emerges An inscription naming the five members of the Khalsa Panth, at Takht Keshgarh Sahib, the birthplace of Khalsa on Baisakh 1, 1756 Vikram Samvat. Guru Gobind Singh emerged from the tent ‚Äúhand in hand with the five‚Äù, writes Kuir Singh, Gurbilas Patshahi 10. The disciples wore saffron-coloured raiment topped over with neatly tied turbans of the same colour. Guru Gobind Singh, similarly dressed, introduced his chosen Sikhs to the audience as Panj Pyare, the five devoted spirits beloved of the Guru. He then proceeded to perform the ceremony. Filling an iron bowl with clean water, he kept churning it with a khanda, double-edged sword, while reciting the sacred verses. Guru Gobind Singh's wife Mata Sahib Kaur ji brought sugar crystals which were put into the vessel at the Guru's bidding. Sweetness was thus mingled with the alchemy of iron. Amrit, the Nectar of Immortality, was now ready and Guru Gobind Singh gave each of the five Sikhs a palmsful of it to drink. At the end, all five of them drank the remaining elixir from the same steel bowl, binding themselves in new fraternal spiritual ties. Their rebirth into this brotherhood meant the cancellation of their previous family ties, status, caste, occupations which had hitherto determined their place in society, their beliefs and creeds and of the rituals they had so far observed. The five Sikhs formed the nucleus of the self-abnegating, martial and casteless fellowship of the Khalsa which Guru Gobind Singh had brought into being that day. They were given the surname of Singh, meaning lion, and were ever to wear the five emblems of the Khalsa: kesh or unshorn hair and beard; kangha, a comb in the kesh to keep it tidy as opposed to the ascetics/yogis/recluses who kept it matted in token of their having renounced the world; kara, an iron bracelet; kaccha, short breeches worn by soldiers; and kirpan, a sword. They were enjoined to succour the helpless and fight the oppressor, to have faith in One God and to consider all human beings equal, irrespective of caste and creed. The five different castes The episode of sis-bhet, i.e. offering of the heads was recorded by Bhai Kuir Singh in his Gurbilas Patshahi 10 (1751) followed by Bhai Sukkha Singh, Bhai Santokh Singh, and others. Earlier chronicles such as the Sri Gur Sobha, and the Bansavalinama do not narrate it in such detail. Ratan Singh Bhangu, Prachin Panth Prakash, simply says that \\"five Sikhs were selected, one each from the five castes, that they had received instruction at the hands of Guru Gobind Singh, was a devoted disciple and had been in residence at Anandpur long enough to have been affected by its ambience of faith and sacrifice. As they volunteered individually it was a coincidence that they belonged to different castes and to different parts of India. Khanda di Pahul, introduced by Guru Gobind Singh on 30 March 1699, became the established form of initiation for Sikhs for all time to come; so also the institution of the Panj Pyare. In fact, Guru Gobind Singh had himself been initiated by the Panj Pyare as he had initiated them. Since then this has been the custom. Panj Pyare, any five initiated Sikhs reputed to be strictly following the rahit, or Sikh discipline, are chosen to administer to the novitiates amrit, i.e. Khanda di Pahul. Panj Pyare are similarly chosen to perform other important ceremonies such as laying the cornerstone of a gurdwara building or inaugurating kar- seva, i.e. cleansing by voluntary labour of a sacred tank, or leading a religious procession, and to decide issues confronting a local sangat or community as a whole. At crucial moments of history, Panj Pyare have collectively acted as supreme authority, representing the Guru-Panth. During the battle of Chamkaur, it was the last five surviving Sikhs who, constituting themselves into the Council of Five, Panj Pyare, commanded Guru Gobind to leave the fortress and save himself to reassemble the Sikhs. Guru Gobind Singh had abolished the masand system and before he died, he also ended the line of living gurus. In the institution of Panj Pyare, he had created the nucleus of a casteless and democratic continuing society.

Every year at the time of Baisakhi (springtime), thousands of devotees would come to Anandpur to pay their obeisance and seek the Guru's blessings. In early 1699, months before Baisakhi Day, Gobind Rai sent special edicts to congregants far and wide that that year the Baisakhi was going to be a unique affair. He asked them not to cut any of their hair‚Äîto come with unshorn hair under their turbans and chunis, and for the men to come with full beards. On Baisakhi Day, March 30, 1699, hundreds of thousands of people gathered around his divine temporal seat at Anandpur Sahib. The Guru addressed the congregants with a most stirring oration on his divine mission of restoring their faith and preserving the Sikh religion. After his inspirational discourse, he flashed his unsheathed sword and said that every great deed was preceded by equally great sacrifice: He demanded one head for oblation. \\"I need a head\\", he declared. After some trepidation one person offered himself. The Guru took him inside a tent. A little later he reappeared with his sword dripping with blood, and asked for another head. One by one, four more earnest devotees offered their heads. Every time the Guru took a person inside the tent, he came out with a bloodied sword in his hand. Thinking their Guru to have gone berserk, the congregants started to disperse. Then the Guru emerged with all five men dressed in orange suits with a blue bib.(These are the colors of Sikhism). He baptized the five in a new and unique ceremony called pahul, what Sikhs today know as the baptism ceremony called Amrit. Then the Guru asked those five baptized Sikhs to baptize him as well. This is how he became known as Guru Chela both teacher and student. He then proclaimed that the Panj Pyare‚Äîthe Five Beloved Ones‚Äîwould be the embodiment of the Guru himself: \\"Where there are Panj Pyare, there am I. When the Five meet, they are the holiest of the holy.\\" He said whenever and wherever five baptized (Amritdhari) Sikhs come together, the Guru would be present. All those who receive Amrit from five baptized Sikhs will be infused with the spirit of courage and strength to sacrifice. Thus with these principles he established Panth Khalsa, the Order of the Pure Ones. Unique Identity At the same time the Guru gave his new Khalsa a unique, indisputable, and distinct identity. The Guru gave the gift of bana, the distinctive Sikh clothing and headwear. He also offered five emblems of purity and courage. These symbols, worn by all baptized Sikhs of both sexes, are popularly known today as Five Ks: Kesh, unshorn hair this a gift from god. Kangha, the wooden comb it keeps the tangles out of Sikhs hair which shows that god keeps the tangles out of your life. Kara, the iron (or steel) bracelet which has no beginning or end which shows that god has no beginning or end. Kirpan, the sword you only use it to defend others weaker than you. You don't hurt anyone. and Kashera, the underwear worn by Sikhs in battle so they can move freely. By being identifiable, no Sikh could never hide behind cowardice again. Political tyranny was not the only circumstance that was lowering people's morale. Discriminatory class distinctions (--the Indian \\"caste\\" system--) were responsible for the people's sense of degradation. The Guru wanted to eliminate the anomalies caused by the caste system. The constitution of the Panj Pyare was the living example of his dream: both the high and low castes were amalgamated into one. Among the original Panj Pyare, there was one Khatri, shopkeeper; one jatav, farmer one Chhimba, calico printer/tailor; one jheemar, one kumhar, water-carrier; and one Nai, a barber. Further the five were from distant regions - lahore, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat and Karnataka odisha.. He gave the surname of Singh (Lion) to every Sikh and also took the name for himself. From Gobind Rai he became Guru Gobind Singh. He also pronounced that all Sikh women embody royalty, and gave them the surname Kaur (Princess). With the distinct Khalsa identity and consciousness of purity Guru Gobind Singh gave all Sikhs the opportunity to live lives of courage, sacrifice, and equality. The birth of the Khalsa is celebrated by Sikhs every Baisakhi Day on April 13. Baisakhi 1999 marks the 300th anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh's gift of Panth Khalsa to all Sikhs everywhere.

He was born in the first half of the 13th century, at Termini Imerese, the village in Sicily from which he derived his surname. As that village was near Palermo, he is sometimes called Panormitano. The Augustinians believe he was probably born at Tarano (near Rieti and not far north of Rome, Italy). On entering religion he changed his name to Agostino, and later was given the additional name of Novello. Life Matteo's parents, of a noble family originally from Catalonia in Spain, educated him most carefully and had him instructed in all the then known sciences. At the University of Bologna, he earned a doctorate in civil and canon law, and became a professor of law. He worked in the chancery of the Kingdom of Sicily at the court of King Manfred of Sicily.\\"Blessed Clement of Osimo & Augustine of Tarano, priests\\", Order of St. Augustine In this capacity Matteo accompanied the King in the war against Charles I of Anjou, who disputed Manfred's right to the crown of Sicily. In the battle at Benevento, in which Manfred was killed and his army routed, Matteo was wounded and thought to be dead, and so was left on the battlefield among the corpses of other soldiers. Regaining consciousness, Matteo was able to reach his home; however, disillusioned with the world and with the evanescence of all earthly glory, he determined thenceforth to forsake all worldly honors and dignities.L√≥pez Bard√≥n, Tirso. \\"Bl. Agostino Novello.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 1. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 14 Jan. 2014 Rescuing a knight trapped in a ravine Following this decision, Matteo asked for admission as a lay brother into the Order of St. Augustine, and was received in a convent in Sicily. There he took the name Agostino; and there he would live unknown to the world, far from his home and his people, devoted to exercises of piety. He lived there tranquilly until an unforeseen incident brought him once more before the world. The title to some property belonging to the convent was claimed by a local bishop. The Augustinians were represented by a learned lawyer of Siena, Giacomo Pallares, who recognized Agostino as a former colleague. Pallares, lost no time in informing the ecclesiastical authorities of Agostino's identity, advising them to keep no longer in obscurity such a wealth of learning.\\"Blessed Augustine of Tarano\\", Augustinian Friends When Clement of Osimo, General of the Order, heard of this, he compelled Agostino, under obedience, to receive Holy Orders, and brought him to Rome, where Agostino reformed the Constitutions of the Order, Nicholas IV appointed Agostino his confessor and Grand Penitentiary,Silvestrini OSA, P. Bruno. \\"Blessed Agostino Novello\\", Santi e Beati, July 18, 2001 a position which he accepted only under obedience. Agostino was elected prior general in 1298. Despite his attempts to refuse this position he was ordered by the pope to accept. In 1300 he resigned from office and spent the remaining ten years of his life at the hermitage of San Leonardo al Lago. In his retreat near Siena, Agostino not only dedicated himself to the practice of the virtues proper to the religious state, and ministered to the people of the surrounding villages as well as in nearby Siena. He was known and respected for his deep humility and love of contemplation. He played an important role in the founding of Siena‚Äôs hospital of Santa Maria della Scala and composed a set of guidelines for the hospital community. Veneration He died on 19 May 1309/10 at San Leonardo and his relics, originally preserved in the Church of Saint Augustine, Siena, were later translated to Termini Imerese in Sicily, where his statue is found on the fa√ßade of the cathedral. Many of the miracles wrought through the intercession of Blessed Agostino were verified and authenticated. Clement XIII solemnly beatified him in 1761, and Clement XIV authorized his cult on 23 July 1770.

An airfoil that is not cambered is called a symmetric airfoil. The benefits of cambering were discovered and first utilized by George Cayley in the early 19th century. Overview Camber is usually designed into an airfoil to maximize its lift coefficient. This minimizes the stalling speed of aircraft using the airfoil. An aircraft with cambered wings will have a lower stalling speed than an aircraft with a similar wing loading and symmetric airfoil wings. An aircraft designer may also reduce the camber of the outboard section of the wings to increase the critical angle of attack (stall angle) at the wingtips. When the wing approaches the stall this will ensure that the wing root stalls before the tip, giving the aircraft resistance to spinning and maintaining aileron effectiveness close to the stall. Some recent designs use negative camber. One such design is called the supercritical airfoil. It is used for near- supersonic flight and produces a higher lift-to-drag ratio at near supersonic flight than traditional airfoils. Supercritical airfoils employ a flattened upper surface, highly cambered (curved) aft section, and greater leading-edge radius as compared to traditional airfoil shapes. These changes delay the onset of wave drag. Definition Broadly, an airfoil is said to have a positive camber if, as is commonly the case, its upper surface (or in the case of a driving turbine or propeller blade its forward surface) is the more convex. But camber is a complex property that can be more fully characterized by an airfoil's camber line, the curve Z(x) that is halfway between the upper and lower surfaces, and thickness function T(x), which describes the thickness of the airfoils at any given point. Then, the upper and lower surfaces can be defined as follows: : Z_\\\\text{upper}(x)=Z(x)+\\\\frac{1}{2}T(x) : Z_\\\\text{lower}(x)=Z(x)-\\\\frac{1}{2}T(x) Example ‚Äì An airfoil with reflexed camber line An airfoil with reflex camber. An airfoil where the camber line curves back up near the trailing edge is called a reflexed camber airfoil. Such an airfoil is useful in certain situations, such as with tailless aircraft, because the moment about the aerodynamic center of the airfoil can be 0. A camber line for such an airfoil can be defined as follows (note that the lines over the variables indicates that they have been nondimensionalized by dividing through by the chord): : \\\\overline{Z}(x) = a\\\\left[\\\\left(b-1\\\\right){\\\\overline{x}}^3-b{\\\\overline{x}}^2+\\\\overline{x}\\\\right] An airfoil with a reflexed camber line is shown at right. The thickness distribution for a NACA 4-series airfoil was used, with a 12% thickness ratio. The equation for this thickness distribution is: : \\\\overline{T}(x) = \\\\frac{t}{0.2}\\\\left(0.2969\\\\sqrt{\\\\overline{x}}-0.1260\\\\overline{x}-0.3516{\\\\overline{x}}^2+0.2843{\\\\overline{x}}^3-0.1015{\\\\overline{x}}^4\\\\right) Where t is the thickness ratio.

In 1995, Scher and her Pentagram team created promotional campaigns for the Public Theater's production of Savion Glover's Bring in 'da Noise, Bring in 'da Funk that featured the wood typefaces used throughout The Public Theater's identity. Scher was inspired by Rob Ray Kelly's American Wood Types and the Victorian theater's poster when she created the cacophony of disparate wood typefaces, silhouetted photographs and bright flat colors for the theater's posters and billboard. Scher limited her colors to two or three while highlighted the play's title and theater logo that surrounded the tap artist in a typographical be-bop. The design was to appeal to a broad audience from the inner cities to the outer boroughs, especially those who hadn't been attracted to theater.Heller, Steve. \\"Street Theater.\\" Print 50.3 (1996): 29.

Wolfe, The Public's producer and Oskar Eustis, who joined as artistic director during the fiftieth anniversary in 2005, on the development of posters, ads, and distinct identities. As part of the anniversary campaign, the identity was redrawn using the font Akzidenz Grotesk. The word \\"theater\\" was dropped and emphasis was placed on the word \\"public\\". By 2008, the identity was even more definitive as it used a font called Knockout, created by Hoefler & Frere-Jones, which provided affordable and accessible productions.

This laid the foundation for the new overall identity and visual language that came to define the Public Theater for the rest of the decade and beyond. The designs for the Shakespeare in the Park campaign were seen across New York, including buses, subways, kiosks, and billboards. Scher's Shakespeare in the Park campaign had become a seasonal tradition in the city. The identity has progressed over the years, and the Public Theater logo was redesigned in 2005 and 2008. The campaign in 2008 for the productions of Hamlet and Hair utilized the strict 90 degree angles of a De Stijl-inspired grid, a pattern in Manhattan's streetscape.

In 1964, the Franklin Gothic No.2 logotype was originally designed by Ivan Chermayeff. By 2004, Matthew Carter had redrawn a new custom typeface named MoMA Gothic. Although MoMA's core identity is a well developed iconic museum, applications like the web, print, and physical environment have not been unified or visionary like the museum itself. In order to continually carry the spirit of the institution, the museum hired Pentagram to design a more powerful and integrated comprehensive system.\\"New Work: The Museum of Modern Art\\" Pentagram. N.p., n.d. Web. <>. To create a new approach that modernizes the institution's image, Paula Scher designed a complete methodology for the new system to work at any scale, from an exterior banner to a print advertisement in the newspaper. She designed a strong grid to uniform placement of images and types. The artwork is cropped to maximize visual impact,and each quadrant of a page or a banner has a specific function. A particular image is selected as the signature focus for an exhibit and list of upcoming events unrelated to the featured into a text block. The black on white logotype placed in a vertical position whenever is possible and always bleeds off an edge. Julia Hoffman, MoMA's creative Director for Graphic and Advertising, and her internal team have used the new system and brought the system to life in applications from larger banners and subway posters to the website.Wheeler, Alina. Designing Brand Identity: An Essential Guide For The Entire Branding Team. 3rd ed. Hoboken, N.J.: John Wiley & Sons, 2009. Print. The Metropolitan Opera Paula Scher and Julia Hoffman designed the new identity for the Metropolitan Opera. The Metropolitan general manager, Peter Gelb, proposed to rebrand the institution and reach wide audiences like the younger generation who had never set foot inside the opera hall. The identity was set in Baskerville and Avenir and the campaign featured a performance of Madama Butterfly.\\"New Work: The Metropolitan Opera\\" Pentagram. N.p., n.d. The print ad campaign launched on August 20, 2006 and according to Thomas Michel, the Metropolitan's marketing director, it was a successful sales day in the history of the organization. New York City Ballet Paula Scher designed a new identity and promotional campaign for the New York City Ballet, one of the largest and well-known dance companies, founded in 1933 by Lincoln Kirstein and George Balanchine. Scher designed with Lisa Kitchenberg of Pentagram and the NYCB's Luis Bravo, to create an identity that linked the company's legacy and location to a modern and dramatic new aesthetic. The logo was set in the font DIN, which appears slightly stacked on each layer. The palette was composed of black, white and silvery grays, resembling how the buildings of New York appear sometimes. It has a softened transparency and a subtle gradation of color that includes shades of blue blacks, green blacks and red blacks.\\"New Work: New York City Ballet\\" Pentagram. N.p., n.d. Scher also cropped the images of City Ballet dancers to create more tension and drama. The new identity and graphics appeared on bus shelter, subway poster, magazines and newspapers ads, in the company's programs and website, and in environmental graphics at the New York State Theater at Lincoln Center, where the company performs.  Period Equity  Paula Scher worked with associate designer Courtney Gooch to create the identity for Period Equity, a non-profit that is dedicated to providing affordable and safe access to menstrual products in the United States. She worked with Period Equity co-founders, Jennifer Weiss Wolf and Laura Strausfeld, to create the identity. Weiss-Wolf and Strausfeld initially wanted to call their organization \\"Menstrual Equality\\", but Scher saw Period Equity as less off-putting. The term \\"period\\" is more playful than \\"menstrual\\", and allows for more graphic options. When the organization achieves its goal, the name can be shifted to \\"Equity, Period\\". This will allow them to later extend their work beyond menstrual inequality into other issues. Scher used the typeface New Rail Alphabet, designed by Margaret Calvert, for its neutral appearance, but replaced its square-edged punctuation with round. The branding concept puts their wordmark in between two big red dots on a white background. These dots are meant to allude to the idea of periods, but they are used in a clean and modernist style. The identity also uses copy such as \\"Periods are not luxuries. Period.\\" to play with the theme. The identity is serious enough for legal work, but also loud and fun, which is necessary when discussing a topic that is normally stigmatized and seen as not appropriate to discuss in public.  Microsoft: Windows 8 logo  In 2012, Scher created a new logo for Windows 8 that takes the logo back to its roots as a window. The logo re-imagines their older four- colour symbol as a more modern geometric shape. Early in the development process, Scher asked Microsoft, \\"Your name is Windows. Why are you a flag?\\" Although Microsoft's original brand started as a window, its graphic evolved into a flag as computing systems became more powerful. As Scher assumed, the waving flag was most likely the result of comments that a plain window looked too static with severe straight lines. The old logo was flat and drawn in motion, while the new logo can convey actual motion by suggesting dimensionality using lines receding into space. This worked better with the brand, as the name Windows was originally used as a metaphor for seeing into screens. The logo itself is based on classical perspective drawing rather than computerized perspective. The cross bars on the window stay the same size no matter what the size of the logo is, meaning it must be redrawn for each time it increases in size. The focus on the analogy of perspective was used to convey the idea that Microsoft products are tools for individuals to achieve their goals from their own perspective. The logo design is neutral to show that it can work in many situations, and for any user. The new logo is meant to work with the Metro design language of Windows 8. Environmental graphic designs=New Jersey Performing Arts Center In 2000, Paula Scher designed an interior design for the New Jersey Performing Arts Center.

Web.  Achievement First Endeavor Middle School For the Achievement First Endeavor Middle School at Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, a charter school for grades 5 through 8, Scher created a program of environmental graphic that helps school interiors to become a better learning environment. She created a vibrant space with bold typography font of Rockwell and simple paint to change the life of its students. With the help of Rogers Marvel Architects, who designed the school as a refurbishment and expansion of the existing building. The design was based on Endeavor's teaching philosophy and a series of motivational slogans used by its teachers. Scher enlarged these concepts into super-graphics that help define the interior spaces. The graphics appear as an equations form (\\"Education = Choice\\", \\"Education = Freedom\\") in the hallways and quotations running around the wall of gymnasium and staircase, to encourage students to do better and create a unique environment of their own.\\"New Work: Achievement First Endeavor Middle School\\" Pentagram.

She created lines that represented the separation of political allies or borders dividing enemies. Scher created the maps into layers that reference what we think when we think of Japan, Kenya, or the Upper East Side. For instance, The United States (1999) was painted in blocky white print and full with a list of facts that we comprehend when we think about cities. Africa (2003) is represented in a stark black and white palette, hinting at a tortured colonial past. The land of the red rising sun is represented when we think of Japan (2004).Coggins, David. \\"Paula Scher At Maya Stendhal.\\" Art In America 94.4 (2006): 156. Academic Search Complete. Web.

The Maya Stendhal's owner decided to extend the exhibition for four weeks, until January 21. Therefore, Scher decided to produce silk-screened prints of The World that contained large- scale images of cities, states, and continents blanketed with place names and other information. It is full of mistakes, misspellings, and visual allusions to stereotypes of places such as South America, painted with hot colors and has two ovaries on the sides.

He belonged to the Rawal branch of the Guhila dynasty, which ruled from the Chitrakuta fort (modern Chittorgarh). The last ruler of this branch, he was defeated by Alauddin Khalji in 1303 CE. The Rajasthani legends mention him as the Rajput ruler Ratan Singh. A fictionalized version of him appears as Ratan Sen in Malik Muhammad Jayasi's Padmavat. According to this poem, Alauddin attacked Chittorgarh to obtain his beautiful wife Rani Padmini; Alauddin captured the fort after Ratan Sen died in a combat with king Devpal of Kumbhalner; subsequently, Padmini and other women committed Jauhar to protect their honour.

He belonged to the Rawal branch of the family, which ruled from Chitrakuta fort (now known as Chittorgarh). Ratnasimha is attested by the 1302 CE (1359 VS) Dariba temple inscription, which records a gift of 16 drammas (coins) to the temple during his reign. The inscription mentions his title as Maharajakula (which appears as Maharawal in colloquial literature). A few coins issued by Ratnasimha have also been discovered.  Defeat against Alauddin Khalji  In 1303, Alauddin Khalji, the Muslim ruler of the Delhi Sultanate, invaded Chittor. After reaching the foot of the Chittor hill, two wings of his army attacked the fort from two different sides. After two months of unsuccessful siege, the attackers pelted stones on the fort using manjaniqs (mangonels), but still failed to capture the fort. Finally, on 26 August 1303, the invaders managed to enter the fort.  Fate after defeat  According to Amir Khusrau, who claims to have entered the fort with Alauddin, the ruler (\\"Rai\\") of Chittor surrendered to Alauddin. The Delhi Sultan massacred 30,000 other Hindus, but pardoned the ruler and his family. He assigned the fort to his young son Khizr Khan with Malik Shahin as the actual administrator, renamed it to Khizrabad, and then returned to Delhi. Khusrau's account is also corroborated by the 14th century Muslim chroniclers Ziauddin Barani and Isami. Historian Banarsi Prasad Saksena believes that Khusrau's account is correct. Kishori Saran Lal, on the other hand, doubts this account, arguing that it seems improbable that Alauddin spared the life of Chittor's ruler while ordering a massacre of 30,000 other Hindus. The Jain writer Kakka Suri, in his Nabhinandana-Jinoddhara-Prabandha (1336 CE) states: According to historian Dasharatha Sharma, this suggests that the ruler of Chitrakuta (IAST: Citrak≈´·π≠a i.e. Chittor) survived the siege, and corroborates the accounts of the Muslim chroniclers. The earliest Hindu account of the event is the Kumbhalgarh prashasti (eulogistic inscription) of 1460 CE. This inscription was issued by Kumbhakarna of the Guhila family's Rana branch, who were a rival of Ratnasimha's Rawal branch. The inscription states: The inscription mentions the title of Ratnasimha and his predecessors as \\"RƒÅula\\", thus indicating that they belonged to the Rawal branch. However, Lakshmasimha (IAST: Lak·π£masi·πÉha) is explicitly called a \\"MahƒÅrƒÅ·πáƒÅ\\", thus indicating that he belonged to the Rana branch. The word \\"departed\\" (tasmin gate in Sanskrit) in this verse has been variously interpreted as \\"died\\" or \\"deserted the defenders\\". Historian Gaurishankar Hirachand Ojha interpreted this verse to suggest that Ratnasimha bravely fought till death. Some other scholars such as Kalika Ranjan Qanungo and R. B. Haldar also accepted Ojha's translation. However, according to other historians such as Akshay Kirti Vyas and R. C. Majumdar, the verse means that Ratnasimha cowardly fled from the battlefield. Subimal Chandra Datta points out that while describing the death of Lakshmasimha, the inscription states that he \\"departed for heaven\\". But while describing Ratnasimha's departure, it simply mentions that he \\"departed\\". This, combined with the surrender of the \\"Rai\\" described in the Muslim accounts, suggests that Ratnasimha departed from the battlefield and surrendered to Alauddin. The 16th century Padmavat legend claims that Ratnasimha (\\"Ratan Sen\\") died in a combat with the ruler of Kumbhalner, before Alauddin's conquest of the fort. The 17th century chronicler Muhnot Nainsi, who wrote under Rajput patronage, states that Ratnasimha (\\"Ratan Singh\\") died on the battlefield.  The legend of Padmini  A legendary account of Ratan Singh (as Ratan Sen) appears in Malik Muhammad Jayasi's 16th century epic poem Padmavat. According to this account, he married the Sinhala princess Padmini after a quest. Alauddin Khalji invaded Chittor to obtain Padmini, after hearing of her beauty. Ratan Sen was captured by the Delhi forces, but his Rajput warriors rescued him on Padmini's request. While he was in captivity, his Rajput neighbour - Devpal of Kumbhalner - sent a marriage proposal to Padmini. Ratan Sen fought with Devpal to avenge this insult, and the two Rajput kings killed each other in a single combat. Alauddin then invaded Chittor, but before he could capture the fort, Padmini (Padmavati) and other women immolated themselves. Several adaptions of the Padmavat legend appeared in the later years. The 16th century historians Firishta and Haji-ud-Dabir were among the earliest writers to mention Padmini as a historical figure, but their accounts differ with each other and with that of Jayasi. For example, according to Firishta, Padmini was a daughter (not wife) of Ratan Sen. Some other medieval legends written under Rajput patronage state that the contemporary ruler of Chittor was Lakhamsi (Lakshmasimha), and Ratan Sen (Ratnasimha) was his younger brother. Another version, compiled by James Tod, states that Padmini was the wife of Lakhamsi's uncle Bhimsi (Bhimasimha); this version does not mention Ratan Sen at all.  Historicity  Historian Kalika Ranjan Qanungo, in his A Critical Analysis of the Padmini Legend (1960), proposed that there were actually four distinct people with similar names. According to him, the medieval bards confused and linked these four individuals: # Ratnasimha, the Guhila ruler mentioned in the Kumbhalgarh inscription # Ratnasen, mentioned as Ratan Sen in Padmavat; he was actually a ruler of Chitrakoot in modern Uttar Pradesh, not Chittor in Rajasthan # Ratna, the son of Kshema; he and another warrior named Bhimasimha were killed in a battle at the foot of the Chittor hill # Ratnasimha, the son of the Chahamana ruler Hammira. Lakshmasimha, the ruler of Chittor, gave him shelter at Chittor, prompting Alauddin to attack Chittor Other historians, such as Jogendra Prasad Singh (1964) and Ram Vallabh Somani (1976) have criticized Qanungo's theory based on the following points: * The Guhila king Ratnasimha and the Ratan Sen of Padmavat cannot be different persons, given that both are described as kings of Chittor who were defeated by Alauddin Khalji. Jayasi names the father of Ratan Sen as a person other than Samarasimha, but according to Singh this is simply a mistake, resulting from the fact that Jayasi wrote over 200 years later. * Ratan Sen of Padmavat could not have been a king of present-day Uttar Pradesh, because the text explicitly refers to Chittor of Mewar region, describing Kumbhalgarh as its neighbour. * Ratna, the son of Kshema, could not have fought against Alauddin: his death is mentioned in a 1273 CE inscription, while Alauddin ascended the throne only in 1296 CE. There is no evidence that Bhimasimha, the person who died fighting alongside him, is same as the Bhim Singh mentioned in the bardic legends. * It is a mere conjecture that Alauddin attacked Chittor because Lakshmasimha sheltered Hammira's son Ratnasimha. The source for this claim is Surajmal's Va·πÉ≈õabhƒÅskara, which is a 19th-century work based on historically unreliable bardic tales. None of the contemporary sources suggest that Hammira had a son named Ratnasimha. Hammira Mahakavya, the earliest biography of Hammira, states that Hammira appointed his minister Jajadeva as the ruler of his kingdom before marching to the battle with Alauddin. If Hammira had a son, he would have appointed his own son (rather than Jajadeva) as his successor. Moreover, Hammira had invaded Chittor in the past, and the relations between the two kingdoms were not cordial enough for Chittor to grant shelter to Hammira's son. Most modern historians have rejected the authenticity of the Padmini legend.

It contains Jubilee College State Historic Site, a frontier Illinois college active from 1840 to 1862. Jubilee College, and the frontier community that supported it, was founded in 1839 by Episcopal bishop Philander Chase. Earlier in his career Chase had founded Kenyon College in Ohio. This was one of the earliest educational enterprises in Illinois. After the Bishop's death, the college closed in 1862. In 1933 the college and grounds, then consisting of , were presented to the state of Illinois. The site has since been expanded to and includes the original Chase residence and church. The entire Jubilee College site is still owned by the state of Illinois. The college grounds are operated by the Illinois Historic Preservation Agency (IAPA), and the surrounding of open space are operated by the Illinois Department of Natural Resources (DNR). The State of Illinois occasionally offers guided tours of the centerpiece of Jubilee College, the 1840s building that housed the school's Episcopal chapel, classrooms and dormitory facilities. Restored in the 1970s, one wing contains the recreated schoolmaster's office and library, which also features a video theater and museum exhibits about the college. The Jubilee College site was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. Though the state park is still open, the historic site was closed November 30, 2008. Jubilee College State Historic Site, as well as 17 other historic sites and state parks, was closed by former Governor Rod Blagojevich to help close Illinois' multimillion-dollar budget deficit. The park was reopened by Blagojevich's successor, Pat Quinn, but closed again on October 9, 2009. However, the natural area surrounding the historic site, Jubilee College State Park contains multi-use trails maintained by volunteer user groups. The trails were originated by equestrians but are shared with hikers and mountain bikers. The state park also contains various camping areas, for which reservations are suggested.

It was printed in 1470 by the press established in Paris by Johann Heynlin. Johann Heynlin, variously spelled Heynlein, Henelyn, Henlin, H√©lin, Hemlin, Hegelin, Steinlin; and translated as Jean √† Lapide, Jean La Pierre (Lapierre, de la Pierre), Johannes Lapideus, Johannes Lapidanus, Johannes de Lapide (c. 1425 - 12 March 1496) was a German-born scholar, humanist and theologian, who introduced the first printing press in France (Paris) in 1470. Born in Stein, near Pforzheim, in Baden-W√ºrttemberg, Heynlin may have been of Swabian origin. (From Stein, meaning \\"stone\\" in German, are derived his translated Latinized surnames Lapideus or a Lapideand Gallicized surname La Pierre.) On the completion of his academic studies in Germany, presumably at Leipzig and Freiburg, he proceeded to Paris to pursue the study of philosophy and theology. In Paris, he came in contact with the foremost representatives of Realism, who, recognizing Heynlin's abilities and probable future influence, exerted their powers to the utmost to mould his mind after their own and thus make him like themselves a bitter opponent of Nominalism. Their efforts were successful. In 1464, Heynlin went to the University of Basel and applied for admission to the professorial faculty of arts. The old controversy regarding the nature of Universals had not yet subsided, and in the university of Basel Nominalism held sway. Hence in view of this and the maintenance of peace within the institution, the admission of Heynlin to the faculty was not accomplished without a most vigorous opposition. Once a member of the faculty, he hoped to rid it of all Nominalistic tendencies, nor was he disappointed in his expectation. In 1465, he became dean of the faculty of arts and in this capacity he revised the university statutes and thus brought about a firmly established curriculum of studies. In 1466, he returned to Paris, obtained the doctorate in theology, was in 1469 elected rector of the university and became professor of theology at the Sorbonne.  Heynlin's printing press  Heynlin's most noteworthy achievement was the establishment of the first printing-press in Paris. Heynlin worked closely with Guillaume Fichet (1433-ca. 1480), another professor at the Sorbonne, who had also come from abroad: from Le Petit- Bornand-les-Gli√®res, in Savoy. Heynlin brought Swiss workmen to install this press in the buildings of the Sorbonne at the end of 1469 or the beginning of 1470: Ulrich Gering (or Guerinch or Guernich) (1445-1510), Michael Friburger and Martin Crantz (or Krantz). Ulrich Gering may have come from M√ºnster in the canton of Aargau, Friburger from Colmar and Crantz may have also come from M√ºnster or Strasbourg. Heynlin gave valuable pecuniary aid to their undertakings, especially for the printing of the works of the Church Fathers. King Louis XI granted letters of naturalization to all three workmen in 1475. Their first publication with this press, and the first book printed in France, was a collection of letters by the fifteenth century grammarian Gasparinus de Bergamo (Gasparino Barzizza). The Epistolae Gasparini Pergamensis (1470) were intended to provide an exemplar for students for the writing of artful and elegant Latin. Their second work was a translation of Sallust (1470-1471), the third the Orationes of Bessarion (1471), and the fourth was Fichet's own Rhetorica in 1471. The number of the works which they published from 1470 to 1472 amounts to some thirty works. At the end of 1472 or at the beginning of 1473, Heynlin and Fichet left the Sorbonne to settle on Rue Saint-Jacques. Two of their apprentices, Pierre de Kaysere (Petrus Caesaris) and Jean Stoll, established around the same time and on the same street their own competing printing press, with the emblem of the Soufflet-Vert.  Other activities  The German humanist Johann Reuchlin attached himself to Heynlin, whom he followed to the young University of Basel in 1474. In 1478, he was called to teach theology in the newly founded University of T√ºbingen, where his learning, eloquence and reputation secured for him the same year the rectorship. The opposition, however, he met from the Nominalists Gabriel Biel, Paul Scriptoris, and others, rendered his service here of short duration. He severed his connexion with the university, proceeded to Baden-Baden and thence to Berne, where he engaged in preaching. Dissatisfied with Berne, he returned to Basel, and tired of wandering, he entered in 1487 the Carthusian monastery of St. Margarethenthal to spend his declining years in prayer and literary work.

The Capability Maturity Model is a five point scale of capability in an organization, ranging from random processes at level 1 to fully defined, managed and optimized processes at level 5. The ability of an organization to carry out its mission on time and within budget is claimed to improve as the CMM level increases. The \\"Capability Im-Maturity Model\\" asserts that organizations can and do occupy levels below CMM level 1. An original article by Capt. Tom Schorsch USAF as part of a graduate project at the Air Force Institute of TechnologyT. Schorsch, \\"The Capability Im-Maturity Model (CIMM)\\", U.S. Air Force (CrossTalk Magazine), 1996. provides the definitions for CIMM. He cites Prof. Anthony Finkelstein's ACM paperA. Finkelstein, A Software Process Immaturity Model, SIGSOFT Software Engineering Notes, 1992. as an inspiration. The article describes situations that arise in dysfunctional organizations. Such situations are reportedly common in organizations of all kinds undertaking software development, i.e. they are really characterizations of the management of specific projects, since they can occur even in organizations with positive CMM levels. Kik Piney, citing the original authors, later adapted the model to a somewhat satirical version that attracted a number of followers who felt that it was quite true to their experience. Capability Immaturity Model levels Finkelstein defined levels 0 (foolish), -1 (stupid) and -2 (lunatic). Schorsch changed the names and added level -3. Piney's structure, truer to the original, uses the terms incompetent, obstructive, antagonistic and psychotic. 0 : Negligent The organization pays lip service, often with excessive fanfare, to implementing engineering processes, but lacks the will to carry through the necessary effort. Whereas CMM level 1 assumes eventual success in producing work, CIMM level 0 organizations generally fail to produce any product, or do so by abandoning regular procedures in favor of crash programs. -1 : Obstructive Processes, however inappropriate and ineffective, are implemented with rigor and tend to obstruct work. Adherence to process is the measure of success in a Level -1 organization. Any actual creation of viable product is incidental. The quality of any product is not assessed, presumably on the assumption that such assessment is unnecessary since if the proper process is followed, high quality is guaranteed. This is the most common level achieved by most organizations that pursue CMM ratings. However, Level -1 organizations believe fervently in following defined procedures, but lacking the will to measure the effectiveness of the procedures they rarely succeed at their basic task of creating work. Unfortunately, this behavior is inherent in the CMMI evaluation process. Since many government agencies will only award contracts over a certain monetary value to organizations that can pass a CMMI-3 or higher SCAMPI appraisal, management may be willing to accept inefficiencies to win these lucrative contracts. Government contracting models in which organizations are paid not for the value of their products but by the number of hours spent building them reward organizations for performing non- value-added activities related to CMMI compliance. Thus, government contractors with CMMI ratings may be more profitable than non-CMMI rated companies regardless of the quality of the work they produce. -2 : Contemptuous The organization‚Äôs ineffectiveness has become apparent to the marketplace or the larger organization, which ignores or attempts to neutralize these unfavorable perceptions. Measurements are fudged to make the organization look good. Measures of activity (bugs fixed, lines of code written, hours worked) replace measures of productivity (% functions completed, test success rates). Volatility in specifications and schedules is recast as evidence of organizational ‚Äúagility.‚Äù Certifications on ‚Äúbest processes‚Äù are presented as evidence that the organization is performing optimally; poor results are blamed on factors outside the organization's control. The processes chosen typically omit or shortcut essential components of recognized methods (e.g. ‚Äú6-week Six-Sigma‚Äù or ‚ÄúLean CMM‚Äù), which are flexible and can cover both good and bad practices. The organization becomes committed to ineffective processes, leading to a feedback cycle of increasing disorganization. -3 : Undermining Undermining organizations routinely work to downplay and sabotage the efforts of rival organizations, especially those successfully implementing processes common to CMM level 2 and higher. This behavior may involve competing for scarce resources, drawing those resources from more effective departments or organizations.

The website, which primarily started as a directory of cheaper alternatives to 0870 numbers (hence the name), also lists geographic-rate (01, 02 or 03) or free-to-caller (080) alternatives for 0843, 0844, 0845, 0871, 0872, and 0873 revenue-share numbers. The vast majority of telephone numbers are submitted by visitors to the website, but the discussion board also offers a place for visitors to request alternative telephone numbers if they are not included in the database. Some companies that advertise a non-geographic number will also offer a number for calling from abroad - usually starting +44 1 or +44 2 - this number can be used within the UK (removing the +44 and replacing it with 0) to avoid the cost of calling non-geographic telephone numbers. Some companies will also offer a geographic alternative if asked.  Motivations behind the website  * Organisations using 084, 087 and 09 non-geographic telephone numbers (except for 0870 numbers from 1 August 2009 to 1 July 2015) automatically impose a Service Charge on all callers. Calls to 01, 02 and 03 numbers, standard 07 mobile numbers and 080 numbers do not attract such an additional charge. * The revenue derived from the Service Charge is used by the call recipient to cover the call handling and call routing costs incurred at their end of the call. Any excess is paid out under a \\"revenue share\\" agreement or may be used as a contribution towards meeting other expenses such as a lease for switchboard equipment. * Non-geographic telephone numbers beginning 084 and 087 have increasingly been employed for inappropriate uses such as bookings, renewals, refunds, cancellations, customer services and complaints, and for contacting public services including essential health services. * Most landline providers offer 'inclusive' calls of up to one hour to standard telephone numbers (those beginning with 01, 02 or 03), while calls to 084 and 087 numbers are usually chargeable. * Mobile telephones on a contract offer hundreds of minutes per month of 'inclusive' calls to standard telephone numbers, while calls to 084 and 087 telephone numbers are always chargeable. * Calls to most 084 and 087 non-geographic telephone numbers are generally not included in bundled minutes from landlines and even less so from mobile telephones. However, a small number of landline providers do include 0870 and a smaller number include 0845 telephone numbers in some of their call packages. * Calls to 084 and 087 non- geographic telephone numbers have a much larger Access Charge if called from a mobile telephone, than if called from a landline, making the call price from mobile telephones excessive. * Before 1 July 2015, calls to 0800 and 0808 numbers were chargeable when called from most contract and pay-as-you-go mobile telephones. Calls to 0500 numbers remained chargeable from mobile telephones. until closure of this range on 3 June 2017.

It helps to detect bacteria in the body by binding lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP). CD14 exists in two forms, one anchored to the membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol tail (mCD14), the other a soluble form (sCD14). Soluble CD14 either appears after shedding of mCD14 (48 kDa) or is directly secreted from intracellular vesicles (56 kDa). The x-ray crystal structure of human CD14 (4GLP.pdb) reveals a monomeric, bent solenoid structure containing a hydrophobic amino-terminal pocket. CD14 was the first described pattern recognition receptor.  Function  CD14 acts as a co- receptor (along with the Toll-like receptor TLR 4 and MD-2) for the detection of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). CD14 can bind LPS only in the presence of lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP). Although LPS is considered its main ligand, CD14 also recognizes other pathogen-associated molecular patterns such as lipoteichoic acid. Signaling pathway of toll-like receptors. Dashed grey lines represent unknown associations Tissue distribution CD14 is expressed mainly by macrophages and (at 10-times lesser extent) by neutrophils. It is also expressed by dendritic cells. The soluble form of the receptor (sCD14) is secreted by the liver and monocytes and is sufficient in low concentrations to confer LPS-responsiveness to cells not expressing CD14. mCD14 and sCD14 are also present on enterocytes. Reference 12 is incomplete. sCD14 is also present in human milk, where it is believed to regulate microbial growth in the infant gut. Differentiation CD14+ monocytes can differentiate into a host of different cells, including dendritic cells, a differentiation pathway encouraged by cytokines, including GM-CSF and IL-4.

The paper aimed for an upper- class readership made up largely of sportsmen. The Spirit also included humorous material, much of it based on experience of settlers near the southwestern frontier.Grammer 370. Theatre news was a third important component. The Spirit had an average circulation of about 22,000,Oriard 289 note 3. with a peak of about 40,000 subscribers.Gorn 67. Life of the paper William T. Porter William T. Porter and his brothers started the Spirit of the Times in 1831. They sought an upper-class readership, stating in one issue that the Spirit was \\"designed to promote the views and interests of but an infinitesimal division of those classes of society composing the great mass . . . . \\"Quoted in Gorn 67. They modeled the paper on Bell's Life in London, a high-class English journal. Subscriptions rose from $2 to $5 in 1836, followed in 1839 by another rise to $10.Yates, 31. Editorial policies forbade any discussion of politics in the paper so as to avoid alienating any potential readers. Nevertheless, some writers managed to have material printed that showed favoritism, typically toward the Whigs.Flora and MacKethan 845-6. The biggest breach of the 'no politics' rule came in 1842, after the publication of Dickens's inflammatory American Notes. A wave of anti-British, anti- imperialist articles followed.Especially Spirit of the Times, 26 November 1842, 3 December 1842, 4 March 1843. By 1839, the Spirit was the most popular sporting journal in the United States.Sloan 199. This allowed the Porters to buy their main rival, the American Turf Register and Sporting Magazine. By 1856, all of the Porter brothers were dead except William. The paper split at some point, one branch called the Spirit of the Times, the other Porter's Spirit of the Times. Porter died in 1858, and circulation of the two papers suffered. After the papers remerged in 1861, George Wilkes bought the enterprise and tried to keep it profitable. In 1878, William B. Curtis became the new editor and helped propagate the journal's elitism by refusing to cover sporting events that were not sanctioned by amateur organizations, which had rigid admission requirements. Sports writing By the 1850s, the Spirit covered angling, baseball, cricket, foot racing, fox hunting, horse racing, rowing, and yachting;Isenberg 92. boxing followed later in the decade. Porter printed all sorts of statistics, presaging the American sports obsession with such trivia. The paper helped to standardize horse racing by publishing horse weights, suggested betting practices, and offering efficient track management techniques. Under Wilkes, the Spirit began covering football more extensively than any previous publication. Football coverage in the Spirit quickly outstripped the same in the paper's main rivals, the New York Clipper and the National Police Gazette.Oriard 138. The paper covered college games first; in 1882, football got its own section. This coverage expanded again in 1892. Under Curtis, who was a devotee of speed skating, developments in local and international speed-skating were covered and Curtis compiled lists of skating records. A prominent contributing writer in the 1870s was cowboy, frontier scout, and stage star Texas Jack Omohundro. Texas Jack's contributions included a lengthy write-up of his experiences as a cow-boy on the Chisholm Trail, hunting buffalo with the Pawnee people, and hunting elk in the Bighorns and Wind River ranges of Wyoming, and deer hunting in Florida. Theatre writing The early Spirit covered goings on at all of New York's playhouses. Jacksonian entertainment was stratifying by class, however, and the Spirit quickly relegated most of its coverage to the Park Theatre.Cockrell 28. Any coverage of the Bowery or Chatham Garden theatres was negative from about 1832 on. Porter wrote in 1840 that the \\"Bowery, . . . is to be transmogrified into a Circus shortly, the 'Bowery boys' having lost their taste for the illegitimate drama, and they never had any other.\\"September 26, 1840. Spirit of the Times. Quoted in Cockrell 33. Emphasis in the original. He visited the Bowery on a few other occasions, and his reviews on it are full of mockery and derision: > By reasonable computation there were about 300 persons on the stage and > wings alone‚Äîsoldiers in fatigue dresses‚Äîofficers with side arms‚Äîa few jolly > tars, and a number of \\"apple-munching urchins.\\" The scene was indescribably > ludicrous. Booth played [Richard III] in his best style, and was really > anxious to make a hit, but the confusion incidental to such a crowd on the > stage, occasioned constant and most humorous interruptions. It was every > thing or any thing, but a tragedy. In the scene with Lady Anne, a scene so > much admired for its address, the gallery spectators amused themselves by > throwing pennies and silver pieces on the stage, which occasioned an immense > scramble among the boys, and they frequently ran between King Richard and > Lady Anne, to snatch a stray copper.

(December 1, 1832). Spirit of the > Times. Quoted in Cockrell 31-2. Humor writing William Porter relied on amateur correspondents to cover sporting events across the United States. By the end of the 1830s, these writers had begun to submit fiction as well, including horse-racing fiction, hunting fiction, and tall tales. The paper thus served as an early outlet for many American authors. Among the Spirit's correspondents who would go on to literary careers were George Washington Harris (who used the pseudonyms 'Sugartail' and 'Mr. Free'), Johnson Jones Hooper, Henry Clay Lewis, Alexander McNutt, Thomas Bangs Thorpe, and Jonathan Falconbridge Kelly. Many contributed anonymously, as writing was not always seen as a respectable profession.Flora and MacKethan 845.Rickels 65. As these humor segments grew more popular, Porter sought out new writers. Among the humorists he published were Joseph Glover Baldwin, Augustus Baldwin Longstreet, and William Tappan Thompson. Many of these writers concentrated on Southwestern humor, that is, humor relating to Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, and Tennessee.Flora and MacKethan 350. Porter edited two anthologies of the Spirit's humorous contributions. The Big Bear of Arkansas (named for a popular sketch) was published in 1845; A Quarter Race in Kentucky (so titled for the same reason) followed in 1847. The Spirit's success prompted other papers, such as the New Orleans Picayune and the St. Louis Reveille, to begin running humor pieces in the 1840s.Flora and MacKethan 931. Character types such as the frontiersman and the riverboatsman became common fixtures of American fiction and drama. NotesReferences * Cockrell, Dale (1997).

It was the first Koodiyattam performance outside Kerala. Mani Madhava Chakyar as Ravana, Mani Neelakandha Chakyar as Hanuman, Mani Damodara Chakyar as Vibhishana & PK.G Nambiar as Shankukarna. In 1949 he performed Chakyar Koothu for All India Radio, which was the first time the art was performed outside Koothambalam. In 1955, under his leadership, Kutiyattam was performed outside the temple for the first time in his village at Killikkurussimangalam. For performing the art forms outside the temples he faced lot of objections from the Chakyar community. In an interview, he remembered In 1962, under the leadership of V. Raghavan- an art and Sanskrit scholar - Sanskrit Ranga of Madras invited Chakyar to perform Kutiyattam there. This was the first time Kutiyattam was performed outside Kerala by his troupe. Ananda Kentish Coomaraswamy and Venkateswarier Subramaniam, \\"The Sacred and the Secular in India's Performing Arts: Ananda K. Coomaraswamy Centenary Essays\\"(1980), Ashish Publishers, p. 150. They performed at Madras on three nights, showing Kutiyattam scenes from three plays: Abhi·π£eka, SubhadrƒÅdhana√±jaya and NƒÅgƒÅnda. Chakyar's performance made great impact on the people and art critics so that the artform and Chakyar himself became known outside Kerala. He was then invited to perform Kutiyattam at various places in North India during 1964, such as New Delhi and Banaras. After Chakyar's first tour to New Delhi, he was awarded the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award in 1964 for his contributions to Chakyar Koothu and Kutiyattam. This was his first national recognition. He performed Kudiyattam all over India and popularised the same. He along with his troop did Koodiyattam performance in places like Madras (1962, 1973 & 1977), Madhura (1962), New Delhi (1964, 1966, 1974, 1979 & 1983), Varanasi (1964 & 1979), Bombay (1973 & 1977), Ujjain (1982), Bhopal (1987) etc. The President of India, Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, invited him to perform Kutiyattam at Rashtrapati Bhavan in 1964 and was impressed by his exceptional acting skill. His Kutiyattam performances, lectures and demonstrations at well-known centres such as the Madras Music Academy, the International Centre for Kathakali in New Delhi, the Experimental Theatre in New Delhi and Bombay and the National Centre for the Performing Arts in Bombay brought him wide popularity and recognition.

He along with his troupe performed these Kutiyattams all over India. When his guru, Rama Varma Parikshith Thampuran, wrote a new Sanskrit champu prabandha called PrahlƒÅdacharita and requested senior artists to study and perform the same on the Chakyar Koothu stage, they said it was impossible for them to stage such a new prabandha. Then Thampuran asked Chakyar, who was then a comparatively young artist, to try. He agreed and studied a part of the prabandha within one night and performed the same on the next day at Tripunithura ‚Äì the then capital of Cochin state (1962). The incident made the scholars to accept his mastery over both Sanskrit and the classical art form. After some months, he performed entire PrahlƒÅdacharita at the same stage. He performed Chakyar Koothu and Koodiyattam for All India Radio and Doordarshan for the first time, which helped to attract thousands of listeners to these traditional art forms. It was he who started demonstrations in Kudiyattam to popularise the same. Teaching Guru Mani Madhava Chakyar performing Chakyar Koothu He is considered the greatest guru of Kutiyattam of the modern times, producing many accomplished disciples. He taught Koodiyattam for the first time to a non-Chakyar ‚Äì Nambiar caste member. He was a Polish student named Maria Christopher ByrskiHe later became Polish Government Ambassador to India. Now at Warsaw University. He has written numerous articles about Sanskrit drama traditions, and Kutiyattam (currently at Department of Indology, Warsaw University), who was then a research student at Banaras Hindu University, came to study the only surviving ancient Sanskrit drama Koodiyattam, from Guru around the early 1960s. He stayed at Guru Mani Madhava Chakyar's home and studied Koodiyattam in its traditional Gurukula way. Lot of research scholars came to study the Sanskrit drama from the ultimate exponent of Kutiyattam and Abhinaya Mani Madhava Cakyar. Dr. Farley Richmond (University of Georgia, USA), noted Sanskrit drama scholar also studied about the ancient Sanskrit art form under Mani Madhava Chakyar by staying at his home at Killikkurussimangalam. He had filmed Rasa Abhinaya and Kutiyattam of the maestro. Kamaladevi Chattopadhyay of All-India Handicrafts Board came to Guru Maani Madhava Cakyar's home to do research about the costumes used in Kutiyattam (AhƒÅryƒÅbhinaya) (1967). Indian theatre scholar Goverdhan Panjal (National School of Drama) studied about Koothambalams and Kutiyattam under the Guru (1975). When Kerala Kalamandalam (a school for the performing arts) was founded by Vallathol Narayana Menon, he invited authority of Rasa-abhinaya, Mani Madhava Chakyar as the master trainer for Rasa-abhinaya to the Kathakali students. Later Kathakali Yogam- Katathandu, Kerala Kalamandalam, PSV Natyasangham- Kottakkal and Gandhi Seva Sadanam Kathakali Academy- Perur used his services as visiting professor of Rasa-abhinaya and taught advanced students in Kathakali and Kutiyattam.Gurus, Perur Gandhi seva Sadanam He is known as ‚Äúthe master who gave eyes to Kathakali‚Äù. His influence on the classical performing arts of Kerala is famous.

After Guru's death it was named as Padmasree Mani Madhava Chakyar Smaraka Gurukulam in memory of the Guru. This institution still keeps its tradition and plays a major role in Kutiyattam teaching, revival and performance. Guru, who had dedicated his life to Kutiyattam was concerned about the fate of this classical art form.

His first major recognition came from HH Bhattan Thampurangreatest Sanskrit scholar of Kerala in this century (Bhatta Raja) of Kodungallur Kovilakam himself at the age of 22. Bhattan Thampuran awarded him with a Mudramothiram (signed ring) (1921). Mani Madhava Chakyar considered this Mudramothiram as the prestigious award that he ever got.K. A. Chandrahasan, In pursuit of excellence (Performing Arts), \\"The Hindu\\", Sunday 26 March 1989 He received the most prestigious sacred Vƒ´rasringhala or Veerashringhala (It's a kind of Golden Bracelet, given to the greatest artist/scholar of that era) from Taliparamba Rajarajeshwara Temple (1923). He is the youngest one to receive this award, which is being given to the scholars of the supreme rank, only by the unanimous approval of a special body of temple consisting of eminent scholars. Till date no one else has received a Veerashringhala from there after Mani Madhava Chakyar.Scholars Honored Best Namboodiri Site Another major Vƒ´rasringhalas that he received are; from Valiya Thampuran of Kottakkal Kovilakam (1952), from Urpassikkavu of Thalassery, from Jagadguru Shri Shankaracharya of Kanchi Kamakoti Peetham (1961), from Samoothiri Raja of Kozhikode, given at the eve of Koodiyattam performance at Guruvayur Sree Krishna Temple (1964) and from Tripunithura Kovilakam (1989). He was honoured with ponnada (a kind of silk cloth given as a gesture of honour and respect) from Maharani (Queen) Of Travancore, presented through Mahakavi Ulloor S. Parameswara Iyer at Vaikom Mahadeva Temple. He was honoured by HH. Rajah of Palakkad with a Keshabharam KireetamKind of Crown used in Kutiyattam. See the crown in :Image:Mani Madhava Chakyar as Ravana.jpg at Hemambika Temple of Kallekkulangara (1962). He has received Gold Medals from Valiya Raja of Katathanadu, Pallikkunnu Bhagavathy Temple of Kannoor, Avittathur (1962), Delhi Experimental theatre (1964) etc. In 1930, he was awarded the title NƒÅtyƒÅchƒÅrya (Guru of Natya) by Kadathanadu Valiya Thampuran (Raja of Kadathanadu). He received the title Vid≈´shakaratna, again from the Taliparamba Rajarajeshwara Temple (1954) for his excellence in performing ‚Äúvid≈´shaka‚Äù in Koodiyattams. He was honoured by Fine Arts Society of Kochi by giving the title Anushtanakalapravina. Government of India conferred Padma Shri (1974) and Emeritus Fellowship (1982) on him. He was conferred by an honorary degree from Banaras Hindu University in 1964.

This work is being used as a reference by scholars and students. Natyakalpadrumam deals with all aspects of Koodiyattam in a scientific and critical manner. This book is considered the encyclopaedia of Koodiyattam. It won the prestigious Kerala Sahitya Academi Award (1976).see section Miscellaneous This book is translated into Hindi by Sangeet Natak Akademi of New Delhi. One of his other book is Matha Vilasam (Mattavilasam 1968), the choreography and play part ( actor's manual ‚Äì Attaprakara) used in Mattavilasaprahasana Kudiyattam. He wrote the Attaprakaras of Abhij√±ƒÅna≈õƒÅkuntala, SwapnavƒÅsavadatta, Vikramorva≈õƒ´ya, MƒÅlavikƒÅgnimitra, PancharƒÅtra and Nagananda (Not published). His biography (in Malayalam), Mani Madhaveeyam (1999) was published by Department of Cultural Affairs Publications of the Government of Kerala.Publications of Dept. of Culture, Kerala Govt. First published as a series in the Malayalam weekly ‚Äì Kalakaumudi in 1991 The book gives the picture of astonishing accomplishing and momentous life of the Guru. It gives an excellent account of his struggles and his lifelong devotion towards the art form. The book includes Guru's memoirs of his illustrious stage life spanning about 80 golden years. Book contains a lot of rare photos giving us an insight to maestro's both personal and theatre life. Guru has written articles in various journalsMani Madhava Chakyar, \\"The Training Methods of Kudiyattam\\", Sangeet Natak, (special issue), no. 111-1141971.\\"Mani Madhava Chakyar\\". Kalamandalam Annual. 33‚Äì34. and presented number of papers in conferences on various aspects of Koodiyattam, Abhinaya, Raagas, Natyasastra, Chakyar Koothu, RasƒÅbhinaya in Kathakali etc. Films and documentaries There are several films and documentaries featuring Chakyar's Rasa-Abhinaya, Koodiyattam performances and life. * Mani Madhava Chakyar: The Master at Work (1994, English, Kavalam Narayana Panikar, Central Sangeet Natak Academy, New Delhi) is a biographical film on the life and work of Chakyar. The film contains an interview with Chakyar where he explains the difficulty he had to face from hardliners when he took the traditional art forms outside temple for the first time in 1949. The film contains a session focussed on Rasa abhinaya by Chakyar, where he enacts various Rasas. * Parvati Viraham: Mani Madhava Chakyar as Ravana (1993, English, Central Sangeet Natak Academy, New Delhi) features Chakyar as Ravana in the PƒÅrvatƒ´ Viraham (separation of PƒÅrvatƒ´) in Koodiyattam form. It shows the PƒÅrvatƒ´ Viraham part of the Ascharyachodamani Kutiyattam and includes the Pakarnnattam abhinaya. * Manifestations of Shiva (1980, English, Malcolm Leigh & Stella Kramrisch, Philadelphia Museum of Art, Asia Society, USA) is a critically acclaimed documentary film; wherein Chakyar has performed as Lord Siva in Classical Indian dance form. * Kutiyattam - Sanskrit Theater of India (2002, English, Multimedia CD, Farley Richmond (University of Georgia), The University of Michigan Press, USA) contains rare videos of Chakyar's Rasa Abhinaya including glimpses of his Netrabhinaya. The CD also contains the audios of recital of Shlokas and play parts by him. * Kudiattam (1986, Hindi, Prakash Jha, India) features Chakyar's abhinaya and shows him explaining the concepts of Kutiyattam and its abhinaya techniques. It also features him teaching etc. This film has won Indian government's National Film Award for Best Arts/Cultural Film (1987). * Mani Madhava Chakkiar (1977, English, Classic Films)\\"Mani Madhava Chakkiar\\", Classic Films, CS Krishnakumar, IA Iqbal is a documentary film about Chakyar. It shows his Abhinaya in different Kutiyattams, his Chakyar Koothu performance etc. It also gives a picture of his personal life. * Guru Mani Madhava Chakyar (2009, Malayalam, Krishnan Unni, Govt. of Kerala) is a documentary about the guru. This project is by Information and Public Relations Dept. of Govt. of Kerala as part of capturing the eminent personalities in Kerala and to highlight their contribution to the State. * Prahladacharitham Chakyar Koothu (1986, audio, Harisree Audios, Kerala) features Chakyar Koothu performance of the prabandha PrahlƒÅdacharita, giving a glimpse into Chakyar's ability in narration and recital. It is unique because he did not perform PrahlƒÅdacharita after the death of his guru, Thampuran, in 1964, except for this recording. Many of his Koodiyattam, Chakyar Koothu performances, demonstrations, interviews etc. were documented by Doordarshan centres of New Delhi, Bombay, Bhopal, Madras, Thiruvananthapuram etc. and All India Radio and is still being broadcast all over India. Documentation of Guru's Kutiyattam performance by Doordarshan Centre Bombai with English commentary of art critic and scholar V. K Narayana Menon is widely acclaimed. Death and legacy The memorial to the Guru at his residence, that marks the spot of his cremation. Chakyar died at the age of 90 on 14 January 1990 in a private hospital at Ottappalam due to natural causes. His body was cremated with full honours at his Killikkurussimangalam residence. There is a memorial at the spot of his cremation. His birth and death anniversaries are celebrated by various cultural programmes, commemorative sessions and Kutiyattam festivals by various cultural organisations and institutes. He is one of the most felicitated artist from Kerala and was the first recipient of all major awards for Chakyar Koothu and Koodiyattam. Kerala Sangeet Natak Academy's annual Koodiyattam Award is known as Maani Madhava Puraskaram as a tribute to him. Many of Chakyar's films are still screened regularly at art theatres across and outside India. His Kutiyattam and Chakyar Koothu performances and other documentaries are broadcast from major Doordarshan and All India Radio stations regularly (Guru himself had initiated performance of these art forms for these media for the first time). Art and cultural festivals are organised by various associations as a dedication to Chakyar regularly.

The Corey-Kim oxidation Although the Corey-Kim oxidation possesses the distinctive advantage over Swern oxidation of allowing an operation above ‚Äì25 ¬∞C, it is not so commonly used due to issues with selectivity in substrates susceptible to chlorination by N-chlorosuccinimide. Reaction mechanism Dimethyl sulfide (Me2S) is treated with N-chlorosuccinimide (NCS), resulting in formation of an \\"active DMSO\\" species that is used for the activation of the alcohol. Addition of triethylamine to the activated alcohol leads to its oxidation to aldehyde or ketone and generation of dimethyl sulfide. In variance with other alcohol oxidation using \\"activated DMSO,\\" the reactive oxidizing species is not generated by reaction of DMSO with an electrophile. Rather, it is formed by oxidation of dimethyl sulfide with an oxidant (NCS). The reaction mechanism of Corey‚ÄìKim oxidation Under Corey-Kim conditions allylic and benzylic alcohols have a tendency to evolve to the corresponding allyl and benzyl chlorides unless the alcohol activation is very quickly followed by addition of triethylamine.

A torque limiter may limit the torque by slipping (as in a friction plate slip-clutch), or uncouple the load entirely (as in a shear pin). The action of a torque limiter is especially useful to limit any damage due to crash stops and jams. Torque limiters may be packaged as a shaft coupling or as a hub for sprocket or sheave. A torque limiting device is also known as an overload clutch. Disconnect types Disconnect types will uncouple the drive, with little or no residual torque making its way to the load. They may reset automatically or manually Shear pin A shear pin type sacrifices a mechanical component, the pin, to disconnect the shafts. The use of shear pins has been well known for since the early 20th century.A. L. De Leeuw, Methods of machine tool design, American Machinist Vol. 57, No. 11 (Sept. 14, 1922); page 402. First invented by Howdon Torque Limiters in 1978. Their design patent GB1520416 (A) incorporated one or more shear pins extending between two fixing blocks detachably secured one to each of the two rotary members. Howdon also had the US Patent US3973412 (A). Patent GB1520416 (A) - TORQUE-LIMITING COUPLINGS Howdon still produce torque limiters in the UK today from their factory in Stroud Gloucestershire. Synchronous magnetic A synchronous magnetic torque limiter uses permanent magnets mounted to each shaft, with an air gap between. They are very fast acting, but may have more backlash than mechanical types. Because there is no mechanical contact between the two shafts, they are also used to transmit torque through a physical barrier like a thin plastic wall. On some models, the torque limit may be adjusted by changing the gap between the magnets. Ball detent A ball detent type limiter transmits force through hardened balls which rest in detents on the shaft and are held in place with springs. An over-torque condition pushes the balls out of their detents, thereby decoupling the shaft. It can have single or multiple detent positions, or a snap acting spring which requires a manual reset. There may be a compression adjustment to adjust the torque limit. Many cordless drills incorporate this type of torque limiter in a planetary gearset. It may be a part of an assembly of multiple gearsets used to primarily reduce speed and multiply torque as well as perform ratio changes. The torque limiter is typically the last gearset in the transmission. It uses the planet carrier as the input with the sun gear as the output, and the annulus normally locked. A series of ball detents act on the annulus to lock it, allowing power to be transmitted from the planet carrier to the sun gear. When the torque transmitted through the gearset reaches a determinate amount, the torque acting on the annulus causes it to unlock from its ball detents and freely rotate, causing power to be diverted from the load on the sun gear to the annulus and thereby stalling the output until torque is reduced to an amount where the ball detents can lock the annulus again. This system equally limits torque in both directions of rotation and also works with the sun gear as the input. The compression of the ball detents (and therefore the amount of torque at which the limiter is utilized) is typically adjusted by means of a rotating collar accessible to the user which is indexed and held in place with its own separate ball detents. Pawl and spring This mechanical type uses a spring to hold a drive pawl against a notch in the rotor. It may feature automatic or manual reset. A compression adjustment on the spring determines the torque limit. Torque limiting types Torque limiting types will limit the torque by slipping (i.e. letting the drive shaft run faster than the driven shaft.) Excess power is dissipated as heat. They don't need to be reset. Friction plate This type is similar to a friction plate clutch. Over-torque will cause the plates to slip. A simple example is found in a fixed-spool fishing reel, where the slipping torque is set by means of a large hand nut in order that the reel will turn and allow more line to unwind before the line breaks under the pull of a fish. Magnetic particle A magnetic particle clutch can be used effectively as a torque limiter. The torque setting fairly approximates a linear relationship with the current passing through the windings, which can be statically or dynamically set depending on needs. Magnetic hysteresis This type is non-synchronous in normal operation, so there is always some slippage.

It bears the distinction of being the first semi-automatic marker ever to win a paintball tournament. Team Swarm used Automags in their victory at the 1990 International Masters.Paintmagazine.com - \\"Behind The AutoMag\\", by Mike Wallis, May 1996 An Automag Classic with attached Brass Eagle 9 oz. CO2 tank and ViewLoader hopper. History The first Automag was invented in 1985, but was revised several times before its release in 1990. As one of the first generation of semi-automatic paintball markers, its blow forward design was unique. Made mostly from stainless steel, the valve system was the first to incorporate a pressure regulator directly into the marker. The design also allowed for disassembly in the field without tools. The marker also introduced other innovations including a quick release twist lock barrel and the Power Feed, which was an angled feed system that prevented balls from being blown back up into the hopper. The Panther was the first prototype semi- automatic marker designed by Tom Kaye of Airgun Designs in 1988. Since it was only a prototype it was never offered to the public. The design was sold to Direct Connect, but was never manufactured. AGD bought the design rights back in 1989 through a non-performance clause in the original contract. The blow back design was deemed to be too primitive (because pump markers changed in 1988, they got removable barrels and quickstrip pins) so a second generation prototype \\"P2\\" (for Panther Prototype Two) was developed. This second design was also a blow back, and had many problems. It was decided to give up on blow back technology and re-engineer the entire action into a \\"blow-forward\\" design. This eliminated many problems inherent in blow-backs, such as their dependence on full, constant operating pressure in order to cycle reliably. This heralded the beginning of the Automag design which went through two revisions; P3 and P4. The P4 design was released to the public in 1990. The Automag had several problems when first introduced and the company fixed them through free updates called Level 6 through Level 7. This inspired a loyal customer base and the marker rose to become the most popular tournament marker in the mid-nineties. The Minimag and the Sydarm were introduced as variants, with the Sydarm targeted specifically at police training. Later came the RT which incorporated an all new regulator that made shootdown impossible (it could recharge 25 times per second), and had \\"reactive trigger\\" technology; after the marker fired, input pressure manipulated the mechanical link to force the trigger to return to its resting position, which reduced problems with \\"short-stroking\\". The Level 10 bolt was designed to eliminate ball-chop during high rates of fire. AGD now sells the X-valve, which is the RT Pro valve made from aluminum instead of stainless steel, and is combined with the Level 10 bolt. Airgun Designs briefly produced the E-mag and the X-Mag, manufactured by Airgun Designs Europe, to compete in tournaments that have come to be dominated by electro-pneumatic models. They have since discontinued their production. The E-Mag's design is unique in that it retains a mechanical link between the trigger and firing mechanism; the electronics work with manipulate electromagnets that lessen the pull strength. With a dead battery, the magnets are simply not functional and the gun reverts to mechanical operation similar to an RT. Therefore, the E-mag remained the only electro- pneumatic marker that would fire with a dead battery until the production of the Tippmann X-7 Phenom with its E-grip in 2009. The \\"Reactive Trigger\\" of the RT and subsequent E-Mag and X-Mag designs proved to be detrimental to AGD; it was found that, given an HPA tank with sufficient output pressure, the reactive trigger could be set to push back after firing with greater strength than was required to pull it, allowing simulated full-auto operation by finding a \\"sweet spot\\" on the trigger, squeezing it with just enough force to fire it but less than the return strength. This was determined by the NPPL and other tournament leagues to confer an unfair advantage, and the rules were changed to specifically prohibit triggers set up to \\"bounce\\" (defined as registering more than one mechanical \\"pull\\" of the trigger per conscious application of pressure to the trigger by the player, whether by mechanical or electronic means). The paintball market has since evolved into fully electronic markers, which provide higher rates of fire and much lighter trigger pulls, many at lower cost than the all-mechanical Automag. However, the Automag today retains its reputation as one of the most reliable mechanical markers ever made. Airgun Designs remains in business despite having all but exited the tournament market. It remains known for its good tech support, and the Automag enjoys a small following of loyal customers who customize and maintain their markers. Mechanical Automags have had a resurgence in popularity with woodsball and scenario players due to their reliability, compact design, and water resistant qualities. Operation The Automag uses a blow-forward operation. The idea behind it is to use a constant volume of air at constant pressure each shot, as to exert a constant amount of force each shot, resulting in great consistency. It is also relatively simple: # The trigger is pulled, the sear closes the on/off valve and releases the bolt a split second later. # Compressed air in the dump chamber overcomes the force of the bolt spring, pushing the bolt forward. As the bolt travels forward it seals off the feed port and 'uncorks' from the dump chamber. The compressed air from the dump chamber passes through the bolt and propels a paintball down the barrel. # Once the dump chamber pressure is vented down the barrel, the bolt is returned by a spring. # The trigger is released # The on/off valve opens and repressurizes the dump chamber # The dump chamber pushes the bolt forward, which is now held in place by the sear. # The marker is ready to fire again The design was the original blow forward paintball marker. The design is also used in many other markers. Currently available new markers that use the blow forward system are the Tiberius Arms line of markers, and the ICD Freestyles. The spool valve family of electropneumatic markers is also derived from this blow-forward operation. VariantsClassic Through the many years of its production there have been a few variants of the Automag, such as the \\"TKO Automag\\" or the Minimag. The TKO Automag was no different than any other Automag, except it came preconfigured with some non-stock accessories, such as a barrel, vertical ASA, and bottomline adapter. The body rail is a black anodized aluminum extrusion and the grip frame manufactured of a carbon composite.  .68 Classic  Original Automag. Stainless steel body and back, with offset powerfeed. Shipped with Level 1-7 valves. Sydarm (it's always been \\"Sidearm\\", SYD is pronounced \\"side\\") A Pistol variant of the Automag Classic, developed for Law Enforcement use. Uses a horizontal feed and 12g charger mounted on top of the body. Minimag The Minimag functionally is the same as an Automag Classic. Cosmetically, it has a longer stainless steel powerfeed body with venting milled into the front end. In addition, the stock barrel was a bit shorter, and a vertical ASA with a braided stainless steel line from the ASA to the A.I.R. (Advanced Integrated Regulator) valve. RT-Based AutomagsThe Automag RT= In 1996, Airgun Designs released the Automag RT (RT standing for Reactive Trigger). This revolutionary design required high pressure air (HPA) to operate; the rapid decompression involved in the valve would quickly cause CO2 to liquefy and freeze the valve's components, thus making the more expensive gas a necessity. This valve uses air pressure to quickly reset the trigger after a shot, thus enabling a faster rate of fire. Shootdown became impossible, as these valves recharged faster than anyone could pull the trigger; in fact, due to their design, they heated up under rapid fire and actually experienced shootup instead. Unfortunately, the original design was fed its gas through the marker's rail, and thus was incompatible as an upgrade to older Automags. This did not fit Airgun Designs' vision of customer support, and it was soon superseded by another design. =The ReTro Valve= The ReTro Valve was a new version of the RT valve, designed to be compatible with older Automags. While initially sold as an upgrade, it soon became the standard for all new high-end Automags, and was used as the basis for the MicroMag, a collaborative project with PTP (Pro Team Products). It was also used as the initial valve for the E-Mag. This valve, unlike the classic valve, was made out of stainless steel with an aluminum back. It was capable of an estimated 26 BPS fire before shootdown. =The X-Valve and the advent of UltraLight Engineering (ULE)= The advent of 700 billet aluminum meant that components no longer had to be made of stainless steel in order to be both strong and light. This aluminum, while more expensive, allowed for a significant weight savings in most components of the marker. The X-Valve is functionally identical to the ReTro Valve, but is made of aluminum instead of stainless steel. This results in an approximately 50% weight savings for no loss in durability or performance. The same concept was applied to the mainbodies, and the result was UltraLight Engineering (ULE). In addition to the weight savings, aluminum could be anodized instead of painted, allowing for more impressive colors and designs. The end result is a much lighter marker than any in the previous generations; indeed, Automags are some of the lightest markers available today. The lighter components also yielded some minor performance increases; the X-Valve has been unofficially tested to perform in excess of 30 BPS with no shootdown. E-Mag The E-Mag is an electronic Automag. Like other Automags, it has gone through different versions corresponding to advances to the Automag platform like the ReTro Valve, the Level 10 anti-chop system and the X-valve. Unlike most electronic markers, the E-mag is capable of firing in both electronic and mechanical modes through means of a readily available selector switch. The battery is rated for approximately 10 cases of paint (20,000 shots), This is in stark contrast to other electronic markers of the time(2000-2004) that must be recharged frequently or risk going down in the middle of a game, the trade off is that the E-Mag uses a much larger battery pack, whereas most markers operated off of a normal 9v battery. The E-Mag uses an unusual Hall effect sensor trigger instead of the more common microswitch, and the sensitivity of this magnetic trigger system gives the E-Mag a reputation for having hair trigger. Indeed, there have been many instances where the marker has fired from a slight jar instead of an intentional trigger pull. As a result, the safety is a very reliable actuator interrupt, and the marker is physically incapable of firing with it engaged. X-Mag The X-Mag was basically the same marker as the E-Mag electronically, except it also included the ACE (Anti-Chop Eye). The components included the original introduction of the X-Valve, originally engraved with an XMag symbol, and now just an X. It wasn't always called the X-Mag. It originally was called the Emag Extreem which later became X-Mag for short. The body of the X-Mag was a single piece instead of the body-rail combo that all previous AGD mags used. The main feature of the X-Mag, besides the one-piece body, was the removable breeches, which allowed users to change the feed port from center feed to warpfeed left or warpfeed right. There were some rare colors produced just as in every previous run. Magma and Placenta were two of the colors that had runs of 3 or less. The original X-Mag was considered somewhat \\"blocky-looking,\\" so AGD ran the body through a computer controlled CNC milling machine. The result was a lighter, more attractive marker named the C&C; X-Mag. FN303 The original Automag design has evolved into other products and is the heart of the FN303 Less Lethal Weapon System developed for Police and Military use.

Two editions were published in 1568, and a revised edition in 1573. It is one of the fundamental texts for rogue literature. Harman is one of the first writers to use the word rogue, which was adopted in the Poor Law legislation of 1572. Harman claimed to have collected his material direct from interviews with vagabonds themselves. The Caveat contained stories of vagabond life, a description of their society and techniques, a taxonomy of rogues, and a canting dictionary, which were reproduced in later works. Harman's reputation has changed since his work was first republished in the early twentieth century; A.V Judges described him then as having \\"all the deftness of the trained sociologist\\", and the Caveat has been used as a primary source. However, historians have long doubted the reliability of his accounts of vagabond society and the use of cant. Harman has been subject to literary analysis informed by Marx, Freud and Foucault, although it has been suggested these \\"appear to be fruitful sources of fertile error\\" (Beier). Harman was certainly not a neutral observer; he frequently makes explicit moral and social judgement about his subjects. These reflect a society in which sexual incontinence was subject to penalties in the local manor courts, the church courts and by Justices of the Peace in Quarter Sessions. It was also a society in ferment over the appropriate response to the increasing number of \\"masterless men\\". A large part of the Caveat was included in William Harrison's Description of England as part of Holinshed's Chronicle. Harman influenced and justified the legal punishment of vagrants, particularly the 1572 Vagabond Act. It was Harman's characterization of vagrants that influenced Elizabethan perspectives on them. Thomas Harman Little is known about Thomas Harman's life. He was from the gentry, described as an esquire in 1557, and with a coat of arms, with which he marked his plate. He inherited land in several parishes in Kent, and resided on an estate near Dartford from 1547. HIs wife Anne was the daughter of Sir Edward Rogers. In The Caveat he implies that he was a Justice of the Peace, but there is no evidence for this. However, in 1550 he was appointed to collect tax in Kent, and in 1554 and 1555 he was a member of the important Commission responsible for the Thames and its tributaries from near Southwark to Gravesend. A fellow member of the Commission was responsible for the creation of the Bridewell in London, and Harman was clearly acquainted with developments in law enforcement there. The Caveat is dedicated to Bess of Hardwick, although that does not mean that she was known personally to Harman. There are literary precursors to the Caveat, including John Awdeley's The Fraternity of Vagabonds (1561), of which Harman was aware. It was written in a period when government in England was increasingly concerned with the perceived problem of \\"masterless men\\". Solutions were being sought to the issue of the able-bodied poor. In 1563 the Statute of Artificers was passed \\"to banish idleness\\". Poor Laws were under review, and a plethora of laws passed against vagrancy, in which the punishments ranged from whipping to branding. In 1559 there was a proposal from a committee (the Privy Council) to restore an act of 1547 that provided for slavery as a punishment. Vagabond Society Harman set out a taxonomy of rogues, which expanded one sketched out by Awdeley. The structure and processes of this mirrored those of Tudor society, with its hierarchy and sumptuary laws, and the trade guilds, with their apprenticeships and initiations ceremonies. An example is the ceremony of \\"stalling a rogue\\" which Harman describes. In this an Upright Man pours beer over the head of the initiate, with the words, \\"I, G.P., do stall thee, W.T., to the rogue, and that henceforth it shall be lawful for you to cant . . . for thy living in all places\\". Such a ceremony is reproduced in later rogue literature, and in the play The Beggars Bush by Beaumont, Fletcher and Massinger, from which it was extracted by Francis Kirkman in The Wits. Bampfylde Moore Carew includes a similar account of his own inauguration as King of the Beggars, and there was a tradition that the graves of members of the Boswell gypsy family were visited annually and beer poured onto them during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Although his taxonomy has been read as if these roles were fixed, Harman's examples made it clear that many of these roles were modes of begging or crime adopted by the same vagabond from time to time. They also make it clear that many of these villains also had legitimate trades, which they exercised from time to time. This is confirmed by the historical record, which shows that many of those arrested as vagrants were unemployed through no fault of their own. They included domestic servants who had been dismissed, labourers seeking work, or those whose trade required travel, such as pedlars and chapmen. Harman does seem to have had direct contact with vagabonds, while most of those who wrote later rogue literature were London based writers living in literary circles. Another area in which Harman has been misunderstood is the place of Egyptians in this vagabond culture. They have no specific place in it, and although he identifies a few individuals as being Egyptians, he describes them generally as having a distinct culture and lifestyle. This is consistent with the attitude to them generally, that they were strange, foreign, little understood and, therefore criminal or at least a danger to the social order. The attitude to the Irish seems to have been similar, though less extreme. Categories of Rogues The following is summarised from Harman, with comments in brackets. ; Abram Men : or Abraham- men. Feign madness and claim to have been inmates at Bedlam, (where there was an Abraham Ward). If they are not given alms through pity they resort to becoming threatening, and playing on the fear that the mentally ill are dangerous. (They were also known as Bethlem Men, and later Poor Toms. It was believed that the Governors of Bedlam authorized some discharged patients to beg and gave them tin badges, although in 1675 the Governors denied this.) ; Autem Morts : Female rogues actually married in church, though not faithful to their husbands. Harman says they go about with children who they send to steal from houses. ; Bawdy Baskets : Female pedlars, who travel from house to house. Harman says that only one, who he names, is honest. The rest steal and buy from servants at under value, living with Upright Men, who provide them with protection. ; Counterfeit Cranks : Pretend to suffer from the \\"falling sickness\\" (epilepsy). They wear dirty clothes, and carry soap so they can use it to foam at the mouth. Some carry false testimonials from ministers in Shropshire. This is one of the modes adopted by Nicholas Blunt. ; Demanders for Glimmer : Beggars pretending to have suffered loss by fire, carrying counterfeit licenses. Harman says most of these are women, who collect money, and food, which they sell, and able to earn 6 or 7 s. a week. They worked with Upright Men, but were careful not to be seen with them. ; Dells : Female rogues who are still virgins. Harman says they are either \\"Wild Dells\\", born to doxies, or have lost their parents or been run away from service with some \\"sharp mistress\\". ; A Doxy : A female rogue whose virginity has been taken by an Upright Man. They are dependent on Upright Men and other rogues. Harman's objection is to their promiscuous lifestyle. He remarks that their breeches serve a dual purpose, as they are also used to carry food they are given. ; Dummerers : Beggars pretending dumbness, most of whom Harman says came from Wales. He recounts how, having satisfied himself that a license produced by one of these was false, he and a surgeon hung him by his wrists from a beam until he spoke. Harman took his money and distributed it to the poor, and the dummerer and his palliard were taken before a Justice, pilloried and whipped. ; Fraters : Pretending to be factors or proctors with false licenses to collect alms for hospitals. ; Hooker or Angler : They carry a long staff and go to houses seeking charity during the day to see what may be stolen. After dark they return and use an iron stick with a hook at the end to reach in through windows to steal clothes and linen, which they hide nearby before taking it to sell. ; Jarkmen or Patricos : Harman says that although Awdeley refers these to, neither exists. A Jarkman is supposed to be a forger of licenses, but Harman says that these are not made by vagabonds, as he has never come across one capable of writing well enough, but bought by them in towns, \\"as what can not be had for money?\\" (Harman is probably right. Several false licenses survive, and the historical evidence is that they were mostly produced by provincial schoolmasters, who were notoriously poorly paid. There does seem to have been a real market for these, with the price determined by the content and quality of the license and the current ferocity of law enforcement). Harman accepts that \\"Patricos\\" was the cant word for priest, but says they did not have priests or any ceremony of marriage, as few were married, preferring \\"natural fellowship and good liking\\". ; Kinchin Coves : Young male rogues. Harman allows them no prospect of reform, saying, \\"when he groweth unto years, he is better to hang than draw forth\\". ; Kinchin Morts : Young female rogues carried on their mother's back in sheets. ; Palliards : Also known as clapperdudgeons. They travel in patched cloaks, with their \\"wives\\", seeking alms, but selling what they are given. They work alone but meet in groups at night. Many are Irish and travel with false passports. The Welsh also use herbs to raise wounds on their legs. (Several recipes for this survive. Harman does not explain explicitly the underlying evil of this trick; that it transforms them from sturdy beggars to deserving beggars who cannot work.) ; Priggers of Prancers : Horse thieves, using various methods. Harman says they will take the horses at least three score miles off to sell. (The problem of horse theft was significant and laws were passed to require records of all horses sold at markets and fairs, and that two people vouch for the seller.) ; Rogues : These are \\"neither as stout or hardy as the upright man\\", but live much the same way, begging, stealing and traveling with false passports. ; Ruffler : A former soldier or serving man who has chosen a vagabond life, who rob, demand or beg as the opportunity arises. Harman says that after a year or two they become Upright Men, \\"unless they prevented by twisted hemp\\" (hanging). The word was used in a 1535 Tudor Act against vagrants. ; Swadders or Pedlars : Harman concedes, \\"not all be evil, but of an indifferent behaviour\\". His objection is that some bribe and steal, and provide outlets for stolen goods which they are given by Upright Men. ; Tinkers or Priggs : Harman does not condemn all tinkers, only those who cheat, steal and spend their money on drink. He says they travel with their \\"doxies\\", whom they change frequently. ; Upright Man : \\"some be serving men, artificers, and labouring men traded up in husbandry [who]. . . not minding to live by the sweat of their face,\\" wander through the counties offering the best poor relief. They are skilled professional thieves. Upright Men had authority over other beggars, from whom they could demand money, or other favours. They carried a staff, called a filchman, as a sign of their position. (Harman's phraseology follows a tradition which goes back to, at least, the introduction to and justification for the Statute of Labourers in 1381.) ; Walking Morts : Unmarried female rogues, who live by peddling, or begging, but their goods are taken by Upright Men. Harman recounts a conversation with one in which he rebuked her \\"for her lewd life and beastly behaviour, declaring to her what punishment was prepared and heaped up for in the world to come.\\" Her response was, \\"‚Ä¶how should I live? None will take me into service. But I labour in harvest-time honestly.\\" ; Whipjacks or Freshwater Mariners : These pretend to be shipwrecked sailors, who were likely to be tolerated, and allowed to travel to their supposed homes, or given support. Harman says that most came from Ireland and the west of England, and operated in the counties east of Wiltshire. Some carried counterfeit licences from the Admiralty, which Harman says they bought in Portsmouth for 2s. (Distressed mariners were sometimes licensed to seek alms, as were the relatives of those whose relatives were kidnapped by corsairs. False licences, or, in cant,\\"jarks\\" were popular, as they were difficult to check.) ; Wild Rogues : Rogues born to rogues, (\\"beastly begotten in barn or bushes\\"), and by nature more given to \\"knavery\\". Harman says that questioning one he replied that his father and grandfather had been beggars, \\"and he must needs be one by good reason.\\" Canting Dictionary Harman includes a short dictionary of cant words. His introduction to that is characteristic of his literary style and social attitude:- \\"Here I set before the good reader the lewd, lousy language of these loitering lusks and lazy lorels, wherewith they buy and sell the common people as they pass through the country.\\" The value of the dictionary to the \\"good reader\\" was probably minimal. Cant has only been found in court records six times, all after Harman and Awdeley, and the extent to which it was actually used is unclear. However, it was a goldmine for later writers, who various copied it, expanded on it, or used it to add colour to pamphlets and plays. Harman's taxonomy is reproduced in William Harrison's Description of England, contained in Holinshed's Chronicles (1577, 1587), as history, and extensively copied by in rogue literature, including Thomas Dekker, in Lantern and Candlelight (1608), Richard Head The English Rogue (1665), and The Life and Adventures of Bampfylde Moore Carew', (1745). Rogue Tales Harman claimed that having for twenty years kept a house on the main road to London, and having through sickness been at his home much, he had learned how to extract information from those vagabonds who called seeking alms. His accounts show similarities to the depositions taken by Justices of the Peace examining cases, and have been assumed to have been the same kind of first hand account collected by researchers such as Henry Mayhew. However, Harman is not a disinterested observer or reporter. He regards himself as a skilled interrogator, and the information to have been extracted against the will of those providing it. Although there is no suggestion he did so frequently, he approvingly reports his own use of violence to extract a confession in one case. He justifies his expansion of Awdeley's work by saying it was insufficient to protect people. His work is aimed at assisting law enforcement, and ridding the country of rogues, so that parishes can concentrate their spending on the relief of the deserving poor. Also, although he denies it, he writes with style, being fond of alliteration, and within a tradition of vulgar writing in chapbooks and jest books, which included crude and sexual references. Such writing was at the time widely acceptable; Sir Thomas More, and Erasmus wrote jests, the latter including a fart joke, and on her deathbed in 1603 courtiers read to Queen Elizabeth from the jest book A Hundred Merry Tales, (1526). Two-thirds of the Caveat is taken up with stories, and in the second edition he says he has added more. The stories are often comic, involving tricks, and have some moral element. A prime example is the man who rescues a \\"mort\\", having extracted a promise of sexual favours for doing so. She defers the reward, in the meantime informs local \\"gossips\\", and the lecher is caught by his wife and her friends with his pants literally down and soundly beaten by them. Nicholas Jennings Harman lists by name 215 Upright Men, Rogues and Palliards in separate lists. Of these 18 have been identified with named individuals punished as vagabonds in contemporary court records by Aydelotte. He also found about a dozen more punished for other offences. Taking into account the possibility of coincidences, the likelihood or apprehension, and the use of false names, this does suggest that some of Harman's information was reliable. The most significant and detailed account given by Harman concerns a man named by him in his list of rogues as \\"Nicholas Blunt (alias Nicholas Jennings, a counterfeit crank) \\". Harman recounts Blunt's appearance at his lodgings in Whitefriars on All Hallows Day 1566 seeking alms, naked from the waist upwards, in ragged dirty clothes, his face smeared with fresh blood feigning the \\"falling sickness\\" (probably palsy or epilepsy). Being suspicious Harman questioned him, and Blunt claimed to have been suffering from the falling sickness for eight years, and to have been discharged from Bedlam two weeks before, after being an inmate there two years. Harman checked with the keeper of the hospital who denied this, and then had Blunt followed by two boys from his printers, who saw him beg all day, renewing the blood from a bladder, and putting fresh mud on his clothes. They then followed him to Newington, south of the river, where the Constable apprehended him. On being searched he was found to have collected 13s. 3¬Ωd. (a labourer would have earned 6d. a day). He was also stripped and found to be fit and well, but escaped naked across the fields in the dark. Having then spent a period begging in the guise of a sailor whose ship and cargo had been lost at sea, and then as \\"Nicholas Jennings\\", a well-dressed hatter who had come to London for work, Blunt happened to accost Harman's printer on New Year's Day 1567. The printer recognised him and had him arrested. After denials and another escape attempt Blunt made a confession and was found to have \\"a pretty house\\" in Newington, \\"well furnished\\" and with a wife living there. Blunt's punishment combined the old penal techniques of physical punishment and public exposure, with the modern theory of rehabilitation through labour. For the latter he was imprisoned in the new Bridewell. For the former he was whipped at a cart's tail through the streets of London, and put in the pillory at Cheapside dressed in both his \\"ugly and handsome attire\\". His picture was exhibited there, and while he was whipped, and also outside his house, and kept at the Bridewell \\"for a monument\\". We know that at least the apprehension and whipping took place as there is a record of it in the Repertory of the Court of Aldermen for 13 January 1567. There are also records there of two others admitting similar crimes, in 1547 and 1517. Several illustrations of Blunt's tale appear in the Caveat. Both these and his story are repeated in later rogue literature . These illustrations and later texts often describe Blunt as an Upright Man, which Harman does not in his text. *'to filch', to beat, to strike, to rob. *'to maund', to ask or require. *'to cant', to speak. *'to prig', to ride.

It is primarily a type of highly refined monologue where the performer narrates episodes from Hindu epics (such as the Ramayana and the Mahabharata) and stories from the Puranas.http://www.mumbaipluses.com/chemburghatkoparplus/index.aspx?page=article&sectid;=3&contentid;=2008041320080414201125628e77d206&sectxslt;=&comments;=true Sometimes, however, it is also a traditional equivalent of the modern stand-up comedy act, incorporating commentary on current socio-political events (and personal comments directed at the members of the audience). The Performance \\"Koothu\\" means dance ... which is a misnomer, as facial expressions are emphasized and there is minimal choreography. It is performed in the Koothambalam; a place inside Hindu temples specifically designed for performing Kutiyattam and Chakyar Koothu. Ideally, the performance takes place in conjunction with festivals, presented by members of the Chakyar community along with the Ambalavasi Nambiars. It is a solo performance, by a narrator in a distinctive headgear and black moustache with his torso smeared with sandalwood paste and red dots all over the body. The headgear resembles snake‚Äôs hood, to symbolise the narration by Anantha, the thousand headed serpent. The Chakyar narrates the story based on the Sanskrit style of \\"Champu Prabandha\\" - a mixture of prose (gadya) and poetry (shloka). He begins with a prayer to the deity of the temple. He then goes on to narrate a verse in Sanskrit before explaining it in Malayalam. The narration uses wit and humor to draw parallels with current events and local situations. Koothu has traditionally been performed only by the Chakyar community. Two instruments accompany the performance - a mizhavu and a pair of ilathalam. This is different from the Nangiar Koothu, which is performed by women called Nangyarammas who belong to the Nambiar caste, and is a more highly refined theatre art. MƒÅni MƒÅdhava ChƒÅkyƒÅr Chakyar Koothu was originally performed only in Koothambalams of Hindu temples. It was Natyacharya- meaning a great teacher and practitioner of natyam (dramaturgy), a title accorded in his honour- Padma Shri MƒÅni MƒÅdhava ChƒÅkyƒÅr, a virtuoso of this art, who took Koothu and Kudiyattam outside the temples to the common people. He was the first to perform Chakyar Koothu for All India Radio and Doordarshan. Many consider him to be the greatest Chakyar Koothu and Kutiyattam artist of modern times. The story goes that his guru, Rama Varma Parikshith Thampuran wrote a Sanskrit champu prabandha called PrahlƒÅdacharita and requested some senior artists to study and perform it, but they found it impossible to do. It was then young MƒÅni MƒÅdhava ChƒÅkyƒÅr's turn to try. He agreed and studied a part of the prabandha overnight and performed it the next day at Tripunithura, then the capital of the Kingdom of Cochin. The incident proved his mastery of both Sanskrit and the classical art forms. After some months, he performed the entire PrahlƒÅdacharita on the same stage. The late Ammannur Madhava Chakyar and Painkulam Raman Chakyar were another important 20th century figure in this art form.

It historically covered an area stretching from Nasiriyah and Amarah in the north to Kuwait in the south. To the south and the west, there was theoretically no border at all, yet no areas beyond Qatar in the south and the Najd Sanjak in the west were later on included in the administrative system. At the beginning of the 20th century it reportedly had an area of , while the preliminary results of the first Ottoman census of 1885 (published in 1908) gave the population as 200,000.Asia by A. H. Keane, page 460 The accuracy of the population figures ranges from \\"approximate\\" to \\"merely conjectural\\" depending on the region from which they were gathered. The capital of the vilayet, Basra, was an important military centre, with a permanent garrison of 400 to 500 men, and was home to the Ottoman Navy in the Persian Gulf. History It was a vilayet from 1875 to 1880, and again after 1884, when it was recreated from the southern sanjaks of the Baghdad Vilayet. After 1884, the vilayet was briefly expanded down the littoral of the Gulf to incorporate Najd and al-Hasa, including Hofuf, Qatar, and Qatif, the incorporation of Najd only lasted until 1913 before the end of the Basra Vilayet. In 1899, Shaikh Mubarak concluded a treaty with Britain, stipulating that Britain would protect Kuwait against any external aggression, de facto turning it into a British protectorate. Despite the Kuwaiti government's desire to either be independent or under British rule, the British concurred with the Ottoman Empire in defining Kuwait as an autonomous caza of the Ottoman Empire. This would last until World War I. Basra fell to the British on 22 November 1914, and the Mesopotamian Expeditionary Force had occupied almost the whole of the vilayet by July 1915.

History Hazelwick School entrance In 1971, the school reduced its age range to 12-18, as the area became a three-tier area, with provision for children in middle schools up until the age of twelve. This situation was reversed in 2004, with the school once again taking pupils aged eleven, at the beginning of Year 7. In preparation for this latter change, the school had considerable work done to buildings. It had been thought that the school would form part of the local Private Finance Initiative which re-built other local schools, but this was not to be the case. Academy status At the start of August, 2011, Hazelwick School became an Academy School in line with new laws passed by the Coalition Government. Academy status was sought due to the school governing body and parental community wanting to have independent control over the school, believing that in the long run the school itself (and the governing body) is best placed to make decisions about its future development. Students The school caters for around 2000 pupils who are separated into 7 different years within the school. Years 7 to 9 study at Key Stage 3 which acts as the foundation knowledge of their educational career. Years 10 to 11 study at Key Stage 4 where pupils study to obtain a variety of qualifications such as; GCSEs, BTECs, NVQs and some pupils can even take A Levels. At Hazelwick's Sixth Form, approximately 400 students are taught at Key Stage 5 which provides several different qualifications for students to obtain, with the main being A Levels. A range of other higher level awards such as BTEC and NVQ are also offered by the school. Curriculum The school is a specialist technology college having specialisms in Humanities and Technology . It was awarded the Naacemark for schools, recognising the school's success in developing and implementing a strategic approach to ICT. Although specialised the school offers a vast range of subjects within the curriculum, from core subjects such as Maths, Science and English to subjects as varied as Drama, Electronics, Art, Music, ICT and more. Sister School Hazelwick School is twinned with Aggrey School in Ghana. This twinning was, until Ann Fearon's appointment as Head Teacher of the school, celebrated with alternating annual trips being made by sixth formers and teachers. During the visit by Aggrey to Hazelwick a week of events to do with the cultural aspects of Ghana take place throughout the school to further ties between the two schools.

During the early 1660s she was an actress in the 'Duke's Theatre Company' and boarded with the company's manager, Sir William Davenant.Olive Baldwin and Thelma Wilson, Davis [Davies; married name Paisible], Mary [Moll] (c.1651‚Äì1708), actress and royal mistress in Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (Oxford University Press, 2004) She became a popular singer, dancer and comedian, but the wife of Pepys called her \\"the most impertinent slut in the world\\".Samuel Pepys Diary 1668 ‚Äì complete Royal mistress Davis met King Charles II in a theatre or coffee-house in about 1667. She flaunted the wealth she acquired from her association with Charles, and gained a reputation for vulgarity and greed. She showed off her \\"mighty pretty fine coach\\" (Pepys:Samuel Pepys Diary February 1669) and a ring worth ¬£600, in those days a vast sum.The Mistresses of Charles II: by Brenda Ralph Lewis at Britannia.com Davis gave up the stage in 1668 and in 1669 had a daughter by Charles, Lady Mary Tudor, who became famous in her own right. Later, Charles dismissed Davis, possibly due to some chicanery by Nell Gwynne, a major rival for the King's affections. Davis did not leave empty-handed however: Charles awarded her an annual pension for life of ¬£1,000. In January 1667‚Äì68, Pepys notes that the King had furnished a house for Moll Davis, the actress, \\"in Suffolke Street most richly, which is a most infinite shame.\\" At the time this street belonged to James Howard, 3rd Earl of Suffolk and 3rd Lord de Walden, a nephew of Thomas Howard, Moll's natural father. Mary Davis is given in the rate books for 1672-3 but not earlier.'Suffolk Street and Suffolk Place', Survey of London: volume 20: St Martin-in-the-Fields, pt III: Trafalgar Square & Neighbourhood (1940), pp. 89‚Äì94.

As a celebrated actress and society lady, she was the subject of portraits by the fashionable artist, Sir Peter Lely. House in St James's Square In October 1673, Davis bought a new house in St James's Square from trustees for Edward Shaw, paying ¬£1800.'St James's Square: Army and Navy Club', in Survey of London, volumes 29 and 30 (St James Westminster, Part 1 (1960) pp. 180‚Äì186, online at St James's Square: Army and Navy Club at british- history.ac.uk(accessed 18 January 2008) 'Madam Davis' first appears in the ratebook for the year 1675 and last appears in 1687. This house (which was surveyed by John Soane in 1799) was almost square and had three storeys, each with four evenly spaced windows, all dressed with a wide architrave and cornice. The staircase hall was south of a large room in front, and two smaller rooms and a secondary staircase at the rear. There was a massive cross-wall, containing the fireplaces of the back rooms. It would now have been Number 22, St James's Square, if it had survived. It was demolished in 1847 to make way for a new club house for the Army and Navy Club, having survived longer than any other of the other original houses in the square. Marriage In December 1686, Davis married the French musician and composer James Paisible (c. 1656‚Äì1721), a member of James II's private musick. Sir George Etherege wrote scornfully of the marriage: \\"Mrs Davies has given proof of the great passion she always had for music, and Monsieur Peasible has another bass to thrum than that he played so well upon\\".Etherege, Sir George, Letters of Sir George Etherege, ed. Bracher, p. 118 The Paisibles joined James's court in exile at St Germain-en-Laye, but in 1693 returned to England, where Paisible became composer to Prince George of Denmark, the husband of Princess Anne, heir to the throne.Lasocki, David, Paisible, James [Jacques] (c.1656‚Äì1721), composer and recorder player in Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (OUP, 2004) References Category:1640s births Category:1708 deaths Category:English courtesans Category:Mistresses of Charles II of England Category:17th-century English actresses Category:English stage actresses Category:Howard family (English aristocracy) ","title":"Moll Davis"},{"id":"3764547","text":"Simone is a given name that can be used for males or females.

Its cofounder Rich Kinder had been the president of Enron. After Kinder was denied an expected promotion to replace Kenneth Lay as chief executive officer, he departed the company, purchasing its interest in ELP for $40 million. In 1999, Kinder Morgan conducted a reverse merger with KN Energy, a utility and pipeline company. Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America (NGPL), which serves the Chicago market, was acquired through this deal. KN Energy became Kinder Morgan's second publicly traded company, Kinder Morgan, Inc. (KMI). In 2001, Kinder Morgan's third publicly traded company, Kinder Morgan Management, LLC (KMR) was formed to facilitate institutional ownership of KMP equity. Leveraged buyout On August 28, 2006, Kinder Morgan announced that it would be taken private in a management-led leveraged buyout totaling approximately $22 billion. Outside participants in the transaction include Fayez Sarofim, Goldman Sachs Capital Partners and Highstar Capital (then owned by American International Group). KMI began trading again on the NYSE on February 11, 2011, following the largest private-equity backed U.S. IPO offering in history.  Subsequent events  In October 2011, Kinder Morgan Inc. agreed to buy El Paso Corp. (EP) for $21.1 billion and gave the combined company 67,000 miles (107,000 kilometers) of gas lines, eclipsing Enterprise Products Partners LP (EPD) as the biggest U.S. pipeline operator. The transaction paid with shares of Kinder Morgan, Kinder Morgan warrants, and all of cash portion $11.5 billion through Barclays Plc (BARC) borrowing. On August 10, 2014, Kinder announced it was moving to full ownership of its partially owned subsidiaries Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, Kinder Morgan Management, and El Paso Pipeline Partners in a deal worth $71 billion. The transaction closed on November 26, 2014. Prior to November 26, 2014, the Kinder Morgan group publicly traded companies included Kinder Morgan, Inc. (NYSE: KMI), Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, L.P. (NYSE: KMP), Kinder Morgan Management, LLC (NYSE: KMR) and El Paso Pipeline Partners, L.P. (NYSE: EPB); a merger transaction combined all under Kinder Morgan, Inc. (NYSE: KMI), on November 26, 2014. American Petroleum Tankers On December 23, 2013, Kinder Morgan announced that, through its Kinder Morgan Energy partner subsidiary (ticker KMP on NYSE), it would acquire the US oil tanker operator American Petroleum Tankers (APT) and its affiliated company SCT (State Class Tankers) from the US private equity investment firms Blackstone Group and Cerberus Capital Management. APT operates a fleet of five US flagged MR 50,000 tons‚Äî330,000 barrels‚Äîoil tankers and has four other similar tankers on order from the General Dynamics shipbuilding company NASSCO in California. This acquisition appears to be the first case whereby a pipeline operator will also be able to offer marine transportation.Kinder Morgan Tankers, http://www.kindermorgan.com/business/terminals/apt.cfm This acquisition would facilitate the export of U.S. natural resources to overseas markets, and Kinder Morgan had lined up \\"some LNG export customers\\" by July 2014.Kinder Morgan Energy Partners' (KMP) CEO Richard Kinder on Q2 2014 Results ‚Äì Earnings Conference Call July 18, 2014, by SA Transcripts, http://seekingalpha.com/article/2322165-kinder-morgan-energy-partners-kmp-ceo- richard-kinder-on-q2-2014-results-earnings-conference-call, accessed 2014-07-20.

Kinder Morgan owns or operates approximately 84,000 miles (135 200 km) of pipelines transporting primarily natural gas, crude oil, and petroleum products. In Canada, Kinder Morgan operates the Trans Mountain oil pipeline which links Alberta with Vancouver, British Columbia, as well as the Cochin pipeline between Western Canada and the American Midwest. Trans Mountain Pipeline In 2013, Kinder Morgan filed its application to the Canadian National Energy Board (NEB) for building a second pipeline roughly parallel to the existing Trans Mountain, for transporting diluted bitumen between Edmonton, Alberta, and Burnaby, British Columbia. The new pipeline would nearly triple the transportation capacity from 300,000 to 850,000 barrels per day, for an estimated investment of $6.8 billion. This expansion would enable the export of larger volumes of Alberta's bituminous sands oil to the US and to Asian countries.Rolfsen, Catherine (2014-11-06), \\"Kinder Morgan pipeline: First Nations fight back with fish\\", CBC, retrieved 2014-12-01. https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-10/kinder-morgan-increases-size-of- trans-mountain-pipe-expansion.html.

Kinder Morgan had the support of several large petroleum industry customers for this expansion, (BP Canada Energy Trading Co., Canadian Natural Resources, Canadian Oil Sands Ltd., Cenovus Energy Inc., Devon Canada Corp., Husky Energy Marketing Inc., Imperial Oil Ltd., Nexen Marketing Inc., Statoil Canada Ltd., Suncor Energy Marketing Inc., Suncor Energy Products Partnership, Tesoro Refining & Marketing Co. and Total E&P; Canada Ltd.). This project is controversial, as are similar pipeline projects like Northern Gateway from Alberta to Kitimat, BC, Keystone XL to the US south and Line 9 (Enbridge's project, from Sarnia to Montreal), all of which expand the transportation capacity of heavy crude to refineries or loading ports for export to the US or overseas. The expansion project faced strong opposition from civic governments, First Nations, environmentally concerned citizens, and others. Protests started in 2014 and were continuing in the spring of 2018. Members of the Squamish and Tsleil- Waututh First Nations of British Columbia, Canada paddled canoes on the waters of Burrard Inlet to the Kinder Morgan Burnaby Terminal for a ceremony to protest the expansion of the Trans Mountain pipeline, in North Vancouver, British Columbia, on September 1, 2012. Tsleil-Waututh leaders hoped to shut down the project altogether.\\"B.C.

The existing and proposed pipelines ship diluted bitumen through the Strait of Juan de Fuca, an extremely sensitive environmental region. The tankers have to pass through a very narrow channel of shallow water to reach the open sea, making the project controversial and strongly opposed by some Canadians and Americans, for reasons similar to the opposition to Keystone XL, Line 9, and Northern Gateway and offshore deep ocean oil drilling. In 2016, B.C. said that it did not support Trans Mountain, partly because Kinder Morgan has not provided enough information about its proposed spill prevention program.Tracy Johnson, \\"Trans Mountain pipeline battle set for NEB hearing,\\" CBC News, 1/19/2016, http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/transmountain-pipeline-hearings- start-1.3408090, accessed 4/21/2016. Northeast Energy Direct Pipeline This high-pressure 30-inch (762 mm) gas transmission pipeline, proposed in 2014, was slated to pass from Wright, New York to Dracut, Massachusetts, to ‚Äúhelp alleviate New England‚Äôs uniquely high natural gas and electricity costs caused by severely limited natural gas transportation capacity currently serving the region.‚Äù However, the project faced stiff opposition from a coalition of anti-fracking activists, pipeline safety advocates who raised questions about the proximity of a high-pressure pipeline to their homes, sustainable-energy advocates, property owners who objected to having land seized by eminent domain, and environmentalists hoping to preserve wetlands and old-growth forests. Legislators and elected officials responded to voters' concerns.No Fracked Gas In Mass, http://www.nofrackedgasinmass.org/; Nashoba Conservation Trust, http://nashobatrust.org/additional-resources/; Dracut/Tyngsboro Pipeline Awareness Group, https://www.scribd.com/doc/227298012/Questioning-the-Need-for-Northeast- Energy-Direct, May 29, 2014; Susan Phillips, \\"Praying with our legs: on pilgrimage against fracked gas,\\" United Church of Christ, Massachusetts Conference, http://www.macucc.org/blogdetail/947845, accessed 1/6/2016.

Palmetto Pipeline Likewise, Kinder Morgan's proposed Palmetto Pipeline, designed to go from the Gulf Coast to the Southeast markets, was nixed. Its path would have taken it through 201 miles (323 km) of eastern and coastal Georgia, and drew opposition from local residents and environmental groups. The company suspended work on the project after the Georgia General Assembly passed a temporary moratorium on the use of eminent domain for pipeline construction, and commissioned a study to review the project.\\"Kinder Morgan Inc.

Like the first two, it was scheduled to be edited by American author Harlan Ellison, with introductions provided by him. The projected third collection was started but, controversially, has yet to be finished. It has become something of a legend in science fiction as the genre's most famous unpublished book. It was originally announced for publication in 1973, but has not seen print to date. Ellison came under criticism for his treatment of some writers who submitted their stories to him, who some estimate to number nearly 150.The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction Many of these writers have since died. On June 28, 2018, Ellison died, with the anthology still unpublished. The fate of the anthology, and the stories submitted for it, remains unknown. British author Christopher Priest, whose story \\"An Infinite Summer\\" had been accepted for the collection, wrote a lengthy critique of Ellison's failure to complete the LDV project. It was first published by Priest as a one-shot fanzine called The Last Deadloss Visions, a pun on the title of Priest's own fanzine, Deadloss. It proved so popular that it had a total of three printings in the UK and later, in book form, as the 1995 Hugo Award for Best Related Work-nominated The Book on the Edge of Forever (an allusion to Ellison's Star Trek episode, \\"The City on the Edge of Forever\\") by American publisher Fantagraphics Books. The essay is available online at the Internet Archive mirror of the original site. Contents The contents of The Last Dangerous Visions were announced on several occasions beginning in 1973, with stories sometimes being added, dropped, or substituted between each announced version. The most complete version was announced in 1979; listed were 113 previously unpublished stories by 102 authors, to be collected in three volumes. 1979 contents list It was announced in the April 1979 issue of Locus that the anthology had been sold to Berkley Books, which planned to publish the 700,000 words of fiction in three volumes. The following tables of contents were published in the June 1979 issue of Locus. Story titles are followed by an approximate word count. Also note that the totals given for each book do not exactly match the published list.

The first of these is the apparition of 11 February 1858, when 14-year old Bernadette Soubirous told her mother that a \\"lady\\" spoke to her in the cave of Massabielle (a kilometre and a half (1 mi) from the town) while she was gathering firewood with her sister and a friend.Catholic Online: Apparitions of Our Lady of Lourdes First Apparition Similar apparitions of the \\"Lady\\" were reported on eighteen occasions that year, until the climax revelation of Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception took place. In 18 January 1862, the local Bishop of Tarbes Bertrand-S√©v√®re Laurence endorsed the veneration of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Lourdes. On 3 July 1876, Pope Pius IX officially granted a Canonical Coronation to the image that used to be in the courtyard of what is now part of the Rosary Basilica.\\"Marie Reine, 22 ao√ªt\\", Zenit, 21 Ao√ªt 2013 The image of Our Lady of Lourdes has been widely copied and reproduced in shrines and homes, often in garden landscapes.

Apparitions  Studio photograph of Bernadette Soubirous, age 14, in daily attire (c. 1 January 1858) The venerated image of Our Lady of the Rosary granted a Canonical Coronation by Pope Pius IX on 3 July 1876. During that same year, an oversized golden laurel wreath was placed at the base as well as a stellar halo being attached to the head of the image; both no longer present. On 11 February 1858, Soubirous went with her sister Toinette and neighbor Jeanne Abadie to collect some firewood. After taking off her shoes and stockings to wade through the water near the Grotto of Massabielle, she said she heard the sound of two gusts of wind (coups de vent) but the trees and bushes nearby did not move. A wild rose in a natural niche in the grotto, however, did move. Soubirous tried to make the sign of the Cross but she could not, because her hands were trembling. The lady smiled, and invited Soubirous to pray the rosary with her. Soubirous tried to keep this a secret, but Toinette told her mother. After parental cross-examination, she and her sister received corporal punishment for their story. Three days later, 14 February, Soubirous returned to the Grotto. She had brought holy water as a test that the apparition was not of evil origin/provenance: \\"The second time was the following Sunday. ... Then I started to throw holy water in her direction, and at the same time I said that if she came from God she was to stay, but if not, she must go. She started to smile, and bowed ... This was the second time.\\" Soubirous's companions are said to have become afraid when they saw her in ecstasy. She remained ecstatic even as they returned to the village. On 18 February, she spoke of being told by the Lady to return to the Grotto over a period of two weeks. She quoted the apparition: \\"The Lady only spoke to me the third time. ... She told me also that she did not promise to make me happy in this world, but in the next.\\" Soubirous was ordered by her parents to never go there again. She went anyway, and on 24 February, Soubirous related that the apparition asked for prayer and penitence for the conversion of sinners. Soubirous witnessing the apparition of the Virgin Mary. Stained glass, Bonneval. The next day, she said the apparition asked her to dig in the ground and drink from the spring she found there. This made her dishevelled and some of her supporters were dismayed, but this act revealed the stream that soon became a focal point for pilgrimages. Although it was muddy at first, the stream became increasingly clean. As word spread, this water was given to medical patients of all kinds, and many reports of miraculous cures followed. Seven of these cures were confirmed as lacking any medical explanations by Professor Verges in 1860. The first person with a \\"certified miracle\\" was a woman whose right hand had been deformed as a consequence of an accident. Several miracles turned out to be short-term improvement or even hoaxes, and Church and government officials became increasingly concerned. The government fenced off the Grotto and issued stiff penalties for anybody trying to get near the off-limits area. In the process, Lourdes became a national issue in France, resulting in the intervention of Emperor Napoleon III with an order to reopen the grotto on 4 October 1858. The Church had decided to stay away from the controversy altogether. Soubirous, knowing the local area well, managed to visit the barricaded grotto under cover of darkness. There, on 25 March, she said she was told: \\"I am the Immaculate Conception\\" (\\"que soy era immaculada concepciou\\"). On Easter Sunday, 7 April, her examining doctor stated that Soubirous, in ecstasy, was observed to have held her hands over a lit candle without sustaining harm. On 16 July, Soubirous went for the last time to the Grotto. \\"I have never seen her so beautiful before,\\" she reported. The Church, faced with nationwide questions, decided to institute an investigative commission on 17 November 1858. On 18 January 1860, the local bishop finally declared that: \\"The Virgin Mary did appear indeed to Bernadette Soubirous.\\" These events established the Marian veneration in Lourdes, which together with F√°tima and the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe is one of the most frequented Marian shrines in the world, and to which between 4 and 6 million pilgrims travel annually. In 1863, Joseph-Hugues Fabisch was charged to create a statue of the Virgin according to Soubirous's description. The work was placed in the grotto and solemnly dedicated on 4 April 1864 in presence of 20,000 pilgrims. A garden image of the Lourdes apparition in Castlewellan, Northern Ireland The veracity of the apparitions of Lourdes is not an article of faith for Catholics. Nevertheless, all recent Popes visited the Marian shrine at some time. Benedict XV, Pius XI, and John XXIII went there as bishops, Pius XII as papal delegate. He also issued an encyclical, Le p√®lerinage de Lourdes, on the one-hundredth anniversary of the apparitions in 1958. John Paul II visited Lourdes three times during his pontificate, and twice before as a bishop.  Bernadette's description of Mary  Soubirous described the apparition as uo petito damizelo (\\"a tiny maiden\\") of about twelve years old. Soubirous insisted that the apparition was no taller than herself. At tall, Soubirous was diminutive even by the standards of other poorly nourished children. Soubirous described that the apparition as dressed in a flowing white robe, with a blue sash around her waist. This was the uniform of a religious group called the Children of Mary, which, on account of her poverty, Soubirous was not permitted to join (although she was admitted after the apparitions). Her Aunt Bernarde was a long-time member. The statue that currently stands in the niche within the grotto of Massabielle was created by the Lyonnais sculptor Joseph- Hugues Fabisch in 1864. Although it has become an iconographic symbol of Our Lady of Lourdes, it depicts a figure which is not only older and taller than Soubirous's description, but also more in keeping with orthodox and traditional representations of the Virgin Mary. On seeing the statue, Soubirous was profoundly disappointed with this representation of her vision.  Similar events  In nearby Lestelle-B√©tharram, only a few kilometres from Lourdes, some shepherds guarding their flocks in the mountains observed a vision of a ray of light that guided them to the discovery of a statue of the Virgin Mary. Two attempts were made to remove the statue to a more prominent position; each time it disappeared and returned to its original location, at which a small chapel was built for it. In the early sixteenth century, a twelve-year-old shepherdess called Angl√®ze de Sagazan received a vision of the Virgin Mary near the spring at Garaison (part of the commune of Monl√©on- Magnoac), somewhat further away. Angl√®ze's story is strikingly similar to that of Soubirous: she was a pious but illiterate and poorly educated girl, extremely impoverished, who spoke only in the local language, Gascon Occitan, but successfully convinced authorities that her vision was genuine and persuaded them to obey the instructions of her apparitions. Like Soubirous, she was the only one who could see the apparition (others could apparently hear it); however, the apparition at Garaison's supernatural powers tended toward the miraculous provision of abundant food, rather than healing the sick and injured. Mid-nineteenth century commentators noted the parallels between the events at Massabielle and Garaison, and interpreted the similarities as proof of the divine nature of Soubirous's claims. At the time of Soubirous, Garaison was a noted center of pilgrimage and Marian devotion. There are also several similarities between the apparition at La Salette, near Grenoble, and Lourdes. La Salette is many hundreds of kilometres from Lourdes, and the events at La Salette predate those in Lourdes by 12 years. However, Virgin Mary's appearance of La Salette was tall and maternal (not petite and gentle like her Lourdes apparition) and had a darker, more threatening series of messages. It is not certain if Soubirous was aware of the events at La Salette. Approval by a local bishop On 18 January 1862, the Bishop of Tarbes Betrand Severt Laurence declared the following regarding the alleged Marian apparitions: The sanctuary basilica built at Lourdes directly above the site of the apparitions Pontifical approbations Pope John Paul II in 1983 at the Grotto of Massabielle of the Lourdes Shrine. * Pope Pius IX approved the veneration in Lourdes and supported the building of the Cathedral in 1870 to which he donated several gifts.

Reported healings The location of the spring was described to Soubirous by an apparition of Our Lady of Lourdes on 25 February 1858. Since that time many thousands of pilgrims to Lourdes have followed the instruction of Our Lady of Lourdes to \\"drink at the spring and wash in it\\". Although never formally encouraged by the Church, Lourdes water has become a focus of devotion to the Virgin Mary at Lourdes. Since the apparitions, many people have claimed to have been cured by drinking or bathing in it,Harris, Ruth. Lourdes: Body and Spirit in the Secular Age, Penguin Books, 2000, p. 312. and the Lourdes authorities provide it free of charge to any who ask for it.Clarke, Richard. 2008 Lourdes, Its Inhabitants, Its Pilgrims, And Its Miracles p. 38 An analysis of the water was commissioned by then mayor of Lourdes, Anselme Lacad√© in 1858. It was conducted by a professor in Toulouse, who determined that the water was potable and that it contained the following: oxygen, nitrogen, carbonic acid, carbonates of lime and magnesia, a trace of carbonate of iron, an alkaline carbonate or silicate, chlorides of potassium and sodium, traces of sulphates of potassium and soda, traces of ammonia, and traces of iodine.Barb√©, Daniel. Lourdes Essentially, the water is quite pure and inert. Lacad√© had hoped that Lourdes water might have special mineral properties which would allow him to develop Lourdes into a spa town, to compete with neighbouring Cauterets and Bagn√®res-de-Bigorre. The Lourdes Medical Bureau To ensure claims of cures were examined properly and to protect the town from fraudulent claims of miracles, the Lourdes Medical Bureau (Bureau Medical) was established at the request of Pope Pius X. It is completely under medical rather than ecclesiastical supervision. Approximately 7,000 people have sought to have their case confirmed as a miracle, of which 69 have been declared scientifically inexplicable by the Bureau.Where Scientists are looking for God, The Telegraph, 16 January 2002.

History Bronze oil lamp excavated at Matara, dating from the Roman Republica (circa 1st century BCE). Matara is the name of both a small village and an important archaeological site in Eritrea. The latter is located some 136 kilometers southeast of the capital Asmara, just past Senafe on the road leading south to the border with the northern Tigray Region of Ethiopia. The archaeological site already has yielded evidence of several levels of habitation, including at least two different major cities, covering more than 1000 years. The topmost layers are associated with the Aksumite Empire and date from the fourth to the eighth centuries. This city was allied with or part of the powerful trading empire centered in the capital, Aksum, to the southwest. It appears that Matara was one of a string of cities along the trade route that ran from Aksum to its port city, Adulis, whose extensive ruins, surveyed but largely unexcavated, are in the vicinity of Zula, southeast of Massawa on the Red Sea coast. Keskese is located north of Matara. Hawulti, a pre-Aksumite or early Aksumite era obelisk, is situated here.

Nova Civitas claimed at its founding to be completely independent, although it was recognized and supported by the Flemish Liberal Party (VLD). The Founding Chairman of Nova Civitas, Boudewijn Bouckaert, was a long-time board member of the VLD. According to their website, the basic principles of Nova Civitas were : Nova Civitas was founded in 1992 in the tradition of the Belgian 1980s Ludwig Von Mises Institute as a new political club to support the rebirth of a strong liberal movement in Belgium dominated by the VLD in Flanders and the Liberal Reformist Party in Wallonia. Nova Civitas was headquartered in Ghent. In 2004, a new regional committee was created in Antwerp, followed in 2006 by one in Brussels. Nova Civitas opposed the \\"socialist welfare state\\" and advocated further transfers of competences from the federal to the regional levels. Nova Civitas also proposed a regrouping of political forces into what would have become a de facto two-party system, with a big centre-right/right-wing political party alliance in Flanders, including VLD, Christen-Democratisch en Vlaams, New Flemish Alliance and Vlaams Belang. At the time, this stirred controversy and several Nova Civitas members were rebuked by the VLD. Senators Hugo Coveliers and Jean-Marie Dedecker were even forced to leave the party in the ensuing turmoil. In 2007, Nova Civitas member Jean-Marie Dedecker started his own political party, the eponymous List Dedecker (now: Libertarian, Direct, Democratic) and established a new think tank, Cassandra, to serve as the ideological laboratory for his party. In 2009, both Cassandra and Nova Civitas fell victim of internal disputes, and decided to disband themselves. A new classical liberal think tank was founded by the remnants: Libera!.

It is operated by a Johnston Press holding company entitled Derry Journal Newspapers. The paper is published on Tuesday and Friday and is a sister paper of the Sunday Journal, the only local newspaper published in Ireland on a Sunday. It is the second oldest newspaper still in existence in Ireland. History=Establishment The London-Derry Journal and General Advertiser was a four-page paper that cost one penny and was initially published on Wednesday and Saturday. In October of the same year as its launch, the paper's publication days were changed to Tuesday and Friday, and 1877 it became a daily paper for a brief time, however, this lasted just three months and the paper became a tri-weekly publication after three months (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday). In its early days, the paper's editorial policy was that of the Protestant community who would become known as 'Unionists' in the following decades. However, in 1829 the paper endorsed Catholic Emancipation (equal rights for Catholics), leading to the then editor, William Wallen, to resign in protest to form the Londonderry Sentinel and North West Advertiser. The paper's position became more nationalist throughout the nineteenth century and was renamed the Derry Journal in 1880 (the nationalist name for the city). The next major change to the paper took place in January 1958 when the paper reverted to its current publishing schedule: Tuesday and Friday. Banning The Journal is also the only mainstream newspaper to have been banned on both sides of the border; firstly in 1932 and again in 1940. Under the McCarroll family, the paper was firmly nationalist and it is this that is believed to have been behind a ban on the newspaper in the Irish Free State in January 1932. The Journal had been calling for Donegal voters to back Fianna F√°il candidates in the upcoming election and had been a strong critic of the Cumann na nGaedheal government. On Monday 6 January, Garda√≠ across Donegal told newsagents not to sell the paper until further notice, however, the source of the ban remains unknown and was rescinded almost immediately. It has been suggested that the decision to stop the selling of the paper was linked to a Fianna F√°il conference in Donegal that weekend, which received extensive coverage in the Monday edition published in Derry. The second ban was enforced in Northern Ireland by the Unionist government on 1 June 1940, it was also cut short and was removed by special dispensation four days later. This ban came again because of the paper's nationalist point of view - it had sided with the neutral √âire government, which Stormont believed amounted to not supporting the Allied war effort.Essay on the banning of the Derry Journal by Freya McClements Ironically the paper was able to cover its own banning through circulation on the other side of the border. Owners In 1998, the McCarroll family sold the paper to what became Trinity Mirror, who sold it to Local Press Ltd, a 3i holding company, in January 2004. Johnston Press took ownership through the purchase of Local Press in November 2005 and it is now operated by the holding company Derry Journal Newspapers.

As one of the fifteen Archbishops of France, the Archbishop of Rouen's ecclesiastical province comprises the greater part of Normandy. The Archbishop of Rouen is currently Dominique Lebrun. History According to legend, developed in the 11th century, the diocese was founded by Nicasius, a disciple of St. Denis who was martyred after arriving in Normandy towards the end of the first century on a mission from Pope Clement I. The monks of S. Ouen appear to have had an active part. Most of the episcopal lists of the Diocese of Rouen, however, omit Nicasius' name.Duchesne, p. 205. Rouen became an archdiocese probably around 744 with the accession of Grimo. Archbishop Franco baptized Rollo of Normandy in 911, and the archbishops were involved in the Norman conquest of England in 1066. Normandy was annexed to France in 1204, and Rouen was later occupied by England from 1419 to 1449 during the Hundred Years' War. In 1562 the city was briefly captured by Huguenots during the French Wars of Religion. The suffragan dioceses of Rouen in the Middle Ages were √âvreux, Avranches, Se√®s, Bayeux, Lisieux, and Coutances. Today its suffragans are the Diocese of √âvreux, the Diocese of Bayeux and Lisieux, the Diocese of Coutances, the Diocese of Le Havre, and the Diocese of S√©es. The seat of the archbishop is the 13th century Gothic Rouen Cathedral. The Cathedral Chapter is composed of ten dignitaries (the Dean,For the Deans of the Cathedral Chapter of Rouen, see Fisquet, pp. 358-366. Already by the end of the 11th century the canons had ceased living together under a common rule (Fisquet, p. 3). the Precentor, the Treasurer, the Archdeacon Major, the Archdeacon Augi (Eu), the Archdeacon of Cales-Major (Grand-Caux), the Archdeacon of Velocassium Franciae (Vexin Fran√ßais), the Archdeacon of Velocassium Normanniae (Vexin Normande), the Archdeacon of Cales-Minor (Petit-Caux), and the Chancellor); in addition there were forty-seven Canons (which included the offices of Succentor, Theologian and Penitentiary).Gallia christiana IX (Paris 1759), p. 3. Ritzler, V, p. 336, note 1, states that there were fifty canons in 1671; he includes the three offices in the number of canons. In addition to the right to nominate the Archbishop of Rouen (from the Treaty of Bologna of 1516, between Francis I and Leo X), the King of France also enjoyed the right of nomination of a considerable number of benefices in the archdiocese. These included: twenty- four abbeys; fourteen priories; the Dean and Canons of the Church of Notre- Dame-de-la-Ronde in Rouen; and the Dean and nine prebends of the Church of Saint-Mellon-de-Pontoise.The benefices available in 1648 are listed in: The Cathedral was heavily damaged, along with other buildings in Rouen, during World War II and later rebuilt. The archdiocese was the site of the terrorist attack at the church of Saint-√âtienne-du-Rouvray.

Capitulation (, a little head or division; capitulare, to treat upon terms) is an agreement in time of war for the surrender to a hostile armed force of a particular body of troops, a town or a territory. It is an ordinary incident of war, and therefore no previous instructions from the captors' government are required before finally settling the conditions of capitulation. The most usual of such conditions are freedom of religion and security of private property on one hand, and a promise not to bear arms within a certain period on the other. Such agreements may be rashly concluded with an inferior officer, on whose authority the enemy are not, in the actual position of the war, entitled to place reliance. When an agreement is made by an officer who has not the proper authority or who has exceeded the limits of his authority, it is termed a \\"sponsion\\", and, to be binding, must be confirmed by express or tacit ratification. The Hague Convention (1899) on the laws and the customs of war lays down that capitulations agreed on between the contracting parties must be in accordance with the rules of military honor. When once settled they must be observed by both the parties.

In April of that year he liberated the city of Vilnius by leading a successful uprising there. Supported by Tadeusz Ko≈õciuszko and appointed the commander in chief of all the partisan forces in the former Grand Duchy, he managed to defeat numerous Russian garrisons in the area. However, accusations of radical republicanism brought him into conflict with the state authorities, and by the beginning of June he was forced to resign as commander-in-chief of Lithuanian forces and pass his office to General Micha≈Ç Wielhorski. Jakub Jasi≈Ñski continued to harass enemy forces in Lithuania and then withdrew with a small partisan troop towards Warsaw.

The wine produced here was classified as one of ten Quatri√®mes Crus (Fourth Growths) in the historic Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855. The Ch√¢teau produces a second wine under the label Ch√¢teau de Clairefont (also called Confidences de Prieur√©-Lichine since 2008), and a Haut-M√©doc, Le Clocher du Prieur√©. History Originally a priory of Benedictine monks who cultivated grapes for service at dinner and at religious ceremonies, practices gradually evolved by the 18th century to establish sales of the wine under the name Le Prieur√© de Cantenac. As a consequence of the French Revolution, the property was seized, divided and sold in 1789 to several surrounding estates, including Ch√¢teau Palmer. A portion was bought by Monsieur Pag√®s who passed on the estate to his widow, when due to its reputation and broker prices received a fourth growth classification in 1855. Several changes in ownership resulted in changes to the name, such as Le Prieur√© and Prieur√©-Cantenac, and when the late wine writer and authority Alexis Lichine arrived to buy the estate it consisted of 11 hectares of neglected vines. Alexis Lichine bought the vineyard in 1951 (shortly after having purchased the Margaux estate Ch√¢teau Lascombes with a consortium) and work began to group and reconstitute the property on the ideal slightly-rising ground. With the money he was garnering from the import business and a few partners, Alexis Lichine bought the Prieure for ¬£11,000, at the time about $16,000. In 1953, with the help of Count Lur-Saluces of Ch√¢teau d'Yquem, Lichine renamed the Prieur√© to Ch√¢teau Prieur√©-Lichine.Hennessy, Leslie A. (2009). The Pope of Wine -A Biography of Alexis Lichine. SF: Montrachet Publishing With the estate renamed in 1953, the following year Cantenac wineries were entitled to use the appellation of Margaux. Sacrificing quantity for quality, trades in portions of desirable land at a loss of two to one were made with third growth neighbours Palmer, Ferri√®re, Kirwan, Giscours, Issan, Boyd-Cantenac and second growth neighbours Durfort-Vivens and Brane- Cantenac, adding up to of vineyards by the mid-1960s. With an aim to produce a wine well beyond its classification, Lichine undertook extensive replanting, repairs and investments and brought in oenologists Emile Peynaud and Patrick L√©on to advise on vat selection. By the 1970s the estate amounted to 58 hectares dispersed across the communes Cantenac and Margaux. After Lichine's death in 1989, the estate was run by his son Sacha for several years, with oenologist Michel Rolland acting as consultant, until the estate was sold to the Groupe Ballande in 1999. The winery currently employs St√©phane Derenoncourt as its consulting oenologist.Suckling, James, Wine Spectator (March 31, 2007). \\"50 Best Bordeaux under $50\\", p.86 Ch√¢teau Prieur√©-Lichine label from the 2000 vintage The vineyard The soils of Ch√¢teau Prieur√©- Lichine are essentially made up of gravel deposited by the river during successive glacial floods in the Quaternary era. Streams resulting from the floods then cut up these sedimentary soils into well drained mounds, which today look out over the Gironde estuary. Production Ch√¢teau Prieur√©- Lichine currently consists of about planted with 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 45% Merlot, 5% Petit verdot. After fermenting in concrete vats, the wine is aged for up to 16 months in 50 percent new oak barrels. Technical Improvements Since 1999, many technical improvements have been adopted. The winery is now working with 34 concrete vats from 80 to 120 hectoliters allowing to improve the plot selection. The main vatroom is equipped with a pneumatic pigeage machine, and the reception area has been modernized to allow gravity vatting.

He developed an early use of a markup language in his 1980 doctoral dissertation. His other principal interest has been computer networking and the development of the Internet. Education Reid received his B.S. in physics from the University of Maryland, College Park in 1970, and then worked in industry for five years before entering graduate school at Carnegie Mellon University, where he was awarded a PhD in computer science in 1980. His dissertation research developed the Scribe word processing system, for which he received the Association for Computing Machinery's Grace Murray Hopper Award in 1982. Reid presented a paper describing Scribe in the same conference session in 1981 in which Charles Goldfarb presented Generalized Markup Language (GML), the immediate predecessor of SGML. Slide presentation (PowerPoint) Career From 1980‚Äì1987, he was an assistant professor of electrical engineering at Stanford University in the computer systems laboratory. There he was a recipient of the Presidential Young Investigator Award in 1984, working along with other new faculty such as John L. Hennessy, David R. Cheriton, and Mark Horowitz. Along with faculty such as Susan Owicki, Forest Baskett, and James H. Clark, his research concerned the connection of Stanford to the Internet, and the development of the SUN workstation. As the Stanford University Network attracted attacks, he became interested in possible network defenses. He left Stanford in 1987, he was immediately hired by the Digital Equipment Corporation, first in the Western Research Laboratory (DEC WRL) under Forest Baskett in Palo Alto, California. Reid and Paul Vixie developed one of the first connections between a corporate network and the Internet, known as \\"Gatekeeper\\" after the character in the Ghostbusters film. The protection techniques developed evolved into what is now called a network firewall. Some early Internet attackers (such as Kevin Mitnick) would impersonate Reid in telephone calls in attempts to gain trust. He experimented with electronic publishing with his USENET Cookbook project. In 1987, he and John Gilmore created the alt.* hierarchy on Usenet. He also created and ran the \\"USENET readership report\\", which sampled the reading habits of volunteer news readers, tried to extrapolate them across the entire population of the USENET, and reported them monthly to the news.lists newsgroup. In 1995 he became director of his own group, the Network Systems Laboratory (DEC NSL). The DEC NSL developed one of the largest Internet exchange points as the Internet became available for commercial use in the 1990s. One of his employees was Anita Borg, who founded the group Systers and the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing while at NSL. DEC NSL and WRL developed AltaVista, one of the first web search engines. In 1998, he was invited to give a keynote talk at the Markup Technologies conference, discussing 20 years of history in the technology. In 1999, he left DEC to work at Bell Labs' Silicon Valley site until it was shut down. In February 2001, he taught for one year at the Carnegie Mellon Silicon Valley campus of CMU.  Google In June 2002, Reid became director of operations at Google. His only written review was from Wayne Rosing, which was positive. In October 2003 he was moved to a program with no funding and no staff, while his former duties were taken over by Urs H√∂lzle, who was 15 years younger. He was fired by Larry Page (who was 30 at the time) in February 2004, after being told he was not a \\"cultural fit\\" by Rosing, and that his ideas were \\"too old to matter\\" by H√∂lzle, according to Reid. It was nine days before the company's initial public offering (IPO) was announced, allegedly costing him 119,000 stock options with a strike price of $0.30, which would have been worth approximately $10 million at the $85 IPO price. Reid estimated that given later appreciation, his unvested stock options would have been worth at least $45 million if he had stayed there. Legal case After retaining Duane Morris as counsel, Reid proceeded to sue Google in July 2004 for discrimination on the basis of age and disability. He was 52 years old and had been diagnosed as having diabetes while at Google. Google retained Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, which defended the case on the grounds that Reid was allegedly told he was not a \\"cultural fit\\". In September 2005, the Santa Clara Superior Court initially granted summary judgment against him. On October 4, 2007, the California Sixth District Court of Appeal overturned the lower court's verdict and allowed the lawsuit to proceed. Google appealed that decision to the California Supreme Court, which granted review in February 2008. Case review The court granted review to decide two questions, one substantive and one procedural: (1) should an employee be allowed to sue an employer for hostile \\"stray remarks\\" by employees who were not directly involved in the allegedly discriminatory decision at issue; and (2) are specific objections to evidence at the summary judgment stage waived when the trial court fails to rule on specific objections despite oral requests that the trial court do so. The parties thoroughly briefed the issues on the merits; next, the court sat on the case for more than a year; then asked for further supplemental briefing from the parties in April 2010 on the procedural question; and finally scheduled oral argument for May 26, 2010. On August 5, 2010, in an opinion by Justice Ming Chin, the court affirmed the Court of Appeal decision in favor of Reid and remanded to the lower courts for further proceedings. The Court refused to adopt the \\"stray remarks\\" doctrine pioneered by U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, because remarks by non-decisionmakers may be circumstantial evidence relevant to discriminatory actions (in the sense that hostile co-workers can manipulate a supervisor); and written objections to evidence are preserved for appeal regardless of whether the trial court rules upon them or whether counsel even argues them orally before the court. In other words, Google won on the procedural question, but Reid won on the substantive question, meaning that he would be able to introduce a much broader range of evidence of Google's alleged atmosphere of discrimination to the trier of fact. The case attracted media attention, with briefs filed by the AARP on Reid's behalf and the California Employment Law Council for Google. The case was settled out of court for undisclosed terms. From July 2005 to 2019, Reid worked at the Internet Systems Consortium, with various titles including head of engineering, operations, and communication.https://www.isc.org/blogs/2019-in-review/ Personal life Reid is an active photographer and has sponsored the Leica User's Group, an e-mail discussion list, for almost two decades. Reid is a practicing Anglican and president of the Society of Archbishop Justus. He is an editor of Anglicans Online and sits on the board of Doane Academy, an Episcopal Pre K-12 school in Burlington, New Jersey.

She was a friend of noted artists and writers of the day, including John Singer Sargent, James McNeill Whistler, Dennis Miller Bunker, Anders Zorn, Henry James, Okakura Kakuzo and Francis Marion Crawford. Gardner created much fodder for the gossip columns of the day with her reputation for stylish tastes and unconventional behavior. The Boston society pages called her by many names, including \\"Belle,\\" \\"Donna Isabella,\\" \\"Isabella of Boston,\\" and \\"Mrs. Jack\\". Her surprising appearance at a 1912 concert (at what was then a very formal Boston Symphony Orchestra) wearing a white headband emblazoned with \\"Oh, you Red Sox\\" was reported at the time to have \\"almost caused a panic\\", and remains still in Boston one of the most talked about of her eccentricities. Biography Isabella Stewart Gardner, 1888 painting by John Singer Sargent Isabella Stewart was born in New York City on April 14, 1840, the daughter of wealthy linen-merchant David Stewart and Adelia Stewart (n√©e Smith).Gardner, Frank A MD [1933] Gardner Memorial : Biographical and Genealogical Record of the Descendants of Thomas Gardner, Planter of Cape Ann, 1624, Salem, 1626‚Äì74, Through His Son Lieut. George Gardner She grew up in Manhattan. From age five to fifteen she attended a nearby academy for girls where she studied art, music, and dance, as well as French and Italian. Attendance at Grace Church exposed her to religious art, music and ritual. At age 16, she and her family moved to Paris where she was enrolled in a school for American girls; her classmates included members of the wealthy Gardner family of Boston. In 1857 she was taken to Italy and in Milan saw Gian Giacomo Poldi Pezzoli's collection of Renaissance art arranged in rooms designed to recall historical eras. She said at the time that if she were ever to inherit some money, she would have a similar house for people to visit and enjoy. She returned to New York in 1858.Anne Hawley and Alexander Wood, \\"A sketch of the life of Isabella Stewart Gardner\\" in Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum: Daring by Design (2014), New York: Skira Rizzoli Publications, pp. 14 et seq. Shortly after returning, her former classmate Julia Gardner invited her to Boston, where she met Julia's brother John Lowell \\"Jack\\" Gardner. Three years her senior, he was the son of John L. and Catharine E. (Peabody) Gardner, and one of Boston's most eligible bachelors. They married in Grace Church on April 10, 1860, and then lived in a house that Isabella's father gave them, at 152 Beacon Street in Boston. They resided there for the rest of Jack's life. Louise Hall Tharp, \\"Mrs. Jack\\", Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, 1965 Jack and Isabella had one son, born on June 18, 1863; he died from pneumonia on March 15, 1865. A year later Isabella suffered a miscarriage and was told she could not bear any more children. Her close friend and sister-in-law died about the same time. Gardner became extremely depressed and withdrew from society. On the advice of doctors, she and Jack traveled to Europe in 1867. Isabella was so ill that she had to be taken aboard the ship on a stretcher. The couple spent almost a year traveling, visiting Scandinavia and Russia but spending most of their time in Paris. The trip had the desired effect on Isabella's health and became a turning point in her life. It was on this trip that she began her lifelong habit of keeping scrapbooks of her travels. Upon her return, she began to establish her reputation as a fashionable, high-spirited socialite. In 1875 Jack's brother, Joseph P. Gardner, died, leaving three young sons. Jack and Isabella \\"adopted\\" and raised the boys. Augustus P. Gardner was 10 years old at the time. Isabella's biographer, Morris Carter, wrote that \\"in her duty to these boys, she was faithful and conscientious\\". Travel and collecting Isabella Stewart Gardner in Venice (1894), by Anders Zorn (Gardner Museum) In 1874, Isabella and Jack Gardner visited the Middle East, Central Europe and Paris. Beginning in the late 1880s, they traveled frequently across America, Europe and Asia to discover foreign cultures and expand their knowledge of art around the world. Jack and Isabella would take more than a dozen trips abroad over the years, keeping them out of the country for a total of ten years.Rosemary Matthews, . \\"Collectors and why they collect: Isabella Stewart Gardner and her museum of art.\\" Journal of the History of Collections 21.2 (2009): 183-189. The earliest works in the Gardners' collection were accumulated during their trips to Europe especially. In 1891, she started to focus on European fine art after inheriting $1.75 million from her father. One of her first acquisitions was The Concert by Vermeer (c. 1664), purchased at a Paris auction house in 1892. She also collected from other places abroad such as Egypt, Turkey, and the Far East. The Gardners began to collect in earnest in the late 1890s, rapidly building a world-class collection primarily of paintings and statues, but also tapestries, photographs, silver, ceramics and manuscripts, and architectural elements such as doors, stained glass, and mantelpieces. In the early years of the 20th century, Isabella traveled with friend and Boston architect Edmund March Wheelwright to collect for the Harvard Lampoon Building, also called \\"Lampoon Castle\\", a faux Flemish castle in Harvard Square. Isabella donated many pieces of art to the castle over her years of collecting. The value of this collection is uncertain, due to the secret nature of the Lampoon. Nearly seventy works of art in her collection were acquired with the help of dealer Bernard Berenson. Among the collectors with whom she competed was Edward Perry Warren, who supplied a number of works to the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. The Gardner collection includes works by some of Europe's most important artists, such as Botticelli's Madonna and Child with an Angel, Titian's Europa, Raphael's The Colonna Altarpiece, and Diego Vel√°zquez. She purchased some of her collection on her own, but often asked for male colleagues, such as her business partner, to purchase on her behalf as it was uncommon for women to participate in art collecting. Isabella Stewart Gardner's favorite foreign destination was Venice, Italy. The Gardners regularly stayed at the Palazzo Barbaro, a major artistic center for a circle of American and English expatriates in Venice, and visited Venice's artistic treasures with amateur artist and former Bostonian Ralph Curtis. While in Venice, Gardner bought art and antiques, attended the opera and dined with expatriate artists and writers. Museum creation By 1896, Isabella and Jack Gardner recognized that their house on Beacon Street in Boston's Back Bay, although enlarged once, was not sufficient to house their growing collection of art, including works by Botticelli, Vermeer, and Rembrandt. After Jack's sudden death in 1898, Isabella realized their shared dream of building a museum for their treasures. She purchased land for the museum in the marshy Fenway area of Boston, and hired architect Willard T. Sears to build a museum modeled on the Renaissance palaces of Venice. Gardner was deeply involved in every aspect of the design, though, leading Sears to quip that he was merely the structural engineer making Gardner's design possible. The building completely surrounds a glass-covered garden courtyard, the first of its kind in America. Gardner intended the second and third floors to be galleries. A large music room originally spanned the first and second floors on one side of the building, but Gardner later split the room to make space to display a large John Singer Sargent painting called El Jaleo on the first floor and tapestries on the second floor.Hilliard T. Goldfarb, The Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum: a companion guide and history (Yale UP, 1995). After the building was ready, Gardner spent a year carefully installing her collection according to her personal aesthetic. The eclectic gallery installations, paintings, sculpture, textiles, and furniture from different periods and cultures combine to create a rich, complex and unique narrative. In the Titian Room, Titian's masterpiece The Rape of Europa (1561‚Äì1562) hangs above a piece of pale green silk, which had been cut from one of Isabella Stewart Gardner's gowns designed by Charles Frederick Worth. Throughout the collection, similar stories, intimate portrayals, and discoveries abound.Anne Higonnet, \\"Private museums, public leadership: Isabella Stewart Gardner and the art of cultural authority.\\" in Cultural Leadership in America: Art Matronage and Patronage ed by Wanda Corn (1997) 84 The museum privately opened on January 1, 1903, with a grand opening celebration featuring a performance by members of the Boston Symphony Orchestra and a menu that included champagne and doughnuts. It opened to the public months later with a variety of paintings, drawings, furniture and other objects dating from ancient Egypt to Matisse. The museum is still arranged with a variety of textiles, furniture, and paintings floor to ceiling.Litowitz, 2007, \\"The Character of an Art Collection\\", Growth and Structure of Cities Program, Bryn Mawr College, Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania Illness and death Sargent Gardner family tomb, Mount Auburn Cemetery In 1919, Isabella Stewart Gardner suffered the first of a series of strokes and died five years later, on July 17, 1924, at the age of 84. She is buried in the Gardner family tomb at Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, between her husband and her son.Wilson, Scott.

Legacy After Gardner's death, the fourth floor served as residence for the museum's director over sixty years. While alive, Gardner herself would use the fourth floor for her residence. When Anne Hawley became director, she decided not to live there. Six months after Anne took office, the museum was robbed. More recently, it has been converted for use as museum offices. Her will created an endowment of $1 million and outlined stipulations for support of the museum, including that the permanent collection not be significantly altered. In keeping with her philanthropic nature, her will also left sizable bequests to the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, Industrial School for Crippled and Deformed Children, Animal Rescue League of Boston, and Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. A devout Anglo-Catholic, she requested in her will that the Cowley Fathers celebrate an annual Memorial Requiem Mass for the repose of her soul in the museum chapel. This duty is now performed each year on her birthday and alternates between the Society of St. John the Evangelist and the Church of the Advent.Mrs. Gardner's annual claim on heaven Isabella Stewart Gardner was an intimate patroness of many artists, writers, and musicians. An accomplished traveler and shrewd collector, she was a leading figure in American social and cultural life. In Boston they called her the \\"Queen of the Back Bay.\\" Paul R. Baker, \\"Gardner, Isabella Stewart\\" in John A. Garraty, Encyclopedia of American Biography (1974), pp 400-401 The site of her former home (demolished in 1904) is a stop on the Boston Women's Heritage Trail.

A view of Blackwater Falls State Park The Environment of West Virginia encompasses terrain and ecosystems ranging from plateaus to mountains. Most of West Virginia lies within the Appalachian mixed mesophytic forests ecoregion, while the higher elevations along the eastern border and in the panhandle lie within the Appalachian-Blue Ridge forests. West Virginia is situated in the Appalachian Mountains of the Upper South region of the 48 contiguous states. Usually considered part of the South Eastern United States, West Virginia is bounded on the northeast by Pennsylvania and Maryland, on the southeast by Virginia, on the northwest by Ohio, and on the southwest by Kentucky. A portion of the Appalachian Mountains stretches into eastern West Virginia, and in the state's northeastern corner, Spruce Knob is officially regarded as the tallest mountain in the Allegheny Mountains, a vast section of the Appalachians.

Address: Mont Chateau Research Center, 1 Mont Chateau Road, Morgantown, WV 26508-8079 http://www.wvgs.wvnet.edu/www/geology/geolphyp.htm Prior to one billion years ago, the geologic history of West Virginia is obscure. Sometime between about 1,100 and 800 million years ago, lava was deposited in the extreme eastern part of the State forming our oldest exposed rock, the Catoctin Greenstone. Later, perhaps about 800 million years ago, a narrow trough began to form in extreme eastern West Virginia. An arm of the sea entered and sediments accumulated. As time went on, this shallow sea transgressed westward. By the end of Cambrian time, about 300 million years later, this shallow sea covered essentially all of West Virginia. Marine deposition took place throughout most of this and the succeeding Ordovician Period. During this total interval of about 370 million years, most of the rocks exposed in Jefferson and eastern Berkeley counties and in scattered areas southwestward along the Virginia boundary were deposited. Rocks of the same age are found in abundance in the deep wells throughout the State. The Taconic Orogeny near the end of Ordovician time formed a high mountainous area east of West Virginia. During Middle and Late Devonian time the Acadian Orogeny, with the main uplift to the northeast, resulted in a further source for the predominantly clastic marine deposits of these epochs. However, near the end of Devonian time, the sea was rapidly retreating westward and the continental red beds of the Hampshire Formation were being deposited over most of the State. The sea made one more important intrusion into West Virginia during Middle Mississippian time, approximately 330 million years ago, resulting in the deposition of the Greenbrier Formation, predominantly limestone, the last marine deposit of significance in the State. At the close of Mississippian time, about 310 million years ago, West Virginia was essentially a land area, subject to erosion. Early in the succeeding Pennsylvanian Period, the area dropped to near sea level and for more than 50 million years continued to sink at about the same rate that deposition was taking place. Permian Period, roughly 270 to 225 million years ago, the Appalachian Orogeny began which played a major part in the formation of the Appalachian Mountains as we know them today. Never again has the sea invaded West Virginia. The oldest evidences of life found in West Virginia occur in rocks about 600 million years old, in the Antietam Formation of Lower Cambrian age. However, in this formation they are abundant and of forms that had already developed through a substantial part of all evolution that has taken place during the history of the earth. Evidences of life in other parts of the earth are found in rocks at least 3 billion years old. Fossils are found in increasing abundance and increasing stages of evolutional development in the rocks of all ages since earliest Cambrian time.  Fauna  The life zones of West Virginia transitions from large low-land farming valleys bordered with forest and meadow to high-land ridge flats and heavy forestlands, some with rocky ridge-line peaks. The geology allows for a diversity of habitats. The \\"Mountain State\\" harbors at least 56 species and subspecies of mammals. The state has more than 300 types of birds and more than 100 species of fish. Many common Insects of the Eastern United States can be found in West Virginia. The state's beetle number about 15 species with more than 70 species of Odonate, some 18 species of spiders and a dozen species of Stonefly. There are about 17 Moth species. There are a little over seven dozen Cave invertebrate species. The West Virginia Division of Wildlife (WVDNR) uses hunting and fishing license fees for wildlife habitat conservation.West Virginia Division of Wildlife  Flora  The Allegheny and Cumberland Plateaus of West Virginia are predominantly covered by hardwood forests, but along the Ohio River and its principal tributaries, the valuable timber has been removed and considerable areas have been wholly cleared over the centuries for farming and pasture lands. Among the most prevalent trees of this region are the chestnut oaks, the walnut, the yellow poplar, and the cherry. Southern West Virginia contains the largest reserve supply of timber. In the Ridge-and-Valley region of the Appalachian Mountains, the Eastern Panhandle and Potomac Highlands have a forest covering similar to that of the plateau region, however between these two areas of hardwood there is a long belt where spruce and white pine cover the mountain ridges. Other trees common in the state are the persimmon, sassafras, and, in the Ohio and Potomac Valley regions, the American sycamore. Hickory, chestnut, locust, maple, beech, dogwood, and pawpaw are widely distributed throughout the state as well. Among the state's common shrubs and vines are the blackberry, black and red raspberry, gooseberry, huckleberry, hazel, and wild grape. Ginseng is an important medicinal plant that is harvested primarily in West Virginia's southern regions. Wild ginger, elder, and sumach are common, and deep in the mountainous areas, rhododendrons, mountain laurel, and azaleas grow in abundance.

It was established in November 1989 as the Stonewall Youth Project by members of the LGBT community in Edinburgh. In April 2003 Stonewall Youth Project became a national organisation and was incorporated as a company limited by guarantee with charitable status under the name by which it is known today. History LGBT Youth Scotland was originally founded in Edinburgh in 1989 as Stonewall Youth Project. In 2003 it was renamed as LGBT Youth Scotland and became a national organisation for young LGBT people.Timeline of OurStory: Diverse Histories of Scotland Organisation and funding LGBT Youth Scotland is based in Edinburgh and also has offices in Glasgow and Dumfries.Contact  LGBT Youth Scotland  LGBT Youth Scotland James Rennie was appointed its first chief executive in 2003, having worked with the organisation from 1997 to 2008. Rennie was dismissed from his post after a Lothian and Borders Police investigation and trial found him guilty of running Scotland's largest paedophile network using company resources and possessing child pornography in 2009. The organisation distanced itself from Rennie and subsequently appointed Fergus McMillan to the position who served for eleven years from 2008 to 2019. Since September 2019, the organisation has been led by chief executive Mhairi Crawford. The organisation is mainly funded by the state, with over ¬£700,000 of its ¬£1.2 million 2018-19 income coming from the Scottish Government, local councils and the National Health Service. Non-state donors include BBC Children in Need and the Big Lottery Fund. It employs 42 staff.  Programmes  Services provided by LGBT Youth Scotland include: Direct Services for LGBT young people including support groups, advice and support, events and volunteering, National Projects including LGBT History Month, Policy work, Research, Training for Professionals. In November 2008, LGBT Youth Scotland began providing volunteering opportunities for those over the age of 26 as a part of the National Development Team's Capacity Building Project. Unlike many youth- steered organisations, LGBT Youth Scotland is not completely peer led, and relies upon experienced volunteers and paid staff to keep services running. The organisation is one of the largest employers in Scotland within the LGBT sector with over 30 full-time paid staff members, with many more part-time staff and volunteers. LGBT young people are involved directly by their formation and support of Scotland's LGBT National Youth Council (NYC). The NYC is made up of elected youth representatives from all across Scotland, and is responsible for gathering the views, issues and aspirations of Scotland's LGBT youth population in order to feed them back to the people who can make a real difference, such as MSPs and local authorities. It brings together youth groups as well as individuals under one umbrella organisation. The service users elect two members of the Scottish Youth Parliament. In 2004 the youth volunteers of the organisation won the Philip Lawrence Award for Community Safety. LGBT Youth Scotland's Charter encourages and enables organisations and, since 2014, schools to proactively include LGBTI people in every aspect of their work - with the aim of protecting staff and demonstrating a commitment to the provision of high quality services to customers, students, and service users.

Most session fixation attacks are web based, and most rely on session identifiers being accepted from URLs (query string) or POST data.  Attack scenarios  Alice has an account at the bank \`http://unsafe.example.com/\` Mallory intends to target Alice's money from her bank. Alice has a reasonable level of trust in Mallory, and will visit links Mallory sends her.  A simple attack scenario  Straightforward scenario: # Mallory has determined that \`http://unsafe.example.com/\` accepts any session identifier, accepts session identifiers from query strings and has no security validation. \`http://unsafe.example.com/\` is thus not secure. # Mallory sends Alice an e-mail: \\"Hey, check this out, there is a cool new account summary feature on our bank, \`http://unsafe.example.com/?SID=I_WILL_KNOW_THE_SID\`\\". Mallory is trying to fixate the SID to \`I_WILL_KNOW_THE_SID\`. # Alice is interested and visits \`http://unsafe.example.com/?SID=I_WILL_KNOW_THE_SID\`. The usual log-on screen pops up, and Alice logs on. # Mallory visits \`http://unsafe.example.com/?SID=I_WILL_KNOW_THE_SID\` and now has unlimited access to Alice's account.  Attack using server generated SID  A misconception is that if a server only accepts server-generated session identifiers, it is safe from fixation. This is false. Scenario: # Mallory visits \`http://vulnerable.example.com/\` and checks which SID is returned. For example, the server may respond: \`Set-Cookie: SID=0D6441FEA4496C2\`. # Mallory is now able to send Alice an e-mail: \\"Check out this new cool feature on our bank, \`http://vulnerable.example.com/?SID=0D6441FEA4496C2\`.\\" # Alice logs on, with fixated session identifier \`SID=0D6441FEA4496C2\`. # Mallory visits \`http://vulnerable.example.com/?SID=0D6441FEA4496C2\` and now has unlimited access to Alice's account.  Attacks using cross-subdomain cookie  This is like cross-site cookie, except that it does not rely on browser vulnerabilities. Rather, it relies on the fact that wildcard cookies can be set by one subdomain that affect other subdomains. Scenario: # A web site \`www.example.com\` hands out subdomains to untrusted third parties # One such party, Mallory, who now controls \`evil.example.com\`, lures Alice to his site # A visit to \`evil.example.com\` sets a session cookie with the domain \`.example.com\` on Alice's browser # When Alice visits \`www.example.com\`, this cookie will be sent with the request, as the specs for cookies states, and Alice will have the session specified by Mallory's cookie. # If Alice now logs on, Mallory can use her account. Each of these attack scenarios has a result where Mallory has successfully gained access to the functions and data normally reserved for Alice. An alternative attack scenario does not require Alice to log into a site. Rather, simply by fixing the session, Mallory may be able to spy on Alice and abuse the data she enters. For example, Mallory may use the above attacks to give Alice her own authenticated session‚Äîso Alice will start using the site with all the authentication of Mallory. If Alice decides to purchase something on this site and enters her credit card details, Mallory might be able to retrieve that data (or other confidential data) by looking through the historical data stored for the account. This type of Session Fixation exploitation differs from the \\"classic\\" exploitation scenarios, since it happens in the unauthenticated part of an application or reverses the authentication (attacker logging victim in).Article about unauthenticated Session-Fixation attacks  Countermeasures = Do not accept session identifiers from GET / POST variables  Session identifiers in URL (query string, GET variables) or POST variables are not recommended as they simplify this attack - it is easy to make links or forms that set GET / POST variables. * The SID is leaked to other people as users cut & paste \\"interesting links\\" from the address bar into chats, forums, communities, etc. * The SID is stored in many places (browser history log, web server log, proxy logs, ...) Note: Cookies are shared between tabs and popped up browser windows. If your system requires to be hit with the same domain (www.example.com/?code=site1 and www.example.com/?code=site2 ), cookies may conflict with one another between tabs. It may be required to send the session identifier on the URL in order to overcome this limitation. If possible use site1.example.com or site2.example.com so there is no domain conflicts in the cookies. This may incur costs with extra SSL certificates. This behavior can be seen on many sites by opening another tab and trying to do side by side search results. One of the sessions will become unusable. = Best solution: Identity confirmation = This attack can be largely avoided by changing the session ID when users log in. If every request specific to a user requires the user to be authenticated with (\\"logged into\\") the site, an attacker would need to know the id of the victim's log-in session. When the victim visits the link with the fixed session id, however, they will need to log into their account in order to do anything \\"important\\" as themselves. At this point, their session id will change, and the attacker will not be able to do anything \\"important\\" with the anonymous session ID. A similar technique can be used to solve the phishing problem. If the user protects their account with two passwords, then it can be solved to a great extent. This technique is also useful against cross-site request forgery attacks. = Solution: Store session identifiers in HTTP cookies = The session identifier on most modern systems is stored by default in an HTTP cookie, which has a moderate level of security as long as the session system disregards GET/POST values. However, this solution is vulnerable to cross-site request forgery, and it does not meet the statelessness requirement of REST. = Solution: Utilize SSL / TLS session identifier = When enabling HTTPS security, some systems allow applications to obtain the SSL / TLS session identifier. Use of the SSL/TLS session identifier is very secure, but many web development languages do not provide robust built-in functionality for this.  Regenerate SID on each request  A countermeasure against session fixation is to generate a new session identifier (SID) on each request. If this is done, then even though an attacker may trick a user into accepting a known SID, the SID will be invalid when the attacker attempts to re-use the SID. Implementation of such a system is simple, as demonstrated by the following: * Get previous Session Identifier \`OLD_SID\` from HTTP request. * If \`OLD_SID\` is null, empty, or no session with SID=\`OLD_SID\` exists, create a new session. * Generate new session identifier \`NEW_SID\` with a secure random number generator. * Let session be identified by SID=\`NEW_SID\` (and no longer by SID=\`OLD_SID\`) * Transmit new SID to client. Example: If Mallory successfully tricks Alice into visiting \`http://victim.example.com/?SID=I_KNOW_THE_SID\`, this HTTP request is sent to \`victim.example.com\`: GET /?SID=I_KNOW_THE_SID HTTP/1.1 Host: victim.example.com \`victim.example.com\` accepts \`SID=I_KNOW_THE_SID\`, which would normally be bad. However, \`victim.example.com\` is secure because it performs session regeneration. \`victim.example.com\` gets the following response: HTTP/1.1 200 OK Set-Cookie: SID=3134998145AB331F Alice will now use \`SID=3134998145AB331F\` that is unknown to Mallory, and \`SID=I_KNOW_THE_SID\` is invalid. Mallory is thus unsuccessful in the session fixation attempt. Unfortunately session regeneration is not always possible. Problems are known to occur when third-party software such as ActiveX or Java applets are used, and when browser plugins communicate with the server. Third-party software could cause logouts, or the session could be split into two separate sessions. If the implementation of sessions includes transmitting the SID through GET or POST variables, then this might also render the \\"back\\" button in most browsers unusable, as the user would then be using an older, invalid, session identifier from a previous request.  Accept only server-generated SIDs  One way to improve security is not to accept session identifiers that were not generated by the server. However, as noted above, this does not prevent all session fixation attacks. if (!isset($_SESSION['SERVER_GENERATED_SID'])) { session_destroy(); // Destroy all data in session } session_regenerate_id(); // Generate a new session identifier $_SESSION['SERVER_GENERATED_SID'] = true;  Logout function  A logout function is useful as it allows users to indicate that a session should not allow further requests. Thus attacks can only be effective while a session is active. Note that the following code performs no Cross-site request forgery checks, potentially allowing an attacker to force users to log out of the web application. if (logout) { session_destroy(); // Destroy all data in session }  Time-out old SIDs  This defense is simple to implement and has the advantage of providing a measure of protection against unauthorized users accessing an authorized user's account by using a machine that may have been left unattended. Store a session variable containing a time stamp of the last access made by that SID. When that SID is used again, compare the current timestamp with the one stored in the session. If the difference is greater than a predefined number, say 5 minutes, destroy the session. Otherwise, update the session variable with the current timestamp.  Destroy session if Referrer is suspicious  When visiting a page, most web browsers will set the Referrer header - the page that contained the link that you followed to get to this page. When the user is logged into a site that is not likely to be linked to from outside that site (e.g., banking websites, or webmail), and the site is not the kind of site where users would remain logged in for any great length of time, the Referrer should be from that site. Any other Referrer should be considered suspicious. However, if the originating request is from a HTTPS page, then the referrer will be stripped, so you cannot depend on this security system. For example, \`http://vulnerable.example.com/\` could employ the following security check: if (strpos($_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER'], 'http://vulnerable.example.com/') ! 0) { session_destroy(); // Destroy all data in session } session_regenerate_id(); // Generate a new session identifier  Verify that additional information is consistent throughout session  One way to further improve security is to ensure that the user appears to be the same end user (client). This makes it a bit harder to perform session fixation and other attacks. As more and more networks begin to conform to RFC 3704 and other anti-spoofing practices, the IP address becomes more reliable as a \\"same source\\" identifier. Therefore, the security of a web site can be improved by verifying that the source IP address is consistent throughout a session. This could be performed in this manner: if ($_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'] != $_SESSION['PREV_REMOTEADDR']) { session_destroy(); // Destroy all data in session } session_regenerate_id(); // Generate a new session identifier $_SESSION['PREV_REMOTEADDR'] = $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']; However, there are some points to consider before employing this approach. * Several users may share one IP address. It is not uncommon for an entire building to share one IP address using NAT. * One user may have an inconsistent IP address. This is true for users behind proxies (such as AOL customers). It is also true for some mobile/roaming users, as well as users that are behind load balanced Internet connections. Users with IPv6 Privacy Extensions enabled may also change their IPv6 privacy addresses at any time. * It will not work reliably with dual stack clients as requests will move between IPv4 and IPv6. * It will not work reliably with mobile users, as mobile users roam between addresses as well. For some sites, the added security outweighs the lack of convenience, and for others it does not. = User Agent = Browsers identify themselves by \\"User-Agent\\" HTTP headers. This header does not normally change during use; it would be extremely suspicious if that were to happen. A web application might make use of User-Agent detection in attempt to prevent malicious users from stealing sessions. This however is trivial to bypass, as an attacker can easily capture the victim's user-agent with their own site and then spoof it during the attack. This proposed security system is relying on security through obscurity. if ($_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'] != $_SESSION['PREV_USERAGENT']) { session_destroy(); // Destroy all data in session } session_regenerate_id(); // Generate a new session identifier $_SESSION['PREV_USERAGENT'] = $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT']; However, there are some points to consider before employing this approach. * Several users may have same browser User Agent in Internet caf√©. * Several users may have same default browser (ex: Internet Explorer 6 in Windows XP SP3 or mini browser in mobile phone). But User Agent may change legally in few cases. Following examples are the same users. * A smartphone whose screen rotated since the last request ** ** * Internet Explorer compatibility mode: ** ** * A user accessing a web site through a proxy distributed across multiple servers, not all of which are upgraded to the latest version of the proxy software ** **  Defense in depth  Defense in depth is to combine several countermeasures. The idea is simple: if one obstacle is trivial to overcome, several obstacles could be very hard to overcome. A defense in depth strategy could involve: * Enable HTTPS (to protect against other problems) * Correct configuration (do not accept external SIDs, set time-out, etc.) * Perform session_regeneration, support log-out, etc. HTTP referrers are not passed with SSL/TLS (HTTPS). The following PHP script demonstrates several such countermeasures combined in a defense in depth manner: if (isset($_GET['LOGOUT'])  $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'] ! $_SESSION['PREV_REMOTEADDR']  $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'] ! $_SESSION['PREV_USERAGENT']) { session_destroy(); } session_regenerate_id(); // Generate a new session identifier $_SESSION['PREV_USERAGENT'] = $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT']; $_SESSION['PREV_REMOTEADDR'] = $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']; Note that this code checks the current REMOTE_ADDR (the user's IP address) and User-agent against the REMOTE_ADDR and User-agent of the previous request. This might be inconvenient for some sites as discussed above.

As a result, the foreign subjects are immune, for most civil and criminal purposes, from actions by courts and other governmental institutions in the state that makes the capitulation. Historical examples In Turkey arrangements termed capitulations, and treaties confirmatory of them, have been made between the Porte and other states by which foreigners resident in Turkey are subject to the laws of their respective countries. In the 9th century, the caliph Harun al-Rashid granted guarantees and commercial facilities to such Franks, subjects of the emperor Charlemagne, as should visit the East with the authorization of their emperor. After the break-up of the Frankish empire, similar concessions were made to some of the practically independent Italian city-states that grew up on its ruins. Thus, in 1098, the prince of Antioch granted a charter of this nature to the city of Genoa; the king of Jerusalem extended the same privilege to Venice in 1123 and to Marseille in 1136. Saladin, sultan of Babylon (Cairo), granted a charter to the town of Pisa in 1173. The Byzantine Emperors followed this example, and Genoa, Pisa and Venice all obtained capitulations. The explanation of the practice is to be found in the fact that the sovereignty of the state was held in those ages to apply only to its subjects; foreigners were excluded from its rights and obligations. The privilege of citizenship was considered too precious to be extended to the alien, who was long practically an outlaw. But when the numbers, wealth, and power of foreigners residing within the state became too great, it was found to be politic to subject them to some law, and it was held that this law should be their own. When the Turkish rule was substituted for that of the Byzantine emperors, the system already in existence was continued; the various non-Muslim peoples were allowed their semi-autonomy in matters affecting their personal status, and the Genoese of Galata were confirmed in their privileges. The treaty of 1641 between the Netherlands and Portugal contains the first European formula. Cromwell continued the commercial treaty policy partly in order to obtain a formal recognition of the Commonwealth from foreign powers. His treaty of 1654 with Sweden contains the first reciprocal most favored nation clause: Article IV provides that the people, subjects and inhabitants of either confederate shall have and possess in the countries, lands, dominions and kingdoms of the other as full and ample privileges, and as many exemptions, immunities and liberties, as any foreigner doth or shall possess in the dominions and kingdoms of the said confederate. The government of the Restoration replaced and enlarged the Protectorate arrangements by fresh agreements. The general policy of the Commonwealth was maintained, with further provisions on behalf of colonial trade. In the new treaty of 1661 with Sweden the privileges secured were those that any foreigner should enjoy in the dominions and kingdoms on both sides. The English capitulations date from 1569, and then secured the same treatment as the Venetians, French, Poles and the subjects of the emperor of Germany; they were revised in 1675, and as then settled were confirmed by treaties of subsequent date now and for ever. Swiss capitulations The extensive employment of Swiss mercenaries by the French monarchy between 1444 and 1792, was governed by contracts. Concluded between the French monarchy and individual Swiss cantons or noble families, these documents were known as \\"capitulations\\", because of a standard format which involved the division of the document into capitula (chapters). While differing in details, the usual agreement covered commitments such as the number of soldiers to be provided, payments or other benefits, and immunity from French law.

He chairs the academic board of the LIB-ERA! think tank and serves as Member of the Flemish Parliament for the liberal party List Dedecker. He is also a former president of the Belgian classical liberal think tank Nova Civitas. Boudewijn Bouckaert holds a PhD and teaches at the Law School of the University of Ghent, the University of Paris and the University of Aix- Marseille. He is director of the Department of Legal Theory and History at Ghent University and was chairperson of the European Master in Law and Economics program. He has been lecturer at the Institute for Humane Studies in Fairfax, Virginia, at the Institute for Economic Studies in Paris, France and also a visitor at Harvard University. He used to sit on the Belgian High Council for Judicial Matters and was chairman of the Land Management Committee. He is also a member of the international free-market group Mont Pelerin Society. In 2006, Boudewijn Bouckaert succeeded professor Matthias Storme as chairman of the Overlegcentrum van Vlaamse Verenigingen (OVV, or Meeting Association of Flemish Organizations), a flamingant organisation in Belgium. On 7 June 2007, his pregnant wife Katrien Van den Berghe died in Ghent University Hospital due to a cerebral hemorrhage. Their unborn son Elias could also not be saved.

A conflict ensued between Bouckaert and party chairman Bart Somers, which ended on 8 July 2005, when Bouckaert stepped down from the party board. After the dismissal of Jean-Marie Dedecker from the VLD, Hugo Coveliers, Dedecker and Boudewijn Bouckaert (and other Nova Civitas members) started negotiations to form a new right wing liberal party. Bouckaert handed in his party resignation on 27 October 2006, stating that the VLD \\"has become a left-liberal party that leans towards the SP.A.\\" The social democratic Different Socialist Party (SP.A) was a partner of the VLD from 1999 to 2007 in the Verhofstadt I and Verhofstadt II governments.

He completed a Bachelor of Fine Arts at the California Institute for the Arts, Valencia, California in 1979. His art covers a range of mediums working with video, sculpture, installation, performance and painting. The artist currently lives and works in New York City. He is married to painter Jacqueline Humphries. Early life and education Born in Manhattan in 1957, Oursler was brought up in Nyack, New York. At CalArts, his fellow students included Mike Kelley, Sue Williams, Stephen Prina and Jim Shaw. John Baldessari ‚Äî with whom he did an independent study ‚Äî and Laurie Anderson were teachers. Oursler moved back to New York in 1981 and was picked up by Electronic Arts Intermix. In 1999, Oursler moved to a studio near New York City Hall. Work= Single- channel tapes: 1977-1989 Tony Oursler is known for his fractured-narrative handmade video tapes including The Loner (1980) and EVOL (1984). Billy Rubin describes as EVOL ‚Äú(charting) the territory between our passion-charged personal narratives and the near impossibility of representing that desire visually or linguistically, the end result often being nothing more than banal cultural cliches.‚Äù These works involve elaborate sound tracks, painted sets, stop-action animation and optical special effects created by the artist. The early videotapes have been exhibited extensively in alternative spaces and museums. They are distributed by Electronic Arts Intermix.  Early installations Oursler's early installation works are immersive dark-room environments with video, sound, and language mixed with colorful constructed sculptural elements. In these projects, Oursler experimented with methods of removing the moving image from the video monitor using reflections in water, mirrors, glass and other devices. The early installation Son of Oil, presented at MoMA PS1 in 1982, links the dystopian feelings brought about by conspiracy theories with the perturbing politics of the oil industry. The large-scale installation L7-L5 deals with science fiction as entertainment in contradiction to the terror of first-hand accounts of alien encounters. It was presented at The Kitchen (New York) and the Stedelijk Museum (Amsterdam) in 1984. Spillchamber (1987) and Spillchamber 2 (1989) were displayed in New York and Japan.  Projection: 1991  Oursler began working with small LCD video projectors in 1991 in his installation The Watching presented at documenta 9, featuring his first video doll and dummy. This work utilizes handmade soft cloth figures combined with expressive faces animated by video projection. Oursler then produced a series of installations that combined found objects and video projections. Judy (1993) explored the relationship between multiple personality disorder and mass media. Get Away II features a passive/aggressive projected figure wedged under a mattress that confronts the viewer with blunt direct address. These installations led to great popular and critical acclaim. Signature works have been his talking lights, such as Streetlight (1997), his series of video sculptures of eyes with television screens reflected in the pupils, and ominous talking heads such as Composite Still Life (1999). An installation called Optics (1999) examines the polarity between dark and light in the history of the camera obscura. In his text \\"Time Stream,\\" Oursler proposed that architecture and moving image installation have been forever linked by the camera obscura noting that cave dwellers observed the world as projections via peep holes. The essay both presents a timeline of mimetic technology and serves as an archive of some of Oursler's own influences. Oursler's interest in the ephemeral history of the virtual image lead to large scale public projects and permanent installations by 2000.Fineartkmv.com  Public projects: 2000-2009  The Public Art Fund and Artangel commissioned the Influence Machine in 2000. This installation marks the artist's first major outdoor project and thematically traced the development of successive communication devices from the telegraph to the personal computer as a means of speaking with the dead. Oursler used smoke, trees and buildings as projection screens in Madison Square Park NYC and Soho Square London. He then completed a number of permanent public projects in Barcelona, New Zealand, Arizona including \\"Braincast\\" at the Seattle Public Library. Million Colors (2006) was commissioned by the state of Arizona for permanent display at the Phoenix Convention Center in downtown Phoenix, AZ. While researching this project, Oursler discovered that locals boast the canyons and desert are graded in more than a million different colors. Aurora sightings and surrounding mountains evoke the lawless and anarchic past of American culture, abandoned goldmines and violent desperadoes of the Wild West. Near Suspicion Mountain, where temperatures reach 110 degrees Fahrenheit, mirages are everyday occurrences. These distinct visual elements generate vivid accounts of UFO sightings and industrial-military conspiracy theories. Oursler steeped himself in the allure of the place and tried to give voice to the arid desert landscape. Narratives unique to the mysterious desert are reflected in the spoken texts of the installation, and the resulting collage of scripts performed by Arizona locals and immigrants is an attempt to let the colorful sedimentary history speak for itself. In 2009 he created a series of commissioned video installations at the Frank Sinatra School of the Arts in Astoria, New York. Tony Oursler:Monsters, Tony Oursler & √©ditions Take5  Public projects: 2010-2020  In 2013, the Ekebergparken Sculpture Park commissioned Oursler to create the permanent installation Klang. The installation took the form of three parts: Klang, a large-scale video cave, Spectral Power, an iconic talking lamppost, and Cognitive / Dissonance, two complementary tree projections. In 2014, Oursler simultaneously presented two large-scale installations in the Netherlands: X ergo Y at the Stedelijk Museum and I/O underflow at the Oude Kerk. I/O underflow was inspired in part by Alan Turing. Tear of the Cloud, commissioned by Public Art Fund, was presented at Riverside Park along the banks of the Hudson River in the summer of 2018. Technological developments in the region provided significant source material for the artist. The structure of the Internet, which blurs the boundary between culture and technology, is evident in the production of millions of bricks in Haverstraw, New York and the long-distance communication of the talking drum as a precursor to the invention of Morse code. The artist explores the composition of Samuel Morse‚Äôs last painting, The Muse, depicting his daughter Susan Walker Morse, uncannily foreshadowing the prototype of his first telegraph. 'The Headless Horseman and his horse are important references in Tear of the Cloud, as they gallop towards artificial intelligence, the chess-playing computer Deep Blue‚Äôs famous knight sacrifice, facial recognition technologies, and bots which have provoked significant questions about our future,' according to Oursler. He suggests connections between the recent DNA CRISPR-Cas encoding of Muybridge‚Äôs Horse in Motion, the birth of the film industry at the Black Maria studio, the actress and proto-feminist Pearl White‚Äôs early silent films created on the Palisades, and the first transistor invented a few miles away at Bell Labs. Mining progressive social movements, the work touches on the mid-19th century Oneida community, their attempts at free love and highly successful manufacturing of silverware and animal traps; the Seneca Falls Convention; counterculture musical and psychedelic experimentation at Woodstock; and the remixing of nascent hip-hop culture in the South Bronx. The river is also characterized by darker connotations including pesticides, PCBs, Indian Point Nuclear Power Plant, and Sybil‚Äôs Cave, where the infamous Mary Rogers murder occurred. Oursler will bring these images ‚Äì and more ‚Äì to life, through the meticulously produced digital projections that evoke the scenarios with kaleidoscopic wonder,‚Äù according to Lehmann Maupin. Oursler gave a talk on the piece at the New School, presented by the Public Art Fund. The piece was accompanied by a digitally published glossary of references.‚Äù 6th, commissioned by the Museum of Old and New Art and Dark Mofo, was presented in the summer of 2019 at the now-defunct Beaumaris Zoo in Hobart, Tasmania. The piece revisited the structure which once held the last living Tasmanian tiger, and projected images into cages to ‚Äúbear witness to a ‚Äòdigital de-extinction‚Äô of the legendary Tasmanian tiger via sweeping projections, sound and light,‚Äù as described by Dark Mofo. Concurrently, the nocturnal installation Beyond the Spectrum was presented at the Royal Tasmanian Botanical Gardens, which houses rare botanical specimens. The installation of 30 talking lights installed throughout the park was culled from the artist‚Äôs archive of more than 20 years of experimentation with the synchronization of light and sound. For this project, the lights were paired with specific plant species throughout the park to be discovered by the wandering viewer. Also in 2019, Oursler presented Eclipse at the Fondation Cartier in Paris, for the exhibition Trees. The piece incorporates ecological themes and the looming loss of the ‚Äúenchanted forest.‚Äù ÁîµÊµÅ (Current) (2019) is an installation piece spanning the Nanjing Eye Footbridge, a pedestrian walkway over the river.  Collaborations  While at California Institute of the Arts, Oursler founded the musical and performance group \\"Poetics\\" alongside fellow student Mike Kelley. The group included many collaborators over the years, such as John Miller, Jim Shaw, Mitchell Syrop, Bill Stobaugh, Don Kruger, Mark Madel, Art Byington, Dave Muller, Steven Vitiello, Bill Wintersole, Zoe Pettijohn, and Linda Post. In 1997‚Äì98, Kelley and Oursler presented the Poetics Project at Documenta X, as well as at venues in Los Angeles, New York, and Tokyo; through video projections, sound, and artworks, this installation re-created their experience at CalArts as members of a short-lived band. The installation is now on semi-permanent display in the collection of the Pompidou Centre. Oursler was a longtime friend of David Bowie and collaborated with him on several works. Oursler created the background videos that played at David Bowie's 50th birthday party concert in 1997. In 2000, Oursler and Bowie collaborated on the four-minute short film Empty, in which Bowie's disembodied head provided narration. Oursler made the video to accompany Bowie's January 2013 single \\"Where Are We Now?\\", and a piece showing two Bowie heads in conversation with each other for the 2013 \\"David Bowie Is\\" exhibit organized by the Victoria and Albert Museum. Oursler became friends with writer and artist Constance DeJong after he saw a performance of hers at the Minneapolis College of Art and Design in 1983. In 1986, they collaborated on Joyride. They then collaborated on the video and performance piece Relatives, first staged at The Kitchen in New York City in 1989. In 1995, DeJong and Oursler collaborated alongside musician Stephen Vitiello for their piece, ‚ÄúFantastic Prayers.‚Äù A CD-ROM of the project was released by Dia in 2000. DeJong is featured in The Watching, which was the first of Oursler‚Äôs works to project videos onto dolls, and was presented at documenta 9. She performs as Madame X in Oursler‚Äôs feature-length film Imponderable', presented at MoMa in 2016. The two have collaborated on numerous other occasions over the years. Oursler has long collaborated with former MIT professor, filmmaker, artist, and bank robber Joe Gibbons. The two met in 1984 and went on to share a house together in Jamaica Plain, Mass. while Oursler taught at the Massachusetts College of Art. In the late 1980s through the early ‚Äò90s Oursler and Gibbons produced a series of videos titled On Our Own. Oursler appears in Gibbons‚Äô feature film The Genius, alongside Karen Finley and Tony Conrad. Oursler‚Äôs lifelong friendship and creative partnership with Tony Conrad began in 1980.

Pride Air was based out of New Orleans International Airport (MSY). History 300px Pride Air was managed by several people who participated in an unsuccessful attempt to acquire Continental Airlines. Many of the investors were former Continental pilots who left the airline after Continental's first bankruptcy. They chose New Orleans (MSY) as a hub because there was no one dominant airline operating from the airport at that time. Pride Air management had previously considered Kansas City as possible hub but then reconsidered when Eastern Airlines began building up their service at Kansas City. Operations began on August 1, 1985. Pride Air did not initially offer service as a low-cost carrier and was instead structured more as a full service airline. However, due to increased competition from Continental Airlines in the New Orleans market in tandem with low initial passenger loads, Pride Air suspended operations on November 15, 1985, only three months after it began flying. The business plan for the airline centered on a hub operation in New Orleans which would link cities in California and Florida. Northeastern International Airways had previously tried this approach in New Orleans in 1984.http://www.departedflights.com, May 1, 1984 Northeastern International Airways system timetable Paul Eckel was the chairman and chief executive of Pride Air.

One of two Catholic high school in the state of Idaho, its school colors are black and gold and the mascot is a knight. History Bishop Kelly (\\"BK\\") opened its doors in the fall of 1964, succeeding St. Teresa's Academy, which had closed that spring. St. Teresa's Academy was Boise's first high school, private or public, established in 1890 by the Sisters of the Holy Cross as a high school and boarding school for young women. Later, St. Joseph's School was built to offer Catholic education to the young men of the area, with an elementary school occupying the lower level and a high school on the upper floor. In 1933, the two high schools joined to form the co-educational St. Teresa's Academy, which educated both Catholic and non-Catholic students until its closure in 1964. Boise's public high school was established in 1902. Namesake \\"BK\\" is named for Edward Joseph Kelly (1890‚Äì1956), the third Bishop of Boise and the first native of the Pacific Northwest to be appointed a bishop. Born in The Dalles, Oregon, he was ordained in 1917 and became Bishop of Boise at age 38 in 1928. Kelly served 28 years as bishop, until his death at age 66.

This colorless oily liquid has a bitter almond odor at higher concentration. Salicylaldehyde is a key precursor to a variety chelating agents, some of which are commercially important.  Production  Salicylaldehyde is prepared from phenol and chloroform by heating with sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide in a Reimer‚ÄìTiemann reaction: :Preparation of salicylaldehyde by the Reimer‚ÄìTiemann reaction Alternatively, it is produced by condensation of phenol or its derivatives with formaldehyde to give hydroxybenzyl alcohol, which is oxidized to the aldehyde. Salicylaldehydes in general may be prepared from the corresponding phenol by the Duff reaction, or by treatment with paraformaldehyde in the presence of magnesium chloride and a base.  Natural occurrences  Salicylaldehyde was identified as a characteristic aroma component of buckwheat. It is also one of the components of castoreum, the exudate from the castor sacs of the mature North American beaver (Castor canadensis) and the European beaver (Castor fiber), used in perfumery. Furthermore, salicylaldehyde occurs in the larval defensive secretions of several leaf beetle species that belong the subtribe Chrysomelina.Pauls, G., Becker, T., et al. (2016). Two Defensive Lines in Juvenile Leaf Beetles; Esters of 3-nitropropionic Acid in the Hemolymph and Aposematic Warning. Journal of Chemical Ecology 42 (3) 240-248. An example for a leaf beetle species that produces salicylaldehyde is the red poplar leaf beetle Chrysomela populi.  Reactions and applications  Salicylaldehyde is used to make the following: Catechol, benzofuran, a salicylaldehydimine (R = alkyl or aryl), 3-carbethoxycoumarin #Oxidation with hydrogen peroxide gives catechol (1,2-dihydroxybenzene) (Dakin reaction). #Etherification with chloroacetic acid followed by cyclisation gives the heterocycle benzofuran (coumarone). {The first step in this reaction to the substituted benzofuran is called the Rap‚ÄìStoermer condensation after E. Rap (1895) and R. Stoermer (1900). #Salicylaldehyde is converted to chelating ligands by condensation with amines. With ethylenediamine, it condenses to give the ligand salen. Hydroxylamine gives salicylaldoxime. #Condensation with diethyl malonate gives 3-carbethoxycoumarin (a derivative of coumarin) by an aldol condensation.

Under Morton's expertise, it passed the News circulation and he took over the News in the early 1970s and ran both as a bi-weekly operation until he closed the Portadown News. On Jim Morton's death, the Morton Newspaper Empire - which comprised around 22 titles in Northern Ireland, passed on to his son John who sold them to Scottish Radio, who consequently sold them on to Johnston Press.

Family life  Storme was born and raised in a Catholic family in the Belgian city of Ghent. His father Marcel Storme (b. 1930) used to be a university law professor, lecturing on the topic of Civil Procedure, and a member of the Belgian Senate (1977‚Äì1981) for the Flemish Christian Democrats. His grandfather August De Schryver (1898‚Äì1992) held several ministerships in many Belgian governments, including the Belgian Exile Government in London during World War II. He held his seat in the Belgian Chamber of Representatives until the late 1965. His other grandfather Jules Storme was professor at the University of Gent (Ghent).  Studies  Storme was educated at the Jesuit College in Ghent, the Sint-Barbaracollege (Latin- Greek Humanities 1970-1976) and was a boy scout in the Sint-Barbara group. He studied law and philosophy, first at the UFSIA in Antwerp (1976‚Äì1978) and further at the Catholic University of Leuven (1978‚Äì1981), where he obtained a master's degree in law. As a student in Leuven, he was active in the Flemish nationalist Katholiek Vlaams Hoogstudentenverbond (KVHV) of Leuven, as well as in the Royal Flemish Law Society (Koninklijk Vlaams Rechtgenootschap, ). He later became a member of K.A.V. Lovania Leuven, a catholic student fraternity that is affiliated to the Cartellverband der katholischen deutschen Studentenverbindungen. Storme also studied at Yale University in New Haven, completing a Master of Arts in philosophy (1982) as a Graduate Fellow of the Belgian American Educational Foundation. At Yale, he also was a member of the Party of the Right and the Calliopean Society. After his university years in the United States, he continued his higher education at Bologna University, Italy and at the Max Planck Institute for International and Foreign Private Law in Hamburg, Germany. He received his doctorate on contract law under professor Walter van Gerven, a former advocate-general to the Court of Justice of the European Communities in Luxembourg.  Professional life  Currently, Matthias Storme is a university professor attached to the University of Leuven and the University of Antwerp. His lectures include the topics of Civil Law, Bankruptcy Law, Comparative Law, Civil procedure and European Community Law. Outside the law school, he teaches a course on Comparative Religion and Ideology. He also writes for several academic and political magazines. As a member of the Brussels Bar, he was president of the Brussels Young Bar Association (Vlaams Pleitgenootschap bij de balie te Brussel) (1995), member of the Bar Council 1996-1998, and member of the General Council of the Flemish Bars 1998 tot 2000 (Orde van Vlaamse balies). He was three times asked to deliver the Opening lecture of the Bar, in Brussels in 1991, in Mechelen (Malines) in 2000 en in Oudenaarde (Audenaerde) in 2007. The latter discussed the legitimation of revolution and secession in history. Storme is now a senior partner lawyer in Ghent, (until 2013 in Brussels, often pleading before the Court of Arbitration, the Belgian court for constitutional and civil rights matters (now called the Constitutional Court). In 1999, Storme brought the Doel Case (a tiny Flemish village near the Scheldt river which was to be evacuated and destroyed in order to make the growth of the Antwerp port possible) to court on behalf of the local inhabitants, assigning the Flemish government. He also brought a case in 2007 before the Constitutional Court that seeks to overturn Belgian laws that he claims are limiting the exercise of freedom of speech. A similar lawsuit was started earlier by prominent Vlaams Belang members. Other cases before the Constitutional Court concern the modification of electoral laws, the protection of the professional privilege of lawyers against EU-legislation, etc.  Academic activities and influence  As a scholar, Matthias Storme publishes mainly in the field of private law and tries to enrich the Belgian law by integrating elements of comparative law. In his doctoral thesis on Good faith, he developed the theory of \\"burdens\\" (lasten) inspired by the German doctrine of Obliegenheiten. He developed the theory of confidence in private law, i.a. in his preadvice for the Vereniging voor de vergelijkende studie in Belgi√´ en Nederland. A lot of his work concerns a further systematisation of general concepts of patrimonial law, such as representation, authority to dispose, separate patrimonies and funds, trustlike concepts, property of securities and a systematical approach to security rights. He published articles in legal theory and legal history on the evolution of law, especially the development of law through case law and the juridification of society. He also published on questions of comparative law and constitutional law and writes a work on Legal Traditions and Systems of the World. He is an expert appointed by the Flemish Government in the Belgian Commission on the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities. From 1992 until the end of its activities in 2003, he was a member of the Commission on European Contract Law, the so-called Lando Commission,and he continues to be a member, since 2000, of the Study Group on a European Civil Code and the so-called European Acquis Group. These groups work together in writing a Draft \\"Common Frame of reference\\" for European Contract Law and more generally European Private Law (6th framework program of the European Union). Storme is a member of the 10-person \\"Compilation and redaction Team\\" finalising this draft. The interim version of the Draft CFR was published on 1 January 2008. Storme is also a member of the Acad√©mie des Privatistes Europ√©ens in Pavia. He helped to start the comparative law project \\"Trento common core project\\" directed by Ugo Mattei (University of Torino) and Mauro Bussani (University of Trento). He is one of the founders of the European Law Institute (ELI) in 2011. He is editor in chief (originally with Ewoud Hondius, since 2016 with Andr√© Janssen) of the European Review of Private Law, of which he was one of the founders in 1991. He is also member of the Board of Editors of the main private law journal in Belgium, the Tijdschrift voor Privaatrecht, and since 2014 one of the 2 directors of that review. He was a Board member of the Centrum Pieter Gillis, a thinktank on pluralism attached to the University of Antwerp and is since 2014 member of the Board of Unia, the Belgian agency on discrimination and equal opportunities. Awards In 2000, he received the Andr√© Demedts Award. Because of his efforts to promote liberty and political freedom, he was awarded the Prize of Liberty by the classic-liberal thinktank Nova Civitas in 2005. The Prize was awarded earlier to Luuk van Middelaar and to Ayaan Hirsi Ali and afterwards to senator Alain Destexhe (2006) and writer and journalist Derk Jan Eppink (2007). In 2006 he was nominated Honorary senator, i.e. a member of the European Honorary Senate of the Movement for a United States of Europe. Speeches In 1998 he delivered the annual speech to the Flemish Entreprise Association in Brussels (\\"V.E.V.-Comit√© Brussel\\"), defending Flemish secession from Belgium and independence as a member state of the European Union (23 September 1998. He lectured at several international law conferences (in Coimbra, New Orleans, Rouen, Groningen, Utrecht, Athens, Jerusalem, Budapest, Trento, Lille, Stellenbosch, Maastricht, Poitiers, Freiburg, Lleida, Salzburg, Porto, Trier, Luzern, M√ºnster, Tartu, etc.). In 2000 he delivered the opening speech of the Bar at Mechelen, pleading for a devolution of the judicial system from the federal state to the autonomous communities. At the Third Ethical Forum of the Fondation universitaire in Brussels on 25 November 2004 (organised by Philippe Van Parijs), he gave a speech on \\"Free speech and the ideology of multiculturalism\\". In 2005, when receiving the Prize of Liberty (\\"Prijs voor de vrijheid\\"), he held the traditional Gustave de Molinari lecture, in which he proclaimed that \\"the most fundamental freedom is the freedom to discriminate\\", directly attacking and rejecting the existing Belgian \\"totalitarian\\" legislation restricting freedom of choice in private relationships. In 2006, when he was nominated a member of the European Honorary Senate of the Movement for a United States of Europe, he delivered a speech entitled \\"The European values: protect them against the values of the European Constitution\\".

USCIRF Commissioners are appointed by the President and the leadership of both political parties in the Senate and the House of Representatives. USCIRF's principal responsibilities are to review the facts and circumstances of violations of religious freedom internationally and to make policy recommendations to the President, the Secretary of State, and the Congress. History Annual Report of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (2008) USCIRF was authorized by the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998, which established:GPO Public Law 105 - 292 - International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 Page accessed June 3, 2016GPO International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 text Page accessed June 3, 2016 *An Office of International Religious Freedom in the United States Department of State, headed by an Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom *A mandate that the State Department prepare Annual Reports on International Religious Freedom *A requirement to name the most egregious religious freedom violators as Countries of Particular Concern (CPCs) and to take policy actions in response to all violations of religious freedom as a specific element of U.S. foreign policy programs, cultural exchanges, and international broadcasting. *The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) The legislation authorizing the USCIRF stated that the Commission would terminate on September 30, 2011, unless it was reauthorized or given a temporary extension. It was given several extensions by the Congress, but would have expired at 5:00 pm on Friday, December 16, 2011 had it not been reauthorized for a seven-year term (until 2018), on the morning of the 16th. This happened after a new reauthorization bill passed both Houses containing two amendments were made to it that Senator Dick Durbin, D-IL (the Senate Majority Whip) had wanted as a condition of releasing a hold he had placed on the former version of the bill; he released it on December 13, after the revisions were made. They stipulate that there will be a two-year limit on terms for commissioners, and that they will be under the same travel restrictions as employees of the Department of State.Authorizing Legislation & Amendments, United States Commission on International Religious Freedom. Accessed on-line June 4, 2010. In 2016, the U.S. Congress passed and President Barack Obama signed the Frank R. Wolf International Religious Freedom Act, which amended IRFA in various ways, including adding a category of designation for non-state actors. Duties and responsibilities USCIRF researches and monitors international religious freedom issues. The Commission is authorized to travel on fact-finding missions to other countries and hold public hearings. The Commission on International Religious Freedom issues an annual report that includes policy recommendations to the U.S. government based on the report's evaluation of the facts and circumstances of religious freedom violations worldwide. Commissioners The International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 provides for the Commission to be composed of ten members: *Three appointed by the President *Three appointed by the President pro tempore of the Senate, of which two of the members shall be appointed upon the recommendation of the leader in the Senate of the political party that is not the political party of the President, and of which one of the members shall be appointed upon the recommendation of the leader in the Senate of the other political party *Three appointed by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, of which two of the members shall be appointed upon the recommendation of the leader in the House of the political party that is not the political party of the President, and of which one of the members shall be appointed upon the recommendation of the leader in the House of the other political party. *The Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom, as a non-voting ex officio member IRFA provides that \\"Members of the Commission shall be selected among distinguished individuals noted for their knowledge and experience in fields relevant to the issue of international religious freedom, including foreign affairs, direct experience abroad, human rights, and international law.\\" Commissioners are not paid for their work on the Commission, but are provided a travel budget and a 15‚Äì20 member staff.

Also Professor at the Department of Human Communication Studies, California State University, Fullerton.. Designation In December 2019, the United States placed Pakistan and China along with Eritrea, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea, Saudi Arabia, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan in the list of countries having engaged in or tolerated \\"systematic, ongoing, and egregious violations of religious freedom\\". Moreover, Comoros, Russia and Uzbekistan were added on a Special Watch List (SWL) for governments that have engaged in or tolerated \\"severe violations of religious freedom\\", in addition to Cuba, Nicaragua, Nigeria, and Sudan. India USCIRF has placed India on CPC and watch list in 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2009 and 2010. Their report has drawn criticism from the Indian press. The Pioneer, in an editorial termed it as \\"fiction\\", \\"biased\\", and \\"Surpassing Goebbels\\". It criticized USCIRF for projecting the massacre of 58 Hindu passengers as an accident. It also accused USCIRF of indirectly justifying murder of Swami Lakshamananda Saraswati, a Hindu cleric and social activist. Christian leaders in Odisha defended India: Archbishop Raphael Cheenath stated that India remained of a secular character, the president of the Odisha Minority Forum that, despite a small hate campaign against minorities, the majority of society had been \\"cordial and supportive\\", and the Orissa Secular Front that, despite the 2002 and 2008 riots, India had a strong secular foundation. The Hindu American Foundation (HAF) has criticized USCIRF for a lack of transparency, for defending Christian missionary groups for converting Hindus, failing to mention the plight of Hindu Kashmiri Pandit refugees, and for commissioning a biased special report on India by Iqtidar Cheema. Specifically, HAF points out that Cheema is a native of Pakistan, who has been honored by Pakistani government bodies, and supports Pakistan‚Äôs foreign policy goals as well. Furthermore, Cheema has supported Islamic separatist movements in Kashmir, Khalistani separatism in Punjab and supports the banned Babbar Khalsa terrorist group. In the 2019 USCIRF report, the chairman Tenzin Dorjee disagreed with the commission's designation of India as a CPC citing having lived in India for 30 years as a religious refugee stating that \\"India is an open society with a robust democratic and judiciary system. India is a great civilization, and since ancient times she has been a country of multifaith, multilingual, and multicultural [diversity].\\" In India, the government and other analysts perceived this critical report as a reaction to the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, 2010 crackdown by the Government of India of Evangelical missionary organizations which engaged in predatory proselytization, and share close ties with the USCIRF. Egypt Prior to the 2001 visit of the USCIRF to Egypt, some Coptic leaders in Egypt protested, viewing the visit as a form of American imperialism. For example, Mounir Azmi, a member of the Coptic Community Council, said that despite problems for Copts, the visit was a \\"vile campaign against Egypt\\" and would be unhelpful. Another critic called the visit \\"foreign intervention in our internal affairs\\".\\"US commission faces closed doors\\" , Omayma Abdel-Latif, Al-Ahram Weekly, March 22‚Äì28, 2001, #526. Accessed on line June 12, 2010. In the event, the USCIRF was able to meet the Coptic Orthodox Pope Shenouda III and Mohammed Sayed Tantawi of Al-Azhar University, but others refused to meet the delegation. Hisham Kassem, chairman of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights, felt that insisting on the rights of Christians in Egypt might antagonize Muslims and thus be counterproductive.\\"Egypt: Religious Freedom Delegation Gets Cold Shoulder\\", Kees Hulsman, Christianity Today, May 21, 2001. Accessed on line June 12, 2010. Laos The first-ever U.S. Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom, Robert Seiple, criticized the USCIRF's emphasis on the punishment of religious persecution over the promotion of religious freedom. In his view, the USCIRF was \\"only cursing the darkness.\\" As an example, he highlighted the Commission's decision to designate Laos a Country of Particular Concern in 2002 despite release of religious prisoners. He further stated \\"...that which was conceived in error and delivered in chaos has now been consigned to irrelevancy. Unless the Commission finds some candles soon, Congress ought to turn out the lights.\\" The Commission responded that despite the releases, the Marxist, Pathet Lao government in Laos still had systemic impediments to religious freedom, such as laws allowing religious activities only with the consent of Pathet Lao government officials, and laws allowing the government to determine whether a religious community is in accord with its own teaching. Other non-governmental organizations (NGOs), religious freedom and human rights advocates, policy experts and Members of Congress, have defended the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom's research work, and various reports on the Pathet Lao government's increased and serious religious persecution in Laos, from Seiple's controversial criticism. They have pointed out potential conflicts of interest involving reported grant monies Seiple, or a non-profit organization connected to Seiple, reportedly received from officials at the U.S. Department of State to apparently seek to minimize grossly increased religious persecution and widespread human rights violations by the Lao government and the Lao People's Army.Smith, Philip, Center for Public Policy Analysis (or Centre for Public Policy Analysis), (10 December 2004), Washington, D.C. Central Asia In 2007, Central Asia and foreign affairs experts S. Frederick Starr, Brenda Shaffer, and Svante Cornell accused USCIRF of championing the rights of groups that aspire to impose religious coercion on others in the name of religious freedom in the Central Asian states of Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. USCIRF has castigated these countries for excessive and restrictions on religious freedom and repression of non-traditional religious groups, despite them having a strict separation of church and state, refusing to make Islam the state religion, and having a secular legal system. Tajikistan Foreign Ministry criticizes USCIRF report on March 13, 2020. Tajikistan calls on the U.S. Department of State to refrain from publishing unverified and groundless information not related to the actual situation with the rule of law and respect of human rights in Tajikistan.Statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Tajikistan on the US Human Rights Report Accusations of Christian bias and other issues The Commission has been accused of being biased towards focusing on the persecution of Christians and of being anti-Muslim & Hinduphobic. A former policy analyst, Safiya Ghori- Ahmad, filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, alleging that she was fired because she was a Muslim and a member of an advocacy group, the Muslim Public Affairs Council. Current commissioners and some other religious freedom advocates deny the claims of bias. The commission has also been accused of in-fighting and ineffectiveness. Jemera Rone of Human Rights Watch said about the report: \\"I think the legislative history of this Act will probably reflect that there was a great deal of interest in protecting the rights of Christians .... So I think that the burden is probably on the US government to show that in this Act they're not engaging in crusading or proselytization on behalf of the Christian religion.\\" In a 2009 study of the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998, the Institute of Global Engagement stated that the United States' international religious freedom policy was problematic in that it \\"has focused more on rhetorical denunciations of persecutors and releasing religious prisoners than on facilitating the political and cultural institutions necessary to religious freedom,\\" and had therefore been ineffective. It further stated that USIRF policy was often perceived as an attack on religion, cultural imperialism, or a front for American missionaries. The report recommended that there be more attention to religious freedom in U.S. diplomacy and foreign policy in general, and that the USCIRF devote more attention to monitoring the integration of religious freedom issues into foreign policy. In 2018, the Hindu American Foundation questioned the credibility of the commission after the appointment of Tony Perkins as a commissioner citing his past \\"hateful stances against non-Christians.\\" The Southern Poverty Law Center also chastised Perkins for far-right Christian views, his anti-LGBT views, his associations with the Ku Klux Klan and other white supremacist groups, terming his evangelical organization, the Family Research Council, a \\"hate group.\\" References *Stahnke, Tad.

He also has a presence in motorsports, having founded NASCAR team Haas CNC Racing (now known as Stewart-Haas Racing) and the Formula One team, Haas F1 Team.  Haas Automation  Haas graduated from California State University, Northridge in 1975 with a Bachelor of Science degree in accounting and finance. He originally majored in engineering but switched to business after Lockheed nearly went bankrupt. After graduation he was unable to find employment that paid more than what he was earning at his summer machine shop job. So, for the next few years he worked as a machinist and CNC programmer. In 1978, he opened Pro-turn Engineering, a small machine shop with two employees. In 1980, Haas noticed that it took one of his employees a long time to manually position an indexer. Haas thought that building his own indexer with a stepper motor drive would be more efficient. He built one for himself and few more for other machine shops. In March 1983, he displayed his indexer at WESTEC (an industry expo). After seeing the positive reaction of attendees, he decided to form Haas Automation to mass-produce them. His first commercial product, the HBI-5C (Haas Brothers Indexer), sold well because it was programmable and inexpensive. In 1986, Haas and a partner were awarded a US patent for their invention. In 1988 Haas started production on a fully enclosed CNC machining center priced well below the competition. Some believed Haas copied or reverse engineered this machine, but at the time existing machines were so hard to use that Haas used them as an example of what not to do. Over time, Haas machine tools became extremely popular, mostly because they were simple, very affordable, and operator-friendly. By 1996, Haas had outgrown its facilities in Chatsworth, California, and began a search that ultimately brought it to Oxnard, California. In March 1997, the move was completed into the Oxnard factory, a facility. By 2005, the factory had been expanded to . Haas Automation is now the largest machine tool manufacturer in the United States. Sales for 2008 reached a record, reportedly just under $1 billion worldwide.  Auto racing = NASCAR  In 2002, Haas formed a NASCAR race team, Haas CNC Racing. After purchasing the Concord, North Carolina-based Craftsman Truck race facility from Hendrick Motorsports, Haas CNC Racing began work on its first entry in the Winston Cup (now known as the NASCAR Cup Series) Series as a single-car team. The first entry for the new team was September 30, 2002 with driver Jack Sprague, who finished 35th after a crash. The team raced only three times in 2002. By 2003 the team was running full-time with several driver changes over the season. The team won its first race in the then-Busch Series in 2004 with driver Jason Leffler. By 2006 the team had relocated to a new, state-of-the-art facility in Kannapolis, North Carolina, and was fielding a full-time two car team in the Cup Series. At the end of 2008, the team was still struggling with a career-average finish of just under 27th place. Late in 2008, Haas announced that he would join forces with driver Tony Stewart;Tony Stewart to partner with Haas Racing in 2009 Stewart would drive for the team and in return would be given a 50% stake in the company. Stewart led the points for much of 2009, winning four times at Pocono, Daytona, Watkins Glen, and Kansas, ending up sixth in points. Stewart had a mediocre 2010 before picking up wins at Atlanta and Fontana, while Newman won at Phoenix. Stewart won the 2011 Sprint Cup Championship, winning 5 of the 10 Chase races. Haas was present at the first team win in May 2009 when Stewart won the All-Star Race. Haas also joined Stewart on the podium at Homestead- Miami Speedway on November 20, 2011, as Stewart won the Ford EcoBoost 400 that day and claimed his third Sprint Cup Championship. Stewart-Haas won their second Cup title with Kevin Harvick in 2014. On September 30, 2015, Stewart announced his retirement from the Cup Series as a driver following the 2016 season. The team currently runs cars in the Cup Series for Harvick in the number 4 Ford Mustang, Clint Bowyer in the 14, Aric Almirola in the 10 and Cole Custer in the 41. With Cole Custer's victory at New Hampshire in September 2014, Haas joined a select club of owners who have won as an owner in all three national touring series, joining Rick Hendrick, Richard Childress and Jack Roush.  Formula One  In January 2014, Haas confirmed that he had formally submitted to the FIA his interest in entering a team in the F1 championship in 2015 or 2016, initially named Haas Formula and Haas Racing Developments. On April 11, 2014, Haas announced that he had been granted a license from the FIA. On May 28, however, it was revealed that the team would delay its debut until 2016, with Haas officially confirming the postponement on June 4. In September 2014, the team took up its current name of Haas F1 Team to better promote its involvement in the chosen sport. In December 2014, it was further reported that Haas purchased major assets from the bankrupted Marussia F1 team, which was confirmed in early 2015.  Wind Shear wind tunnel  In 2006 planning began for a commercial wind tunnel. Haas commissioned California-based Triliad Development to oversee the project. The facility was designed to be the most advanced automotive wind tunnel in the world. The facility is centered on an MTS rolling road which allows a car to be restrained in place directly on top of a massive tread mill-like machine with a by by 1 mm thick stainless steel belt rotating at speeds up to . The rolling road accurately simulates the dynamics of a car on the race track, unlike traditional fixed-floor tunnels. Construction of the new wind tunnel began in 2007 and was completed by year-end. After six months of commissioning, the wind tunnel opened to its first customer, a Formula One race team, in July 2008. Today the Wind Shear facility counts numerous NASCAR, IndyCar, Formula One and American Le Mans Series teams as customers. Wind Shear is owned 100% by Haas.  Philanthropic activities  Haas Automation and Haas were the recipient of the Roy Pinkerton Award, presented by United Way, Ventura County Chapter. Many engineering colleges have \\"CNC Labs\\" outfitted with machines he donated, including California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly), California State University, Channel Islands,https://www.google.com/u/csuci?q=gene+haas&x;=0&y;=0&domains;=csuci.edu&sitesearch;=csuci.edu California State University, Northridge,http://www.csun.edu/~hfoao102/press_releases/fall98/engineering.html and De Anza College. Haas also has been a generous donor to two-year colleges, most recently Danville Community College through the award of a $1 million grant in April 2015 to support an Associate of Applied Science degree program in Integrated Machining Technology. The program, which will be housed in the Gene Haas Center for Integrated Machining in Danville, Virginia, will build upon the college's existing 80-credit Precision Machining Technology two-year diploma program.  The Gene Haas Foundation  The Gene Haas Foundation has provided charitable donations since 2001 including Hospice Foundation, Boy Scouts of America, Los Angeles Mission, YMCA Kids Camp, NAACP, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, MS Society, and others.  Criminal tax evasion  On June 19, 2006, Haas was arrested by IRS agents for investigation of filing false tax returns, witness intimidation, and conspiracy. Four others were indicted together with Haas, all of whom pleaded guilty. Just before Haas's case was to go to trial, a plea agreement was reached, whereby he would plead guilty to felony conspiracy to commit tax evasion. He was sentenced to two years in prison and ordered to pay $75 million in restitution. Haas was incarcerated beginning January 2008 and was released on probation on May 7, 2009 after serving 16 months of his two-year sentence.

Gobley; most other publications mention only M. Gobley, with the exception of one in 1868 and one in 1869, both signed T. Gobley; full civility in official acts was in literary order Nicolas Theodore. (Nicolas) Gobley (), who first isolated, and ultimately determined the chemical structure of lecithin, the first identified and characterized member of the phospholipids class, and a pioneer researcher in the study and analysis of the chemical components of brain tissues, was born in Paris on 11 May 1811 and died in Bagneres-de-Luchon (a small city in central Pyrenees famous in the second half of the 19th century for its thermal waters) on 1 September 1876. Biography and academic courses Gobley's family originated from the Yonne region, a very rural hilly area of Burgundy, and the small city Fulvy. His father had settled at the end of the 18th century as a wine broker in Paris, marrying a young lady in a family long established (since at least the beginning of the 17th century) in that trade in the capital city of France (that family, Boutron, was registered in the 17th and 18th centuries as one of the 12 suppliers of wines to the King's Court). Wine trading had strong links with alcoholic distillation, some close kin of the Boutron family were indeed spirits distillers, and it is likely this environment that led Theodore to studies in chemistry and pharmacy. Indeed, an historical study conducted in 1957 by P. et C. Chatagnon on the early steps of brain tissues chemical structure studies mentions that Gobley effected a stay as apprentice by one of his parents named Guerin, indicated as pharmacist (actually, his brother-in-law, Denis Guerin (1798‚Äì1888), pharmacist in Paris for a few years in the early 1830s, but more well known as mayor of the city of Fontainebleau during close to 30 years, from 1843 till 1871, and so far as known, not related to the Boutron family). Whatever the initial lead, further on Gobley entered full grade studies in pharmacy and in the early 1830s attended courses delivered by one of the great figures of French pharmaceutical and chemistry arts of that time, Pierre Jean Robiquet, of whom he became a close collaborator, and ultimately his son-in-law, through marrying Laure Robiquet, one of the daughters of his master and mentor. Robiquet (1780‚Äì1840), a long-standing professor at the Ecole de Pharmacie in Paris (since 1811) was a very prominent, respected and honoured player among the French chemists/pharmacists community of the first half of the 19th century: member of the \\"Soci√©t√© de Pharmacie\\" later on designated as the \\"Acad√©mie Nationale de Pharmacie\\" (1817), of which he was Secretary General then President, (1817 till his death) (see (http://www.shp-asso.org/)), member of the \\"Acad√©mie de M√©decine\\" (1820), member of the Acad√©mie des Sciences, distinguished with the order of L√©gion d'Honneur, author of numerous studies and pioneering work in the research of complex molecules in natural bodies, either plants or animals, who had isolated such fundamentals products, as caffeine, cantharidin, and most of all the alizarin, a powerful and stable red dye that was to become one of the first dyes to be mass-produced through a pure chemical synthesis path. Theodore Gobley qualified as a pharmacist in 1835, married Laure Robiquet in 1837, and established himself as pharmacist in Paris (60 rue du Bac; the place had been run down when Boulevard Saint Germain was opened some 30 years later); in parallel to his trade, in his personal lab he conducted his research, and followed a path very similar to that of his father-in‚Äìlaw (demised in 1840): he entered the Ecole de Pharmacie as professor in 1842 (he quit in 1847), became a member of the Acad√©mie Nationale de Pharmacie in 1843, of which he became president in 1861, and was admitted as a member of the Acad√©mie de M√©decine that same year. While conducting various works on a very diversified range of topics very much like most pharmacist/chemists of the 19th century, Gobley singled himself out by a somehow unique lifelong pursuit in the study of lipids in the living animals reign, whereby he demonstrated the universal presence of a fundamental substance, which he named lecithin, and the exact composition of which he pursued during thirty years. Theodore Gobley was also a philanthropist, and he was involved in the management of a local administration office for the housing of poorer people in the \\"D√©partement de la Seine\\" (today, the greater Paris area including districts 75, 78, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95). One of Gobley's daughters married composer Paul Collin. Gobley died on 1 September 1876 in the Pyrenean thermal resort of \\"Bagn√®res-de-Luchon, where he was on a family trip. His burial place lies at \\"cimeti√®re Montparnasse\\" in southern Paris. Discoverer of lecithin and phospholipids In the course of the first half of the 19th century, several French chemists had initiated some tries at the chemical components of brain tissues, but tools and methods for analysis were poor and results fairly unsatisfactory; however they had consistently obtained through different methods, mostly through dissolution in warm alcohol of brain matter, a lipidic substance of more of less stable composition which they had diversely called \\"mati√®re blanche\\" (Louis-Nicolas Vauquelin), \\"c√©r√©brote\\" (J. P. Cou√´rbe), acide c√©r√©brique (Edmond Fr√©my). Obviously, the brain tissues were not solely composed of that, and confusion was high as to their actual composition, with especially Edmond Fremy holding, based on his work on \\"acide cerebrique\\", for a blend of neutral lipids such as olein and phosphoric acid. Gobley found a masterly solution to this question in a series of careful incremental steps. Building on a succession of biological tissue models : egg yolk (1846‚Äì1847), carp fish eggs (1850), carp fish roe (1850), brain matter of sundry higher class vertebrae such as chicken, and ultimately man, fat matters in human fluids: blood (1852), bile (1856), Theodore Gobley, in a series of works assiduously pursued over a span of more than 30 years, classified the several fat matters from a variety of biological tissues, characterized their several properties, identified their respective structure, established bridges between wide apart categories (seminal matter, brain) and branches of zoology (birds, fish, mammals), shed light on similarities of tissues build-up and specified their differences depending on their function (1874). Early studies on egg yolk chemical components, 1843‚Äì1847 In a first step during 1845 (\\"Recherches chimiques sur le jaune d'≈ìuf\\", Compte Rendu hebdomadaire Acad√©mie des Sciences 1845, 21, 766) Gobley achieved a ground breaking first work where he analysed in detail the lipids in the egg yolk, obtaining from egg yolk byproducts never before evidenced in that matter: * margaric acid, for which he confirmed the chemical breakdown obtained by Mr Varentrapp, at the expense of the variant sustained by Michel Eug√®ne Chevreul * oleic acid, for which he confirmed the chemical breakdown obtained by Mr Michel Eug√®ne Chevreul * an acid containing phosphorus, that a very careful and delicate series of analyses led him to indisputably identify as glycerophosphoric acid While evidencing the first two could somehow be looked at with some more or less natural expectation, given their prevailing presence previously demonstrated in a variety of organs or corporeal fluids (such as blood, bile, brain tissues), the latter one was until then exclusively known as a byproduct of direct chemical preparation. Gobley in addition brought full details as to the constitution of the oily part of egg yolk, which he determined to be made up of oleine, margarine and a cholesterin, previously evidenced by Louis-Ren√© Le Canu and which he demonstrated has entirely identical properties to the one (cholesterol) isolated from bile by Michel Eug√®ne Chevreul. In the immediate wake, in a second step in 1847 (\\"Recherches chimiques sur le jaune d'oeuf de poule\\"; par M. Gobley. Deuxi√®me M√©moire. Comptes Rendus hebdomadaires Acad√©mie des Sciences 1847, 21, 988) Gobley took a global view of the chemical structure of egg yolk and proposed for its lipid part a model comprising two distinct fractions: * the one, in very small quantities (0.3% of total mass) which he qualified as a nitrogenous fraction totally devoid of phosphor, and which he hinted to be quite probably identical with the higher up mentioned \\"mati√®re blanche\\" Louis-Nicolas Vauquelin, \\"c√©r√©brote\\" (J.P.Cou√´rbe), and \\"acide c√©r√©brique\\" (Edmond Fr√©my), identified and described from early 19th century years; for this fraction Gobley used the denomination of \\"mati√®re c√©r√©brique\\" (\\"Recherches chimiques sur le jaune d'≈ìuf 2√®me m√©moire\\"), then later on the name \\"c√©r√©brine\\" (\\"Recherches chimiques sur les ≈ìufs de carpe\\"); this name \\"cerebrin\\" had been created some years before by a German chemist M√ºller, while fully characterizing its chemical composition and properties; * the other, in significant quantities (8.5% of total mass) which he qualified and characterized as definitely containing phosphor under some form, that he prosaically denominated \\"mati√®re phosphor√©e\\" (\\"phosphoric matter\\") (\\"Recherches chimiques sur le jaune d'≈ìuf 2√®me m√©moire\\"); this fraction can be degraded into a mixture of margaric acid, oleic acid and glycerophosphoric acid, for the which it is the sole and exclusive origin, Gobley effectively demonstrated that none of these three acids exists on its own within egg yolk. Putting in light the chemical bridges from egg yolk to human brain, 1847 In this very same work, Gobley developed an awareness that this phosphoric part was a new, non-characterized and complex component of a precise nature and stable structure, not a mixture of sub-products in varying proportions: :If therefore neither one of oleic acid, margaric acid nor glycerophosphoric acid existed as such in the viscous matter (of egg yolk), what kind of a (molecule) can that be (that is their source), that indisputably presents one of the most unusual set of properties within all the (fractions) of biological tissues :Mais si les acides ol√©√Øque, margarique et phosphoglyc√©rique ne pr√©existent pas dans la mati√®re visqueuse, quelle est donc la nature de ce corps, qui est sans contredit l'un des plus curieux de l'organisation animale? Having recognized the uniqueness of this component from this work in the pivotal year 1847, Gobley henceforth bore most of his research efforts on it. Already in this same year of 1847, Theodore Gobley realized the deep similarities of chemical structure between brain tissues and egg yolk. Taking up the previous work of Vauquelin, Cou√´rbe and Fr√©my, he isolated as they had from the fat matters of animal brain as well as from the human brain a phosphoric fraction, but going one step further, he demonstrated that this brain matter yields through hydrolysis exactly the same set of by-products that he had obtained from egg yolk: ever the triad oleic acid, margaric acid, glycerophosphoric acid (Journal de Pharmacie et de Chimie 1847, 12, 5). :I have rerun all those experiments using the phosphoric viscous matter from the brain of chicken, of sheep, and finally of man, and ever I am come to the same results. There then exists in the brain, just as in egg yolk, a phosphoric substance which, under the conditions I exercised unto it, has always yielded as decomposition products oleic acid, margaric acid and glycerophosphoric acid. :J'ai r√©p√©t√© toutes ces exp√©riences avec la mati√®re visqueuse phosphor√©e de la cervelle du poulet, du mouton et de l'homme, et je suis arriv√© aux m√™mes r√©sultats. Il existe donc dans le cerveau, comme dans le jaune d'oeuf, une substance phosphor√©e qui, dans les conditions o√π je l'ai plac√©e, m'a toujours donn√©, pour produits de d√©composition, de l'acide ol√©ique, de l'acide margarique et de l'acide phosphoglyc√©rique. This set of solid results led him into proposing for cerebral tissues a chemical structure parallel to that of egg yolk, relying on a phosphoric part, lecithin, and a non-phosphoric, nitrogenous part, cerebrin (\\"Recherches chimiques sur les oeufs de carpe\\". Journal de Pharmacie et de Chimie 1850, t17, 401, et t18, 107). This approach set him immediately at odds with the views developed up to then by Edmond Fr√©my, the prominent specialist of that period regarding the chemical study of the brain and a member of the Acad√©mie des Sciences; Fr√©my's views were that the phosphoric fraction of brain was related to the phospho-oleic acid. Another twenty years were employed by Gobley to fully demonstrate the point. The identification and chemical breakdown of lecithin, the first of phospholipids, 1848‚Äì1874 In the course of the next three years 1848‚Äì1850, Theodore Gobley extended the scope of his research in parallel over egg yolk, carp fish eggs, fish roe, and brain tissue. In 1850 (\\"Recherches chimiques sur les ≈ìufs de carpe\\"), he evidenced the presence of his \\"mati√®re phosphor√©e\\", with identical properties, in carp fish eggs; he proposed for it the name of lecithin which history upheld, from the Greek lekithos (egg yolk) (Journal de Pharmacie et de Chimie, Paris, 1850, 17, 401), thus underlining the clear link with his early studies. And in its wake he demonstrated that lecithin, however obtained (from egg yolk, carp fish eggs, fish roe, human brain), and even though not totally purified, always yields a mix of oleic acid, margaric acid and glycerophosphoric acid when hydrolyzed, and under no circumstances whatsoever anything like phosphoric acid which would have been expected if ordinary fat matter acids, such as phospho-oleic acid, had been involved (\\"Recherches chimiques sur la laitance de carpe.\\" Journal de Pharmacie et de Chimie 1851, t19, 406). Conversely, he demonstrated that the non phosphoric fraction of egg yolk, that he had called \\"c√©r√©brine\\" is absolutely identical in chemical breakdown and reactive properties to the \\"acide c√©r√©brique\\" identified by Edmond Fr√©my and M. R. D. Thompson in the brain. In 1852, he evidenced the presence of lecithin in veinous blood (Recherches chimiques sur les mati√®res grasses du sang veineux de l'homme), and in 1856, in bile as well (Recherches sur la nature chimique et les propri√©t√©s des mati√®res grasses contenues dans la bile). However, he still lacked one brick for a complete breakdown of lecithin's structure. That brick was found during the 1860s by parallel work conducted mainly in Germany, that identified yet a new component of biological fat matters, choline, first in the liver-produced bile by the German chemist Adolph Strecker (Ann. Chem. Pharm. 1868, 148, 77), then shortly afterward in the human brain through the research of Oscar Liebreich in Berlin (who believing he had identified a different matter named it initially \\"nevrin\\") and in his wake complementary contributions by Dibkowsky, Baeyer and Wurtz. Using these additions to his own work, Theodore Gobley in 1874 crowned this long, patient and unyielding series of steps through a final proposal of a complete structure for lecithin, whose hydrolysis yields exactly one oleic acid, one margaric acid, one glycerophosphoric acid and one choline (\\"Sur la l√©cithine et la c√©r√©brine\\", Gobley J Pharm Chim 1874, 19, 346). Fig 1. 1 example of variant phosphatidylcholine, palmitoyl-oleyl-sn- phosphatidylcholine. Later studies expanded the egg yolk lecithin into a wide family of lecithins answering to this structure, combining with a choline head and glycerophosphoric acid a variety of fatty acids. In general, a lecithin, or more precisely a phosphatidylcholine is obtained using a saturated fatty acid, in the example here palmitic acid or hexadecanoic acid H3C-(CH2)14-COOH (margaric acid identified by Gobley in egg yolk, now named heptadecano√Øc acid H3C-(CH2)15-COOH, belongs to that class) and an unsaturated fatty acid, here oleic acid or 9Z-octadecenoic acid as in Gobley's original egg yolk lecithin). The first global overview of brain tissues chemical structure The complete series of results led Theodore Gobley into proposing for brain viscous matter a structure under four main components (\\"Recherches chimiques sur le cerveau de l'homme\\", Journal de Pharmacie et de Chimie 1874) (water set aside, an overwhelming 80%): * lecithin (5.5%), * cerebrin (approximately 3%), characterized as a nitrogenous matter, identical to that of egg yolk, but in much higher quantities in the brain * cholesterin (approximately 1%), * and an abundant new component of albuminous type, that he named cephalin (approximately 7%), in addition to regular albumin (1%) Theodore Gobley thus was the discoverer of the entirely new class of phospholipids and a founding pioneer in the understanding of the chemical basis of brain structure and build-up. Other research, investigations and discoveries In parallel, Theodore Gobley developed a number of additional threads of research of a more mainstream type: In cooperation with a French doctor, member of the Academie de Medecine, Jean-L√©onard-Marie Poiseuille, he published some results on urea in blood and urine. In liaison with his commitment in public health matters and institutions, he involved himself in various studies on toxics, human nutrition and health, and the safety of industrial processes: thus he successively investigated toxins in toadstools (Recherches chimiques sur les champignons v√©n√©neux, 1856), medicinal real or supposed properties of diverse plants, herbs and preparations, toxicity of lead in widespread tins used for cooking utensils, poisonous effects of rye. In the tradition of the methods of Robiquet, from the natural vanilla fruit, he obtained in 1858 the very first samples of pure vanillin, its active flavoring principle. Gobley lived just long enough to see this breakthrough bring about the advent of artificial industrial vanillin synthesis, in a process based on glycosides extracted from the sap of pine trees (1874), opening the path to the extraordinary expansion of the use of that very popular flavour. Incidentally that also brought about the complete collapse of the growing of natural vanilla and the related industry, but that was probably not intended by Gobley.

ATM cards are payment card size and style plastic cards with a magnetic stripe and/or a plastic smart card with a chip that contains a unique card number and some security information such as an expiration date or CVVC (CVV). ATM cards are known by a variety of names such as bank card, MAC (money access card), client card, key card or cash card, among others. Other payment cards, such as debit cards and credit cards can also function as ATM cards. Charge and proprietary cards cannot be used as ATM cards. The use of a credit card to withdraw cash at an ATM is treated differently to a POS transaction, usually attracting interest charges from the date of the cash withdrawal. Interbank networks allow the use of ATM cards at ATMs of private operators and financial institutions other than those of the institution that issued the cards. ATM cards can also be used on improvised ATMs such as \\"mini ATMs\\", merchants' card terminals that deliver ATM features without any cash drawer.. Nowadays , even children can keep atm cards as some banks like Kotak Mahindra give atm cards to children as well.\\"Permata Mini ATM\\" \\"Mini ATM BRI\\" These terminals can also be used as cashless scrip ATMs by cashing the receipts they issue at the merchant's point of sale.\\"Cashless Scrip ATM Terminals\\" The first ATM cards were issued in 1967 by Barclays in London.Jarunee Wonglimpiyara, Strategies of Competition in the Bank Card Business (2005), p. 1-3. Dimensions The size of ATM cards is and rounded corners with a radius of 2.88‚Äì3.48 mm, in accordance with ISO/IEC 7810#ID-1, the same size as other payment cards, such as credit, debit and other cards. They also have a printed or embossed bank card number conforming with the ISO/IEC 7812 numbering standard. ATM uses All ATMs, at a minimum, will permit cash withdrawals of customers of the machine's owner (if a bank-operated machine) and for cards that are affiliated with any ATM network the machine is also affiliated. They will report the amount of the withdrawal and any fees charged by the machine on the receipt. Most banks and credit unions will permit routine account-related banking transactions at the bank's own ATM, including deposits, checking the balance of an account, and transferring money between accounts. Some ATM cards can also be used at a branch, as identification for in-person transactions. The use of the ATM card for in store purchases or refunds is allowed only with pre-approved retailers, but not for on-line transactions. For other types of transactions through telephone or online banking, this may be performed with an ATM card without in-person authentication. This includes account balance inquiries, electronic bill payments, or in some limited cases, online purchases (see Interac Online). Card networks ATM cards operate thru specific networks. Interlink is just one example of the many ATM networks. Canada's Interac and Mastercard's Maestro are examples of networks that link bank accounts with point-of-sale equipment. Some debit card networks also started their lives as ATM card networks before evolving into full-fledged debit card networks such as STAR (Interbank Network), and others such as: Development Bank of Singapore (DBS)'s Network for Electronic Transfers (NETS) and Bank Central Asia (BCA)'s Debit BCA, both of them were later on adopted by other banks (with Prima Debit being the Prima interbank network version of Debit BCA).

A transaction processing system (TPS) is a software system, or software/hardware combination, that supports transaction processing. History The first transaction processing system was SABRE, made by IBM for American Airlines, which became operational in 1970. Designed to process up to 83,000 transactions a day, the system ran on two IBM 7090 computers. SABRE was migrated to IBM System/360 computers in 1972, and became an IBM product first as Airline control Program (ACP) and later as Transaction Processing Facility (TPF). In addition to airlines TPF is used by large banks, credit card companies, and hotel chains. The Hewlett-Packard NonStop system (formerly Tandem NonStop) was a hardware and software system designed for Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) introduced in 1976. The systems were designed for transaction processing and provided an extreme level of availability and data integrity.

Processing types Transaction processing is distinct from and can be contrasted with other computer processing models, such as batch processing, time-sharing, and real-time processing. Batch processing Batch processing is execution of a series of programs (jobs) on a computer without manual intervention. Several transactions, called a batch are collected and processed at the same time. The results of each transaction are not immediately available when the transaction is being entered; there is a time delay. Real-time processing \\"Real time systems attempt to guarantee an appropriate response to a stimulus or request quickly enough to affect the conditions that caused the stimulus.\\" Each transaction in realtime processing is unique; it is not part of a group of transactions. Transaction processing A Transaction Processing System (TPS) is a type of information system that collects, stores, modifies and retrieves the data transactions of an enterprise. Transaction processing systems also attempt to provide predictable response times to requests, although this is not as critical as for real-time systems. Rather than allowing the user to run arbitrary programs as time-sharing, transaction processing allows only predefined, structured transactions. Each transaction is usually short duration and the processing activity for each transaction is programmed in advance. Transaction processing system features The following features are considered important in evaluating transaction processing systems. Performance Fast performance with a rapid response time is critical. Transaction processing systems are usually measured by the number of transactions they can process in a given period of time. Continuous availability The system must be available during the time period when the users are entering transactions. Many organizations rely heavily on their TPS; a breakdown will disrupt operations or even stop the business. Data integrity The system must be able to handle hardware or software problems without corrupting data. Multiple users must be protected from attempting to change the same piece of data at the same time, for example two operators cannot sell the same seat on an airplane. Ease of use Often users of transaction processing systems are casual users. The system should be simple for them to understand, protect them from data-entry errors as much as possible, and allow them to easily correct their errors. Modular growth The system should be capable of growth at incremental costs, rather than requiring a complete replacement. It should be possible to add, replace, or update hardware and software components without shutting down the system. Types of transaction processing=Processing in a batch Transactions may be collected and processed as in batch processing. Transactions will be collected and later updated as a batch when it's convenient or economical to process them. Historically, this was the most common method as the information technology did not exist to allow real-time processing. Processing in real-time This is the immediate processing of data. It provides instant confirmation of a transaction. It may involve a large number of users who are simultaneously performing transactions which change data. Because of advances in technology (such as the increase in the speed of data transmission and larger bandwidth), real-time updating is possible. Databases for transaction processing A database is an organized collection of data. Databases offer fast retrieval times for non-structured requests as in a typical transaction processing application. Databases for transaction processing may be constructed using hierarchical, network, or relational structures. * Hierarchical structure: organizes data in a series of levels. Its top-to-bottom-like structure consists of nodes and branches; each child node has branches and is only linked to one higher level parent node. * Network structure: network structures also organizes data using nodes and branches. But, unlike hierarchical, each child node can be linked to multiple, higher parent nodes. * Relational structure: a relational database organizes its data in a series of related tables. This gives flexibility as relationships between the tables are built. {valign=\\"top\\"  A hierarchical structure.  valign=\\"top\\"  A network structure.  valign=\\"top\\"  A relational structure. } The following features are desirable in a database system used in transaction processing systems: * Good data placement: The database should be designed to access patterns of data from many simultaneous users. * Short transactions: Short transactions enables quick processing. This avoids concurrency and paces the systems. * Real-time backup: Backup should be scheduled between low times of activity to prevent lag of the server. * High normalization: This lowers redundant information to increase the speed and improve concurrency, this also improves backups. * Archiving of historical data: Uncommonly used data are moved into other databases or backed up tables. This keeps tables small and also improves backup times. * Good hardware configuration: Hardware must be able to handle many users and provide quick response times. Backup procedures A Dataflow Diagram of backup and recovery procedures Since business organizations have become very dependent on transaction processing, a breakdown may disrupt the business' regular routine and stop its operation for a certain amount of time. In order to prevent data loss and minimize disruptions there have to be well-designed backup and recovery procedures. The recovery process can rebuild the system when it goes down. Types of back-up procedures There are two main types of back-up procedures: grandfather-father-son and partial backups: =Grandfather- father-son= This procedure involves taking complete backups of all data at regular intervals daily, weekly, monthly, or whatever is appropriate. Multiple generations of backup are retained, often three which gives rise to the name. The most recent backup is the son, the previous the father, and the oldest backup is the grandfather. This method is commonly used for a batch transaction processing system with a magnetic tape. If the system fails during a batch run, the master file is recreated by restoring the son backup and then restarting the batch. However, if the son backup fails, is corrupted or destroyed, then the previous generation of backup (the father) is used. Likewise, if that fails, then the generation of backup previous to the father (i.e. the grandfather) is required. Of course the older the generation, the more the data may be out of date. Organize only of records that have changed. For example, a full backup could be performed weekly, and partial backups taken nightly. Recovery using this scheme involves restoring the last full backup and then restoring all partial backups in order to produce an up-to- date database. This process is quicker than taking only complete backups, at the expense of longer recovery time. =Advantages= * Batch or real-time processing available. * Reduction in processing time, lead time and order cycle time. * Reduction in inventory, personnel and ordering costs. * Increase in productivity and customer satisfaction.

Life and career Orville Alvin Vogel was born in Pilger, Stanton County, Nebraska, one of the four children of William and Emelia Vogel. He graduated from high school in 1925 and received bachelor's and master's degrees from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln in 1929 and 1931, respectively. He married Bertha Berkman in 1931 and began his career as a wheat breeder at Washington State College (now University) in Pullman in 1931. Vogel worked for the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Agriculture Research Service at Washington State University for his whole career, from 1931 to 1972. In retirement, Vogel established a fund to help finance wheat research. He and his wife, Bertha, matched donations to help launch the fund. Vogel died of cancer in 1991. Role in the Green Revolution Cecil Salmon, a biologist working in post- World War II Japan, collected 16 varieties of wheat, including Norin 10, which was developed by an agronomist Gonjiro Inazuka in Iwate Prefecture to be very short, thus less likely to suffer wind damage. Salmon sent them to Vogel in Washington in 1949. Vogel began crossing Norin 10 with other wheats to make new short-strawed varieties. Vogel led the team that developed Gaines, the first of several new varieties that produced 25 percent higher yields than the varieties they replaced. Vogel shared his seeds of Norin 10 and Norin 10/Brevor 14 cross with Norman Borlaug, who later received the 1970 Nobel Peace Prize for his role in the ‚Äúgreen revolution.‚Äù Borlaug publicly acknowledged Vogel's contributions to his research. Honors and awards Among many honors, Dr. Vogel received the 1975 National Medal of Science, Washington State's first Medal of Merit in 1987 and the 1990 John Scott Award given by the City of Philadelphia for useful inventions. He was inducted into the Agricultural Research Service's Science Hall of Fame in 1987. Washington State University honored Vogel by naming a chair and a building after him: the Orville A.

Biography  Born in Florence, Angelo was elected Bishop of Rapolla in 1375, but in 1383 he was transferred to the see of Florence where he had been preceded by a previous family member many years before, Angelo Acciaioli. He was promoted to the cardinalate on 17 December 1384 by Pope Urban VI. He defended legality of the election of Urban VI and his successors against the claims of the antipopes Clement VII and Benedict XIII. In the Papal conclave, 1389 he was actively working on being elected to the papacy, but an anonymous narrative of the Conclave accuses him of simony (bribery), managing thereby to acquire six votes of the thirteen cardinals in the Conclave.Johannes J.

He served as the Latin Archbishop of Patras, and hence ruler of a virtually independent domain in the northwestern Peloponnese, from 1395 to 1400. As papal legate, Angelo crowned king Ladislaus of Naples in Gaeta on 29 May 1390. He reformed the Benedictine monastery S. Paolo fuori le mura in Rome and participated in the papal conclave, 1404. Newly elected Pope Innocent VII named him archpriest of the patriarchal Vatican Basilica (shortly after 4 December 1404), Cardinal-Bishop of Ostia e Velletri (12 June 1405), Dean of the Sacred College of Cardinals (12 June 1405), and finally Vice-Chancellor of the Holy Roman Church (on 29 August 1405). He presided over the papal conclave, 1406. He died in Pisa at the age of 59. His remains were transferred to the Carthusian monastery in Florence.

The group met about 12 times before making a proposal to the school board in the summer of 1991. The group reached a compromise with the board members on only two items. The Garland independent school Board voted 6 to 1 at its August 1, 1991, meeting, to discontinue use of the altered Confederate flag as the school flag and to also change the color of the mascot's uniform from gray to blue and red. The sole dissenting vote was cast by Randy Clark, who maintained that he was voting as his constituents had advised him.

Harvey had a distinguished career in the FDNY until her retirement in 1994. She was named for marine fireman John J. Harvey, killed when a ship exploded during a fire.

Harvey was sold, at auction, in 1999, to a private consortium of marine preservationists determined to prevent her from being scrapped. In June 2000 she was added to the National Park Service's National Register of Historic Places. Her current owners have thoroughly restored her, and host frequent free trips on the river. She is currently moored at North River Pier 66, located at 12th Avenue and 26th Street on the Hudson River.

Harvey had an unexpected encore. Shortly after the attacks on the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, the boat's owners asked FDNY officials for permission to assist in evacuations from Ground Zero. Meanwhile, firefighters had determined that the vast scale of destruction had damaged many fire mains, depriving fire crews of water. Officials radioed John J. Harvey, asking if her pumps still worked. Responding that they did, she was told to drop off her passengers as soon as possible and return to the disaster site, reactivating her official designation Marine 2. Alongside two other FDNY fireboats, and , she pumped water at the site for 80 hours, until water mains were restored. The National Trust for Historic Preservation gave John J.

It inhabits the Sonoran and Mojave Deserts of the Southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. Its range extends from eastern California, Utah, and Nevada south to Baja California and Sonora. Taxonomy The common name \\"chuckwalla\\" (or chuckawalla) is derived from the Shoshone word tcaxxwal, or caxwal, the form used by the Cahuilla of southeastern California. Its generic name, Sauromalus, is said to be a combination of two ancient Greek words: sauros meaning \\"lizard\\" and omalus meaning \\"flat\\". The proper ancient Greek word for \\"flat\\" is however homalos (·ΩÅŒºŒ±ŒªœåœÇ) or homalƒìs (·ΩÅŒºŒ±ŒªŒÆœÇ).Liddell, H.G. & Scott, R. (1940). A Greek-English Lexicon. revised and augmented throughout by Sir Henry Stuart Jones. with the assistance of. Roderick McKenzie. Oxford: Clarendon Press. Its specific name is ater, Latin for \\"black\\" or \\"dark\\" Its original epithet was Sauromalus obesus; although that name is no longer officially recognized, it is still very common in the literature and it remains in many standard natural history references for North America. In 1998, Bradford D. Hollingsworth examined variations in Sauromalus and concluded that only five species should be recognized. He regarded S. obesus as conspecific with S. ater, and he used S. ater, which has priority, as the specific name of the combined taxon. No subspecies of S. ater are currently recognized. Based primarily on the extensive use of the name S. obesus, a petition to give that name precedence over that of S. ater was submitted to the ICZN. However, this reasoning was dubious and the priority of S. ater was maintained. In 2004, ICZN ruled that the name Sauromalus ater was first described by zoologist Auguste Dum√©ril in 1856, thus had precedence over the name Sauromalus obesus which was not named until 1858 by Baird.  Description  The common chuckwalla is a large, flat- bodied lizard with a large, rounded belly, and a wide-based, blunt-tipped tail. Reaching a total length of 20 in and a weight of . Small scales cover its body, with larger scales protecting the ear openings. The coloration of these lizards varies by location and between juveniles and adults, as well as between males and females. In adult males, the head, shoulder, and pelvic regions are black, while the midbody is light tan speckled with brown. Adult females are brownish in color with a scattering of dark red spots. Young chuckwallas have four or five broad bands across their bodies, and three or four on the tail which are lost in adulthood by males, but retained somewhat by females. Common chuckwalla Sauromalus ater at Bristol Zoo, England Behavior Harmless to humans, these lizards are known to run from potential threats. When disturbed, the chuckwalla enters a crevices between rocks, inflates its lungs using a gular pump.Deban, S.M., J.C. O‚ÄôReilly, and T.C. Theimer 1994. Mechanism of defensive inflation in the chuckwalla, Sauromalus obesus. Journal of Experimental Zoology 270: 451-459. Lung inflation distends its body and wedges the lizard tightly in place.Stebbins, Robert C.,(2003) A Field Guide to Western Reptiles and Amphibians, 3rd Edition. Houghton Mifflin Company, Males are seasonally and conditionally territorial; an abundance of resources tends to create a hierarchy based on size, with one large male dominating the area's smaller males. Chuckwallas use a combination of color and physical displays, namely \\"push ups\\", head-hobbing, and gaping of the mouth to communicate and defend their territory. Chuckwallas are diurnal animals, and as they are ectothermic, spend much of their mornings and cooler days basking. These lizards are well adapted to desert conditions; they are active at temperatures up to 102 ¬∞F (39 ¬∞C). Chuckwallas brumate during cooler months and emerge in February. Mating occurs from April to July, with five to 16 eggs laid between June and August. The eggs hatch in late September.  Diet  Primarily herbivorous, the chuckwalla eats creosote bush flowers, leaves, fruit, and occasionally insects.

Money market accounts should not be confused with money market funds, which are mutual funds that invest in money market securities. United States=Features Money market accounts are regulated under terms similar to ordinary savings accounts. They are insured by the FDIC (unlike money market funds), and although they may provide checking services, the restrictions of Federal Reserve Regulation D have discouraged their use for day-to-day payment purposes. In practice, money market accounts are distinguished from ordinary savings accounts by their higher balance requirements and their more complex interest rate structure.

KCTR airs a country music format. Licensed to Billings, Montana, United States, the station serves the Billings area. The station is currently owned by Townsquare Media Billings License, LLC. History 102.9 FM began broadcasting in August 1979 as KOOK-FM, sister station to KOOK (970 AM). The new outlet used Schulke Radio Productions's automated beautiful music format with just eight commercial units an hour. KOOK-AM-FM was acquired by \\"Major\\" Dan Miller, a 25-year employee of the stations, and the Mesa Broadcasting Company of Chicago in 1983. Citing low support, KOOK-FM flipped to country as KBIT on January 16, 1984. The station returned to KOOK-FM on November 4, 1985, as part of a format and call sign trade between the AM and FM stations that moved country to AM and the former contemporary hit radio format on KOOK to FM. The move failed to generate increased interest in the stations, and Miller left the management group and KOOK. After the FM station improved in listenership over the course of 1987, KOOK-KBIT was sold again in 1988, to Citadel Associates of Phoenix. Citadel wasted little time changing the format on KOOK-FM back to country; KOOK and KBIT began simulcasting as KCTR-AM-FM, retiring the KOOK call letters from Billings radio after having been used since 1951. In October 2007, a deal was reached for KCTR-FM to be acquired by GAP Broadcasting II LLC (Samuel Weller, president) from Clear Channel Communications as part of a 57 station deal with a total reported sale price of $74.78 million.

The two outer stone circles are circular. The middle circle, the largest is slightly elliptical. The survival of the southern stone circle, which now contains nine stones, has been most precarious: only two of the remaining stones are upright and the other seven are partially covered with soil.

Neepawa was incorporated as a town in 1883. It is bordered by the Municipality of North Cypress ‚Äì Langford and Rural Municipality of Rosedale. Neepawa is the self- proclaimed Lily capital of the world in part because of its Lily Festival. The town has also been named \\"Manitoba's Most Beautiful Town\\", more than any other community in the province. History In the many years before European settlement, the lands around Neepawa were primarily used by the Cree and the Assiniboine. Native peoples in the area followed a regular cycle by following the Plains Bison to take shelter in the areas north of Neepawa in the winter, and then heading south again across the plains and beyond Neepawa in the summer. The town name of Neepawa comes from the Cree word for \\"Land of Plenty\\", the name was first used around 1873. Prior to settlement, the only Europeans in the area were primarily fur traders, many people made their way through the area on the North Fort Ellice Trail which went from the Red River to Edmonton. It was on this trail that a group of settlers from Listowel, Ontario eventually decided to settle in 1877, where the Stony and Boggy creeks meet. The Neepawa area was in what was then known as \\"The Northwest Territories\\", just to the west of the 1870 boundary of Manitoba. During the next 30 years, many settlers came to live in the area. The first settlers were from the British Isles. Eastern European settlers also came from countries such as Poland and Hungary and built the Hun Valley Settlement near Neepawa. Neepawa only joined Manitoba when the western edge of the then \\"postage stamp province\\" was expanded to its present western borders in 1881. John A. Davidson and Jonathon J. Hamilton arrived in the town in 1880, they were the first real business men of the town buying land and surveying them into lots. In 1881 John Hamilton and John Davidson built a store and a grist mill near the junction of Boggy and Stoney Creeks. Like many western Manitoba towns at the time, Neepawa eagerly await the arrival of the railway in the 1880s. Sometime after the railway reached Gladstone, Manitoba in 1882, Davidson and Hamilton offered the Manitoba and Northwestern Railway (which was leased to CPR) a land grant and a financial bonus of $16,000 to construct their line within the town limits and the railway agreed to build their station within Neepawa. Soon a village grew and on the 23 of September, 1883 the town of Neepawa was incorporated. Dr. David Harrison who owned a private bank in Neepawa was elected Premier of Manitoba in 1887. Neepawa's first hospital was completed in 1904 and had the capacity for 20 patients. The hospital included a nursing school. Neepawa's first school opened in 1881. It was a three-story building finally completed in 1898 and used until 1928. The Neepawa Salt Company mined salt here from 1932 until 1970. Author Margaret Laurence wrote several books through the 1960s and 1970s, depicting the town under the name of Manawaka. On May 12, 2010 Neepawa was the host of Manitoba's 140th birthday party. The town was chosen as the site of the festivities as a result of winning a contest within the province. Geography Neepawa lies on the Manitoba Escarpment, the rolling hills around Neepawa are typical of the escarpment. Neepawa lies within the Canadian Prairies, the region around Neepawa is defined as Aspen parkland. Although Neepawa is part of the prairies the area to the north is heavily forested parkland. Riding Mountain National Park and Duck Mountain Provincial Park lie to the north, are part of this parkland, and are also an extension of the escarpment. The boreal forest which extends all the way across Canada, is also found to the north of Neepawa. Spruce Woods Provincial Park is located about 60 km south of the town. Neepawa lies at the source of the Whitemud River, it is also about 40 km east of the Little Saskatchewan River, a tributary of the Assiniboine River which is 60 km south of the town. The town is also about 60 km west of Lake Manitoba, one of the largest lakes in Manitoba. Climate=Economy The economy of Neepawa and the region is strongly dependent on agriculture. The rolling fields in the area support many types of crops and livestock operations. Neepawa serves as a major agricultural service centre for many of the producers in the region. More prominently, growers in Neepawa produce some of the finest and most diverse lilies in the world. As of 2009 over 2,000 kinds of Lily were grown locally. These flowers are shipped directly from Neepawa to many of the major international floral markets. Neepawa proclaims itself the \\"Lily capital of the world\\" because of this. Neepawa also attracts a number of tourists throughout the year in part because of the lilies. An estimated 12,000 people visit the Lily Festival and Neepawa each July. As well as being an agricultural centre, Neepawa's businesses serve as a shopping and retail centre for much of the area's residents. Education Hazel M. Kellington Elementary School (named after longtime teacher) has about 350 students and the Neepawa Area Collegiate Institute has about 500 students. Neepawa Nursery School teaches 3- and 4-year-old children. Neepawa is part of the Beautiful Plains School Division. Assiniboine Community College has a campus in Neepawa and offers various post-secondary courses. Transportation The Town of Neepawa is located along the Yellowhead Highway 16 and Highway 5, the Parks Route. The community is located 45 minutes northeast of Brandon, the region's largest centre, and 2 hours northwest of Winnipeg, the provincial capital. Neepawa is also located 1 hour from Riding Mountain National Park. Neepawa Airport features a 3,500 foot runway that is able to service air ambulance and small jets. Trucking services are provide by Gardewine North, which maintains a depot in Neepawa. Attractions Margaret Laurence Home The Margaret Laurence Home is a designated Provincial Heritage Site and a Level 2 Museum. This is the house where Margaret Laurence grew up in Neepawa as a youth. In addition the Riverside Cemetery in Neepawa is the resting place of Margaret Laurence. The cemetery's Davidson Memorial was the signature of Laurence's book The Stone Angel. This cemetery is also the furthest west in which any Titanic passenger was buried. Four young men from the village of Fritham in Hampshire, England, went down with the Titanic in 1912: Lewis Hickman (aged 32), Leonard Mark Hickman (aged 24), Stanley George Hickman (aged 21), and Ambrose Hood (aged 21). A gravestone in memory of the Hickman brothers can be found in Riverside Cemetery.Find A Grave website The Beautiful Plains Museum is a Heritage Railway Station that was the home of the museum since 1981. The original railway station was built in 1901. The Lily Festival in Neepawa first began in 1996 and today features the over 2,000 different kinds of Lily that are grown in Neepawa. Neepawa sees around 12,000 visitors in the town during the Lily Festival each July. The Roxy Theatre Neepawa is a community-run theatre that was built in 1906. The theatre hosts live arts and current movies. The Roxy Theatre was the setting for the 2015 movie Amityville Playhouse (UK/Europe release), Amityville Theatre (US release). Both the Roxy and the Towns Court House were used in the movie (as were other locations in the town) which was shot in September 2014. Government Neepawa is governed by a town council consisting of a mayor and six councilors. The town council is elected to a four-year term. The current Mayor of Neepawa is Blake McCutcheon. The Deputy Mayor is Brian Hedley and the remaining council consists of Marijka Kostenchuk, Darren Pudlo, Murray Parrott, Jason Nadeau and Darryl Gerrard.

The East Court which has casts of Italian monuments and the Porta Magna of San Petronio Basilica in Bologna by Jacopo della Quercia The Cast Courts (originally called the Architectural Courts) of the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, England, comprise two large halls. Unusually for a museum, the Cast Courts house a collection not of originals, but copies. Here are to be found reproductions of some of the most famous sculptures in the world. Most of the copies were made in the 19th century and in many cases they have better resisted the ravages of time, 20th- century pollution and over-zealous conservation than the originals. In a few cases, such as the late 15th century L√ºbeck relief of Christ washing the Apostles' feet, the original has been destroyed and the cast is a unique record of a lost work. History The practice of reproducing famous sculptures in plaster dates back to the sixteenth century when Leone Leoni assembled a collection of casts in Milan, he collected: \\"as many of the most celebrated works... carved and cast, antique and modern as he was able to obtain anywhere\\". Such private collections, however, remained modest and uncommon until the 18th century. By 1800 there were extensive collections in Berlin, Paris, Vienna and elsewhere. Early in the 19th century there was growing interest in medieval art, and, perhaps as an expression of national pride, casts were made of outstanding national monuments particularly in France and Germany. In Britain, from 1841 onwards, a collection of art from all periods and countries was being assembled by the Government School of Design. In 1852 this collection was taken over by the Museum of Manufactures when it was established at Marlborough House. By 1858 the museum had moved to its current location in South Kensington and the casts were displayed in various corridors and galleries. In 1862, the collection was inflated by the acquisition of over 2,000 casts of decorative wood carving that had been used as examples for the craftsmen working on the new Westminster Palace. By around 1860 the previously haphazard means of acquisition was supplemented by a more systematic approach: a list was drawn up of copies it was thought desirable to acquire and soon plans were drawn up to house them. As with the acquisition of original sculptures, this work was driven primarily by Henry Cole and John Charles Robinson. In contrast to other national collections, the collection at the V&A; was conceived as being international in scope. Casts were acquired throughout the 1860s and 70s. Many of the casts were commissioned by the Museum or purchased from French or German firms. Other casts were obtained through exchange with other museums. In 1864 plans for an international exchange of copies of 'the finest works of art which each country possesses' were drawn up by Henry Cole and the assistance of the Foreign Office was sought to obtain lists of major works in the possession of other European governments. This ambitious scheme culminated in 15 European princes being persuaded to sign up to the International Convention of promoting universally Reproductions of Works of Art at the Paris International Exhibition of 1867. With this agreement, the Victoria and Albert Museum came to acquire the large and diverse collection of casts that it has today. The Courts were designed by Major General Henry Scott of the Royal Engineers and were opened to the public in July 1873. The Courts are architecturally dramatic: they are large and high. The West Court is topped by a roof of glass that admits sunlight which is supplemented by electric lights; it predominantly contains casts of Northern European and Spanish sculpture and Trajan's Column. The East Court has a high ceiling and has casts of Italian monuments. The two Courts are divided by corridors on two levels; the mid-level corridor allows the Courts to be viewed from above. The West Court (that includes Trajan's Column) also has a vertiginously high walkway around it at a third level. The walkway is contiguous with a space that is used to store objects, mostly casts, that are not on public display; the walkway and storage area are not open to the public. It is said that the proportions of the West Court were informed by the need to display Trajan's column and the imposing Portico de la Gloria. When the cast courts first opened, they included displays of large scale architectural model and many casts of architectural details, hence the original name Architectural Courts. When the courts first opened to the public they attracted much attention although the initial press reaction was mixed. The Art Journal, while generally favourable, was particularly critical of the inclusion of Trajan's Column which had the 'effect of crowding out of sight those (casts) of more sensible proportions' -- a criticism that seems justified. Other museums also received casts, but chose to display the frieze in an unrolled manner and presented at eye level, as can now be seen at the Museum of Roman Civilization and National Museum of Romanian History. In the 1920s, discussions within the museum focused on the lack of space for display. It was suggested that the cast collection be moved to The Crystal Palace where another large collection of casts was also housed. The proposed move was rejected by the then director, Eric Maclagan which was fortunate because in 1936 Crystal Palace was destroyed by fire. Twenty three casts, mainly effigies, that escaped the inferno were transferred to the museum and were the last major additions to the cast collection. Major exhibits=Trajan's Column Cast Court from upper walkway. The full height of Trajan's Column could not possibly be accommodated and the column is divided into two roughly equal parts. The original column in Rome is some 30m high and includes an internal spiral staircase which leads to a platform at the top. The cast is of the huge pedestal and the entire column, but excludes the viewing platform. The original statue on the top was lost in antiquity. The pedestal is covered in illustrations of booty from the Dacian Wars and the column is covered in a detailed frieze illustrating the conquest of Dacia by the Roman emperor Trajan. Inside the pedestal of the cast of Trajan's column. The roof window of the Cast Court can be seen through the top of the \\"chimney\\". There is also a small aperture on top of the pedestal through which the upper gallery of the Cast Court can be seen. The frieze spirals around the column and describes in narrative form two wars against Dacia, the first (AD 101-102) is illustrated in the lower portion of the column, and the second (AD 105-106) in the upper portion. The dividing point on the column is marked by a personification of Victory writing on a shield and this is approximately the point at which the cast of the column is divided. The column was cast in many small parts and these parts were reassembled on brick chimney-like structures built especially for the purpose. Just as on the original there is a door on the cast of the pedestal that affords access to the interior, but within the cast there is nothing to be seen but the white painted interior of the brick chimney. The upper portion is similarly hollow, but there is no means of access. In Rome the frieze is extremely difficult to see. The viewing conditions in the museum are also less than optimal. The lower section is atop a huge pedestal some high. Consequently, the only part of the frieze that can be examined closely by the public is the bottom of the upper portion. The mid-level corridor does afford an alternative view albeit at a distance and only from one side. The upper-level walkway looks down on the column and does give views all round, but at a significant distance and this is not open to the public. Portico de la Gloria Cast of Portico de la Gloria Cast of Portico de la Gloria (detail) The portal, known as the Portico de la Gloria is from the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela in Spain. The original dates from the 12th century and is by the Master Mateo.Portico de la Gloria by MASTER MATEO In 1865, Robinson had visited Santiago de Compostela and on seeing the cathedral urged for a cast of the doorway to be made. This was prior to the construction of the Cast Courts and so allowed for the design to accommodate this vast artefact. The task of making the cast went to Domenico Brucciani & Company, a firm that later effectively acted as a franchise of the museum and continued to make casts until the early 1920s. The casting of this immense structure required an arduous sea voyage and protracted, delicate negotiations with the ecclesiastical authorities. At the opening of the Cast Courts, the cast of the Portico de la Gloria was critically acclaimed and was applauded as a \\"glory to the museum\\". Baptistry Doors This copy is an electrotype of the Florence Baptistry Doors known as the Gates of Paradise by Lorenzo Ghiberti. School of Athens There is a painted copy of Raphael's School of Athens over 4 metres by 8 metres in size, dated 1755 by Anton Raphael Mengs on display in the eastern Cast Court. Pulpit from Pisa Cathedral A plaster cast of Giovanni Pisano's pulpit from Pisa Cathedral. The plaster cast of a pulpit was constructed after the marble original which once stood in the Cathedral of Pisa. The pulpit has inscriptions running round the frieze and the base that make it clear that the sculptor was Giovanni Pisano (1250-1314) and that the work was completed by 1311. Reliefs show scenes from the life of Christ and the Last Judgment. A central support comprises images of the three Virtues over a base depicting the Liberal Arts. The two supports nearest the front of the pulpit depict Christ over the Four Evangelists and Ecclesia over the four Cardinal Virtues. The original pulpit was dismantled in 1602 following a fire in the cathedral. A new pulpit by Fancelli was installed 25 years later, it used some of Pisano‚Äôs original carvings and the rest, including the narrative reliefs, were used elsewhere in the cathedral. Interest in the original appearance of the pulpit was re-awakened in the nineteenth century. Pisan sculptor Giovanni Fontana worked on a reconstruction carved from wood and in 1865 a group of British bronze sculptors produced their own reconstruction. The two reconstructions differed in detail. This cast seems to be from this 1865 reconstruction. Another copy of this cast was shown in the Exposition Universelle in Paris, in 1867. The present pulpit in the Cathedral in Pisa is a reconstruction by Peleo Baccithat assembled in 1926. The reconstruction incorporates most of the fragments from the original although some are dispersed in museums around the world. The 1926 reconstruction differs substantially from the earlier reconstructions and has been described as problematic. Three Davids Michelangelo's David was the museum's first major cast of Italian figure sculpture. It was acquired in 1857 when it was sent as a gift from the Grand Duke of Tuscany to Queen Victoria -- apparently in an attempt to placate English anger at his refusal to allow the National Gallery to export Domenico Ghirlandaio's Madonna Enthroned. The gift was entirely unexpected and the Queen promptly gave the cast to the then South Kensington Museum which is now the Victoria and Albert Museum. In the reign of Queen Victoria, the display of male nudity was contentious and the Queen herself was said to find it shocking. The museum commissioned a suitably proportioned fig leaf that was kept in readiness in case of a visit by the Queen or other female dignitary: the fig leaf was then hung on the figure using a pair of hooks. Today, the fig leaf is no longer used, but it is displayed in a case at the back of the cast's plinth. Donatello's bronze statue of David (circa 1440s) is notable as the first unsupported standing work in bronze cast since classical times. The cast is painted to resemble the bronze of the original. A third image of David is a cast of David by Verrocchio. Other notable casts Saint George, after marble original by Donatello in the Museo Nazionale (Bargello), Florence. Early in the 20th century, there was something of a reaction against copying works of art and interest in the collection -- and other similar collections -- declined. Only more recently has revived interest in the collection led to its once again being fully appreciated. In recent years, the Cast Courts have been used to display the works of contemporary artists. From November 2003 until June 2004, artist Rachel Whiteread's cast of Room 101: the BBC office where George Orwell worked some years before writing his famous novel Nineteen Eighty-Four. The original room 101 was demolished in the restructuring of Broadcasting House.

On October 1, 2005, it merged with the separate √ñsterreichische Postsparkasse (P.S.K.) to form the \\"Bank f√ºr Arbeit und Wirtschaft und √ñsterreichische Postsparkasse AG\\", shortened as BAWAG P.S.K.. In October 2017, BAWAG Group AG, the holding company of BAWAG P.S.K., became a listed company on the Vienna Stock Exchange. Largest shareholders are GoldenTree Asset Management (21.8%) and T. Rowe Price (5.6%). History Old logo of BAWAG before 2007 Bank f√ºr Arbeit und Wirtschaft BAWAG was founded in 1922 by the Austrian Chancellor Dr. Karl Renner as the Arbeiterbank (Austrian Worker's Bank), not so much to extend favourable terms of credit to ordinary people, but to spare them to resort to more capitalist institutions (cit. Renner). Socialist trade unions and the Gro√üeinkaufsgesellschaft f√ºr √∂sterreichische Consumvereine (Austrian consumer associations procurement company) each hold a 40% stake in the bank. However, because of those close ties to the Social Democratic Party of Austria (SP√ñ) and labour unions, BAWAG was forced to close in 1934 by the Austro-fascist government of Chancellor Engelbert Dollfu√ü. It resumed its operations after the end of World War II in 1947. In 1963, it took the name of Bank f√ºr Arbeit und Wirtschaft AG (BAWAG, translatable as \\"Bank for Labour and Business\\"). The bank continued to have close relations to social democratic party SP√ñ and the unions. The Austrian Trade Union Federation (√ñGB) retained 70% of the shares, the other 30% were held by the Konsum retail cooperative chain. In the 1970s, popular products were the Kapitalsparbuch (fixed-term savings passbook) and the Betriebsratskredit. At the same period, the bank actively used its finances to sponsor the promotion of Austrian contemporary art and culture. The BAWAG Foundation was established in 1974 with the goal of making art as accessible as possible to all people.__UeberUns/Unternehmen/Firmengeschichte/nav__en,setId=bawagpsk,path=_2A125984_2A_2F126866_2F125984_2F122828_2FCR122828_2FCD121012.html BAWAG History  A look back at over 80 years of history and tradition. The Foundation was closed in 2013. In 1979, parliament amended the Austrian Banking Act (Kreditwesengesetz or KWG), which now allowed the operation of branches. The BAWAG experienced rapid expansion throughout Austria, from an existing network of 26 offices to 120 by 1982. The shareholder Konsum went bankrupt in 1995, which sent shockwaves through the political landscape in Austria, especially for the social democrats. The Bayerische Landesbank bought the shares and increased its stake to 46%. Merger to create BAWAG PSK In 2000, BAWAG successfully took over a majority of shares of the √ñsterreichische Postsparkasse (P.S.K.) bank, buying 74.82% of the shares from the government. In November 2003, the remaining 25.18% were bought up as well. The merger, which was not finalized until 2005, created the country's third-largest bank group with a balance sheet total of nearly 45 billion euros, 5000 employees, some 2000 outlets (including branches where P.S.K. has been already located) and over one million private customers (2000). The new BAWAG/P.S.K. Group now had the largest centrally managed sales network in Austria. With the combined assets, the new group BAWAG/P.S.K. experienced further growth. The piano manufacturer B√∂sendorfer was bought from the American company Kimball International in 2001. Since the fall of the Iron Curtain and the prospect of an accession of Central- and East European countries to the EU, new market opportunities open up. In 2002, the Slovakian bank Istrobanka is bought, a year later the Czech bank Interbanka. Both equities are owned 100% by the BAWAG. The new partners opened up opportunities to expand in retail banking and intended to open new branches throughout Europe. In 2004, BAWAG acquired 100% of the shares of Dresdner Bank CZ, integrating it into the Interbanka, now renamed as BAWAG Bank CZ. The management decided to transfert as much capital as possible from the holding to the operative bank, so that a 1,5billion euro debt of the √ñGB were inherited by the bank. The Bayerische Landesbank sold its 46% share in 2004 to the other shareholder, the Austrian Trade Union Federation (√ñGB). With that deal, the √ñGB became sole owner of the BAWAG. The BAWAG Affair Since the Refco scandal in October 2005, which involved bad loans in the amount of 425 million euros, the bank almost defaulted on its obligations and had to be bailed out by the conservative government of Wolfgang Sch√ºssel. This has cast doubts about the future of links between the socialist-led unions and the bank. The losses came from a series of failed bets using risky derivative investments held in off-balance- sheet vehicles. Though the bets go back as far as 1998, they surfaced only in 2006 during U.S. investigations into the bankruptcy of Refco. Also, Bawag lent Phillip Bennett, the former chief executive of Refco, hundreds of millions of dollars just before the brokerage filed for bankruptcy protection in October 2005. As a result of the losses and subsequent investigations, criminal charges were filed against a number of BAWAG executives. Several people were found guilty and convicted. Helmut Elsner, former chief executive of Bawag, was found guilty of breach of trust, fraud and false accounting and was sentenced to nine and a half years in prison. The judge also ordered him to repay Bawag ‚Ç¨6.8 million in pension benefits. The defendants also included the Bawag executive Johann Zwettler and the investment banker Wolfgang Fl√∂ttl, who was based in the United States. Zwettler was given a five-year sentence. Fl√∂ttl was sentenced to 10 months. Six others were given various sentences. Sale to Cerberus As BAWAG's shareholder was also facing financial trouble, √ñGB decided to sale its entire stake in March 2006. Cerberus was finally chosen in December 2006, beating competitors Bayerische Landesbank, Allianz and Lone Star Funds, and who bought 90% of BAWAG for ‚Ç¨3.2 billion. Other shareholders are the √ñsterreichische Post (5%), Generali (2-3%), the W√ºstenrot-Gruppe (1%) and Hannes Androsch. Initially, BAWAG P.S.K. pursued a 2 brands strategy, progressively switching to the joint brand BAWAG PSK in 2007. In order to transform the bank, the new management sold non-strategic assets, like a 43% stake in Austrian TV operator ATV, foreign subsidiaries Istrobanka,http://www.forium.de/redaktion/lbbw-kauft-tschechische-bawag-bank- cz/ to KBC Group in July 2008, BAWAG Bank CZhttp://www.news.at/articles/0812/30/200857/bawag-tochter-istrobanka-geht- grossbank-kbc-350-mio-euro to Landesbank Baden-W√ºrttemberg in September 2008, piano producer B√∂sendorfer to Yamaha in January 2008http://wiev1.orf.at/stories/244290 and Stiefelk√∂nig (shoe retailer) in 2011.

The novel was completed in 1970, first published in 1971, with an English translation the following year. The novel is an unusual blend of fiction narrative and historiography, and has given rise to extensive and often bitter controversy, both from the literary as well as from the historical point of view. Some episodes of the book had caused in accusations of the author in anti-Semitism, mostly rebutted at the time,Richard Grener - Solzhenitsyn and Anti-Semitism, a New Debate, The New York Times, 13 November 1985. but these were renewed later, regarding Two Hundred Years Together (see the article about the latter for details). Plot The plot primarily follows Colonel Vorotyntsev, a General Staff officer sent by the Grand Duke's (supreme commander, Russian Army) headquarters to the Russian Second Army invading East Prussia under command of General Alexander Samsonov. Vorotyntsev has been sent to find out exactly what is happening with the Second Army; a second General Staff colonel has been sent to the First Army with the same mission. Distances were so great, communications so poor, and the Russian Army so badly prepared for war, Vorotyntsev was sent to find out all he could about conditions at the front and then report back to the Grand Duke. By August 26, the opening day of the 4-day Battle of Tannenberg, Vorotyntsev comes to realize that he cannot return to his headquarters in time to make any difference in the outcome of the battle, and stays with the Second Army to help out where he is able to. Numerous side plots involving other characters, both on the battlefield and elsewhere, fill out the novel. The unprepared army's failures mirror those of the Tsarist regime. A famous episode in the earlier version of the novel narrates the state of mind of General Samsonov, the Russian commander, after his disastrous defeat in what came to be known as the Battle of Tannenberg. Samsonov, tormented by the scale of the defeat and his fear of reporting this failure to the Tsar, eventually commits suicide. His body is found by a German search party, a bullet wound in his head and a revolver in his hand. Later editions In 1984, a new version of the novel, much expanded, was published in an English translation by H.T. (Harry) Willetts. By this time Solzhenitsyn had been a resident of the USA for some years. He was able to publish chapters that had been suppressed while he was still living in Russia, given the Soviet censorship of literature, and to add material based on his extensive research at the library of the Hoover Institution. These included chapters on Vladimir Lenin, which were published separately as Lenin in Zurich, and several chapters dealing with Prime Minister Pyotr Stolypin, as well as with the background and personality of Stolypin's murderer, Dmitri Bogrov, and the suspected involvement of the Tsarist Secret Police in this assassination.SolzhenitÔ∏†sÔ∏°yn AI, Jr. EE, Mahoney DJ.

The town lies southeast of the city of Viterbo and about southwest from Civita Castellana. The town is known for its mineral springs, sold and bottled under the Acqua di Nepi brand throughout Italy. History The region was already occupied in the 8th century BC; neighbouring Pizzo had been occupied in the Bronze Age. Nepet became Roman before 386 BC, when Livy speaks of it and Sutrium as the keys of Etruria. In that year it was surrendered to the Etruscans and recovered by the Romans, who beheaded the authors of its surrender. It became a colony in 383 BC. It was among the twelve Latin colonies that refused further help to Rome in 209 BC. After the Social War it became a municipium. It is hardly mentioned in Imperial times, except as a station on the road (Via Amerina) which diverged from the Via Cassia near the modern Settevene and ran to Amelia and Todi. In the 8th century AD it was the seat of a duchy for a short while. During the late 9th to early 10th century, it was, along with much of central Italy, threatened by the Saracens.

Their tower is located on nearby Equinox Mountain. Because of its location and power the station is able to reach Albany-Schenectady-Troy (while distantly), Saratoga Springs and Glens Falls along with southern and central Vermont, western Massachusetts, and western New Hampshire. It broadcasts an alternative rock format which is more varied than most stations owned by larger corporations. Despite being located in Vermont, WEQX has been voted the best radio station for the Capital Region (Albany, New York) by the Metroland alternative newsweekly for 15 years running (up to 2006) and voted best radio station of 2002 and 2006 by the Albany Times Union. It has also won Best Radio Station of the Year awards from Rolling Stone magazine in 1993, 1995 and 1996. In addition, the Album Network (a radio industry magazine) voted the station the Best Alternative Radio Station in the Country (small market), in 1995. History WEQX was founded in November 1984 by Brooks Brown as an independent radio station, when he moved to Manchester and couldn't find a station to meet his advertising needs. Brown built the studio himself, and was involved in building the antenna. The station originally broadcast an Adult Contemporary format for its first ten months of operation until flipping to Alternative Rock or Modern Rock in September 1985. The station is located in a Victorian house at 161 Elm Street. Some of the DJs on WEQX in their early days as a Rock station included Ellen McKinnon formerly of WQBK-FM in Albany, NY as well as former WPYX Albany DJs Ernie James and John Clark. WEQX, or \\"EQX\\", as it is commonly referred to by its listeners, is a large sponsor of live music and has presented various concerts in the Capital Region (Albany, New York). In the summer of 2007, EQX held the first EQX Fest at the Saratoga Performing Arts Center. The concert started at 3 PM and ran until around midnight. It had three different stages; one for local bands, one for mainstream bands, and one for the headliners. The headliners included The Nightwatchman, Matisyahu, and 311 (in that order). On September 28, 2013, EQX held its fourth annual Pearl Palooza in Albany, New York. It was an all day free music festival that featured Portugal. The Man, Said The Whale, Cayucas among others. On November 14, 2014, WEQX celebrated its 30th Anniversary as an independently owned-and- operated Alternative station, 1 year right after WEQX's founder and owner A. Brooks Brown died in August 2013. On December 29, 2015 the WEQX transmitter tower collapsed due to ice and wind. Broadcasting continued on their online feed, and reduced coverage was re-established with the use of a temporary tower a few days later.

History The parish of Swineshead is recorded as Suineshefet (1086), Swynesheved (13th century), Swineshead (16th century). It was an exclave of the county of Huntingdonshire, and surrounded by Bedfordshire, until 1888 or 1896, when it was transferred to Bedfordshire. The parish was an exclave because it was within the great manor of Kimbolton, once the property of Harold, the last Saxon king of England, and part of this manor was held to be in Huntingdonshire though separated from the rest of the county by about half a mile at the nearest point. Thus although King Harold's lands were granted to different persons by William the Conqueror, Swineshead and Stonely both passed to Fitz-Piers and both remained in the county of Huntingdonshire. At the time of the Domesday survey, land in Kimbolton and in Swineshead was held by William de Warenne, and his influence may have been used to keep his property in the same county. Swineshead was enclosed by Act of Parliament in 1803. The parish was part of Eaton Socon rural district from 1896 to 1934, then becoming part of Bedford rural district until 1974. Geography The soil in the parish is loam and gravelly and the sub-soil mainly blue galt. The chief crops are wheat, barley beans, and peas. The surface is undulating and is between above sea-level. The village itself stands at about . The parish was once well wooded, Swineshead and Spanoak Woods in the north of the parish still remain but now are not as large as they once were. They are owned by the Woodland Trust and Swineshead Wood is a Site of Special Scientific Interest. Religious sites The Church of St Nicholas consists of a chancel, nave, north aisle with vestry, south aisle, west tower and south porch. The walls are coursed rubble with some pebble rubble, and with stone dressings. The roofs are covered with stone slates, tiles and lead. The church is not mentioned in the Domesday survey of 1086, but there was a rector here before 1271. The whole church seems to have been rebuilt during the 14th century, beginning with the chancel about 1330; about the same time, the south aisle and porch were built. The north aisle with the base of a tower at its west end followed about 10 years later, but the proposed tower was almost immediately abandoned in favour of one at the west end of the nave. Towards the end of the 15th century, a clerestory was added to the nave, a vestry was added at the east end of the north aisle, with a chamber above it, and a narrow slipway communicating with the chancel. At the same time the chancel arch was widened, rood-stairs built on the south side, and a rood- screen and loft erected. The nave roof was repaired in 1706 and in 1841. A general restoration seems to have occurred from 1847 to 1853. The tower and spire were again repaired in 1907. Landmarks The village is in the middle of the parish, and includes many old houses. The \\"Three Horseshoes\\" Inn dates from the early 17th century. The cottages are of brick and timber with tiled and thatched roofs. The former rectory, now used as a farmhouse, is an ancient plastered building of brick and timber opposite the church. When it was undergoing restoration in 1846, a copy of the Solemn League and Covenant (signed by the then Rector of Swineshead) was discovered in the roof where it was perhaps hidden by the cautious rector of the time. There are the traces of two moats in the village.

History  The school began classes in the year of 1904 at the corners of Pine Street and Meridian Road, in a one-room schoolhouse. Meridian High was the first high school in the Meridian area. During most of the twentieth century, Meridian and surrounding areas were separated from Boise to the east by a significant amount of agricultural land, which later became developed. In 1975, a larger, more modern campus (initially containing four buildings) was built at the present location, at the intersection of Pine Ave. and Linder Rd. With enrollment already exceeding capacity when the new campus opened, an addition to the classroom building was completed the following year. Growth continued into the mid-1980s, forcing the school to adopt a split-shift schedule to accommodate the 2,400 students attending a facility built for 1,800. Until 1987, it was the only high school in the Meridian School District, and had the largest enrollment in the state. With rapid growth in the Meridian and west Boise area, four additional high schools opened in the next two decades to relieve congestion. In the fall of 2007, a new PTC building was constructed, housing three new shops and adding additional space for students and faculty. Additional space for the Future Farmers of America (FFA) was also established.  Athletics  The Warriors have won over 60 district and 25 state championships.

The first book printed in France: Epistolae (\\"Letters\\"), by Gasparinus de Bergamo (Gasparino Barzizza). It was printed in 1470 by the press established by Johann Heynlin. Gasparinus de Bergamo (in Italian, Gasparino (da) Barzizza; in French, Gasparin de Bergame; in Latin, Gasparinus Barzizius Bergomensis or Pergamensis) (c. 1360 ‚Äì c. 1431) was an Italian grammarian and teacher noted for introducing a new style of epistolary Latin inspired by the works of Cicero. With Pier Paolo Vergerio the Elder, he was influential in the development of humanism at Padua. As one of the first Italian Humanists, he taught rhetoric, grammar, and moral philosophy with the aim of reviving Latin literature. Biography Born Gasparino Di Pietrobuono in the village of Barzizza, near Bergamo, he studied grammar and rhetoric at Pavia. Remaining there to teach from 1403 to 1407, he subsequently moved to Venice to serve as private tutor to the Barbaro family. Unable to find backing in Venice in order to establish a school there, Gasparinus then taught at Padua (1407‚Äì21), enjoying his most productive writing period, where his reputation as a teacher and scholar was established. He was appointed to lecture there on rhetoric and on authors such as Seneca, Cicero, Virgil, and Terence. He also established the elementary school, which offered a humanist curriculum. Both Vittorino da Feltre and Leon Battista Alberti owed their boyhood education to him. Antonio Beccadelli, called \\"Il Panormita\\", also studied under him. He then taught at Ferrara, and on the invitation of Filippo Maria Visconti, opened an elementary school at Milan in 1418, to be organized along the same lines as Gasparinus' school at Padua. He taught at Milan from 1421 and also served as Visconti's court orator. Gasparinus also served as secretary to Pope Martin V and in this capacity attended the Council of Constance. Gasparinus died at Milan around 1431. By his marriage to Lucrezia Alliardi, Gasparinus had a son, named Guimforte (Guiniforto) Barzizza (c. 1406‚Äì63), who became a distinguished scholar and writer. Guimforte married Giovannina Malabarba. Works *Epistolarum liber (\\"Book of Letters\\") or Epistolae (\\"Letters\\"): his most famous work, which carries the distinction of being the first book printed in France (Paris), in 1470, with the newly introduced printing press by Johann Heynlin. This work was intended to provide an exemplar for students for the writing of artful and elegant Latin and was designed to teach prose composition. *Tractatus de compositione (ca. 1420): a treatise on rhetoric and literary style. In this treatise, Gasparinus argued for a return to the elements of style found in the rhetoricians of antiquity. *Orthographia: a manual of Latin orthography, his most important work. *possibly the Sinonima Ciceronis (\\"Synonyms of Cicero\\"): a collection of synonymous terms used in the rhetorical works of Cicero, produced to aid in the expansion of students' rhetorical vocabulary in Latin.The work is anonymous, but R.G.G. Mercer suggests, in The Teaching of Gasparino Barzizza: With Special Reference to his Place in Paduan Humanism (London, 1979; p. 66) that it may well be the work of Barzizza.

The rearrangement was first observed in the late 1950s by Canadian chemist Adrian Gibbs Brook (1924‚Äì2013), after which the reaction is named. These migrations can be promoted in a number of different ways, including thermally, photolytically or under basic/acidic conditions. In the forward direction, these silyl migrations produce silyl ethers as products which is driven by the stability of the oxygen-silicon bond. 318x318px The silyl substituents can be aliphatic or aromatic, and if the silicon is a center of chirality, the migration occurs with retention at this center. This migration occurs through a transition state where silicon is penta-coordinate and bears a partial negative charge. If a center of chirality is present at the carbon center to which the silyl group is attached, then inversion occurs at this center. As an example, if (trimethylsilyl)methanol where to be deprotonated, a [1,2]-Brook rearrangement would occur.  Reaction mechanism  The reaction mechanism for this rearrangement depends on the conditions employed to affect the rearrangement and the nature of the starting material. Anionic rearrangements are the most common Brook rearrangements observed, and their mechanisms can be broken into two general categories. The first category starts with proton abstraction of a nearby hydroxyl group by a base. This generates an alkoxide which then acts as a nucleophile and attacks the silicon atom in a nucleophilic displacement reaction, with the methylene group acting as the leaving group. The generated carbanion is then protonated by the H-B species to form the product. In the case where the base used is consumed in the reaction (i.e. Butyllithium), then the carbanion can act as a base to deprotonate further starting material to generate the final product. The Brook rearrangement reaction mechanism The proposed transition state for this reaction step is a three-membered ring, with significant negative charge build-up on the carbon atom and the silicon atom, as demonstrated by Hammett sigma and rho studies. This reaction generally proceeds with a low activation energy and a large negative entropy of activation. This further supports the cyclic three member transition state, as this would be considerably more ordered than the ground state of the starting material. The reaction proceeds with overall retention at the silicon center, as demonstrated with a Walden Cycle (shown below). This supports a pentacoordinate silicon as part of the mechanism, as trigonal bipyramidal geometry around the silicon with one of the O or C axial and the other equatorial would explain the observed retention in configuration at the silicon center. This mechanism also proceeds with inversion at the carbon center. This reaction is known to be reversible. Depending on the relative stabilities of the carbanion and oxy-anion formed, a silyl ether is perfectly capable of rearranging to a species with the silicon bonded to the carbon atom, and the free alcohol being present. This would be termed a Retro-Brook rearrangement. The second category of anionic brook rearrangements involves nucleophilic attack at an sp2 hybridized center to generate an oxy-anion two atoms removed from the silicon atom. This can then undergoes intramolecular attack by the oxy-anion to yield the silyl ether, but the final fate of the carbanion often depends on the substrate in question. For example, attempting to perform a Wittig reaction on acylsilane results in the formation of a silyl enol ether instead of the expected alkene, due to elimination by the carbanion instead of protonation as seen above. 683x683px The Brook rearrangement has been shown to occur with retention of configuration at the silicon center as demonstrated in the following Walden cycle: The Brook rearrangement Walden cycle All steps in this cycle were known to proceed with retention of configuration except for attack of the lithium reagent (which proceeded by inversion) and the Brook Rearrangement, which was being investigated. By starting with a chiral silicon of known configuration, the stereochemistry of the reaction could be determined by looking at the specific rotation of the recovered silane. Since it is known that attack by the lithium reagent proceeds with inversion, the recovered silane should be the opposite enantiomer of the starting silane (single inversion) if the Brook Rearrangement proceeds with retention, and the same enantiomer if the reaction proceeds with inversion (double inversion). Experimentally, the recovered silane was the opposite enantiomer, showing that the reaction occurred with retention at the silicon center.  Scope  Brook rearrangements are known in acylsilanes.Patrocinio, Amauri F. and Moran, Paulo J. S. Acylsilanes and their applications in organic chemistry. J. Braz. Chem. Soc., 2001, vol.12, no.1, p.07-31. ISSN 0103-5053. Online article Beyond that, acylsilanes are well known for their hydrolysis in basic solution to a silanol and an aldehyde. This occurs through a Brook-rearrangement initiated by attack at the carbonyl group. A related reaction, involving initial attack at the silicon center, causes migration of one of the silicon groups to the carbonyl carbon, which initiates a Brook-Rearrangement. If the silicon group was chiral, the end product is a chiral silyl ether, as the migration occurs stereospecifically. Rearrangements analogous to the Brook Rearrangement are known for many other types of atoms. These include nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur as the nucleophilic component, with boron and germanium analogous known as the electrophilic component.

She was one of China's most successful gymnasts in the 1990s. She was known for performing routines of exceptional difficulty and technique, but also for inconsistency. Her birth date has been reported in various events as July 19 and November 7; it is unclear which is correct. She is a fraternal twin; her sister Mo Huifang was also a gymnast. Gymnastics career Both Huilan and Huifang began gymnastics in 1985 in Guangxi. In 1990, they were invited to attend a camp in Beijing to test for admission to the Chinese national training center. Huifang was accepted, but Huilan was not. Showing determination that would serve her well in her competitive career, she talked coaches into allowing her to remain in Beijing with her sister. Eventually, Huifang was injured and retired from gymnastics; Huilan, in contrast, thrived and improved. Mo made her international debut at the 1993 Cottbus Cup, where she placed a modest sixth in the all-around. The next year at the Asian Games, however, she nearly swept the competition with gold medals in the team, balance beam, uneven bars, and vault and a bronze in the all-around. She came to the attention of the international gymnastics community at the 1994 World Championships in Brisbane, Australia, where she achieved a seventh-place finish in the all- around final, the highest of any Chinese gymnast. Although she placed out of the medals on floor exercise, her routine, which was choreographed to Leroy Anderson's \\"Typewriter Song\\", was a hit with the audience. Her performance on the uneven bars, where she debuted her own version of the Gaylord salto, also gained recognition and appreciation. Mo was the first female to perform this skill, a front tuck over the bar to recatch. At the 1995 World Championships in Sabae, she showed an increased level of difficulty on all events, including a double-twisting Yurchenko vault, a double layout on floor exercise and beam routine highlighted by a dynamic two-foot layout and blind double stag leaps. Her team won the silver medal for China in the team competition, their highest finish since 1981. Her preliminary scores qualified her to all four event finals and the highest qualification score for the all-around final. She would only finish sixth in the final due to a fall from the balance beam in the first rotation. She went on to win the balance beam title and tied for the silver medal on the uneven bars with all around champion Lilia Podkopayeva behind eventual Olympic champion Svetlana Khorkina. Mo was expected to be a major medal contender at the 1996 Olympics. However, the competition would prove to be disappointing for the entire Chinese team. Errors in the preliminary round kept her from qualifying for the beam and bars event finals, which were arguably her best events. Mistakes and falls from several of her teammates kept the Chinese squad from earning a medal in the team competition altogether. In the all-around, She performed well on her first three rotations: vault, uneven bars and balance beam to lead the competition going into the final rotation, but stepped out of bounds on floor exercise and dropped to fifth place. She went on to win a silver medal on vault behind Romanian Simona Am√¢nar, the first Chinese female gymnast to win a medal on vault at the Olympic/World Championship level. After the 1996 Olympics, she participated in exhibitions and shows in the United States before returning to training. She continued to compete through the 1997 season. However, struggling with her fitness and increased demands for difficulty with a new Code of Points, she quietly retired from gymnastics at the end of 1997. Life after gymnastics By all accounts, Mo's life after gymnastics has been fruitful. She has enjoyed status as a celebrity in China, where she is recognized as one of the country's most beloved sports figures. She pursued her education at Renmin University of China in Beijing and subsequently began a career as a sports journalist and commentator. She has also tried her hand at modeling and has a contract with the Li Ning company. She portrayed former teammate Sang Lan in a television miniseries. Skills Mo's style was noted for its excellent form, extension, and difficulty. She also frequently used cheeky choreography on the floor. On the uneven bars, she was the first woman to perform a Gaylord, a front flip over the high bar. This skill is now known as the \\"Mo Salto\\" or officially the Mo on uneven bars in the Code of Points, and is classified as a \\"G\\" element. Only a handful of other women gymnasts have attempted and successfully completed the Mo Salto. In fact, the only women gymnasts who have performed the \\"Mo Salto\\" at international competitions are all from China, including Meng Fei and Bi Wenjing. In 2005 World Championships, Chinese athlete Zhang Yufei performed it successfully in podium training. However, she was injured during the vault qualification, thus she did not use this skill during bars qualification. In 2013 World Championships, Yao Jinnan also successfully performed a Mo Salto during the all-around competition (but did not successful grasp the high bar attempting this in the event final). Another Chinese athlete, the relatively unknown Zhou Duan, performed the even harder Gaylord II (front flip with half twist over the high bar) at the 1997 East Asian Games.

It is a Grade I listed building. It was constructed in the early 20th century in an Arts and Crafts style, to a design by Ernest Barnsley. After Ernest's death in 1925, it was completed by Sidney Barnsley, his brother, and then by Norman Jewson, Ernest's son-in-law. All the construction materials were obtained locally, and hand worked by local craftsmen. The three wings of the house are angled around a central, circular, lawned courtyard. The east wing, originally for servants, has been converted into flats, whilst the central \\"public\\" wing was not lived in by the family, instead being used for community teaching and events. Crafts were taught in the building and the vast majority of the furniture was commissioned for the house and built locally. The southern gardens used hedges to create specific spaces, giving the impression of exterior \\"rooms\\" next to the house, with an extensive kitchen garden which provided much of the food for the house. The house was described by the designer Charles Ashbee as the single best example of the Arts and Crafts movement. During World War II, the house was used as an evacuation point for a London Catholic school, and a maternity house due to the shortage of midwives. History In 1894, Claud Biddulph, youngest son of the politician Sir Michael Biddulph, was given of land by his father and in 1906, he committed ¬£5000 (worth approximately ¬£2 million in 2015)Comparing average earnings between 1894 and 2015, ¬£5000 is valued at approximately ¬£2,076,000.00 by MeasuringWorth.com per year to building a house. Biddulph and his wife, Margaret, were passionate about the Arts and Crafts movement, a design movement focused on restoring traditional approaches to decorative craftwork and fine art, so he commissioned architect Ernest Barnsley to create the house in that style. Biddulph referred to the manor as a \\"cottage in the country\\". The Biddulphs originally hoped for a large village house, a focal point for the village community, who would work on craft projects in the house. Barnsley had settled in the Cotswolds in 1893 with his brother, leaving their successful Birmingham architecture firm behind, to focus on traditional crafting methods without machines. Building began in 1909, using oak from the estate, metalwork from local blacksmiths, and stone quarried locally, brought to the site by a private railway line. Barnsley insisted that no machines would be used, so instead of using a saw powered by steam engine, the wood was hand-sawn in a saw pit. The east wing was completed by 1915, and the Biddulphs moved into them, with the reception rooms finished around the same time. Despite the grandeur of the building, the Biddulph's lived in some small rooms and fitted the large reception rooms for community use. Biddulph also built some cottages at the site of the old manor house at Rodmarton around the same time. As the Biddulphs were interested in the Arts and Crafts movement, using the manor house to give classes for villagers in crafts such as woodwork and embroidery. There were also plays and musical events for the villagers, including puppet shows for the children. Construction was paused during World War I and Barnsley died in 1926. The final part of the build was completed between 1926 and 1929 under the supervision of his brother, Sidney and his son-in-law, Norman Jewson. The built took a total of 23 years, largely due to the traditional methods being used, but also as no contractor was hired to manage the build. During World War II, Rodmarton Manor was used as an evacuation point for Sisters of Marie- Auxiliatrice school in Finchley, with over 150 children living there. Biddulph also offered the house rent free to act as a maternity house from 1943 until the end of World War II, due to the shortage of midwives who could attend people at their homes. When Anthony Biddulph took over the house in 1954 on the death of his father, he decided to convert the east wing into flats, living in the \\"public\\" wing. House The rainwater pipes are embossed with images such as this monkey Rodmarton Manor is a country house built between 1909 and 1929, built from local materials, worked by local craftsmen. It was built as three wings, viewed in plan as three sides of an octagon, around a large circular courtyard, covered in grass which is designed to be reminiscent of a village green. The majority of the building is two storeys high and made of coursed cut stone, the plinth is offset and the quoins are flush. The roof is made of stone slate, with grouped chimneystacks. The north facade has a gabled porch bay which includes an arched doorway with a stone monogram above. On each side of the entrance bay, there are two gables, with bays where the wings are set at an angle. The north-west wing includes a chapel, with a twin- arched loggia and its own porch. The east wing was previously the service wing. The building's rainwater pipes are embossed with animals and flowers. Inside the Rodmarton Manor, there are 74 rooms of which 19 are bedrooms, all named after local fields. The porch bay leads to the \\"public\\" wing, with a long hall which runs for the wing's full length. Off the hall is the drawing room, which decorated with hanging tapestries, designed by Hilda Sexton. The drawing room connects through to a large library, originally a ballroom, which was regularly used for performances. The library connects to the formal dining room, which was not used often due to the distance from the kitchen. The furniture throughout was all commissioned specifically for the house and built by local workshops, including some by Alfred Hoare Powell. The building was designated Grade I listed status on 4 June 1952 and was described by Charles Ashbee as the single best example of the Arts and Crafts movement. Gardens The pavilion at the end of the Long Garden The gardens are Grade II* listed on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. The gardens of the house were also created in line with the Arts and Crafts movement, providing food for the house. Influenced strongly by Margaret Bidulph, who had studied at Studley Horticultural College, where she had met her future head gardener William Scrubey. Scrubey and Margaret Biddulph would go on to plant the gardens together. The terrace and gardens south to the south of the house include yew hedges to create specific spaces, mixed with Portuguese laurels and roses, giving the impression of exterior rooms next to the house. Nearby is an area of topiary, clipped in domes and tiers. At the far end of the south terrace is a ha-ha, leading to a cherry orchard and tennis courts, although only one tennis court remains, the others have been converted in a croquet lawn and a swimming pool. The northern garden includes a small pavilion and a small pond with seating areas. It also includes a kitchen garden, with fruit trees. At long and wide, the largest part is known as the Long Garden, between a wall and a yew hedge, with a long flagstone path through a lawn with the pool in the centre and leading up to the pavilion at the end. On the other side of the yew hedge is the Leisure Garden, designed to be a garden which does not need weeding, from which there are paths to the \\"Troughery\\", the Sunken Garden, the Winter Garden and back to the Terrace. The \\"Troughery\\" is a small garden which creates features from stone troughs and staddle stones, surrounded by topiary.

(The cavities are the part of the mold shaped like the parts to be produced.) By contrast, a cold runner is simply a channel formed between the two halves of the mold, for the purpose of carrying plastic from the injection molding machine nozzle to the cavities. Each time the mold opens to eject the newly formed plastic parts, the material in the runner is ejected as well, resulting in waste. A hot runner system usually includes a heated manifold and a number of heated nozzles. The main task of the manifold is to distribute the plastic entering the mold to the various nozzles which then meter it precisely to the injection points in the cavities.  Hot runner advantages  * Shorter cycle time: No runner controlling the cooling time * Easier to start: Without runners to remove, and auto cycle occurs faster and more frequently * Fewer sink marks and under- filled parts: Unlike when plastic flows through a cold runner and loses heat to mold plates * Design flexibility: Can locate the gate at many points on the part * Balanced melt flow: Separate melt channels are in externally heated manifolds that are insulated from mold plates surrounding them. Hot runner systems were first developed and came into sporadic use in the early 60s with generally negative results. They gained popularity in the 80s and 90s as technological advancements allowed improved reliability and the escalation of plastic materials prices made hot runner systems more desirable and cost effective. Hot runners are fairly complicated systems, they have to maintain the plastic material within them heated uniformly, while the rest of the injection mold is being cooled in order to solidify the product quickly. For this reason they are usually assembled from components pre manufactured by specialized companies. A hot runner controller is a temperature controller used to control the temperature in the hot runner. This helps create the most consistent part(s). Hot runners usually make the mold more expensive to manufacture and run, but allow savings by reducing plastic waste and by reducing the cycle time. (do not have to wait until the conventional runners freeze).

In 1728 he was the last known Native American living in the town of Suncook. At the start of King George's War in 1740 Plausawa moved to St. Francis in Quebec and fought against the settlers of the British. During a raid on Epsom, New Hampshire on August 21, 1747, Plausawa and his companions, Sabattis and Christo, captured Isabella McCoy and burned her farm and the neighboring farms while her husband Charles McCoy was away serving in the New Hampshire Militia. Isabelle McCoy told of the very good treatment she received by Plausawa on her way to Quebec where Plausawa sold her as a servant to a French Canadian family. In 1752 Plausawa led another raid that captured two African-American slaves from a field in Canterbury, New Hampshire. One slave escaped to warn the town militia and Plausawa, Sabattis and Christo returned to Quebec where they sold their captive to a French officer.History of Northfield New Hampshire 1780-1905 by Lucy R. H. Cross, 1905, Concord, NH Rumford Printing Co. In 1754, King George's War was over and the French and Indian War had yet to start, and Plausawa and Sabattis were in Canterbury again intending to trade furs with the townspeople. After some altercations they were told to leave or else. Plausawa and Sabattis went to Boscawen, New Hampshire to the home of Peter Bowen. Bowen planned to trade with them and gave them rum to drink and when they were drunk removed the musket balls from their muskets. On the morning of February 9, 1754 Peter Bowen killed Sabattis and then Plausawa with a tomahawk during a fight. To this day it is still unclear if this was done in self-defense as Peter Bowen claimed, or in order to rob the Indians of their furs. Peter Bowen was charged with the murder of both Plausawa and Sabattis and taken to Portsmouth, New Hampshire for trial but was released from jail the night before the trial by his friends and neighbors and never stood trial.

Description XMLBeans is a tool that allows access to the full power of XML in a Java friendly way. The idea is to take advantage of the richness and features of XML and XML Schema and have these features mapped as naturally as possible to the equivalent Java language and typing constructs. XMLBeans uses XML Schema to compile Java interfaces and classes that can then be used to access and modify XML instance data. Using XMLBeans is similar to using any other Java interface/class: with methods like getFoo or setFoo, just as when working with Java. While a major use of XMLBeans is to access XML instance data with strongly typed Java classes there are also APIs that allow access to the full XML infoset (XMLBeans keeps XML Infoset fidelity) as well as to allow reflection into the XML schema itself through an XML Schema Object model. Characteristics of XMLBeans # Large XML Schema support. # Large XML Infoset support. Large XML Schema support: XMLBeans fully supports XML Schema and the corresponding java classes provide constructs for all of the major functionality of XML Schema. This is critical since often one has no control over the features of XML Schema needed to work with in Java. Also, XML Schema oriented applications can take full advantage of the power of XML Schema and not have to restrict themselves to a subset. Large XML Infoset support: When unmarshalling an XML instance the full XML infoset is kept and is available to the developer. This is critical because that subset of XML is not easily represented in Java. For example, order of the elements or comments might be needed in a particular application. Objective A major objective of XMLBeans has been its applicability in all non-streaming (in memory) XML programming situations. The developer should be able to compile their XML Schema into a set of Java classes and know that they will be able to: # use XMLBeans for all of the schemas they encounter. # access the XML at whatever level is necessary without other tools.  APIs  To accomplish the above objectives, XMLBeans provides three major APIs: * XmlObject * XmlCursor * SchemaType XmlObject: The java classes that are generated from an XML Schema are all derived from XmlObject. These provide strongly typed getters and setters for each of the elements within the defined XML. Complex types are in turn XmlObjects. For example, getCustomer might return a CustomerType (which is an XmlObject). Simple types turn into simple getters and setters with the correct java type. For example, getName might return a String. XmlCursor: From any XmlObject the developer can get an XmlCursor. This provides efficient, low level access to the XML Infoset. A cursor represents a position in the XML instance. The cursor can be moved around the XML instance at any level of granularity needed from individual characters to Tokens. SchemaType: XMLBeans provides a full XML Schema object model that can be used to reflect on the underlying schema meta information. For example, the developer might generate a sample XML instance for an XML schema or perhaps find the enumerations for an element so that they may be displayed.  Example  An example of a simple XML Schema Definition to describe a country is given below. ISO 3166 When the schema is compiled into XMLBean classes (e.g., using Ant), it is very easy to create and manipulate XML data that conforms to the schema definition. The following Java code is a simple example that illustrates how an XML document can be created and validated. import org.openuri.domain.country.v1.Country; import org.openuri.domain.country.v1.Iso; public class CountrySample { public static void main(String[] args) { Country country = Country.Factory.newInstance(); country.setName(\\"Denmark\\"); country.setPopulation(5450661); // from Wikipedia :-) // print out country XMLBean as XML System.out.println(country.xmlText()); // check if document is valid - will print \\"Document is invalid\\" // because required Iso child element in not in the object System.out.println (\\"Document is \\" + (country.validate() ? \\"valid\\" : \\"invalid\\")); // add child with complex type Iso to make the document valid Iso iso = country.addNewIso(); iso.setAlpha2(\\"DK\\"); iso.setAlpha3(\\"DNK\\"); iso.setCountryCode(208); // print out country XMLBean as XML System.out.println(country.xmlText()); // check if document is valid - will print \\"Document is valid\\" System.out.println (\\"Document is \\" + (country.validate() ? \\"valid\\" : \\"invalid\\")); } }  History  David Bau was the chief designer for the XMLBeans 1.0 project while he was working for BEA. XMLBeans started on the grounds of XMLMaps, an XML binding tool included in previous BEA WebLogic products. XMLBeans was originally developed as part of the proprietary BEA WebLogic Workshop Framework, but it was obvious from interviews conducted when it was first announced on January 27, 2003, that BEA wanted it to become an open standard. At that time it was not decided which organization BEA wanted to involve in the standardization effort. Later that year it was donated to the Apache Software Foundation. The original team included Cezar Cristian Andrei and Eric Vasilik, later the team added Cliff Schmidt and Radu Preotiuc-Pietro, Jacob Danner, Kevin Krouse and Wing Yew Poon. XMLBeans is now being developed by Apache POI. * January 27, 2003: BEA announces XMLBeans as a technology preview. * September 24, 2003: BEA donates XMLBeans to the Apache Software Foundation where it joins the Apache Incubator Project. * April 23, 2004: XMLBeans Version 1.0.2 is released.

It is the sequel to August 1914, which concerned Russia's role in World War I. The novel picks up on the brink of the Russian Revolution, depicting characters from all walks of life ‚Äî from soldiers and peasants to Tsar Nicholas II, Tsarina Alexandra Feodorovna, and Lenin. Unlike the first novel, the book does not revolve around any specific historical events. Instead, the book portrays everyday lives and politics as they were in the period between Imperial Russia's peak and the February Revolution. The novel's original Russian title is Oktyabr 1916 ‚Äî October 1916; during the period in which the novel is set, Russia had not yet adopted the Gregorian calendar, and so its dates were somewhat out of step with the rest of the world. (And the February Revolution, mentioned above, occurred in late February 1917 according to the calendar then in use, but early March according to the Gregorian calendar.) In November 1916, the novel literary form is used as a device to link together what are best described as a series of essays and polemics. Solzhenitsyn uses long and detailed conversations (typically dialogues) between the characters in this novel as a way of presenting political and philosophical arguments. Several of the fictional characters, especially those engaged in the dialogs, are very thinly disguised historical personages. The dialogue device brings out many of the issues which were important topics of dissention in pre-revolutionary Russia. Although Solzhenitysn himself is openly contemptuous of the leftist/liberal tendency in Russian political thought and public life in this period, he gives these views full airing along with other views more in sympathy with his own, especially in his long dialogues.

Over a period of several years, he fabricated results in the field of oncology which he published in leading medical journals. The article that led to his downfall, which was published in The Lancet, was based on 900 patients Sudb√∏ had fabricated entirely. The editor of The Lancet described this as the biggest scientific fraud conducted by a single researcher ever.http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Krop,_psyke_og_sundhed/Sundhedsvidenskab/L√¶ger/Jon_Sudb√∏ Sudb√∏ graduated from the University of Oslo faculty of dentistry in 1989 and the faculty of medicine in 1994, both top of his class. Sudb√∏ was formerly employed as a consultant oncologist at the Radium Hospital in Oslo and as an associate professor at the University of Oslo, but as a result of the fabrication scandal, he resigned from these positions in 2006. The same year, his licenses to practice medicine and dentistry were revoked. An inquiry by the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Oslo found that most of Sudb√∏'s work, including his doctoral dissertation, were based on fraud, and the University of Oslo revoked his doctorate in medicine in 2006. In 2007, he was granted a strictly limited license to work as an assistant dentist under supervision, and in 2009, he regained licenses to practice medicine and dentistry with some restrictions. He is currently working as an assistant dentist in Seljord, Telemark. His wife Wanja Kildal was his co-author of 7 of the articles that were found to be fraudulent and subsequently retracted, while his twin brother Asle Sudb√∏ was a co-author of two of these articles. Scandal In January 2006 it was revealed that his October 2005 fast track submission to The Lancet was based upon fraudulent patient data. The article had suggested that non-COX2-NSAIDs like ibuprofen diminish the risk of oral cancer in smokers. However, it turned out that the whole patient material was fictional. The leader of the epidemiology division at Norwegian Institute of Public Health, Camilla Stoltenberg, found the article suspicious at the end of 2005 because the data was supposedly from a cancer patient database which had not yet opened. The Norwegian newspaper Dagbladet reported that of the 908 subjects in the Lancet study 250 had the same birthday. Sudb√∏ has later acknowledged that he has used fictional data in at least two more papers, published in the New England Journal of Medicine and the Journal of Clinical Oncology. An independent Commission of Inquiry led by Swedish Professor Anders Ekbom, that also included a member from the U.S. National Cancer Institute, was set up by Rikshospitalet and the University of Oslo to discern the details of the fraud. They were also to try to identify the role of the co-authors, which included, among others, Jon Sudb√∏'s brother and wife. In May 2006, Norwegian and Swedish media reported that the committee was investigating some 60 scientists from 6 countries, and a total of 38 articles. The commission reported on 30 June 2006. The commission deemed much of Sudb√∏'s work invalid because of manipulation and fabrication of raw data: of the 38 articles he had published since 1993, 15 were condemned as fraudulent, including his doctoral dissertation. Because of this, the dissertation and the other fraudulent articles will be rescinded. The commission also criticised the co-authors of Sudb√∏'s papers. Professor Anders Ekbom, the Chair of the Commission, said: \\"One explanation of this catastrophe was that Sudb√∏ was a lone wolf. Few or anyone had insight into his work\\". The commission found no evidence that any of his co-authors had taken part in the fraud or otherwise been party to the deceit, although Sudb√∏'s supervisor accepted criticism for lack of vigilance and follow-up. In November 2006 his authorizations as a physician and a dentist were revoked by the Norwegian Board of Health Supervision, but in 2007 he was granted a strictly limited authorization to work as an assistant dentist. In 2009 he was granted restricted authorizations to practice as dentist and as a physician, however he cannot involve himself in research. Effects of fraud Rikshospitalet and the University were both criticized for \\"a lack of preliminary control and organization with a view to the researcher's [Sudb√∏'s] PhD project\\". The hospital was also criticized for \\"a lack of training and consciousness-raising in respect of the researcher and other employees with a view to the rules for handling patient material, preliminary assessments of research projects and authorship\\" and for \\"a lack of leadership and routines designed to expose and deal with non-conformance with its rules of procedure\\". The fraud may also have had international effects. The commission could not rule out that Sudb√∏'s false conclusions could have affected cancer patients around the world, because his findings were used by other scientists and incorporated into cancer treatments, although Sudb√∏'s solicitor Erling O. Lyngtveit had said on behalf of his client that none of the fraudulent articles had had any consequences for patients.http://depesjer.no/saker/sudb%C3%B8-case-co-author-responsibilities- disregarded/ Norway's scientific reputation could also be damaged by the affair, and \\"massive lawsuits\\" may be imminent from the national and international organisations that funded Sudb√∏'s fraudulent papers. According to the Norwegian news website Depesjer (\\"Dispatches\\"), scientific experts they consulted felt that Sudb√∏'s co-authors were \\"severely exploited\\", but also that closer observations of the Vancouver guidelines and other rules by co- authors would \\"hamper future attempts at publishing fabricated material\\". Dr. Atle Klovning, a leading European authority on evidence-based medicine, said in the article that Sudb√∏'s co-authors had probably not lived up to their responsibilities according to the Vancouver rules.

It tells the story of senior literature professor David Kepesh, renowned for his literature-themed radio show. Kepesh is finally destroyed by his inability to comprehend emotional commitment. The Dying Animal is the third book in a series portraying the life of the fictional professor, preceded by The Breast (1972) and The Professor of Desire (1977). Plot summary Kepesh is fascinated by the beautiful young Consuela Castillo, a student in one of his courses. An erotic liaison is formed between the two; Kepesh becomes obsessively enamored of his lover's breasts, a fetish developed in the previous novels. Despite his fevered devotion to Consuela, the sexually promiscuous professor maintains a concurrent affair with a previous lover, now divorced. He is also reluctant to expose himself to the scrutiny or ridicule that might follow from an introduction to Consuela's family. It is implied that he fears such a meeting would expose the implausible age gap in their relationship. Ultimately, Kepesh limits their relationship to the physical instead of embarking upon any deeper arrangement. In the end, Kepesh is destroyed by his indecisiveness, the fear of senescence, his lust and jealousy. Consuela never subsequently finds a lover who can show the same level of devotion to her body as Kepesh had. After some years of estrangement, she asks him to take nude photographs of her because she will be losing one of her breasts to a life-saving mastectomy. Most editions display a cover picture, Le grand nu (1919) by Amedeo Modigliani. In the novel, Consuela sends Kepesh a postcard depicting Le grand nu, and Kepesh surmises that the figure in the painting is her alter ego. Film adaptation The Isabel Coixet film Elegy (starring Pen√©lope Cruz and Ben Kingsley), which premiered at the 2008 Berlinale, is based on The Dying Animal.

The individual parts, such as eyes, ears, mouth and nose represent values of the variables by their shape, size, placement and orientation. The idea behind using faces is that humans easily recognize faces and notice small changes without difficulty. Chernoff faces handle each variable differently. Because the features of the faces vary in perceived importance, the way in which variables are mapped to the features should be carefully chosen (e.g. eye size and eyebrow-slant have been found to carry significant weight).\\"An Experimental Analysis of the Pre-Attentiveness of Features in Chernoff Faces\\", Morris CJ, Ebert DS, Rheingans P. 1999; published by the conference \\"Applied Imagery Pattern Recognition: 3D Visualization for Data Exploration and Decision Making\\". http://www.research.ibm.com/people/c/cjmorris/publications/Chernoff_990402.pdf Detail Chernoff faces themselves can be plotted on a standard X‚ÄìY graph; the faces can be positioned X‚ÄìY based on the two most important variables, and then the faces themselves represent the rest of the dimensions for each item. Edward Tufte, presenting such a diagram, says that this kind of Chernoff-face graph would \\"reduce well, maintaining legibility even with individual areas of 0.05 square inches as shown ... with cartoon faces and even numbers becoming data measures, we would appear to have reached the limit of graphical economy of presentation, imagination, and let it be admitted, eccentricity\\".Edward R. Tufte, The Visual Display of Quantitative Information, p. 142. Extensions=Asymmetrical faces In 1981, Bernhard Flury and Hans Riedwyl suggested \\"asymmetrical\\" Chernoff faces; since a face has vertical symmetry (around the y axis), the left side of the face is identical to the right and is basically wasted space ‚Äì a point also made by Tufte.Edward R. Tufte, The Visual Display of Quantitative Information, p. 97: \\"Halves may be easier to sort (by matching the right half of an unsorted face to the left half of a sorted face) than full faces. Or else an asymmetrical full face can be used to report additional variables (Flury & Riedwyl 1981). Bilateral symmetry doubles the space consumed by the design in a graph, without adding new information.\\" One could have the 18 variables that specify the left be one set of data, but use a different set of data for the right side of the face, allowing one face to depict 35 different measurements. They present results showing that such asymmetrical faces are useful in visualizing databases of identical twins, for example, and are useful in grouping as pairs of Chernoff faces would be. Chernoff fish In Visualizing Financial Data (), Julie Rodriguez and Piotr Kaczmarek use \\"Chernoff fish\\", where various parts of a cartoon fish are used to encode different financial details. In literature In the Peter Watts 2006 novel Blindsight a transhuman character is seen using Chernoff faces. This is explained by the character as a more efficient method of representing data, as a large portion of the human brain is devoted to facial recognition. In the sci-fi short story \\"Degrees of Freedom\\" by Karl Schroeder, Chernoff faces make a prominent appearances as a future technology, supporting the communication of aggregate sentiment and perspective.

Background He was born at 46 Gloucester Road, Regent's Park, LondonWilliam Job Collins at the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography - subscription required, accessed 30 July 2012 the eldest son of William Job Collins (also a doctor) and Mary Anne Francisca (n√©e Treacher). He attended University College School, London, and began his medical training at St Bartholomew's Hospital, where he became ophthalmic house surgeon, extern midwifery assistant and assistant demonstrator of anatomy at the medical school. His Times obituary reported that ' his further progress toward the staff of the school was barred by the heterodox views he held, and freely expressed, on the subject of vaccination' . He subsequently became a Fellow, Scholar and gold medallist in Sanitary Science and Obstetrics at the University of London, graduating as BSc in 1880 and MD in 1881. Along with Charles Creighton and Edgar Crookshank, he became one of a small number of medical critics of smallpox vaccination in the late 19th century. He was also a member of the Royal Commission on Vaccination, 1889‚Äì1896. He later specialised in anatomy and ophthalmology, in 1918 receiving the University of Oxford Doyne Ophthalmic Medal. He served two terms as Vice-Chancellor of the University of London in 1907-1909 and 1911‚Äì12. Political career In later life he turned to politics, elected as member of London County Council for St Pancras in 1892, reaching the office of chairman in 1897. In 1904, Collins was the first chairman of the education committee, which laid the foundation of the education service in London. He was elected Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) for St Pancras West, 1906‚Äì1910, and for Derby in 1917‚Äì18. In parliament he was particularly instrumental in promoting the Metropolitan Ambulance Act, that resulted in the establishment of the London ambulance service. He served on various government committees, including the Vivisection Committee 1906‚Äì1912, as British plenipotentiary at the international opium conferences at The Hague, 1911‚Äì1914, the Sussex Agricultural Wages Committee, and the Select Committee on the Hop Industry. He was knighted in the 1902 Coronation Honours, receiving the accolade from King Edward VII at Buckingham Palace on 24 October that year. He was later appointed a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (KCVO) in 1914, and served as Vice-Lieutenant of the County of London from 1925 to 1945. Personal life On 2 August 1898 Collins married Jane Stevenson Wilson (c,1855-1936), daughter of John Wilson, MP for Govan. Jane was a Sister at the National Temperance Hospital in Hampstead Road, north London. He died aged 87 at 1 Albert Terrace, Regent's Park where he had lived since the age of two.

ITSs have the common goal of enabling learning in a meaningful and effective manner by using a variety of computing technologies. There are many examples of ITSs being used in both formal education and professional settings in which they have demonstrated their capabilities and limitations. There is a close relationship between intelligent tutoring, cognitive learning theories and design; and there is ongoing research to improve the effectiveness of ITS. An ITS typically aims to replicate the demonstrated benefits of one-to-one, personalized tutoring, in contexts where students would otherwise have access to one-to-many instruction from a single teacher (e.g., classroom lectures), or no teacher at all (e.g., online homework). ITSs are often designed with the goal of providing access to high quality education to each and every student. History=Early mechanical systems Skinner teaching machine 08 The possibility of intelligent machines have been discussed for centuries. Blaise Pascal created the first calculating machine capable of mathematical functions in the 17th century simply called Pascal's Calculator. At this time the mathematician and philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz envisioned machines capable of reasoning and applying rules of logic to settle disputes (Buchanan, 2006).Buchanan, B. (2006). A (Very) Brief History of Artificial Intelligence. AI Magazine 26(4). pp.53-60. These early works contributed to the development of the computer and future applications. The concept of intelligent machines for instructional use date back as early as 1924, when Sidney Pressey of Ohio State University created a mechanical teaching machine to instruct students without a human teacher.Sidney PresseyFry, E. (1960). Teaching Machine Dichotomy: Skinner vs. Pressey. Pshychological Reports(6) 11-14. Southern University Press. His machine resembled closely a typewriter with several keys and a window that provided the learner with questions. The Pressey Machine allowed user input and provided immediate feedback by recording their score on a counter.Shute, V. J., & Psotka, J. (1994). Intelligent Tutoring Systems: Past, Present, and Future. Human resources directorate manpower and personnel research division. pp. 2-52 Pressey himself was influenced by Edward L. Thorndike, a learning theorist and educational psychologist at the Columbia University Teacher College of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Thorndike posited laws for maximizing learning. Thorndike's laws included the law of effect, the law of exercise, and the law of recency. Following later standards, Pressey's teaching and testing machine would not be considered intelligent as it was mechanically run and was based on one question and answer at a time, but it set an early precedent for future projects. By the 1950s and 1960s, new perspectives on learning were emerging. Burrhus Frederic \\"B.F.\\" Skinner at Harvard University did not agree with Thorndike's learning theory of connectionism or Pressey's teaching machine. Rather, Skinner was a behaviourist who believed that learners should construct their answers and not rely on recognition. He too, constructed a teaching machine structured using an incremental mechanical system that would reward students for correct responses to questions. Early electronic systems In the period following the second world war, mechanical binary systems gave way to binary based electronic machines. These machines were considered intelligent when compared to their mechanical counterparts as they had the capacity to make logical decisions. However, the study of defining and recognizing a machine intelligence was still in its infancy. Alan Turing, a mathematician, logician and computer scientist, linked computing systems to thinking. One of his most notable papers outlined a hypothetical test to assess the intelligence of a machine which came to be known as the Turing test. Essentially, the test would have a person communicate with two other agents, a human and a computer asking questions to both recipients. The computer passes the test if it can respond in such a way that the human posing the questions cannot differentiate between the other human and the computer. The Turing test has been used in its essence for more than two decades as a model for current ITS development. The main ideal for ITS systems is to effectively communicate. As early as the 1950s programs were emerging displaying intelligent features. Turing's work as well as later projects by researchers such as Allen Newell, Clifford Shaw, and Herb Simon showed programs capable of creating logical proofs and theorems. Their program, The Logic Theorist exhibited complex symbol manipulation and even generation of new information without direct human control and is considered by some to be the first AI program. Such breakthroughs would inspire the new field of Artificial Intelligence officially named in 1956 by John McCarthy in 1956 at the Dartmouth Conference. This conference was the first of its kind that was devoted to scientists and research in the field of AI. The PLATO V CAI terminal in 1981 The latter part of the 1960s and 1970s saw many new CAI (Computer-Assisted instruction) projects that built on advances in computer science. The creation of the ALGOL programming language in 1958 enabled many schools and universities to begin developing Computer Assisted Instruction (CAI) programs. Major computer vendors and federal agencies in the US such as IBM, HP, and the National Science Foundation funded the development of these projects.Chambers, J., & Sprecher, J. (1983). Computer-Assisted Instruction: Its Use in the Classroom. Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey: Prentice-Hall Inc. Early implementations in education focused on programmed instruction (PI), a structure based on a computerized input-output system. Although many supported this form of instruction, there was limited evidence supporting its effectiveness. The programming language LOGO was created in 1967 by Wally Feurzeig, Cynthia Solomon, and Seymour Papert as a language streamlined for education. PLATO, an educational terminal featuring displays, animations, and touch controls that could store and deliver large amounts of course material, was developed by Donald Bitzer in the University of Illinois in the early 1970s. Along with these, many other CAI projects were initiated in many countries including the US, the UK, and Canada. At the same time that CAI was gaining interest, Jaime Carbonell suggested that computers could act as a teacher rather than just a tool (Carbonell, 1970). A new perspective would emerge that focused on the use of computers to intelligently coach students called Intelligent Computer Assisted Instruction or Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS). Where CAI used a behaviourist perspective on learning based on Skinner's theories (Dede & Swigger, 1988),Larkin, J, & Chabay, R. (Eds.). (1992). Computer Assisted Instruction and Intelligent Tutoring Systems: Shared Goals and Complementary Approaches. Hillsdale, New Jersey: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates. ITS drew from work in cognitive psychology, computer science, and especially artificial intelligence. There was a shift in AI research at this time as systems moved from the logic focus of the previous decade to knowledge based systems‚Äîsystems could make intelligent decisions based on prior knowledge (Buchanan, 2006). Such a program was created by Seymour Papert and Ira Goldstein who created Dendral, a system that predicted possible chemical structures from existing data. Further work began to showcase analogical reasoning and language processing. These changes with a focus on knowledge had big implications for how computers could be used in instruction. The technical requirements of ITS, however, proved to be higher and more complex than CAI systems and ITS systems would find limited success at this time. Towards the latter part of the 1970s interest in CAI technologies began to wane. Computers were still expensive and not as available as expected. Developers and instructors were reacting negatively to the high cost of developing CAI programs, the inadequate provision for instructor training, and the lack of resources. Microcomputers and intelligent systems The microcomputer revolution in the late 1970s and early 1980s helped to revive CAI development and jumpstart development of ITS systems. Personal computers such as the Apple 2, Commodore PET, and TRS-80 reduced the resources required to own computers and by 1981, 50% of US schools were using computers (Chambers & Sprecher, 1983). Several CAI projects utilized the Apple 2 as a system to deliver CAI programs in high schools and universities including the British Columbia Project and California State University Project in 1981. The early 1980s would also see Intelligent Computer-Assisted Instruction (ICAI) and ITS goals diverge from their roots in CAI. As CAI became increasingly focused on deeper interactions with content created for a specific area of interest, ITS sought to create systems that focused on knowledge of the task and the ability to generalize that knowledge in non-specific ways (Larkin & Chabay, 1992). The key goals set out for ITS were to be able to teach a task as well as perform it, adapting dynamically to its situation. In the transition from CAI to ICAI systems, the computer would have to distinguish not only between the correct and incorrect response but the type of incorrect response to adjust the type of instruction. Research in Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Psychology fueled the new principles of ITS. Psychologists considered how a computer could solve problems and perform 'intelligent' activities. An ITS programme would have to be able to represent, store and retrieve knowledge and even search its own database to derive its own new knowledge to respond to learner's questions. Basically, early specifications for ITS or (ICAI) require it to \\"diagnose errors and tailor remediation based on the diagnosis\\" (Shute & Psotka, 1994, p. 9). The idea of diagnosis and remediation is still in use today when programming ITS. A key breakthrough in ITS research was the creation of The LISP Tutor, a program that implemented ITS principles in a practical way and showed promising effects increasing student performance. The LISP Tutor was developed and researched in 1983 as an ITS system for teaching students the LISP programming language (Corbett & Anderson, 1992).Corbett, A.T., & Anderson, J. R. (1992). LISP Intelligent Tutoring System Research in Skill Acquisition. In Larkin, J. & Chabay, R. (Eds.) Computer assisted instruction and intelligent tutoring systems: shared goals and complementary approaches (pp.73-110) Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey: Prentice-Hall Inc. The LISP Tutor could identify mistakes and provide constructive feedback to students while they were performing the exercise. The system was found to decrease the time required to complete the exercises while improving student test scores (Corbett & Anderson, 1992). Other ITS systems beginning to develop around this time include TUTOR created by Logica in 1984 as a general instructional toolFord, L. A New Intelligent Tutoring System (2008) British Journal of Educational Technology, 39(2), 311-318 and PARNASSUS created in Carnegie Mellon University in 1989 for language instruction.Bailin, A & Levin, L. Introduction: Intelligent Computer Assisted Language Instruction (1989) Computers and the Humanities, 23, 3-11 Modern ITS After the implementation of initial ITS, more researchers created a number of ITS for different students. In the late 20th century, Intelligent Tutoring Tools (ITTs) was developed by the Byzantium project, which involved six universities. The ITTs were general purpose tutoring system builders and many institutions had positive feedback while using them. (Kinshuk, 1996)Kinshuk (1996). Computer aided learning for entry level Accountancy students. PhD Thesis, De Montfort University, England, July 1996. This builder, ITT, would produce an Intelligent Tutoring Applet (ITA) for different subject areas. Different teachers created the ITAs and built up a large inventory of knowledge that was accessible by others through the Internet. Once an ITS was created, teachers could copy it and modify it for future use. This system was efficient and flexible. However, Kinshuk and Patel believed that the ITS was not designed from an educational point of view and was not developed based on the actual needs of students and teachers (Kinshuk and Patel, 1997).Kinshuk, and Ashok Patel.

Modern day ITSs typically try to replicate the role of a teacher or a teaching assistant, and increasingly automate pedagogical functions such as problem generation, problem selection, and feedback generation.

There were three ITS projects that functioned based on conversational dialogue: AutoTutor, Atlas (Freedman, 1999),Freedman, R. 1999. Atlas: A Plan Manager for Mixed-Initiative, Multimodal Dialogue. (1999) AAAI Workshop on Mixed-Initiative Intelligence and Why2. The idea behind these projects was that since students learn best by constructing knowledge themselves, the programs would begin with leading questions for the students and would give out answers as a last resort. AutoTutor's students focused on answering questions about computer technology, Atlas's students focused on solving quantitative problems, and Why2's students focused on explaining physical systems qualitatively.

Al Magazine 22.4, 39-52. Other similar tutoring systems such as Andes (Gertner, Conati, and VanLehn, 1998)Gertner, A.; Conati, C.; and VanLehn, K. (1998) Procedural Help in Andes; Generating Hints Using a Bayesian Network Student Model. Articicial Intelligence, 106-111. tend to provide hints and immediate feedback for students when students have trouble answering the questions. They could guess their answers and have correct answers without deep understanding of the concepts. Research was done with a small group of students using Atlas and Andes respectively. The results showed that students using Atlas made significant improvements compared with students who used Andes.Shelby, R. N.; Schulze, K. G.; Treacy, D. J.; Wintersgill, M. C.; VanLehn, K.; and Weinstein, A. (2001) The Assessment of Andes Tutor. However, since the above systems require analysis of students' dialogues, improvement is yet to be made so that more complicated dialogues can be managed. Structure Intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) consist of four basic components based on a general consensus amongst researchers (Nwana,1990; Freedman, 2000; Nkambou et al., 2010Nkambou, R., Mizoguchi, R., & Bourdeau, J. (2010). Advances in intelligent tutoring systems. Heidelberg: Springer.): #The Domain model #The Student model #The Tutoring model, and #The User interface model The domain model (also known as the cognitive model or expert knowledge model) is built on a theory of learning, such as the ACT-R theory which tries to take into account all the possible steps required to solve a problem. More specifically, this model \\"contains the concepts, rules, and problem-solving strategies of the domain to be learned. It can fulfill several roles: as a source of expert knowledge, a standard for evaluating the student's performance or for detecting errors, etc.\\" (Nkambou et al., 2010, p. 4). Another approach for developing domain models is based on Stellan Ohlsson's Theory of Learning from performance errors,Ohlsson, S. (1996) Learning from Performance Errors. Psychological Review, 103, 241-262. known as constraint-based modelling (CBM).Ohlsson, S. (1992) Constraint-based Student Modeling. Artificial Intelligence in Education, 3(4), 429-447. In this case, the domain model is presented as a set of constraints on correct solutions.Mitrovic, A., Ohlsson, S. (2006) Constraint-Based Knowledge Representation for Individualized Instruction. Computer Science and Information Systems, 3(1), 1-22.Ohlsson, S., Mitrovic, A. (2007) Fidelity and Efficiency of Knowledge representations for intelligent tutoring systems. Technology, Instruction, Cognition and Learning, 5(2), 101-132. The student model can be thought of as an overlay on the domain model. It is considered as the core component of an ITS paying special attention to student's cognitive and affective states and their evolution as the learning process advances. As the student works step-by-step through their problem solving process, an ITS engages in a process called model tracing. Anytime the student model deviates from the domain model, the system identifies, or flags, that an error has occurred. On the other hand, in constraint-based tutors the student model is represented as an overlay on the constraint set.Mitrovic, A. and Ohlsson, S. (1999) Evaluation of a Constraint- Based Tutor for a Database Language. Int. J. Artificial Intelligence in Education, 10(3-4), 238-256. Constraint-based tutorsMitrovic, A. (2010) Fifteen years of Constraint-Based Tutors: What we have achieved and where we are going. User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction, 22(1-2), 39-72. evaluate the student's solution against the constraint set, and identify satisfied and violated constraints. If there are any violated constraints, the student's solution is incorrect, and the ITS provides feedback on those constraints.Mitrovic, A., Martin, B., Suraweera, P. (2007) Intelligent tutors for all: Constraint-based modeling methodology, systems and authoring. IEEE Intelligent Systems, 22(4), 38-45.Zakharov, K., Mitrovic, A., Ohlsson, S. (2005) Feedback Micro-engineering in EER-Tutor. In: C-K Looi, G. McCalla, B. Bredeweg, J. Breuker (eds) Proc. Artificial Intelligence in Education AIED 2005, IOS Press, pp. 718-725. Constraint-based tutors provide negative feedback (i.e. feedback on errors) and also positive feedback.Mitrovic, A., Ohlsson, S., Barrow, D. (2013) The effect of positive feedback in a constraint-based intelligent tutoring system. Computers & Education, 60(1), 264-272. The tutor model accepts information from the domain and student models and makes choices about tutoring strategies and actions. At any point in the problem-solving process the learner may request guidance on what to do next, relative to their current location in the model. In addition, the system recognizes when the learner has deviated from the production rules of the model and provides timely feedback for the learner, resulting in a shorter period of time to reach proficiency with the targeted skills. The tutor model may contain several hundred production rules that can be said to exist in one of two states, learned or unlearned. Every time a student successfully applies a rule to a problem, the system updates a probability estimate that the student has learned the rule. The system continues to drill students on exercises that require effective application of a rule until the probability that the rule has been learned reaches at least 95% probability.Corbett, Albert T. and Anderson, John R., \\"Student Modeling and Mastery Learning in a Computer-Based Programming Tutor\\" (2008). Department of Psychology. Paper 18. http://repository.cmu.edu/psychology/18 Knowledge tracing tracks the learner's progress from problem to problem and builds a profile of strengths and weaknesses relative to the production rules. The cognitive tutoring system developed by John Anderson at Carnegie Mellon University presents information from knowledge tracing as a skillometer, a visual graph of the learner's success in each of the monitored skills related to solving algebra problems. When a learner requests a hint, or an error is flagged, the knowledge tracing data and the skillometer are updated in real-time. The user interface component \\"integrates three types of information that are needed in carrying out a dialogue: knowledge about patterns of interpretation (to understand a speaker) and action (to generate utterances) within dialogues; domain knowledge needed for communicating content; and knowledge needed for communicating intent\\" (Padayachee, 2002, p. 3).Padayachee I. (2002). Intelligent Tutoring Systems: Architecture and Characteristics. Nkambou et al. (2010) make mention of Nwana's (1990) review of different architectures underlining a strong link between architecture and paradigm (or philosophy). Nwana (1990) declares, \\"[I]t is almost a rarity to find two ITSs based on the same architecture [which] results from the experimental nature of the work in the area\\" (p. 258). He further explains that differing tutoring philosophies emphasize different components of the learning process (i.e., domain, student or tutor). The architectural design of an ITS reflects this emphasis, and this leads to a variety of architectures, none of which, individually, can support all tutoring strategies (Nwana, 1990, as cited in Nkambou et al., 2010). Moreover, ITS projects may vary according to the relative level of intelligence of the components. As an example, a project highlighting intelligence in the domain model may generate solutions to complex and novel problems so that students can always have new problems to work on, but it might only have simple methods for teaching those problems, while a system that concentrates on multiple or novel ways of teaching a particular topic might find a less sophisticated representation of that content sufficient. Design and development methods Apart from the discrepancy amongst ITS architectures each emphasizing different elements, the development of an ITS is much the same as any instructional design process. Corbett et al. (1997) summarized ITS design and development as consisting of four iterative stages: (1) needs assessment, (2) cognitive task analysis, (3) initial tutor implementation and (4) evaluation.Corbett A. T., Koedinger, K. R., & Anderson, J. R. (1997). Intelligent tutoring systems. In M. G. Helander, T. K. Landauer, & P. V. Prabhu (Eds.), Handbook of human-computer interaction (pp. 849‚Äì874). Amsterdam: Elsevier. The first stage known as needs assessment is common to any instructional design process, especially software development. This involves a learner analysis, consultation with subject matter experts and/or the instructor(s). This first step is part of the development of the expert/knowledge and student domain. The goal is to specify learning goals and to outline a general plan for the curriculum; it is imperative not to computerize traditional concepts but develop a new curriculum structure by defining the task in general and understanding learners' possible behaviours dealing with the task and to a lesser degree the tutor's behavior. In doing so, three crucial dimensions need to be dealt with: (1) the probability a student is able to solve problems; (2) the time it takes to reach this performance level and (3) the probability the student will actively use this knowledge in the future. Another important aspect that requires analysis is cost effectiveness of the interface. Moreover, teachers and student entry characteristics such as prior knowledge must be assessed since both groups are going to be system users. The second stage, cognitive task analysis, is a detailed approach to expert systems programming with the goal of developing a valid computational model of the required problem solving knowledge. Chief methods for developing a domain model include: (1) interviewing domain experts, (2) conducting \\"think aloud\\" protocol studies with domain experts, (3) conducting \\"think aloud\\" studies with novices and (4) observation of teaching and learning behavior. Although the first method is most commonly used, experts are usually incapable of reporting cognitive components. The \\"think aloud\\" methods, in which the experts is asked to report aloud what s/he is thinking when solving typical problems, can avoid this problem. Observation of actual online interactions between tutors and students provides information related to the processes used in problem-solving, which is useful for building dialogue or interactivity into tutoring systems. The third stage, initial tutor implementation, involves setting up a problem solving environment to enable and support an authentic learning process. This stage is followed by a series of evaluation activities as the final stage which is again similar to any software development project. The fourth stage, evaluation includes (1) pilot studies to confirm basic usability and educational impact; (2) formative evaluations of the system under development, including (3) parametric studies that examine the effectiveness of system features and finally, (4) summative evaluations of the final tutor's effect: learning rate and asymptotic achievement levels. A variety of authoring tools have been developed to support this process and create intelligent tutors, including ASPIREMitrovic, A., Martin, B., Suraweera, P., Zakharov, K., Milik, N., Holland, J., & Mcguigan, N. (2009).

The goal of most of these authoring tools is to simplify the tutor development process, making it possible for people with less expertise than professional AI programmers to develop Intelligent Tutoring Systems. Eight principles of ITS design and development Anderson et al. (1987)Anderson, J., Boyle, C., Farrell, R., & Reiser, B. (1987). Cognitive principles in the design of computer tutors. In P. Morris (Ed.), Modeling cognition. NY: John Wiley. outlined eight principles for intelligent tutor design and Corbett et al. (1997) later elaborated on those principles highlighting an all-embracing principle which they believed governed intelligent tutor design, they referred to this principle as: Principle 0: An intelligent tutor system should enable the student to work to the successful conclusion of problem solving. # Represent student competence as a production set. # Communicate the goal structure underlying the problem solving. # Provide instruction in the problem solving context. # Promote an abstract understanding of the problem-solving knowledge. #Minimize working memory load. #Provide immediate feedback on errors. #Adjust the grain size of instruction with learning. #Facilitate successive approximations to the target skill. Use in practice All this is a substantial amount of work, even if authoring tools have become available to ease the task.For an example of an ITS authoring tool, see Cognitive Tutoring Authoring Tools This means that building an ITS is an option only in situations in which they, in spite of their relatively high development costs, still reduce the overall costs through reducing the need for human instructors or sufficiently boosting overall productivity. Such situations occur when large groups need to be tutored simultaneously or many replicated tutoring efforts are needed. Cases in point are technical training situations such as training of military recruits and high school mathematics. One specific type of intelligent tutoring system, the Cognitive Tutor, has been incorporated into mathematics curricula in a substantial number of United States high schools, producing improved student learning outcomes on final exams and standardized tests. Intelligent tutoring systems have been constructed to help students learn geography, circuits, medical diagnosis, computer programming, mathematics, physics, genetics, chemistry, etc. Intelligent Language Tutoring Systems (ILTS), e.g. this one, teach natural language to first or second language learners. ILTS requires specialized natural language processing tools such as large dictionaries and morphological and grammatical analyzers with acceptable coverage. Applications During the rapid expansion of the web boom, new computer-aided instruction paradigms, such as e-learning and distributed learning, provided an excellent platform for ITS ideas. Areas that have used ITS include natural language processing, machine learning, planning, multi-agent systems, ontologies, semantic Web, and social and emotional computing. In addition, other technologies such as multimedia, object-oriented systems, modeling, simulation, and statistics have also been connected to or combined with ITS. Historically non-technological areas such as the educational sciences and psychology have also been influenced by the success of ITS.Ramos, C., Ramos, C., Frasson, C., & Ramachandran, S. (2009). Introduction to the special issue on real world applications of intelligent tutoring systems. , 2(2) 62-63. In recent years, ITS has begun to move away from the search-based to include a range of practical applications.https://trac.v2.nl/export/.../Intelligent%20Tutoring%20Systems.pdf ITS have expanded across many critical and complex cognitive domains, and the results have been far reaching. ITS systems have cemented a place within formal education and these systems have found homes in the sphere of corporate training and organizational learning. ITS offers learners several affordances such as individualized learning, just in time feedback, and flexibility in time and space. While Intelligent tutoring systems evolved from research in cognitive psychology and artificial intelligence, there are now many applications found in education and in organizations. Intelligent tutoring systems can be found in online environments or in a traditional classroom computer lab, and are used in K-12 classrooms as well as in universities. There are a number of programs that target mathematics but applications can be found in health sciences, language acquisition, and other areas of formalized learning. Reports of improvement in student comprehension, engagement, attitude, motivation, and academic results have all contributed to the ongoing interest in the investment in and research of theses systems. The personalized nature of the intelligent tutoring systems affords educators the opportunity to create individualized programs. Within education there are a plethora of intelligent tutoring systems, an exhaustive list does not exist but several of the more influential programs are listed below. Education Algebra Tutor PAT (PUMP Algebra Tutor or Practical Algebra Tutor) developed by the Pittsburgh Advanced Cognitive Tutor Center at Carnegie Mellon University, engages students in anchored learning problems and uses modern algebraic tools in order to engage students in problem solving and in sharing of their results. The aim of PAT is to tap into a students' prior knowledge and everyday experiences with mathematics in order to promote growth. The success of PAT is well documented (ex. Miami-Dade County Public Schools Office of Evaluation and Research) from both a statistical (student results) and emotional (student and instructor feedback) perspective.Evaluation of the Cognitive Tutor Algebra I Program A Shneyderman ‚Äì Miami‚ÄìDade County Public Schools, Office of Evaluation and Research, Miami Fl.

Mathematics Tutor The Mathematics Tutor (Beal, Beck & Woolf, 1998) helps students solve word problems using fractions, decimals and percentages. The tutor records the success rates while a student is working on problems while providing subsequent, lever-appropriate problems for the student to work on. The subsequent problems that are selected are based on student ability and a desirable time in is estimated in which the student is to solve the problem.Beal, C. R., Beck, J., & Woolf, B. (1998).

Paper presented at the annual meeting of the American Educational Research Association. eTeacher eTeacher (Schiaffino et al., 2008) is an intelligent agent or pedagogical agent, that supports personalized e-learning assistance. It builds student profiles while observing student performance in online courses. eTeacher then uses the information from the student's performance to suggest a personalized courses of action designed to assist their learning process.Schiaffino, S., Garcia, P., & Amandi, A. (2008). eTeacher: Providing personalized assistance to e-learning students. Computers & Education 51 , 1744-1754 ZOSMAT ZOSMAT was designed to address all the needs of a real classroom. It follows and guides a student in different stages of their learning process. This is a student-centered ITS does this by recording the progress in a student's learning and the student program changes based on the student's effort. ZOSMAT can be used for either individual learning or in a real classroom environment alongside the guidance of a human tutor. REALP REALP was designed to help students enhance their reading comprehension by providing reader-specific lexical practice and offering personalized practice with useful, authentic reading materials gathered from the Web. The system automatically build a user model according to student's performance. After reading, the student is given a series of exercises based on the target vocabulary found in reading.Heffernan, N.

It uses natural dialogue based, Socratic language to help students learn about regulating blood pressure.http://www.cs.iit.edu/~circsim/ Why2-Atlas Why2-Atlas is an ITS that analyses students explanations of physics principles. The students input their work in paragraph form and the program converts their words into a proof by making assumptions of student beliefs that are based on their explanations. In doing this, misconceptions and incomplete explanations are highlighted. The system then addresses these issues through a dialogue with the student and asks the student to correct their essay. A number of iterations may take place before the process is complete.aroque.bol.ucla.edu/pubs/vanLehnEtAl- its02-architectureWhy.pdf SmartTutor The University of Hong Kong (HKU) developed a SmartTutor to support the needs of continuing education students. Personalized learning was identified as a key need within adult education at HKU and SmartTutor aims to fill that need. SmartTutor provides support for students by combining Internet technology, educational research and artificial intelligence. AutoTutor AutoTutor assists college students in learning about computer hardware, operating systems and the Internet in an introductory computer literacy course by simulating the discourse patterns and pedagogical strategies of a human tutor. AutoTutor attempts to understand learner's input from the keyboard and then formulate dialog moves with feedback, prompts, correction and hints.Graesser, A.C., Wiemer-Hastings, K., Wiemer-Hastings, P., & Kreuz, R., & TRG.

Corporate training and industry Generalized Intelligent Framework for Tutoring (GIFT) is an educational software designed for creation of computer-based tutoring systems. Developed by the U.S. Army Research Laboratory from 2009 to 2011, GIFT was released for commercial use in May 2012. GIFT is open-source and domain independent, and can be downloaded online for free. The software allows an instructor to design a tutoring program that can cover various disciplines through adjustments to existing courses. It includes coursework tools intended for use by researchers, instructional designers, instructors, and students. GIFT is compatible with other teaching materials, such as PowerPoint presentations, which can be integrated into the program. SHERLOCK \\"SHERLOCK\\" is used to train Air Force technicians to diagnose problems in the electrical systems of F-15 jets. The ITS creates faulty schematic diagrams of systems for the trainee to locate and diagnose. The ITS provides diagnostic readings allowing the trainee to decide whether the fault lies in the circuit being tested or if it lies elsewhere in the system. Feedback and guidance are provided by the system and help is available if requested. Cardiac Tutor The Cardiac Tutor's aim is to support advanced cardiac support techniques to medical personnel. The tutor presents cardiac problems and, using a variety of steps, students must select various interventions. Cardiac Tutor provides clues, verbal advice, and feedback in order to personalize and optimize the learning. Each simulation, regardless of whether the students were successfully able to help their patients, results in a detailed report which students then review.Eliot, C., & Woolf, B. (1994). Reasoning about the user within a simulation-based real-time training system. In Proceedings of the fourth international conference on user modeling , 121-126. CODES Cooperative Music Prototype Design is a Web-based environment for cooperative music prototyping. It was designed to support users, especially those who are not specialists in music, in creating musical pieces in a prototyping manner. The musical examples (prototypes) can be repeatedly tested, played and modified. One of the main aspects of CODES is interaction and cooperation between the music creators and their partners.MILETTO, E. M., PIMENTA, M. S., VICARI, R. M., & FLORES, L. V. (2005). CODES: A web-based environment for cooperative music prototyping. Organised Sound, 10(3), 243-253. Effectiveness Assessing the effectiveness of ITS programs is problematic. ITS vary greatly in design, implementation, and educational focus. When ITS are used in a classroom, the system is not only used by students, but by teachers as well. This usage can create barriers to effective evaluation for a number of reasons; most notably due to teacher intervention in student learning. Teachers often have the ability to enter new problems into the system or adjust the curriculum. In addition, teachers and peers often interact with students while they learn with ITSs (e.g., during an individual computer lab session or during classroom lectures falling in between lab sessions) in ways that may influence their learning with the software. Prior work suggests that the vast majority of students' help-seeking behavior in classrooms using ITSs may occur entirely outside of the software - meaning that the nature and quality of peer and teacher feedback in a given class may be an important mediator of student learning in these contexts. In addition, aspects of classroom climate, such as students' overall level of comfort in publicly asking for help, or the degree to which a teacher is physically active in monitoring individual studentsHolstein, K., McLaren, B. M., & Aleven, V. (2017, March). SPACLE: investigating learning across virtual and physical spaces using spatial replays.

Kurt VanLehn's much more recent overview (2011) of modern ITS found that there was no statistical difference in effect size between expert one-on-one human tutors and step-based ITS. Some individual ITS have been evaluated more positively than others. Studies of the Algebra Cognitive Tutor found that the ITS students outperformed students taught by a classroom teacher on standardized test problems and real-world problem solving tasks. Subsequent studies found that these results were particularly pronounced in students from special education, non-native English, and low-income backgrounds. A more recent meta-analysis suggests that ITSs can exceed the effectiveness of both CAI and human tutors, especially when measured by local (specific) tests as opposed to standardized tests. \\"Students who received intelligent tutoring outperformed students from conventional classes in 46 (or 92%) of the 50 controlled evaluations, and the improvement in performance was great enough to be considered of substantive importance in 39 (or 78%) of the 50 studies. The median ES in the 50 studies was 0.66, which is considered a moderate-to-large effect for studies in the social sciences. It is roughly equivalent to an improvement in test performance from the 50th to the 75th percentile. This is stronger than typical effects from other forms of tutoring. C.-L. C. Kulik and Kulik‚Äôs (1991) meta-analysis, for example, found an average ES of 0.31 in 165 studies of CAI tutoring. ITS gains are about twice as high. The ITS effect is also greater than typical effects from human tutoring. As we have seen, programs of human tutoring typically raise student test scores about 0.4 standard deviations over control levels. Developers of ITSs long ago set out to improve on the success of CAI tutoring and to match the success of human tutoring. Our results suggest that ITS developers have already met both of these goals.... Although effects were moderate to strong in evaluations that measured outcomes on locally developed tests, they were much smaller in evaluations that measured outcomes on standardized tests. Average ES on studies with local tests was 0.73; average ES on studies with standardized tests was 0.13. This discrepancy is not unusual for meta-analyses that include both local and standardized tests... local tests are likely to align well with the objectives of specific instructional programs. Off-the-shelf standardized tests provide a looser fit. ... Our own belief is that both local and standardized tests provide important information about instructional effectiveness, and when possible, both types of tests should be included in evaluation studies.\\" Some recognized strengths of ITS are their ability to provide immediate yes/no feedback, individual task selection, on-demand hints, and support mastery learning. Limitations Intelligent tutoring systems are expensive both to develop and implement. The research phase paves the way for the development of systems that are commercially viable. However, the research phase is often expensive; it requires the cooperation and input of subject matter experts, the cooperation and support of individuals across both organizations and organizational levels. Another limitation in the development phase is the conceptualization and the development of software within both budget and time constraints. There are also factors that limit the incorporation of intelligent tutors into the real world, including the long timeframe required for development and the high cost of the creation of the system components. A high portion of that cost is a result of content component building. For instance, surveys revealed that encoding an hour of online instruction time took 300 hours of development time for tutoring content.Murray, T. (1999). Authoring intelligent tutoring systems: An analysis of the state of the art. International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education (IJAIED), 10, 98‚Äì129. Similarly, building the Cognitive Tutor took a ratio of development time to instruction time of at least 200:1 hours. The high cost of development often eclipses replicating the efforts for real world application. Intelligent tutoring systems are not, in general, commercially feasible for real-world applications. A criticism of Intelligent Tutoring Systems currently in use, is the pedagogy of immediate feedback and hint sequences that are built in to make the system \\"intelligent\\". This pedagogy is criticized for its failure to develop deep learning in students. When students are given control over the ability to receive hints, the learning response created is negative. Some students immediately turn to the hints before attempting to solve the problem or complete the task. When it is possible to do so, some students bottom out the hints ‚Äì receiving as many hints as possible as fast as possible ‚Äì in order to complete the task faster. If students fail to reflect on the tutoring system's feedback or hints, and instead increase guessing until positive feedback is garnered, the student is, in effect, learning to do the right thing for the wrong reasons. Most tutoring systems are currently unable to detect shallow learning, or to distinguish between productive versus unproductive struggle (though see, e.g.,Baker, R., Gowda, S., Corbett, A., & Ocumpaugh, J. (2012). Towards automatically detecting whether student learning is shallow. In Intelligent Tutoring Systems (pp. 444-453). Springer Berlin/Heidelberg.K√§ser, T., Klingler, S., & Gross, M. (2016, April). When to stop?: towards universal instructional policies. In Proceedings of the Sixth International Conference on Learning Analytics & Knowledge (pp. 289-298). ACM.). For these and many other reasons (e.g., overfitting of underlying models to particular user populationsOcumpaugh, J., Baker, R., Gowda, S., Heffernan, N., & Heffernan, C. (2014). Population validity for Educational Data Mining models: A case study in affect detection. British Journal of Educational Technology, 45(3), 487-501.), the effectiveness of these systems may differ significantly across users. Another criticism of intelligent tutoring systems is the failure of the system to ask questions of the students to explain their actions. If the student is not learning the domain language than it becomes more difficult to gain a deeper understanding, to work collaboratively in groups, and to transfer the domain language to writing. For example, if the student is not \\"talking science\\" than it is argued that they are not being immersed in the culture of science, making it difficult to undertake scientific writing or participate in collaborative team efforts. Intelligent tutoring systems have been criticized for being too \\"instructivist\\" and removing intrinsic motivation, social learning contexts, and context realism from learning.Jonassen, D. H., & Reeves, T. C. (1996). Learning with technology: Using computers as cognitive tools. In D. H. Jonassen (Ed.), Handbook of research on educational communications and technology (pp. 693 - 719). New York: Macmillan. Practical concerns, in terms of the inclination of the sponsors/authorities and the users to adapt intelligent tutoring systems, should be taken into account.Polson, Martha C.; Richardson, J. Jeffrey, eds. (1988). Foundations of Intelligent Tutoring Systems. Lawrence Erlbaum. First, someone must have a willingness to implement the ITS. Additionally an authority must recognize the necessity to integrate an intelligent tutoring software into current curriculum and finally, the sponsor or authority must offer the needed support through the stages of the system development until it is completed and implemented. Evaluation of an intelligent tutoring system is an important phase; however, it is often difficult, costly, and time consuming. Even though there are various evaluation techniques presented in the literature, there are no guiding principles for the selection of appropriate evaluation method(s) to be used in a particular context.Iqbal, A., Oppermann, R., Patel, A. & Kinshuk (1999). A Classification of Evaluation Methods for Intelligent Tutoring Systems. In U. Arend, E. Eberleh & K. Pitschke (Eds.) Software Ergonomie '99 - Design von Informationswelten, Leipzig: B. G. Teubner Stuttgart, 169-181.Siemer, J., & Angelides, M. C. (1998). A comprehensive method for the evaluation of complete intelligent tutoring systems. Decision support systems, 22(1), 85‚Äì102. Careful inspection should be undertaken to ensure that a complex system does what it claims to do. This assessment may occur during the design and early development of the system to identify problems and to guide modifications (i.e. formative evaluation).Mark, M. A., Greer, J. E.. (1993). Evaluation methodologies for intelligent tutoring systems. Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education, 4, 129‚Äì129. In contrast, the evaluation may occur after the completion of the system to support formal claims about the construction, behaviour of, or outcomes associated with a completed system (i.e. summative evaluation). The great challenge introduced by the lack of evaluation standards resulted in neglecting the evaluation stage in several existing ITS'. Improvements Intelligent tutoring systems are less capable than human tutors in the areas of dialogue and feedback. For example, human tutors are able to interpret the affective state of the student, and potentially adapt instruction in response to these perceptions. Recent work is exploring potential strategies for overcoming these limitations of ITSs, to make them more effective. Dialogue Human tutors have the ability to understand a person's tone and inflection within a dialogue and interpret this to provide continual feedback through an ongoing dialogue. Intelligent tutoring systems are now being developed to attempt to simulate natural conversations. To get the full experience of dialogue there are many different areas in which a computer must be programmed; including being able to understand tone, inflection, body language, and facial expression and then to respond to these. Dialogue in an ITS can be used to ask specific questions to help guide students and elicit information while allowing students to construct their own knowledge.Graessner A. C., Kurt VanLehn, C. P R., Jordan, P. & Harter, D. (2001). Intelligent tutoring systems with conversational dialogue. AI Magazine, 22(4), 39. The development of more sophisticated dialogue within an ITS has been a focus in some current research partially to address the limitations and create a more constructivist approach to ITS.Graesser, A. C., Chipman, P., Haynes, B. C., & Olney, A. (2005). AutoTutor: An intelligent tutoring system with mixed-initiative dialogue. , 48(4) 612-618. In addition, some current research has focused on modeling the nature and effects of various social cues commonly employed within a dialogue by human tutors and tutees, in order to build trust and rapport (which have been shown to have positive impacts on student learning).Zhao, R., Papangelis, A., & Cassell, J. (2014, August). Towards a dyadic computational model of rapport management for human-virtual agent interaction. In International Conference on Intelligent Virtual Agents (pp. 514-527). Springer International Publishing.Madaio, M. A., Ogan, A., & Cassell, J. (2016, June). The Effect of Friendship and Tutoring Roles on Reciprocal Peer Tutoring Strategies. In International Conference on Intelligent Tutoring Systems (pp. 423-429). Springer International Publishing. Emotional affect A growing body of work is considering the role of affect on learning, with the objective of developing intelligent tutoring systems that can interpret and adapt to the different emotional states. Humans do not just use cognitive processes in learning but the affective processes they go through also plays an important role. For example, learners learn better when they have a certain level of disequilibrium (frustration), but not enough to make the learner feel completely overwhelmed. This has motivated affective computing to begin to produce and research creating intelligent tutoring systems that can interpret the affective process of an individual. An ITS can be developed to read an individual's expressions and other signs of affect in an attempt to find and tutor to the optimal affective state for learning. There are many complications in doing this since affect is not expressed in just one way but in multiple ways so that for an ITS to be effective in interpreting affective states it may require a multimodal approach (tone, facial expression, etc...). These ideas have created a new field within ITS, that of Affective Tutoring Systems (ATS). One example of an ITS that addresses affect is Gaze Tutor which was developed to track students eye movements and determine whether they are bored or distracted and then the system attempts to reengage the student. Rapport Building To date, most ITSs have focused purely on the cognitive aspects of tutoring and not on the social relationship between the tutoring system and the student. As demonstrated by the Computers are social actors paradigm humans often project social heuristics onto computers. For example in observations of young children interacting with Sam the CastleMate, a collaborative story telling agent, children interacted with this simulated child in much the same manner as they would a human child. It has been suggested that to effectively design an ITS that builds rapport with students, the ITS should mimic strategies of instructional immediacy, behaviors which bridge the apparent social distance between students and teachers such as smiling and addressing students by name. With regard to teenagers, Ogan et. al draw from observations of close friends tutoring each other to argue that in order for an ITS to build rapport as a peer to a student, a more involved process of trust building is likely necessary which may ultimately require that the tutoring system possess the capability to effectively respond to and even produce seemingly rude behavior in order to mediate motivational and affective student factors through playful joking and taunting. Teachable Agents Traditionally ITSs take on the role of autonomous tutors, however they can also take on the role of tutees for the purpose of learning by teaching exercises. Evidence suggests that learning by teaching can be an effective strategy for mediating self-explanation, improving feelings of self-efficacy, and boosting educational outcomes and retention. In order to replicate this effect the roles of the student and ITS can be switched. This can be achieved by designing the ITS to have the appearance of being taught as is the case in the Teachable Agent Arithmetic Game and Betty's Brain. Another approach is to have students teach a machine learning agent which can learn to solve problems by demonstration and correctness feedback as is the case in the APLUS system built with SimStudent. In order to replicate the educational effects of learning by teaching teachable agents generally have a social agent built on top of them which poses questions or conveys confusion. For example Betty from Betty's Brain will prompt the student to ask her questions to make sure that she understands the material, and Stacy from APLUS will prompt the user for explanations of the feedback provided by the student. Related conferences Several conferences regularly consider papers on intelligent tutoring systems. The oldest is The International Conference on Intelligent Tutoring Systems, which started in 1988 and is now held every other year. The International Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED) Society publishes The International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education (IJAIED) and organizes the annual International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education (http://iaied.org/conf/1/) started in 1989. Many papers on intelligent tutoring systems also appear at International Conference on User Modeling, Adaptation, and Personalization () and International Conference on Educational Data Mining (). The American Association of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) will sometimes have symposia and papers related to intelligent tutoring systems. A number of books have been written on ITS including three published by Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.

According to Albert Einstein's theory of relativity, a high-energy nucleus appears length contracted, or compressed, along its direction of motion. As a result, the gluons inside the nucleus appear to a stationary observer as a \\"gluonic wall\\" traveling near the speed of light. At very high energies, the density of the gluons in this wall is seen to increase greatly. Unlike the quark‚Äìgluon plasma produced in the collision of such walls, the color-glass condensate describes the walls themselves, and is an intrinsic property of the particles that can only be observed under high-energy conditions such as those at RHIC and possibly at the Large Hadron Collider as well. \\"Color\\" in the name \\"color-glass condensate\\" refers to a type of charge that quarks and gluons carry as a result of the strong nuclear force. The word \\"glass\\" is borrowed from the term for silica and other materials that are disordered and act like solids on short time scales but liquids on long time scales. In the \\"gluon walls,\\" the gluons themselves are disordered and do not change their positions rapidly because of time dilation. \\"Condensate\\" means that the gluons have a very high density. The color-glass condensate is important because it is proposed as a universal form of matter that describes the properties of all high-energy, strongly interacting particles. It has simple properties that follow from first principles in the theory of strong interactions, quantum chromodynamics. It has the potential to explain many unsolved problems such as how particles are produced in high-energy collisions, and the distribution of matter itself inside of these particles. Researchers at CERN believe they have created color-glass condensates during collisions of protons with lead ions. In these sorts of collisions, the standard outcome is that new particles are created and fly off in different directions. However, the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) team at the LHC found that in a sample of 2 million lead-proton collisions, some pairs of particles flew away from each other with their respective directions correlated. This correlation of directions is the anomaly that might be caused by the existence of a color-glass condensate while the particles are colliding.

The show centres on the two presenters, Holly Willoughby and Steve Wilson, setting each other challenges to test their nerve. It uses common phobias, such as the fear of heights and the dark, as the basis. It was produced by Darrall Macqueen.  Show Format  The shows are broadcast alternately: one week Holly will set Steve a fear to face and the next week Steve will present a challenge to Holly. The 'boys v girls' idea is a sub-theme of the programme. Whoever is facing their fear completes three challenges over two days, two on day one and another on day two. These increase in difficulty as they progress, and the final challenge really determines whether the fear has been overcome or not.  Other Features  During the challenges a phobia expert, Anjula Mutanda, monitors the heartbeat of the contestant in order to find out whether they are 'feeling the fear'. There is also a 'body burst' section, in which Anjula explains, with the aid of an animated sequence, the science behind the fears and the body's reactions to these.

The first, a 1989 Thanksgiving Day game in Dallas, was noted for allegations that the Eagles put a $200 bounty on Cowboys kicker Luis Zendejas, who had been cut by Philadelphia earlier that season. The second was a rematch held two weeks later in Philadelphia. The Eagles, favored to win both games, swept the series.  Bounty Bowl I: The 1989 Thanksgiving Classic  The Cowboys/Eagles rivalry had been increasingly heated since the 1986 season, with Buddy Ryan arriving as the Eagles' head coach; the next year, during the NFL players' strike, the Cowboys (who were playing with a number of players that crossed picket lines) routed an Eagles squad filled with replacement players; Ryan, believing that the Cowboys had run up the score in poor form, responded in kind in the second game when the strike was over. After the 1988 season, the Cowboys were sold to Jerry Jones, who proceeded to gut the team and fire longtime head coach Tom Landry in preparation for rebuilding. On November 23, 1989, the Philadelphia Eagles defeated the Dallas Cowboys 27‚Äì0. Following the game, which was broadcast on CBS, Cowboys head coach Jimmy Johnson alleged that Ryan had taken out a bounty on two of the former's players, kicker Luis Zendejas and quarterback Troy Aikman:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOW9oYaSQdg Ryan denied the bounty accusation, saying that film of the game \\"show that Small had no intention of hurting Zendejas.\\" The Philadelphia coach asserted it would have been in the Eagles' best interests to keep Zendejas in the game because he was in a slump. Ryan also joked about Johnson's accusations: When the Cowboys and Eagles met on Thanksgiving 25 years later, on November 27, 2014, Johnson joked that Ryan put up the bounty offer to keep his players interested since the Cowboys, who ultimately went 1-15, performed so poorly that year.Jimmy Johnson mentioned in the first segment of Fox NFL Sunday on November 27, 2014. Johnson was an analyst on the show at the time. Zendejas spoke of having seen Buddy call guys out and give them $100 for what the kicker called a weekly Big Hit award but what Ryan called a Big Play award. This set of events set the stage for the scheduled rematch two weeks later in Philadelphia, dubbed \\"Bounty Bowl II.\\" As for the Eagles, they would not play another Thanksgiving game until the 2008 NFL season when the Eagles faced the Arizona Cardinals in a preview of that season's NFC Championship Game.  Bounty Bowl II  The second game in the series took place on December 10, 1989, with NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue in attendance. The game was anticipated as a media event. CBS Sports did a pre-game opening touting the contest as \\"Bounty Bowl II\\", complete with wanted posters, the involved players' pictures, and bounty amounts. During the game, Eagles' fans threw snowballs, ice, and beer onto the field. Several game participants were targeted, including back judge Al Jury and Cowboys punter Mike Saxon (both struck by snowballs), as well as Cowboys coach Jimmy Johnson, who was hit with objects as he was escorted off the field by the Philadelphia Police Department. Television announcers Verne Lundquist and Terry Bradshaw were also pelted with snowballs ‚Äì Lundquist would claim on-air that a recent dental surgery had been less unpleasant than broadcasting a game in Philadelphia ‚Äì and Eagles defensive lineman Jerome Brown was struck while standing on the sideline asking fans to cease throwing things. Eagles fan Edward Rendell later admitted that he was involved in the incident. The then- former Philadelphia district attorney, future mayor of Philadelphia and future governor of Pennsylvania bet another fan $20 that the latter couldn't reach the field with a snowball; Rendell lost. The Eagles won the game 20‚Äì10. As a result of the incident, the Eagles added security and banned beer sales for their last home game of the year against the Phoenix Cardinals and the subsequent NFC wild-card playoff game versus the Los Angeles Rams. Aftermath Porkchop Bowl A third game in the heated rivalry took place the next season, known as the \\"Porkchop Bowl\\". The game got its name because Eagles head coach Buddy Ryan choked on a pork chop in the week leading up to the game. Philadelphia won this game as well, 21‚Äì20. Further coverage In 2008 and on April 11, 2010, the game was included on a list of the ten most memorable moments in the history of Texas Stadium by ESPN.

The first underground railways in London, the Metropolitan Railway (MR) and the District Railway (DR), used specially built steam locomotives to haul their trains through shallow tunnels which had many ventilation openings to allow steam and smoke to clear from the tunnels. It was impractical to use steam locomotives in the small unvented tubular tunnels of the deep-level lines, and the only options were rope haulage (as on the Glasgow Underground) or electric locomotives. The C&SLR; was opened just a few years after the very first use of electricity to drive rail vehicles (trains or trams) and the primitive locomotives reflected this. Over the next 15 years, motors became smaller, gear drives and motor suspension were developed and reliable multiple unit control became available. Electric multiple unit trains became the standard, but electric locomotives were still being built. From 1903, the MR and the DR began to electrify the central parts of their lines for use by electric multiple units (EMUs). On both railways carriages were hauled by electric locomotives that were exchanged for a steam engine to run over un- electrified distant sections. The last steam-hauled passenger trains were replaced in 1961. When not hauling passenger trains, the electric locomotives were used for shunting and for hauling departmental trains. Some locomotives, as on the MR, were retained just for these duties. Rather than buy additional locomotive for this work, as was required with the battery-electric locomotives, makeshift locomotives were created from withdrawn passenger vehicles of at least three types, which were modified to haul trains over any part of the system or shunt rolling stock at Acton Works. City & South London Railway The interior of C&SLR; locomotive number 13 When the City & South London Railway (C&SLR;) was authorised in 1884, it was intended to be a cable-hauled line, but during the construction phase, the promoters decided to use electric traction, despite the fact that the technology was in its infancy. Two prototype locomotives were built by Mather & Platt in 1889, to a design by Dr Edward Hopkinson, with Beyer-Peacock supplying many of the mechanical parts. No. 1 used motors mounted directly on the drive axles, while No. 2 had motors driven through gears. Trials were conducted in December 1889 with No. 1 and two passenger cars. No. 2 was also used for testing, but it is not clear whether it pulled any cars. A production run of 14 locomotives was then built, numbered 1 to 14, duplicating the original numbers 1 and 2. Each had four wheels, with Edison-Hopkinson motors fitted to the axles, which were permanently wired in series. A 26-step rheostat was used to control the speed, and a switch which altered the connections to the armature was used to reverse the direction of travel. The locomotives were small and short to fit within the small diameter tunnels, which were at the northern end of the railway, and on the straighter southern section, to allow higher speeds. The cab was built along the centre line of the locomotive with a door at each end and the controls and equipment mounted on the sides. There was a single driving position at one end of the locomotive with the power controller on one side and the Westinghouse air-brake valve and hand-brake column on the other. The controls worked directly so no form of multiple-unit control was ever possible. Each locomotive could haul three coaches at up to on good track, providing a service speed of around . At the end of a run, the arriving locomotive was trapped in the platform by its carriages. A replacement locomotive hauled the train away on the next trip and the released locomotive was then available to head the next incoming train (this is called \\"slip working\\"). The train air-braking system, controlled by the driver, was fed from an air reservoir on the locomotive and, as the original locomotives were unable to generate their own compressed air, the reservoirs were recharged at Stockwell Station from an air line maintained at . Later, locomotives were fitted with compressors. The railway was opened on 4 November 1890 by The Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII) and locomotive No. 10 carried a commemorative nameplate with the name Princess of Wales to celebrate its use on that occasion. There was soon a need for an additional two locomotives to operate the service. Nos. 15 and 16 were built by Siemens with a modified design of motor, which attempted to overcome the problem of burnt-out armatures that had plagued the line since its opening. In 1895, the C&SLR; itself built locomotive No. 17 at Stockwell depot, and carried out a series of tests on locomotives 12, 15 and 17, as more locomotives would soon be needed for the extensions being made. They ordered three more locomotives from different manufacturers in 1898, which were equipped with four-pole motors, a more efficient control system using series-parallel switching of the motors, and on-board compressors. The motors were still mounted on the axles. Another two locomotives (Nos. 21 and 22), which were built at Stockwell Depot, included further refinements and were the prototypes for the final batches of locomotives. Nos. 23 to 52 were built by Crompton to an improved design, including nose-suspended motors connected to the axles by a single reduction gear, but still bore a strong external resemblance to the original locomotives. Between 1904 and 1907, locomotives Nos. 3 to 12 were rebuilt with new electrical equipment to improve their performance. Following the introduction of new locomotives and the abandonment of the restrictive King William Street terminus in 1900, the C&SLR; was able to run trains with four cars. Five-car trains were introduced from 1907. Six-carriage trains were briefly operated in 1914/15 and from October 1923 before the last part of the line was closed for reconstruction and tunnel enlargement in November 1923. The enlarged tunnels allowed the locomotive hauled trains to be replaced by 'Standard' Stock electrical multiple units. 44 locomotives were in use just before the closure and some remained in service until 1925 hauling works trains while the tunnels were being enlarged. One locomotive survives in preservation. It was originally displayed as No.1, but investigations over a number of years finally identified it as either No. 13 or 14, and suggested that it was more likely to be No. 13 (the number which it now carries). After being displayed in the Science Museum, it was transferred to the Acton store of the London Transport Museum, and then to the newly reopened museum in Covent Garden. No. 36 was displayed on a plinth at Moorgate Metropolitan line station for many years but was damaged beyond repair by a bomb in 1940. Some of its electrical parts were presented to Crompton Parkinson before the rest of it was scrapped. A motor and axle from No. 36 are now held by the Science Museum but are currently in store. Central London Railway Opened in 1900, the Central London Railway initially used 44-ton Bo-Bo electric locomotives to haul its trains. These long, low locomotives had deep plate frames, a central cab and equipment compartments on front and rear. The cabs had four doors, one on each side and one on each end (for safe access/exit when in the tunnels). Each axle carried a GE56A motor directly mounted on it. When starting, pairs of motors were connected in parallel, and the two pairs were connected in series. The controller had nine series notches, after which the motors were open-circuited, reconnected in full parallel, and the controller had another seven parallel notches. The direct-working controls did not allow the locomotives to work in multiple. A serious design fault in these locomotives was their very high unsprung weight of 33 tons. Geared motors had not been used as it was thought they would be noisy in the confines of a tunnel. This resulted in serious problems with noise and vibration. Complaints from local residents started immediately after the service commenced and were such that the Board of Trade imposed a speed limit until modifications could be made. This was achieved by only using series mode on the controller, but by 1901, three of the locomotives had been rebuilt with new bogies and nose-suspended GE55 motors, reducing the unsprung weight to 11 tons. Six and seven car trains were run, and as on the City and South London Railway, locomotives were stepped back at the termini. A seven-car train required a crew of eight. Two men rode in the locomotive, there was a front and rear guard, and four additional men operated the gates on the passenger cars. 28 locomotives were built, although 32 were ordered, the remaining four intended for when the extension from Bank to Liverpool Street was opened. However, from 1901 trials were conducted with multiple units, with motor cars converted from trailer cars 54, 81, 84 and 88. These became the first operational multiple units in Europe, and the benefits of virtually eliminating vibration and the ease of reversing them at the termini resulted in an order for 64 motor cars being placed. They were delivered in mid-1903, and the locomotives became redundant after only three years. The three geared locomotives were retained, to be used for shunting at Wood Lane Depot, while the rest were offered for sale. The Metropolitan Railway subsequently bought two of the three, in order to carry out experiments in regenerative control. No. 12 remained at Wood Lane, becoming L21 in 1929. It saw occasional use until 4 May 1940, when the Central line was converted from three-rail to four-rail operation, and was scrapped in 1942. Metropolitan Railway Metropolitan Vickers No. 17 Metropolitan Railway electric locomotives were used on London's Metropolitan Railway with conventional carriage stock. On the outer suburban routes an electric locomotive was used at the Baker Street end that was exchanged for a steam locomotive en route. The first ten had a central cab and were known as camel- backs, and these entered service in 1906. A year later another ten units with a box design and a driving position both ends arrived. These were replaced by more powerful units in the early 1920s. One locomotive is preserved as a static display at London Transport Museum and another, No. 12 \\"Sarah Siddons\\", has been used for heritage events, most recently in 2019. District Railway In 1905 the District Railway bought ten bogie box cab locomotives that looked similar to their multiple units, but were only long. They were manufactured by the Metropolitan Amalgamated Carriage and Wagon Company, and most of them had a single cab at one end. Consequently, they were worked in pairs, coupled back to back with the cabs at the outer end. The locomotives were used to haul London and North Western Railway passenger trains on the electrified section of the Outer Circle route between Earl's Court and Mansion House. In December 1908 these services terminated at Earl's Court and the locomotives were used to haul District line trains, one coupled to each end of a rake of four trailer cars. From 1910 trains from the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway (LT&SR;) were extended over the District line, the steam locomotives being exchanged for electric ones at Barking. Two rakes of carriages were provided by the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway, and were hauled over the District tracks by the locomotives working in pairs. Not needed, three locomotives were scrapped, leaving three pairs and one spare. Originally numbered 1A to 10A, those that were not scrapped became L1 to L7 after 1910. Their electrical equipment was reused on new multiple unit trains that were being introduced. The locomotives were equipped for working in multiple. Each locomotive had four GE69 motors, rated at totaling 800 hp. In 1922 the motors were replaced with GE260 surplus from the F Stock. L2 and L7 were scrapped in 1938, and the remaining locomotives were scrapped in 1939, after the LT&SR; service was withdrawn. Their electrical equipment was re-used in F-stock cars which were being converted to air-door operation. Acton Works Shunters L11 preserved outside Epping station. For moving rolling stock around the main workshops at Acton, four electric locomotives were created out of withdrawn passenger vehicles. *L10 - This Bo-Bo locomotive was built from two Hampstead Gate Stock driving motors. It was constructed at Acton Works in 1930 from cars 1 and 3, originally built in 1907 by the American Car and Foundry Company. The motor ends of both cars were joined back-to-back, and this design was the first of several similar vehicles constructed from old stock. The vehicle was fitted with adjustable couplers at each end, which could be raised or lowered to cope with tube stock or sub-surface stock. Because of the layout of Acton Works, only the couplings on the southern end, known as the \\"Acton\\" end (as opposed to the \\"Ealing\\" end), were used, and those at the Ealing end were gradually cannibalised for spares for the Acton end. It was subsequently rebuilt, with flat panels on the sides, rather than the louvred ones of the Hampstead stock, and lost its distinctive clerestory roof. The GE69 motors were replaced with the superior GE212 motors, which included interpoles and roller bearings. It survived until 1978, when it was cut up on site by Cashmores. *L11 - Built in 1964 from two 1931 Standard Stock vehicles (numbers 3080 and 3109), this vehicle followed the same concept as L10, as both donor vehicles had some of their passenger compartments cut off and the two cabs and control sections were joined back to back. The resulting locomotive was a single vehicle Bo-Bo. A small section of the passenger compartment remained, and most of the air system and braking equipment was moved into it from beneath the frames, so that it could be more easily maintained. The vehicle had four WT54A motors, which were wired so that each pair remained permanently in series. Thus they worked at half voltage, but the slow-speed characteristics were better-suited for shunting. Dual couplings for tube and sub-surface stock were fitted at the Acton end only. The front door was blocked off, but had a low-level screen, to enable the driver to see the couplings more easily. When first built, it carried a maroon livery, but was painted yellow in 1983. It saw use until the early 1990s and since preservation in 2004, has been on display outside Epping Underground station. *L13A/B - Created in 1974, this locomotive consisted of two 1938 Stock Driving Motor cars coupled back to back. Modifications included the addition of high level air pipes to allow coupling to other Departmental vehicles, reciprocating compressors, and the addition of power lines between the two cars. These gave the locomotive a very long shoegear span, since all four bogies were fitted with shoe beams, enabling it to cross gaps in the current rail at very low speeds. The locomotive was built so that L14A/B, which had proved the usefulness of a long shunting locomotive, could be scrapped. *L14A/B - Two of the flat fronted 1935 stock prototype cars were rebuilt to create this locomotive. The donor cars, numbers 10011 and 11011, had been displaced from the Epping - Ongar shuttle in 1966. They were transferred to Acton Works for articulation experiments, thought being given at the time to the articulation of trains on the Northern line. The trailing ends of the two motor cars were cut back so there was only one window behind the rear double doors, and both were mounted on a single steel bogie. The outer bogies were replaced with new lightweight ones, constructed of aluminium, and the unit was ready for testing to begin in August 1970. After a year of trials, engineers had collected sufficient data, and as it was never intended for the vehicle to enter passenger service, it was transferred to Acton Works as a shunting locomotive, where it was particularly useful, as the shoes spanned . The experimental lightweight aluminium motor bogies were removed in 1975, and fitted to 1972 MkII car No3363, so that long-term testing of the design could be carried out. This ended the life of LT's only articulated locomotive, which was scrapped at Acton later that year.

It is located alongside the River Muick to the southwest of Ballater. History The property was built in 1715. It was acquired from the Gordon family (owners of the Abergeldie Estate) who had acquired it from the Farquharsone family. Birkhall was acquired by Prince Albert, consort to Queen Victoria, as part of the Balmoral Castle estate in 1849 and given to his eldest son, Albert Edward, Prince of Wales. Victoria bought Birkhall back to provide accommodation for her staff and extended family in 1884; Prince Albert Edward had only visited Birkhall once, for he preferred the larger Abergeldie Castle. Birkhall was occupied by General Sir Dighton Probyn, Keeper of the Privy Purse to King Edward VII and Comptroller to Queen Alexandra in the late 19th century and early twentieth century. King George V lent Birkhall in the 1930s to the Duke and Duchess of York (later King George VI and Queen Elizabeth), who holidayed there with their children, Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret Rose. The house was redecorated by the Yorks, who also replanted the gardens. After the Duke of York ascended to the throne in 1936, the new King and Queen occupied Balmoral during the summer while Princess Elizabeth, her husband Prince Philip, and their children occupied Birkhall during the late summer season. Birkhall was inherited by Charles, Prince of Wales and Duke of Rothesay, from Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother upon her death in 2002. He also spent his second honeymoon at Birkhall in 2005 with the Duchess of Cornwall. In 2011, Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, celebrated Hogmanay at Birkhall. In March 2020, the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall self-isolated at Birkhall after the Prince tested positive for COVID-19.

This affix will, then, convey a derivational or inflectional meaning.Eugene Nida, Morphology: The Descriptive Analysis of Words, 2nd ed., Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press 1949, p. 69. This suprasegmental pattern acts like segmental phonemes within a morpheme; the suprafix is a combination of suprasegmental phonemes, organized into a pattern, that creates a morpheme. For example, a number of African languages express tenseaspect distinctions by tone.Eugene Nida, Morphology: The Descriptive Analysis of Words, 2nd ed., Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press 1949, p. 63, Problem 46. And English has a process of changing stress on verbs to create nouns. History Driven by structural linguists in the United States, the suprafix was more frequently used by such linguists during the time of American Structuralism. The idea of suprasegmental morphemes was introduced in Eugene Nida's morphology textbook, where he suggested the term, suprafix, to account for these kinds of morphemes; the term was adopted by George L. Trager and Henry Lee Smith Jr. in their paper on the structure of English. It was further described in Edith Trager's article on the suprafix in English verbal compounds and in Archibald A. Hill's introductory linguistics of English text. Later, it was taken up in Peter Matthews' influential morphology textbook.P[eter] H. Matthews, Morphology: An Introduction to the Theory of Word-Structure, Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press 1974, p. 133 Some linguists prefer superfix, which was introduced by George L. Trager for the stress pattern of a word, which he regarded as a special morpheme that combines and unifies the parts of a word.George L. Trager, \\"Taos I: A language revisited\\". International Journal of American Linguistics 14(1948), 155‚Äì160, p. 157 Another term that has not been widely adopted, but has been suggested to replace suprafix or superfix, is the term, simulfix. This word has been offered as a replacement term because many linguists have noted that the addition of suprasegmental phonemes is added neither above nor below the segmental phonemes; instead it is affixed altogether. However, a simulfix has been used to describe different morphological phenomena and, therefore, has not been adopted for the purposes defined here. Types There are two different types of suprafixes, additive and replacive. Suprafixes are additive if they add a suprasegmental pattern to the base form while replacive suprafixes simply change the pattern from the base form to a new pattern that conveys a different meaning. Additive suprafixes These kind of suprafixes are affixes that add suprsegmental phonemes to the base. These processes occur as a result of an underlying pattern of stress, tones, or even nasalization being added to an underlying morpheme composed of only segmental phonemes. In other words, this affix is attached to a bare base that has no other suprasegmental pattern underlyingly. This can fall under a broader category of additive morphology (e.g. processes of prefixation, suffixation, infixation, etc.). This is exemplified by a language in the Belgian Congo, Ngbaka: w√†, wƒÅ, w«é, and w√° all mean 'clean.' Nida, however, explains that while the segmental base contains the meaning 'to clean,' the different tones associated with the base reveal different tense/aspect information. Replacive suprafixes These kinds of suprafixes are affixes that replace suprasegmental phonemes of the base form. These processes occur as a result of an underlying pattern of stress, tones, or nasalization replacing a previous pattern of suprasegmental phonemes. More succinctly, this process involves stripping one suprasegmental pattern for another in order to convey a different meaning. This can fall under a broader category of replacive morphology. In this kind of morphology, some particular phoneme or phonemes are being replaced by another to attribute a different meaning. An example of this can be found in another language from the Congo, Mongbandi: ngb√≤ and ngb√≥ both mean 'swam.'Eugene Nida, Morphology: The Descriptive Analysis of Words, 2nd ed., Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press 1949, p. 63, Problem 47. However, Nida explains that the first word is the base form while the second exhibits the verb in second plural person. Since the second plural person suprafix replaces the tonal pattern of the base form, this is a replacive suprafix.  In languages = In English  The suprafix can also be defined as an underlying suprasegmental pattern that indicates a property of a particular type of phrase in a language, but especially for English. These patterns, in English, are most notable between an individually uttered word and that same word within a larger phrase. Consider, for example, the word 'house,' which has no internal stress pattern, alone. However, when within a phrase like the white house (e.g. /√∞…ô  ç√†…™t h√¢ äs/) versus the White House (e.g. /√∞…ô  ç√°…™t h√† äs/), the stress on 'house,' as the single word, changes. English also uses a process of replacive suprafixes, where base form verbs are changed to nouns by a replacement in stress pattern, alone. Examples of this can be seen with: 'import (n) vs. im'port (v) and 'insult (n) vs. in'sult (v). Here, the stress pattern alters in order to signal the difference between noun and verb.  In other languages  In the Ma'ya language of Indonesia, there is a toneme that marks a replacive morpheme that is also described as a suprafix. Lex van der Leeden describes the language as having a toneme pattern, such as a class 12 toneme pattern of the language, being replaced by a class 21 toneme pattern. He notes that these are inflectional changes. In the Waur√° language, there is a nasalization suprafix, which arises when the word is placed in a possessive construction. Consider nu-map√£ÃÅ, 'my honey' versus m√°pa, 'honey.' In Ngbaka, there are examples of additive suprafixes. The segmental string that constitutes the morpheme meaning 'to return' is kpolo. However, when the four different additive suprafixes are affixed, a change in tense/aspect is realized: kp√≤l√≤, kp≈çl≈ç, kp√≤l√≥, and kp√≥l√≥.

Born in Leigh, Lancashire, Morgan began his career as a poet in the mid-1950s when he was 16 and living alone in London. He entered the British Army and rose to the rank of infantry platoon commander while serving with the Loyal Regiment (North Lancashire) in West Germany, but began to question this career choice. By the mid-1960s he had become a pacifist and resigned his commission. In 1964 he moved to Edinburgh, where he started to publish his poems and to perform recitals in public. He returned to the North of England in 1971, but this time to Yorkshire's North Riding, to live and work in the fishing village of Robin Hood's Bay, near Whitby. Over the years Morgan emphasised the oral tradition of poetry and song. Some of his poems have been set to music and have been recorded by such artists as Al Stewart (\\"My Enemies Have Sweet Voices\\" on the 1970 Zero She Flies album), the McCalmans and most recently the Levellers, by ‚ÄòIs This Art‚Äô. (During his 1999 UK tour, Al Stewart invited Morgan to read the lyrics as he performed the above song in the City Varieties music hall show at Leeds on 7 November). Morgan's BBC Television series A Voyage Between Two Seas (1983) presented a journey across Northern England via the region's waterways.

The suburb was founded in 1907 by Henrietta Barnett to be a model community where all classes of people could live together in attractive surroundings and social harmony. History The church was built to the designs of Edwin Landseer Lutyens (1869‚Äì1944). It is a hybrid. Simon Jenkins calls it \\"the confident application of Queen Anne Revival to traditional church form\\". Building began in 1909, but the west end was not completed until 1935. The church was consecrated on 7 May 1911. Externally it is 200 feet long and the spire rises 178 feet above the ground. Inside, the church is 122 feet from the west door to the chancel steps, and forty feet to the highest part of the roof. The ceiling is barrel-vaulted and domed. There are three vaults between the west end and the crossing; a saucer dome over the crossing; one further vault over the crossing and a saucer dome over the sanctuary. The east end finishes in an apse completed in 1923. The murals and paintings are by Walter P. Starmer (1877‚Äì1961). He began with the Lady Chapel in 1920 and finished with the apse in 1929. Starmer served with the Red Cross and YMCA in the First World War, and many of his paintings of the Western Front are in the Imperial War Museum. The west window (dedicated 1937) is to the design of Starmer and depicts Saint Jude holding the cross in his right hand and this church in his left. Below is his symbol, the ship; above, Christ in glory, surrounded by the traditional symbols of the four evangelists. On the north side of the west door is a memorial (brass plaque) to the horses killed in the First World War. The accompanying relief panel showing a warhorse is by 1970 by Rosemary Proctor (died 1995). It replaces al bronze model of a horse by Lutyens' father, and its replacement, which were stolen. Near it is a memorial to Basil Bourchier, the first vicar, and, on the south pillar, a commemoration of the completion of the west end. In the north-west porch are portraits of former vicars. The ceiling panels over the centre aisle depict: the wise men and the shepherds; Christ feeding the multitude and stilling the storm; Christ healing the blind and lepers; the crucifixion (dome); and the entry into Jerusalem with Christ carrying the cross (chancel). The memorials on the north wall are to John Raphael, a popular sportsman killed in the First World War; to Father Maxwell Rennie, a bust by his daughter Rosemary Proctor; and, in the lunette above St George's altar, a painting by Starmer represents the last few moments in the life of Michael Rennie, the Vicar's son, who died of exhaustion after rescuing several evacuee children after their ship, the City of Benares, had been torpedoed on its way to Canada in 1940. The murals here and in the south aisle represent the teaching of Jesus in the parables of the kingdom. The Stations of the Cross, also by Starmer, begin here and continue into the south aisle. The fine iron screens that flank the sanctuary are much older than the church and bear the name Matthias Heit and the date 1710. The sanctuary floor is patterned in brick and marble. The high altar includes two stones from Canada: a smaller dark one from the former French royal chapel of Annapolis Royal in Nova Scotia (where the first European settlement north of Florida was established in 1605, and where the first regular Church of England services were held in Canada in 1710), and a larger and lighter coloured one from the altar steps of Montreal Cathedral. The foundation stone on the north side of the chancel was laid on St Mark's Day 1910 and is by Eric Gill. The pulpit was also a gift from Canada. Over the south door (into the car park) is a commemoration of the unveiling of the murals by the Prince of Wales in 1924, and, over the door, a figure of Christ by Rosemary Proctor in memory of her brother. Nearby, on the south wall, is a memorial to Edward VII. View from the south-east, from Hampstead Heath To the left of the chancel is the Lady Chapel, the oldest part of the church, completed and opened for worship in 1910. On the pillar at the right of the entrance is a key to the ceiling painting depicting heroic women associated with the First World War, the campaign for women's suffrage, and other causes. Over the arch is a memorial to the unveiling of the frescoes. In the sanctuary is a wooden statue of Our Lady, a reproduction of the early sixteenth century Mourning Virgin or \\"Nuremberg Madonna\\" which would originally have been part of a crucifixion scene. Its curious proportions suggest that it was meant for a very high position and to be seen from far below. In the central panel of the altar is a modern reproduction of the Madonna and Child by Bernini. The Blessed Sacrament is reserved in the tabernacle behind the altar. St John's Chapel, to the right of the sanctuary, was a gift of the Harmsworth family in 1923. The murals draw on the Gospel of John and the Book of Revelation. The memorial window to Robert Lovel St John Harmsworth (1898-1920), Son of Sir (Robert) Leicester Harmsworth, 1st Bt is by Robert Anning Bell, one of the most distinguished artists of his day. It has been described as one of the most charming of his designs, and makes use of features from seventeenth century English Baroque sepulchral monuments. The green and white marble altar is by Lutyens. In the central panel is a picture by Maurice Greiffenhagen (a friend and colleague of Anning Bell at the Glasgow School of Art, and a fellow Royal Academician) of St John holding a chalice from which is emerging a serpent. This refers to the legend in which the priest of the temple of Diana gave St John poison to drink as a test of faith. Two men had already died of the poison, but St John survived, and restored the other two to life as well. The vestries lie behind the altar of St John. The \\"Father Willis\\" organ comes from St Jude's church in Whitechapel where Canon Samuel Barnett, husband of Henrietta Barnett, the founder of Hampstead Garden Suburb, was vicar. It stood for ten years at the west end and was moved, after restoration, to its present position in the chancel in 1934. The organ was rededicated in October 2002 following extensive rebuilding and renovation works, including the commissioning of a new console. The church is open at and around service times and occasionally on summer Sunday afternoons. Because it is in regular use for recordings, concerts and other events, visitors are advised to check that they will be able to gain access. Organised groups are welcome to visit the church and with appropriate notice it is usually possible to arrange for a guide to welcome visitors and show them around. The church hosts the annual Proms at St Jude's music festival. St Jude's has been on Historic England's 'Heritage At Risk' register. The adjacent vicarage is also by Lutyens and is Grade II Listed. References Evelyn Waugh was confirmed at St Jude's in 1916: ‚ÄòI went to church with my parents, who had taken to frequenting Saint Jude's, Hampstead Garden Suburb, a fine Lutyens edifice then in the charge of a highly flamboyant clergyman named Basil Bourchier . . . Personal devotees flocked to him from all parts of London. His sermons were dramatic, topical, irrational and quite without theological content. . . . Despite all Mr Bourchier's extravagant display I had some glimpse of higher mysteries.\\" (Evelyn Waugh, A Little Learning, 1964) C.S. Lewis spoke at St Jude's twice, first on 27 Sept 1942, a sermon called \\"Miracles\\", and again on 15 April 1945, a sermon called \\"The Grand Miracle\\". Signature in the St Jude's Register for April 1945 St Jude's has been described as: \\"a building of true originality\\" and a \\"key work\\" of its period (Roslin Mair, Key Dates in Art History, 1979) Lutyens' \\"ecclesiastical masterpiece\\" and \\"one of the best twentieth-century church exteriors in England\\" (Simon Jenkins, The Companion Guide to Outer London, 1981). St Jude's is one of [Lutyens'] most successful buildings. It exhibits all his best qualities and even turns that 'naughtiness' or wilful originality which often mars his late buildings into a decided advantage\\" (Bridget Cherry and Nikolaus Pevsner, The Buildings of England: London 4: North, 1998). \\"a magnificent Edwardian period piece. . . The tunnel like domed interior contains a wonderful collection of gay furnishings, the wilful naughtiness of which was quite in keeping with the emancipated outlook of the people who lived in the hand-made red brick houses designed by Raymond Unwin, Baillie Scott, . . . and Crickmer ‚Äì all of whom were then regarded as the last word of fashion. Gorgeous is the best word to use for the painted ornaments and decorations.\\" Peter Anson (Fashions in Church Furnishings, 1960) \\"[It] broke new ground . . . the repudiation of Gothic is total; there is not a pointed arch in the building. . . . The central tower [rises] above the crossing to be surmounted by a Byzantine spire ‚Äì majestic, imperious, Elgarian. . . . The interior is quieter but no less impressive.

Between 1972‚Äì1992, he reigned supreme in the world of illegal gypsy boxing. During these years, he fought down a mineshaft, in a quarry, at horse fairs, on campsites, in bars and clubs and in the street. Several relatives of Gorman have become professional boxers in recent years, including Nathan Gorman, Hughie Fury and Tyson Fury. Early life Gorman was born in Nottingham, England to a Welsh father and Irish mother, both Travellers, on 1 March 1944. His paternal grandfather and great-grandfather were also boxers. Gorman had his first bare-knuckle fight at the age of 12. Gorman is survived by his children, his son Shaun and daughter Maria Gorman. Career When he won the title of Bareknuckle Champion of Great Britain and Ireland, having beaten rival Jack Fletcher in a fight at a quarry, he was aged 28, was tall and weighed . On St Leger day in 1976, Gorman was ambushed by an armed mob and almost killed. He had turned up expecting to fight a challenger by the name of Ricky \\"Top Hat\\" Donahue, but was set upon by the group, who had reportedly been paid ¬£25,000 to carry out the attack. Bartley detailed in his book: \\"I showed up at 10.30am, the agreed time, but he (Donahue) was no where to be seen. Then from out of no where 25 guys appeared with crowbars and bricks. I was beaten senseless.\\" Retirement and death Gorman claimed to remain unbeaten until his retirement from boxing in 1992, with his last fight being a draw with Graeme O'Laughlan (Kennedy). Gorman lived in a traveller site in Uttoxeter, England, and that is where he lived out his final days. In popular culture For the 2012 film The Dark Knight Rises, actor Tom Hardy revealed that he used Gorman's voice as one of the inspirations for the accent of Bane. Gorman has also been cited as the main inspiration for professional wrestler Wade Barrett's finishing move, the Bull Hammer Elbow. Gorman's autobiography King of the Gypsies, written with the help of Peter Walsh, was completed just before Gorman's death. Gorman tells an uncompromising but touching story of a man compelled by the weight of his own violent family history to fight and suffer pain. The book reveals that he was only nine years old when he first witnessed the misery that violence brings. Bartley saw his uncle killed by one punch thrown by a rogue showman. Much of the book is taken up with tales of brutal fights at fairs, racecourses and bars. Shane Meadows filmed a documentary entitled King of the Gypsies, interviewing Gorman about his life in 1995. The 1999 Comedy Drama 'A Room for Romeo Brass' featuring Paddy Considine who played the part of Morrell based his accent on Gormans.

T≈çhoku disaster Swiss Air-Rescue (German: Schweizerische Rettungsflugwacht, French: Garde a√©rienne suisse de sauvetage, Rega) is a private, non-profit air rescue service that provides emergency medical assistance in Switzerland and Liechtenstein.Rega MissionsLandespolizei Liechtenstein > Notrufnummern Rega was established on 27 April 1952 by Dr Rudolf Bucher, who believed the Swiss rescue organization needed a specialized air sub-section. Rega mainly assists with mountain rescues, though it will also operate in other terrains when needed, most notably during life- threatening emergencies. Rega also provides a repatriation and medical advice service for members who experience a medical emergency while abroad and local treatment is not available. Rega also aids alpine farmers during the summer months in rescuing livestock and retrieving dead animals. As a non-profit foundation, Rega does not receive financial assistance from any government. They are quite unusual within Europe, with the majority of their costs paid through the annual fees of private contributors (As of 2016: 3.2 million patrons, 38% of the population). In exchange, Rega does not charge its contributors for its search, rescue and repatriation costs. One other rare aspect of Rega is that people in distress can call for a helicopter rescue directly (phone number 1414). In case of insufficient mobile phone coverage, alpinists can also use emergency radio telephone (161.3 MHz). The head office, the Rega Centre, (home to the Rega operations center where all missions are coordinated) is a hangar located at the northeast section of Zurich Airport within the municipality of Kloten;\\"anfahrtsplan_rega_center_en.pdf\\" (Archive) Rega.

All Rega helicopters carry a crew of three: a pilot, an emergency physician, and a paramedic who is also trained to assist the pilot for radio communication, navigation, terrain/object avoidance, and winch operations. In some situations, such as evacuating cable cars or retrieving injured climbers from a rock face, the crew also consists of a specialist trained by the Swiss Alpine Club. In the Canton of Valais, helicopter search and rescue is carried out by Air Glaciers and Air Zermatt.  Name  The name Rega was created by combining letters from the name \\"Swiss Air Rescue Guard\\" as it was written in German (Schweizerische Rettungsflugwacht), French (Garde A√©rienne Suisse de Sauvetage), and Italian (Guardia Aerea Svizzera di Soccorso). The decision to change the name was made in 1979, to create a uniform and more concise name for speakers of the three languages.

Partners Rega work closely with several organizations and emergency services including the police, fire and ambulance services. It assists in rescue efforts related to road accidents with the Touring Club Suisse TCS. For alpine search, rescue and recovery operations, Rega works closely with rescue branch of the Swiss Alpine Club. For larger operations, Rega may request additional helicopters from the FOCA or the Swiss Accident Investigation Board (SAIB, German acronym SUST) (formerly Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB). Rega is a partner of the Swiss Air Force, which supports Rega with helicopters and personnel when necessary. For search-and-rescue flights in difficult conditions, the Air Force has a FLIR- equipped helicopter (usually Eurocopter AS332 Super Puma or Cougar) on call. The Air Force continually monitors the airspace and directs emergency signals immediately to Rega. Aircraft equipment of the Swiss Air Force is used to gain a rapid and precise location of an emergency signal that is transmitted to the Rega helicopter early in an emergency mission. Rega also has access to the Air Force radio system for comprehensive radio coverage, which has a larger coverage area than civil aviation radio.

It is also the first series to have toy commercials that were filmed on Videotape. Produced by Toei and aired by TV Asahi in Japan from January 29, 1989 to January 28, 1990, it ran for 52 episodes and a feature movie aired on July 17, 1989. According to Toei's International Sales & Promotion Department, the series' English title can be referred to as Jiban. Created and designed by Keita Amemiya,https://www.toei-video.co.jp/catalog/dutd07846/ the premise for the series combines elements from the American film RoboCop and the 1970s tokusatsu Robot Detective. The opening catchphrase of the series is: Plot Naoto Tamura, a new detective in Central City, is killed by a Bionoid Monster in the line of duty. Doctor Kenzo Igarashi, a man whose experiments had been responsible for the Bioron syndicate's existence, brought the man back to life as a cyborg detective, Jiban. Eventually Madogarbo and Rhinonoid killed Jiban, who returned to life again as Perfect Jiban (basically the same design as the original, but with a blue-colored metal body and three new weapons). In the finale, Biolon destroyed Jiban's base and transformed Madogarbo into false Jiban. Jiban defeated his duplicate and ultimately Gibanoid, the true form of Biolon's leader Doctor Giba. The victorious Jiban then learned that Mayumi Igarashi, the one civilian that knew his secret, had been his missing younger sister all along. Characters Mobile Cop Jiban, holding up his badge. * Naoto Tamura/Mobile Cop Jiban A human revived as a cyborg by Doctor Igarashi to fight Biolon. He is capable of reverting to his human identity at will. He holds the rank of deputy police commissioner (as a robot) and detective (as human). Jiban's programming enables him to follow these directives: # Arrest criminals in any circumstance without a warrant. # Punish criminals on his own judgment if they happen to be members of Bioron. # Use lethal force depending on the circumstances. In human form, Naoto often plays the fool and is looked on down by Yoko and Kiyoshiro for this, but Yoko begins to warm up to him after realizing he could be Jiban. In the Filipino Dubbing Version, His name was Marco Tamura. * Mayumi Igarashi The only civilian who knew Jiban's secret identity. She lost her memory in battle, after falling from a waterfall, because, Madogarbo gave her a Bomb Ring. If Jiban approaches her, the bomb will burst. She called Naoto her 'big brother,' only to find that she was really his lost sister in the finale. * Shun'ichi and Shizue Igarashi Mayumi's (adoptive) parents. Shunichi is the son of Doctor Kenzou Igarashi but is not a scientist. Relocated as witnesses to Biolon, they resumed their life as Mayumi's foster parents in the finale. * Doctor Kenzo Igarashi Started the Jiban's project to counter Bioron, the results of his biological experimentation. He died when Jiban was built. * Yoko Katagiri A female detective of Central City. Naoto's senior. Manly sharpshooter who could not figure out that Naoto was Jiban. She is also known in the Filipino Dubbed Version as Lori. * Kiyoshiro Muramatsu Elite detective of Central City with a liking for Yoko. * Seiichi Yanagida The head of the Police Department. He cooperated with Doctor Igarashi in the Jiban Project two years earlier. He collaborated with Jiban after Igarashi's death. He died when Jiban's base was destroyed. * Section Chief Takeko Bando The Central City Section Chief of Detectives. Got headaches trying to keep the peace in jurisdictions where strange events occurred, no thanks to Biolon. * Michiyo Matsumoto A tea server of the Detectives' Section of Central City Police Department. She is always cheerful and encouraging. * Boy/Harry Boy Jiban's robotic assistant. He stays at his secret base. Originally he was simply Boy, an immobile camera-like robot who had to give instructions to Mayumi to operate the control center, but then his computer was transferred to panda-like \\"Harry\\" (a robot devised by another student of Doctor Igarashi's) and began substituting for the amnesiac Mayumi. He died when Jiban's base was destroyed. * Ryo Hayakawa A drifter who takes in Mayumi after she loses her memory, mistaking her for his dead sister, Midori. He initially refers to her by that name but later refers to her by her own name Mayumi after reading a missing person's notice, although Mayumi does not tell him her true origins (since her memory is faulty). In the scuffle, Mayumi goes away, unable to remember what just happened. He died in Episode 46, when Jiban removed the Bomb Ring from Mayumi's finger with a very precise shot, without hurting her. Ryou took the ring and ran, to throw it out, but was killed in the resulting explosion. He is played by Ryouhei Kobayashi Who would later play Fumiya Hoshikawa / Five Black in the 1990 sentai series Chikyuu Sentai Fiveman. Equipment * Jiban's Badge It can be used as a communicator to contact Harry Boy, Seiichi and Mayumi in Jiban's Base or used to summon any of his vehicles, as well as to control their armaments electronically. Articles Every episode, when Jiban faces his Bionoid enemy, he ejects his badge from his waist and shows it to the monster, reading a code of articles and laws that served as his directives (much like the CPU Directives in RoboCop, but giving him a greater freedom instead of restraining it):  * * Super Police Vehicles * Super Police Machine Reson Jiban's patrol car, a modified Pontiac Firebird with a sixth generation computer and hence a will of its own, and it was destroyed by Gibanoid. * Super Police Bike Vaican Jiban's Suzuki motorcycle with a sixth generation computer and hence a will of its own, and it was destroyed by Gibanoid. In the Philippine Version, it is known as Mecha Panther. * Super Police Jet Spylas Jiban's stealth fighter plane with a will of its own, and it was destroyed by Doctor Giba using his ship's weapon systems. Weapons * Spikes It is hidden in Jiban's upper arms to puncture and break a hold or to shoot. * Jiban Hyper Beam It is hidden in Jiban's upper arms to shoot into areas that cannot be accessed through physical means (example: doors). Jiban used it in the movie. * Maximillian Type 3 Jiban's personal jutte-like weapon. Concealed in a collapsible holster located on his right leg, it can transform into either Pistol, Stun Gun, or Sword Mode. The Maximillian Type 3 can also perform the following moves and techniques: # Disclose Shock It is used in stun gun mode, essentially a stun gun. # Last Shooting/ThermalBeam/Search Buster It is used in pistol mode, firing laser shots. # Jiban End (Energy sword) It is used in sword mode, splits enemies in half. It is also known as Jiban Slash in the Filipino Version. * Daidaros Jiban's personal cannon. Required to perform the Daidaros Bombard Technique, which is used to finish off foes. It can be made into a Jetpack jet to enable Jiban to fly short distances. * Autoderringer Jiban's personal rifle. He acquired it after being resurrected as Perfect Jiban. It has a machine gun mode and a bazooka mode. The machine gun mode is used to stun and set up the enemy; after an \\"Energy Charge\\" in which the bazooka is charged, it fires a powerful shot to finish off the enemy. It was destroyed by Gibanoid during Jiban's final fight with him. * Powerbreaker Pincer/claw. A left arm attachment. It can be used to attack enemies. He acquired it after being resurrected as Perfect Jiban. * Needricker Drill. A right arm attachment. It can be used to drill into areas that cannot be accessed through physical means (e.g. doors). He acquired it after being resurrected as Perfect Jiban. Criminal Syndicate Bioron An armed force organized by the mysterious scientist Doctor Giba intending to take over the Earth by means of narrow attacks rather than large-scale destruction. Their theme/weapon is biochemistry. * Doctor Giba The bearded brown-haired Caucasian human-looking leader and founder of Bioron. His real identity is Gibanoid, a bio-monster born by accident from the chemical waste of Doctor Igarashi's National Science Academy Bio Laboratory. As a result, Giba is filled with malice for humans. He assumed his true form in the series finale, using Mayumi as a shield to escape in his ship. He died while fighting Jiban on his ship as it crashed into the mountainside. * Marsha and Karsha The first bio-lifeforms created by Kiba, his secretaries and intermediaries between him and his Bionoid agents. They can transform into small spiders (for spying on people), and assume their inhuman \\"Battle\\" forms (Battle Marsha and Battle Karsha), armed with energy whips. They were killed in the series finale by Doctor Giba for failing to kill Jiban. * Bubi and Muku (Pugui and Muguie in the Brazilian dub) The cute and not so-cute creatures living in Bioron's base. Muku was one of Jiban's foes in early chapters, in giant size, but only as a distraction. The 4 critters had a tendency to annoy Marsha and Karsha with their Commentary of what the 2 recently did during that episode. Sometimes just showing up once to be used as target practice by the Bionoids demonstrating their powers. The four became friends with Mayumi when she told them about a mother's love and she tried to defend them from Marsha and Karsha who attacked the critters for saving Mayumi's life by Defusing the bomb in Fake Momnoid. They hung out with Mayumi in the finale. * Mad Garbo (17-51) A Jiban Cyborg Killer created by Doctor Giba as a counter to Jiban. Using power from Queen Cosmos, she and Rhinonoid are able to kill Jiban in Episode 34, but he is resurrected as Perfect Jiban. She later assumes his total appearance to attack him by having his Reson, Spylas and Vaican attack Jiban making them believe Jiban was Madogarbo. She even got as far as damaging Jiban so badly that he went Blind but Mayumi's Despair at seeing her brother about to be killed caused what energy of Queen Cosmos was left to gather and blast Fake Jiban turning her back into regular Madogarbo she was then killed by Jiban. * Kuro Kiba Mad Garbo's motorcycle with rhino horn and sidecar with machine guns. In the English Version, it is known as Black Fang. * Queen Cosmos (28-46) A lunar life form resembling a human woman (but actually a floating rock like starfish with a long tail) intent on conquering Earth to establish an all- woman empire. She appeared in episode 28 but did not reveal her name till episode 34. In her own words, she is made of space garbage and came from a place that was cold and ugly, lacking anything beautiful, thus her obsession with having everything beautiful and being called beautiful herself. She is more powerful than the other Biorons (except Doctor Giba himself); she allies with them to destroy Jiban. Her jewelry turns into parasite creatures: Earring into a skull patterned ladybug that would infuse into Jiban distorting his circuitry and her Brooch would turn into a spider creature blasting Jiban with tiny powerful balls of light. Her bracelet was able to transform into a snake creature wrapping around one's neck to control their mind. In Episode 46, she was defeated by Jiban. * Golem Cosmos (37) An offshoot of Queen Cosmos herself, this entity was created to be her champion from a piece of herself. The creature was extremely powerful, armed with a crescent sword and shield, she very nearly defeated Jiban Until he grabbed her sword wrist with Powerbreaker, twisting her wrist and impaling her with Needricker. She then turned back into her clay statue state and dissolved. Weapons: A long silvery sword, shield, energy blasts from sword and laser blasts from eyes. * Masques The mass-produced grunt human-like life forms armed with knives, guns, machine guns and bazooka. They can disguise themselves as humans and regenerate lost limbs. A determined human (usually Yoko and sometimes Kiyoshiro) can take them out by shooting them in the head or chest or by physically choking them out.  Bionoid  Bionoids are the product of Doctor Giba's research. They can disguise themselves as humans. * Chamelenoid (1) * Catnoid (2) * Mudnoid (3) * Rosenoid (4) * Octopusnoid (5) * Vulturenoid (6) * Influenzanoid (7) * Molenoid (8) * Hyenanoid (9) *

It was a spin-off created by a writer from Who's the Boss? and featuring characters introduced during an episode of that show. The show was the acting debut of Halle Berry.\\"Halle Berry's Journey From Miss USA Runner-Up To Oscar Winner\\". Access Hollywood. June 16, 2011. Both Who's the Boss? and Living Dolls were produced by ELP Communications through Columbia Pictures Television and ABC. Synopsis The show featured Charlie Briscoe (Leah Remini), a friend of Samantha Micelli (the Who's the Boss? character played by Alyssa Milano). Samantha is dabbling in a modeling career and Charlie, a friend from Samantha's old Brooklyn neighborhood comes to visit. While doing some test shots for a dog food commercial, it is discovered that Charlie is very photogenic. Charlie is then befriended by the owner of a modeling agency for teenage girls, Trish Carlin (Michael Learned). Trish is also a friend of advertising executive Angela Bower, one of the main characters on Who's the Boss?. Trish becomes a mother figure to Charlie and the other models. Reception Living Dolls was universally panned by critics and received mostly negative reviews. It was the only series to receive an \\"F\\" grade by People magazine in its 1989 fall preview issue.\\"Throwing a Curveball: Surprising Spin-Offs\\". Screenrush. Retrieved October 28, 2013. ABC canceled the series after 12 episodes in December 1989. Production The series had a back-door pilot on Who's the Boss? before turning into a series. In that episode, Vivica A. Fox played Emily instead of Halle Berry. Two pilots were made for the series. The first, in which Berry, David Moscow, and Tucker did not appear, was produced to introduce Living Dolls as a spin-off. Their roles were portrayed by other actors. Executives disliked the original cast and held auditions for recasting. Another pilot was shown directly before the Living Dolls premiere, which illustrates the reasons why Charlie moved in with Trish in the first place.

Northwestern is the second largest high school in the state of Maryland when measured by total square footage. It was the first of the county's current high schools to be replaced with a new facility. Northwestern became the school district's second Center for the Visual and Performing Arts (CVPA) magnet high school, with the program commencing for the 2013‚Äì14 school year. The CVPA program is a highly selective, rigorous four-year specialized program that offers college prep and professional career prep study in the visual arts and performing arts. Admission to the program is through a competitive, two-stage application process. Northwestern's CVPA program operates as a \\"school-within-a-school\\" model, and is a replication of the program that has been in existence at Suitland High School since 1986. However, currently Northwestern's program only draws students from a limited attendance-area. In December 2009, Northwestern was recognized as a Silver Medal School among \\"America's Best High Schools\\" by U.S. News & World Report.Best High Schools. U.S. News & World Report, 2009. In 2005, The Washington Post cited Northwestern as being the second highest ranking high school, among all district high schools, for students' scores on the nationally administered AP tests. Northwestern is accredited by the Commission on Secondary Schools, a division of the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools. The late Jim Henson, creator of The Muppets, graduated from Northwestern in 1954. On October 5, 2002, during an official building dedication ceremony attended by Jane and Heather Henson, as well as representatives from the Jim Henson Legacy, Northwestern was given permission to rename the arts building at Northwestern, to the Jim Henson School of Arts, Media and Communications.Jim Henson School of Arts, Media & Communications The Jim Henson Legacy, Inc. History E. Carlene Murray is the current principal at Northwestern, joining the faculty in the Fall of 2015. Murray replaced Edgar Batenga, who was principal from 2011 until 2014. Batenga replaced Jerome Thomas, who served as principal from 2004 until 2011. Thomas was a long-time vice principal at Northwestern, and had succeeded former principal William T. Ritter, who was the school's Dean of Students until 2000, when then-principal Kevin M. Maxwell left the Prince George's County Public Schools system to head Walter Johnson High School in Montgomery County. Maxwell was currently serving as superintendent of schools for the Anne Arundel County Public Schools system, also in Maryland, until June 2013. William Ritter himself was eventually appointed head of the Region 5 District in 2004 (and later, head of the school system's FIRST-Financial Incentive Rewards for Supervisors & Teachers program), where Jerome Thomas (who was a longtime vice principal at Northwestern)took his position. On Thursday, June 28, 2013, it was confirmed by the county executive, Rushern Baker, that Maxwell had been chosen to permanently lead the Prince George's County Public Schools system beginning in August 2013, as the new chief executive officer, replacing Alvin Crawley.

Northwestern hosts the very popular Saturday-run ISP Flea Market, sponsored by the school's International Studies Program. Northwestern currently serves as the school district's northern host school for the annual Band & Orchestra Festival, which showcases county bands and orchestras who are adjudicated by renowned music directors from around the country. Northwestern once served as a host school for the district's' Middle School & High School Chorus Festival. It is currently used as a secondary site for the Superiors Concert, the district festival for all choirs rated \\"superior during\\" county assessments. Northwestern also served as host for Gateway Music Festival's Washington, DC national choir competition in 2003, and hosted the 2004 Maryland All-State Band Festival. Building and facilities The Northwestern High School campus circa 1951-2000 Northwestern Campus (1951-2000) Northwestern Senior High School was founded in 1951 as a public secondary school. It was the consolidation of three schools: Hyattsville, Greenbelt, and Mount Rainier High Schools. Beginning in the 1960s, several additions were built, in stages, including what was called the new art wing. By the year 2000, Northwestern consisted of a long main wing with three wings branching out. These were referred to as the A-wing, B-wing, and C-wing. The cafeteria was located at the rear of the school on the second floor and attached to the C-wing. The boys' gymnasium, girls' auxiliary gymnasium, and band, choir, and orchestra rooms were all located at the rear of the building. The C-wing was accessible to the B-wing by a long suspended enclosed bridge that could only be reached from the second floor. A large field located between wings B and C was dubbed \\"The Senior Courtyard.\\" Originally reserved exclusively for seniors to converge during lunch, this courtyard was eventually opened to the entire student body. Northwestern was one of the few schools to allow students outside during lunch, as most schools didn't have the proper accommodations to allow this. The Justice Memorial Auditorium was part of the A-wing, and was the final addition to the original building. The A-wing was the only section of the old facility that had air conditioning. Northwestern was converted from a grades 10-12 \\"senior high school\\" to a grades 9-12 \\"high school\\" configuration in 1981. The new building USGS aerial photograph of the present-day Northwestern High School campus By the mid-1990s, Northwestern was beginning to show its age. A plan to replace the structure with a brand new $45 million facility was proposed. Prince George's County Public Schools contracted the SHW Group LLPSHW Group LLP to design and build the new school. Construction began in late summer of 1998, with the new facility located directly behind the old building. Students attended classes in the old building while construction took place only yards away. The new school was physically connected to the old building at the rear (stage area) of the auditorium. The new building officially opened to students and staff in August 2000, just in time for the school year. It was the first new high school constructed in Prince George's County since Eleanor Roosevelt High School was completed in 1976. While it took two years to construct the new facility, the building was not actually fully finished until midway through the 2001‚Äì02 school year. Classes commenced at the new Northwestern before the former facility had been torn down. The large bus lot in front of the new building, and the main parking lot, had yet to be paved prior to the opening of the new building, because the old facility stood where these new areas were to be made. A few exterior portions of the new facility weren't finalized until 2002. Except for the auditorium, which was retained from the old building and was completely overhauled and transformed into the D-Wing of the new school, the old Northwestern was razed while classes were ongoing in the new building. The main parking lot for the new school lies where the former facility once stood.

Northwestern's largest enrollment was reached during the 2006‚Äì2007 school year, with over 3,000 students. Northwestern had over twenty portable classrooms to accommodate the over-enrollment. Ironically, the school had never had portable trailers until after the new facility was built. Even though Northwestern's 2013-14 enrollment was under capacity, the school then housed twenty portable classrooms. The additional space was primarily needed to accommodate the expansive course offerings and programs available at the school. Until 2006, Northwestern was officially the largest high school in MarylandNorthwestern High School (2001). The 2001 Compass. Page 1. when measured by square footage, a distinction that has since been given up to the new . Dr. Henry A. Wise, Jr. High School. However, with Wise having a capacity of 2,600 students and Northwestern having a capacity of 2,700, Northwestern is still the largest high school in the county in terms of capacity. There was controversy for a time for the distinction of what was then physically the largest high school in Maryland, between Northwestern and neighboring Montgomery Blair High School in Montgomery County. Both had been designed by the same architectural firm, around the same time (Blair in 1998; Northwestern in 2000); both share a similar design inside and out; and they are of similar size. Blair was constructed at originally and Northwestern at. Through certain technicalities, Blair's total square footage was upped to around . It was decided that Northwestern, with the addition of its greenhouse to the second floor of the A-Wing in 2001, retains its slightly larger physical size over Blair, despite Blair having a larger maximum student capacity. Northwestern's campus features three courtyards between the four wings of the building. The school has a total of five parking lots: the large main parking lot (located in front of the facility, where the former facility once stood) designated for staff and visitors; an adjacent lot located in front of the auditorium, reserved for staff and students; two smaller lots at the rear of the facility, reserved for staff or visitors attending athletic events; and a large bus bay capable of accommodating 44 school buses, located in front of the facility, which doubles as another lot for staff and visitors, during and after the regular school day. The school has six tennis courts located just outside the auditorium to the east of the building and it has several basketball courts located at the rear of the building outside the food court, which have been decommissioned and now serves as an area which houses several of the school's portable classrooms. There are three athletic fields in the rear of the building: the football/soccer stadium, which also encompasses the running track which surrounds the football/soccer field; a softball field, and a baseball field. Northwestern is divided into four distinct \\"sub-schools\\": the A-Wing, B/G-Wing, C-Wing, and D/E/F-Wing. Each can house between 600 and 700 students. The original plan was to physically divide the school into four smaller schools, hence the design theme of the building.Hummer, Alex. \\"A New Look at School Registration\\". The Paw Print, December 1999. Page 1. Sub-School A was intended to be the \\"School of Fine, Creative, and Performing Arts\\"; Sub- School B was to be the \\"School of Career and Consumer Education\\"; Sub-School C was to be a general facility that housed mainly elective courses, in addition the school's main offices, security office, and health center; and Sub-School D was to be \\"The School of Intensive and Specialized Instruction,\\" which would house the school's honors and advanced placement program as well as the school's ESOL (English Speakers of Other Languages) program and Vocational Development (Special Education) program. Students were not to be permitted to interact with students from other sub-schools, and were to be isolated within their sub-school for the majority of the school day. Due to scheduling conflicts and feasibility issues with this concept, the idea was dropped before the new building ever opened, while the idea of smaller learning communities was retained and revised to become less restrictive and isolating. The sub-schools are connected by a large, unique main hallway called the skywalk, which features a tiered three-story design. A person overlooking the third floor skywalk can see straight down to the first floor main hallway. The building features an artistic, colorful design theme using multiple variations of the colors blue, purple, teal, gray, and white. These were inspired largely by the official school colors, navy blue and white. The four main academic sections of the building house specialized programs as part of Northwestern's initiative to provide smaller learning environments in which students can specialize in specific areas of study, similar to a college. Across the main hallway from the sub-buildings are other facilities encompassing the H, J, & K-Wings (there is no \\"I-Wing\\"), which includes the main gymnasium, auxiliary gymnasium, main cafeteria/food court (H-Wing), NJROTC unit and Child Development wing (K-Wing), and library/media center. The H, J, and K-Wings are not separate buildings like Wings A-F. Another unique design feature of Northwestern is its three satellite cafeterias or commissaries, which supplement the main food court. There are commissaries in Wings A, B/G, and D/E/F. These were generally intended for seniors only, but students of all grade levels use the facilities. Northwestern has three lecture halls with stadium seating which resemble classrooms typically found at large universities. These can seat 30-50 students. The auditorium, which constitutes the entire portion of the building referred to as the D-Wing, has a maximum capacity of 1,100. Northwestern also has two high-capacity elevators restricted for personnel use only. Northwestern is a technologically advanced school and has over six computer labs in addition to the media center. It currently has over 1,100 computers, the most of any high school in Maryland. Each classroom at Northwestern has a bank of at least five computers with internet access. All of the lavatories at Northwestern feature automatic flush toilets, automatic on/off sinks, and automatic hand dryers. As an energy conservation effort, the lighting in the hallways has an auto-on/off feature, where sensors will automatically shut off the lights if movement is not detected within a certain period of time, and conversely will turn on the lights when movement is detected. Athletic facilities The football/soccer stadium Northwestern was planned with an enhanced emphasis on athletics. The football and soccer stadium (previously known as the Prince George's County Memorial Stadium) can accommodate the entire student population and features a modern, air-conditioned press box. There are also two softball/baseball fields (one at either side of the football field) and six tennis courts. The new baseball field was dedicated to longtime baseball coach, football coach, gym teacher, athletic director and alumnus Martin \\"Marty\\" Gallagher. This honor was organized by Coach Gallagher's former athletes from the 60s, 70s and 80s. The gymnasium is currently the second largest in Prince George's County; it is able to seat over half the school's population. When the bleachers are retracted, the gymnasium can provide three full-sized basketball courts for practice and play. It was rumored that the new school was to feature, among other things, an indoor swimming pool, but this did not come to fruition. Northwestern Health & Wellness Center The Health & Wellness Center is a joint venture between Northwestern High School and the Prince George's Hospital Center in Cheverly, Maryland. When the original Health & Wellness Center was founded in the mid-90s in the old building, it was the first of its kind in PGCPS. Three other centers have since been established, more recently, in other area schools. The Health Center is located across from the Main Administrative Offices (Room C207) and combines the Health and Wellness Center and the Health Suite. The center provides basic health, counseling, education and prevention services in support of Northwestern students' academic and social success. Services include physical examinations, laboratory testing and treatment for infections and transmittable diseases, immunizations, gynecological care, dental care, and mental health counseling. All students, as well as the infants and toddlers of teen parents enrolled in the Adolescent Teen Parenting Program, are eligible to receive confidential primary health care services and treatment. The emphasis is on health promotion, disease prevention and self- care. Services are provided at no direct charge to students or parents/guardians, except when appropriate to bill enrollees' insurance companies or medical assistance. Demographics The C-wing (main wing) at Northwestern High School As of Fall 2013, Northwestern High School has an enrollment of approximately 2,217 students. The demographics of the student body (as of 2009) werre 96.5% minority, of which 44.2% were African- American/Black, including those from African or Caribbean nations; 45.04% Hispanic; 6.8% Asian; and 3.4 Caucasian. Of these students, 1270 are male and 1183 are female.Northwestern High School Profile & Statistics, Northwestern High School. About 400 students are \\"Limited English Proficient\\" (LEP) or ESOLSchool Improvement Plan, Northwestern High School. and over 200 are in Special Education. More than half of Northwestern's students qualify for Free and Reduced Meal status. Feeder patterns and admissions=Admissions With the implementation of the Center for the Visual and Performing Arts (CVPA) magnet program, Northwestern presently has two separate admissions processes. General admission into the main comprehensive program requires no special procedures. Students who live in the designated zoned attendance area for Northwestern, as defined by the school district, can attend the school. In 8th grade, incoming freshman complete a pre-registration form which reflects which of the Northwestern academy programs they are interested in enrolling in. Certain academies have specific requirements that students must satisfy in order to apply. The admissions procedure for the CVPA magnet program is a competitive and selective audition-only entrance process. Students vying for a spot have specific audition requirements. Acceptance into the program is through a two-stage application process. The first stage involves an actual application which factors in current GPA, plus two teacher recommendations, after which qualified students undergo an audition related to their intended arts major. Currently, only students living in a limited boundary area are eligible to audition for placement into the CVPA Academy. They must either be in the zoned attendance area for Northwestern, or have been enrolled in the Creative and Performing Arts magnet program at Hyattsville Middle School, where Northwestern now serves as the high school continuity program.

There is no restriction on footwear.Northwestern High School Uniform Policy Academics=Sub-schools and academy programs As part of adopting a \\"smaller learning communities\\" program of instruction, Northwestern High School offers several specialized programs in addition to the core curriculum mandated by the Prince George's County Public Schools system.2008-2009 Northwestern High School Course Guide. Northwestern Guidance Department. Pages 5-8. A career academy operates as a \\"school-within-a-school\\" model, that provides a college preparatory curriculum with a career-related theme. The curriculum organizes instruction in academic subjects around an industry or career theme and enables students to fulfill requirements for college entrance in addition to acquiring work-related knowledge and skill. All students are provided a core set, or curricula, and experiences in the ninth and tenth grades. Ninth graders become a part of the Ninth Grade Academy to provide greater structure and focus with the goal of enhancing basic skills and preparing them for more intensive study after their selection of a career academy by the end of sophomore year. During eleventh and twelfth grades, students are exposed to more specific or specialized instruction and participate in various work-based learning experiences. Since all students take a core foundation of academic courses, career pathways overlap enough to allow the flexibility to change academies, if interests change or new knowledge and skills are acquired. Northwestern has identified nearly a dozen career clusters, organized around broad career fields. Of those career clusters, Northwestern has implemented four sub-schools. Each wing at Northwestern hosts at least one sub-school and one or more academy programs. The various programs are: *The Jim Henson Center for the Visual and Performing Arts Academy **Vocal Music major **Instrumental Music major **Interactive Media Production major **Visual Arts major **Dance major **Drama major *School of Business Management and Finance **Academy of Business Management **National Academy of Finance *School of Human Resource Services **International Studies Program (ISP) **NJROTC Academy of Military Science *School of Manufacturing, Engineering, and Technology **Project Lead the Way Academy of Engineering Northwestern also features the America's Choice School Design Signature Program, a whole-school program which promotes reading and the language arts.

The glass focal point spans the entire length of \\"the skywalk\\" and the middle brick column is actually the housing for one of two elevators at the school. =Academy of Arts, Media and Communications= The Jim Henson School of Arts, Media, and Communications offers academies in three arts disciplines: Arts & Humanities, Performing Arts, and Visual Arts. The vocal and instrumental music programs at Northwestern, as well as the Advanced Placement Art program, have collectively received numerous awards throughout the years for their work. =Project Lead the Way Academy of Engineering= The Project Lead The Way (PLTW) Academy of Engineering educates high school students in the principles of engineering, and provides content in the fields of electronics, biotechnology, aerospace, civil engineering, and architecture. The Academy of Engineering is a partnership with PLTW and the STEM Academy. The program is a four-year sequence of courses which, when combined with traditional mathematics and science courses in high school, introduces students to the scope, rigor and discipline of engineering prior to entering college. Students in the Academy of Engineering take specialized courses specific to the academy, such as Principles of Engineering, Introduction to Engineering Design, and Digital Electronics. Specialization courses include Computer Integrated Manufacturing, Biotechnical Engineering, Civil Engineering and Architecture, Aerospace Engineering, and Capstone Course: Engineering Design and Development. =Academy of Finance= The National Academy of Finance connects high school students with the world of financial services, offering a curriculum that covers banking and credit, financial planning, international finance, securities, insurance, accounting, and economics. The AOF is a national program that was established to develop students with the skills and knowledge to succeed in this fast- paced growth area of business. =The NJROTC Academy of Military Science= The Naval Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps (NJROTC) Academy of Military Science, provides secondary school students the opportunity to become informed, responsible citizens prepared for high school graduation. Program highlights include a focus on academics, including United States military history; exploration of national security issues; the study of meteorology and astronomy; communications and advanced technologies employed by the armed services; navigation and survival skills; healthy lifestyles and physical fitness; organizational skills and financial management; career exploration in a wide variety of fields (both military and nonmilitary); and the foundations of responsible leadership. Cadets learn and develop leadership skills and application of military courtesies and customs as they complete each year of their NJROTC programs. The curriculum is structured for success in high school and beyond. Through the demonstration of discipline, honor, self-respect, and commitment, cadets gain increasing responsibilities within their programs. NJROTC cadets and units must complete civic action projects and community service. The program also provides field trips to historical military sites and institutions, and visits to colleges, universities and military academies to increase awareness and opportunities. Participation on one of the various drill teams could include travels to neighboring counties, states, and possibly competitions held nationwide. The programs provide college scholarships and military academy appointment opportunities for qualified cadets. With the completion of specific requirements, several courses within the NJROTC curriculum can earn cadets college credits through the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs. Students who successfully complete a minimum of three years of the NJROTC program and qualify to enter active-duty military service, receive pay/rank increases of two grades above non-NJROTC recruits. =International Studies Academy= The International Studies Academy (also known as the International Studies Program) is an interdisciplinary honors program which affords students the opportunity to choose a curriculum offering a focus in global education and technology. ISP students are encouraged to participate in international travel. This component of the ISP greatly enhances participating students‚Äô understanding of their world and enriches their ability to interact successfully with a broad range of peoples and regions. Similarly, the experiences offered within ISP reinforce students‚Äô capacity for viewing career paths in technology-related professions, as well as in foreign policy, international affairs, and foreign exchange. The Jim Henson Center for the Visual and Performing Arts Academy The Jim Henson Center for the Visual and Performing Arts Academy is a selective specialized program, and students are only admitted to the program through a competitive audition process. The school was granted the exclusive rights to use Jim Henson's name, by Henson's family. This is the largest sub-school at Northwestern, and is an extension of the original Academy of Arts, Media, and Communications. The CVPA is a rigorous four-year arts program that offers artistically talented high school students educational opportunities designed to prepare them artistically for college, professional study, or career options in the arts. Students in this program may major in six specific arts concentrations, which include vocal music, instrumental music, interactive media production (television production), visual arts, dance, and drama (theatre). CVPA students take a required \\"zero period\\" course, which has them start their school day 45 minutes earlier than the general student body. The CVPA program is open to students in a limited attendance area, and all students who are enrolled in the Creative and Performing Arts program at Hyattsville Middle School can apply to the program at Northwestern. Eventually, it is anticipated that the boundaries will be expanded to include the entire northern half of the county, while Suitland's CVPA program will draw students from the southern half. Northwestern provides the continuity arts program for K-8th grade students enrolled in the Creative and Performing Arts programs at both Edward M. Felegy Elementary School and Hyattsville Middle School. Vocal Music major Students who want to continue their musical training can audition for placement into either guitar, piano, or voice (choral) majors. Within each major, students receive advanced-level instruction via private lessons, as well as their participation in larger ensembles. In-school juried assessments of students' level of development in sensing, playing, and performing, are required as a component of being a vocal music major. Students also have a chance for exposure to music technology and composition, through an arts integration approach. Vocal Music majors take a required \\"zero period\\" Applied Music course, which incorporates advanced private voice lessons. Vendors in the parking lot at Northwestern, participating in the popular Saturday-run ISP Flea Market, run by the schools' International Studies Academy Instrumental Music major Instrumental Music majors have the option of completing a concentration in either band or orchestral performance. Regardless of their major, all instrumental students receive advanced-level instruction on their major instrument via private lessons and additional music theory training. These are provided with the aim of making the participant more college- and career-ready. A requirement of either major is participation in large and small ensemble performances, as well as in-school juried assessments. Interactive Media Production major The emphasis of this major (formerly \\"Television Production\\") is hands-on experience in television, radio, digital arts and film. Students are exposed to current principles and practices of multimedia standards, computer graphics, software application, developmental techniques, and media ethics. Students may take courses such as Media Scriptwriting and Mass Media. Visual Arts major Visual Arts majors are exposed to studio processes, and learn the history of the materials and techniques used in these processes. Students use integrated technology throughout the program, take foundation courses, and in their junior and senior years select two areas of concentration per year. The concentrations allow majors to receive instruction in drawing and painting, sculpture, photography, and computer graphics. Dance major Students electing to major in the field of Dance undergo rigorous instruction in various genres, with an emphasis on ballet, jazz, and modern dance. Students are provided opportunities to participate in collegiate, regional, national workshops, competitions, and enrichment opportunities. Drama major Students in this strand are exposed to acting, directing, playwriting, set/scene design, costume design, make-up, audio/visual, lighting, writing, and performing original poetry and monologues. Students may select from specialized courses such as Technical Theatre, Theatre Production, and Acting Studio. General academics Northwestern students generally undertake a college preparatory curriculum that follows the graduation requirement guidelines set forth by the state of Maryland, which includes four years of English; three years of mathematics, science, and social studies (U.S. History, L/S/N Government, and World History are required); one credit in fine arts and Foundations of Technology; and a ¬Ω credit of Personal Fitness (Physical Education) and Health. Students choose from a variety of \\"completer electives\\", as well as a combination of ways they can earn those elective credits. Two credits of a foreign language (of the same language) are required, as well as three credits is miscellaneous electives. Optionally, a student may elect to complete two credits in Advanced Technology Education and three credits in miscellaneous electives. As another option, a student could complete a state-approved technology program and any remaining credits in electives.

A wide array of electives are offered in the humanities, including African American Studies, African Area Studies, Drama, Economic Issues, Practical Law, Journalism/Yearbook, Psychology, Public Policy Issues, SAT Preparation, Social Studies Research Seminar, and Student Government. Northwestern's award-winning music program offers students twelve performance ensembles ranging from marching band and steel drum band to concert choir. Non-performance elective courses include Music Survey, Musicianship and AP Music Theory. The Student Art Gallery, located on the 2nd floor of the Jim Henson School of Arts, Media and Communications Release-time/work study program Northwestern has three groups of 12th grade students who have an abbreviated class schedule. Most of these students take two classes per day before leaving school. These groups include: *Released time students *Marketing work study students *COE/Government Connection Work Study students Released time students are allowed to leave prior to the end of the normal school day to pursue a non-credit program of activities which approved, but not sponsored or supervised, by the school. Most leave after their second period class. While released time students have school privileges, such as participation in athletic and other extracurricular activities, they must exit the school building at the conclusion of their normal day and return at the time their scheduled activity begins. Guidance counselors discuss the terms of release time with students, and students and their parents must complete the necessary paperwork. Marketing work study students are seniors participating in the Marketing Completer program. They take their scheduled classes and, in most cases, are dismissed from school at the end of second period. They are not permitted to leave school before the conclusion of their second period class. While these students have jobs, their work schedules should not conflict with their normal school day. The Cooperative Office Experience (COE)/Government Connection Work Study students participate in a school sponsored work-based learning experience in partnership with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in Washington, DC. Students must report to their work site by a specified time. Prince George's County school buses transport these students to the Prince George's Plaza Metro Station. Daycare In 2011 the school was one of two in the county with an on-site daycare; it also had classes for new parents. That year almost 40 students at the school had children. Advanced Placement program rankings Northwestern offers one of the largest AP programs in Prince George's County, with courses such as AP Calculus, AP Physics, AP U.S. History, AP English Literature, AP Studio Art, and AP Spanish. Northwestern High School was cited in The Washington Post for its achievements in its Advanced Placement (AP) program in 2005. Northwestern was ranked second in the county (out of 24 high schools) for students scoring highest on the nationally administered Advanced Placement Tests, by College Board, the association which governs AP programs and its related courses throughout the country. In January 2006, the College Board reported that 17.9% of Northwestern's 2005 graduates earned a passing score of 3 or higher, (the highest being a 5) which is above the national average of 14.1%. This achievement ranked Northwestern behind only the county's leading high school, Eleanor Roosevelt, which has consistently ranked first in the county due largely in part to its specialized Science and Technology Center magnet program. This was the first time Northwestern had achieved this distinction. Northwestern's closest contender in the county is the academically notable Bowie High School, which received a rating of 13.2%. University of Maryland Collaborative Project magnet program During the 1990s and extending into the 21st century, Northwestern housed the University of Maryland Collaborative Project continuation magnet program,Prince George's County Public Schools. \\"University of Maryland Collaborative Project\\", Magnet Schools 1999-2004, October 10, 2012. for students who were enrolled in a middle school Science, Mathematics, and Technology Magnet Program, primarily serving students from the magnet at Nicholas Orem Middle School. The educational programs within the magnet were also open to all attendance-area students at Northwestern. It was a highly challenging program, focusing on preparating of students to achieve success in AP coursesand for entry into college. The magnet included differentiated instruction and a competency-based curriculum, and served as an educational partnership linking the personnel and resources of the University of Maryland, College Park and Northwestern. Students had access to Pre-Advanced Placement courses and AP Government at the ninth grade level; major emphasis on analytical writing in English classes, computer-intensive mathematics classes; scientific research in trigonometry and calculus classes; and a host of other magnet-exclusive instructional methods. Due to the court-ordered restructuring of PGCPS magnet programs, several magnets were eliminated in between 2003 and 2004, including the programs at Northwestern and Nicholas Orem. Extracurricular activities=Band The Northwestern High School Instrumental Music Program has been rated \\"Superior\\" and received first place, as well as grand championship rankings, at local, state, and national levels. The band went to Nationals several times (a competition/event for the best bands in the country). Choir The vocal music program has become a nationally and internationally recognized program. It consists of three main performance ensembles, and other smaller extra-curricular groups. For the 2013‚Äì14 school year, the main ensembles were the VPA magnet Advanced Chorus, and the non- magnet Concert Choir, and Mixed Chorus. Over the years, there have been other numerous vocal music groups at the school. The Concert, Advanced, Women's, and Gospel Choirs have received numerous superior ratings at the local and state level, as well as national and international venues. In the Fall of 2010, the Choir formed the Friends of the Northwestern Choral Society, a legal non- profit organization that serves as the managerial and operating division of the choir. The FNCS is primarily responsible for the fundraising endeavors of the choir, managing expenditures and finances, and promoting the choir and its events. The largest choir has typically been the Concert Choir. Enrollment in this Choir has been as high as 130 members, and currently has approximately 100. The vocal music program at Northwestern is not considered extra- curricular. All choirs at Northwestern are offered as credit courses during the academic school day. The Mixed Chorus was begun in the 2013‚Äì14 school year. It is open to all students in grades nine through twelve, and is intended to be the beginning-level choir for those students with little to no prior experience in vocal music performance. The Concert Choir is the intermediate-level choir and the main vocal performing group at Northwestern, for students in grades nine through twelve. It has open enrollment. Students sing in many genres, such as classical, spiritual, international, secular, sacred, jazz, and show tunes. The choir has performed classical works, from Mozart and Schubert, to challenging spirituals by William L. Dawson and Moses Hogan. The Advanced Ensemble is an auditioned, select choir, and members must be enrolled in the school's Center for the Visual and Performing Arts magnet program. It is the primary touring/performing choir at Northwestern. The Advanced Ensemble performs music of the same genre as the main Concert Choir, but the music tends to be more challenging, with more foreign-language repertoire. The Advanced Ensemble travels and performs the most extensively of all the performing groups. The Advanced Ensemble underwent their first international tour in July 2013, when they traveled to South Africa to participate in a two-week concert tour, as part of the prestigious Ihlombe South African Choral Festival. They visited the cities of Johannesburg, Pretoria, Soweto, and Cape Town. The group achieved international notoriety and media coverage during their tour, when they performed outside of the Mediclinic Heart Hospital, the facility where revered former president of South Africa, Nelson Mandela, was being treated for illness. The Gospel Choir is currently taught as an after-school ensemble. It has performed gospel music works from contemporary gospel greats such as Kirk Franklin, Hezekiah Walker, and Donnie McClurkin. The Women's Choir is a beginning to intermediate-level, all-female SSA ensemble. This group is the equivalent of the main Concert Choir. Encore! is a new a cappella jazz tunes and pop variety choir, formed from members of the Advanced Ensemble. Encore! performs at the more prestigious events the choirs are requested to participate in. The choirs participate yearly in nationwide and international choral competitions, consistently bringing home multiple first place/Superior honors for eight of the last twelve years. The Concert Choir was awarded the highest honor, a \\"Superior\\" rating, at the 2011 Festival of Gold invitational in New York City. The choirs have also had a prominent presence at the state-level Maryland All- State Chorus Festival. The choirs have been featured on the national television network NBC; a PBS network broadcast special, Celebrate America with Tim Janis; and the University of Maryland television network;. They have performed with the Towson State University Choir and the University of Maryland Chamber Singers. The Advanced Ensemble was featured in news stories on three of the four major Washington, DC-area television news networks (WRC- TV/NBC 4, WTTG/FOX 5, and WUSA TV 9, in addition to being featured in The Washington Post three times. The choirs have performed two world premiers - Many Voices, One World with original poetry by Northwestern students, and Undisclosed Locations with Northwestern's award-winning Jazz Band. Both collaboration projects were in conjunction with the University of Maryland School of Music, with songs written exclusively for the choir by the late composer Christopher Patton. ;Performance-based ensembles *Concert Choir ‚Äì a beginning- to intermediate-level mixed choir; open enrollment; all grade levels; non-magnet *Visual and Performing Arts Choir ‚Äì a selective, advanced- level SATB choir; audition required; all grade levels; CVPA Magnet Ensemble *Encore! ‚Äì a small jazz/pop variety mixed ensemble; semi-selective; all grade levels; CVPA Magnet Ensemble *Concert band ‚Äì a beginning/intermediate-level concert band; open enrollment; all grade levels *Marching band ‚Äì an intermediate/advanced-level marching band; semi-selective; all grade level *Jazz Ensemble ‚Äì a small intermediate/advanced-level jazz ensemble; audition required; grades 10‚Äì12 *Percussion Ensemble ‚Äì a small, intermediate-level percussion ensemble; semi-selective; grades 10‚Äì12 *Wind Ensemble ‚Äì a small, advanced-level, instrumental chamber ensemble; audition required; grades 10‚Äì12 *Flute Choir ‚Äì a small, intermediate/advanced-level, instrumental chamber ensemble; audition required; grades 9‚Äì12 *Full Orchestra ‚Äì a large instrumental group consisting of the combined Concert Band and String Orchestra *String Orchestra ‚Äì a multi-skill level, string ensemble; open enrollment; grades 9‚Äì12 *String Ensemble ‚Äì a small chamber orchestra, primarily consisting of string instruments; audition required; grades 10‚Äì12 A photograph of the Northwestern High School main gymnasium showing the right, center, and left sections of the space Athletics Northwestern High School sports teams are called the Wildcats.

It lies on the left bank of the Olt River, between the cities of Sibiu and FƒÉgƒÉra»ô, close to the villages of C√¢r»õa (German Kerz, Hungarian: Kerc) and C√¢r»õi»ôoara (German: Kleinkerz). The monastery was probably founded in 1202‚Äì1206 by monks from Igri»ô Abbey (daughter house of Pontigny Abbey), and was disbanded in 1494, when the apostolic legate Ursus of Ursinis ratified C√¢r»õa Abbey's attachment to the Provostship nullius of Sibiu. The Cistercian monastery introduced and helped develop French Gothic art in the region. History of the Monastery The exact founding date of the C√¢r»õa Monastery () is unknown. A document from Konstanz, dated 17 April 1418, issued by Sigismund, king of Hungary states vaguely that the monastery was founded, built, and awarded rights and privileges by his predecessors. The statute of royal establishment is also pointed out in the act disbanding the monastery 27 February 1474, and was made ex auctoritate juris patronatus regii Matthias Corvinus, king of Hungary. Cistercian documents from the 13th till 15th century gathered and analyzed by Leopold Janauschek mention the founding year of the monastery as being somewhere around 1202‚Äì1203. The best approximation of the monastery's date of foundation can be obtained from a document issued by the Arpadian royal chancellery in 1223. This document states that the territory on which the monastery was built ‚Äì delimited by the Olt River at the north side and its tributaries the Arpa»ô River at the east, the C√¢r»õi»ôoara River at the west and the FƒÉgƒÉra»ô Mountains) at the south ‚Äì was awarded by magister Gocelinus, for the blessing of his soul, through the Transylvanian voivod Benedict (pro remedio animae nostre per fidelem ac dilectum nostrum Benedictum tunc temporis vaivodam assignari facientes). It is known that Benedict was Voivode of Transylvania between 1202‚Äì1206 and 1208‚Äì1209. This means that the founding date must fall between 1202 and 1209. An additional document, the General Chapter of the Cistercian Order from 1206, further narrows the date of founding. This document mentions the presence of a Cistercian monk from Transylvania, most probably from C√¢r»õa (abbas ultra Sylvas in Hungaria, filius abbatis de Egris), at the C√Æteaux Abbey, in Burgundy, the main abbey of the Cistercian order. Summing up this historical data, the date of the monastery's founding by the cistercians monks can be established as occurring between 1198 and 1208. The colonising convent was the mother abbey in Igri»ô (Latin Egris, Hungarian Egres), in the Banat plain, today located in Timi»ô County, Romania. Filiation reports between the two monasteries can be dated from 1206, 1368 and 1430. History of the surviving structure Tower of C√¢r»õa Monastery The first buildings of the monastery were built, according to Cistercian customs, using perishable materials, most probably wood. These can be dated relatively confidently as having been built in the founding period (1205‚Äì1206). A few years later, approximately 1210‚Äì1215, a stone chapel, the oratorium, was built close to the original wood buildings. The foundations of this chapel of small dimension (around 8‚Äì10 metres) and massive walls, were rediscovered in the spring of 1927, by the Transylvanian Saxon art historian and archeologist Victor Roth. Also, subsequent researches were carried out in the period 1983-1985 to better study these remains. The construction of the main stone edifice started a little bit later, most probably between 1220 and 1230. The construction occurred in two stages, separated by the Great Mongol invasion of 1241. In the first stage of construction, the main elements are of Romanesque influence. The general plan was traced and the walls were erected up to a height of about 3‚Äì4 metres. In 1260, the works were restarted under a new architect trained in the mature Gothic architecture, and with the help of a new masons' workshop. During this period, the old stone oratorium was dismantled and on its foundations was built a part of the north wing of the transept and a part of the choir with the polygonal apse. At around 1300, the church and the east wing of the C√¢r»õa Monastery were already finished and the works on the south side will continue for about two decades. Possessions of the monastery A document issued on 29 January 1322 by the king Charles I of Hungary states that ten villages were in the possession of the Cistercian monastery of C√¢r»õa: C√¢r»õa (Kerch), Cri»õ (Cruz), Me»ôendorf (Messendorf), Cloa»ôterf (villa Nicholai), Apo»ô (villa Abbatis), CisnƒÉdioara (monte sancti Michaelis), Feldioara (Feldwar), Colun (Colonia), Gl√¢mboaca (Honrabah) and C√¢r»õa Rom√¢neascƒÉ (Kercz Olachorum) which correspond to the area between present day cities of Sibiu and Bra»ôov and the T√¢rnava Mare River valley. In the second half of the 13th century, in its vicinity, on the right bank of the Olt river, the village of C√¢r»õa () was founded and also on the H√¢rtibaciu River valley, close to Agnita, it founded the village of Apo»ô (German: Abtsdorf, or \\"the Monk's Village\\"). Both villages were populated with German colonists (Transylvanian Saxons) and later in the 13th and 14th centuries on the Sighi»ôoara seat, it founded the villages of Cri»õ (German: Deutsch-Kreuz; ), Me»ôendorf (German: Meschendorf; Hungarian: Mese) and Cloa»ôterf (German: Klosterdorf; Hungarian: Mikl√≥stelke), and also the villages Colun (German: Kolun; Hungarian: Kellen), Gl√¢mboaca (German: H√ºhnerbach; Hungarian: Glimboka) and Feldioara (German: Marienburg; Hungarian F√∂ldv√°r) situated on the right bank of the Olt River between Sibiu and Bra»ôov.

Ulanhu had the nickname of \\"Mongolian Viscount‚Äù during his political career. He served as Vice-Premier between 1956 and 1966. He was purged during the Cultural Revolution but later reinstated. Between 1983 and 1988 he held the office of Vice President of the People's Republic of China. Ulanhu was the highest-ranking minority official in PRC history, and became an icon of loyalty both to the Mongolian people and to the PRC. Except for the period of the Cultural Revolution, his family dominated the politics of Inner Mongolia. His son Buhe served as Chairman of Inner Mongolia for a decade, and his granddaughter Bu Xiaolin was appointed to the same position in 2016. Early career 160px Born in Tumed Left Banner, just outside the city of Hohhot, Ulanhu was the child of herders. He went to elementary school in his hometown, and went on to study at the Mongolian- Tibetan College of Beiping (now Beijing). He joined the Socialist Youth League of China (later renamed Communist Youth League) in 1924, intending to become communist revolutionary. In 1925, he joined the Communist Party of China and was sent to Moscow Sun Yat-sen University in the Soviet Union to study Marxism. In Moscow, Ulanhu shared a desk with Chiang Ching-kuo, the son of Chiang Kai-shek. In 1929, when he returned from his studies, Ulanhu began organizing communist rallies in Mongolia, and was appointed a Committee Member of the CPC's West-Mongolia Working Committee. In 1931, Ulanhu was chosen to run the military and intelligence offices in Mongolia, serving in Ikh Juu League (now the city of Ordos). During the Second World War, Ulanhu led his forces to stop the Japanese from advancing towards Hohhot and led his officers to march to northern Shaanxi where he continued battling against the Japanese forces. In August 1941, he arrived at the revolutionary base of Yan'an to work on ethnic affairs. Civil war During the Chinese Civil War, Ulanhu was one of the commanders of the Pingjin Campaign and the Liaoshen Campaign, he also led his Communist forces to destroy the local bandits and anti-communist forces in Mongolia. Ulanhu was instrumental in bringing Inner Mongolia under the control of the Communist Party of China and was elected the Acting Governor and founding Chairman of the Autonomous Government of Inner Mongolia in 1947. Inner Mongolia was the first of five recognized autonomous regions in China. In September 1954, Ulanhu was named Vice-Premier, ranking eighth. In 1955 he was awarded the rank of General (shang jiang), becoming one of only 57 generals bestowed the honour of being a \\"founding general\\" of the People's Republic. He served as Communist Party Secretary and chairman of Inner Mongolia from the region's founding to 1966. Cultural Revolution Ulanhu and the delegates of Inner Mongolia People's Congress. At the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, zealous Red Guard organizations attempted to storm the Inner Mongolia government headquarters. Ulanhu used troops at his disposal to repel them, only to be later undone by military forces sent in by leftist leaders in Beijing, ousting him from office. He was accused of \\"ruling Inner Mongolia like an independent kingdom\\", and persecuted as a suspected member of the independence-leaning Inner Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, a charge later proven to be false. However, while he was a target for struggle, Ulanhu survived the Cultural Revolution without enduring some of the more severe physical hardships inflicted upon some of his colleagues, largely owing to the support of Premier Zhou Enlai. After rehabilitation and death Ulanhu was politically rehabilitated in 1973, prior to the 10th Party Congress, with the personal blessing of Mao Zedong. In 1977, Ulanhu became head of the United Front Department of the central organization of the CPC. Among various other posts, he served one term as Vice President of the People's Republic of China under President Li Xiannian from 1983 to 1988. Upon completion of the term as vice-president, he was elected Vice-Chairman of the National People's Congress. He died shortly thereafter in 1988 after an illness. He was eulogized with high honours by the ruling Communist Party. In 1992, the Ulanhu Memorial Hall was opened to the public in Hohhot. His Selected Works were published in 1999 at a dedication ceremony attended by Jiang Zemin, General Secretary of the Communist Party of China.Êñ∞ÂçéÁΩëËµÑÊñôÔºö‰πåÂÖ∞Â§´ In December 2007, the Communist Party held a high-profile conference to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Ulanhu's birth. In 2009, the historic epic Spring Comes Early to the Grasslands aired on China Central Television, and depicted some of Ulanhu's activities during the revolution. Family Ulanhu married twice and had four sons and four daughters. His son, Buhe, served as the Chairman of Inner Mongolia from 1982 to 1993. His granddaughter (Buhe's daughter) Bu Xiaolin was appointed Chairwoman of Inner Mongolia in March 2016, making her the third generation of the Ulanhu family to hold that position.

It was released on 25 February 1977 by Island.  Writing  The songs \\"Sat'day Night in the City of the Dead\\" and \\"Dangerous Rhythm\\", alongside other songs from the album, were written while the band were named Tiger Lily. The former song pre-dated punk music, written over a year before the emergence of punk. The latter, a reggae influenced song, was released as the first Ultravox single in February 1977 to positive reviews. The band's early ambition to combine 1950s and 1960s pop music with the intensity of raw rock music and glam rock developed into writing longer and more intricate songs like \\"I Want to Be a Machine\\". The song \\"My Sex\\" includes an early use of a synthesizer. Lyrically the album is mainly about the band's environment, living in London in the mid-1970s, with lyricist John Foxx being heavily influenced by the writings of J.G.

Before that the British heads of mission to the Holy See were styled Attach√© resident at Rome and Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary. History of representation Diplomatic relations were broken off between the Pope and the Kingdom of England in 1534, after the Act of Supremacy of that year declared that King Henry VIII was \\"the only Supreme Head in Earth of the Church of England\\". This break continued throughout the remaining existence of the Kingdom of England and its successor the Kingdom of Great Britain (1707‚Äì1800). However, after the formation of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland an \\"unofficial official\\" was kept in Rome from the mid- nineteenth century, holding the title of representative to the Papal States.Chadwick, 1988, p. 2. With the rise of Italian nationalism, the Papal States were conquered by the House of Savoy and a unified Kingdom of Italy was declared in 1861. In 1874, due to the Roman Question, the Conservative government withdrew this representative, reasoning that it was not cost- effective to maintain a representative to a \\"non-existent state\\". Missions between 1874 and 1914 were designated \\"special and temporary\\". In 1914 the United Kingdom formally re-established diplomatic relations with the Holy See. A minister was sent to the papal court during the First World War to court the favour of the Pope towards the Triple Entente. This mission was maintained after the war for the perceived value of its prestige (a \\"quiet place for a not very distinguished diplomat\\") and the conflicts in Ireland, Malta, Quebec, and Australia, which had Roman Catholic dimensions. After the rupture in 1930‚Äì33 due to difficulties in Malta, the post was filled with more experienced and respected diplomats. From 1914 to 1982 the diplomatic representative of the United Kingdom to the Holy See had the rank of Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary, as did the UK's representatives to many other countries until the 1960s, but partly because there was already a British ambassador in Rome, to Italy. The British envoy to the Holy See was upgraded to Ambassador in 1982.Chadwick, 1988, p. 3.

Novak currently plays for Traktor Chelyabinsk in the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL). He has won the Gagarin Cup twice with DDynamo Moscow in 2012 and 2013. Playing career Nov√°k played junior hockey with HC Budejovice in his native Czech Republic and with the Regina Pats of the Western Hockey League before he was drafted by the New York Rangers in the second round (64th overall) of the 2000 NHL Entry Draft. After being drafted, he spent a two further seasons with Regina. On March 8, 2002 he was part of a blockbuster trade that sent Nov√°k, Igor Ulanov, a first-round selection in the 2002 NHL Entry Draft (later traded to Calgary Flames - Eric Nystrom), a second-round selection in the 2002 NHL Entry Draft (Rob Globke) and a fourth-round selection in the 2003 NHL Entry Draft to the Florida Panthers for Pavel Bure and a second-round selection in the 2002 NHL Entry Draft (Lee Falardeau). Nearing the end of the season, he sustained a serious injury that kept him off the ice until late 2004, when he played with the San Antonio Rampage of the American Hockey League. Just prior to the start of the 2005‚Äì06 NHL season, Nov√°k was traded to the Ottawa Senators for a sixth-round selection in the 2007 NHL Entry Draft. On August 8, 2006, Nov√°k signed with the Columbus Blue Jackets as an unrestricted free agent. On May 1, 2014, Novak was signed to a two-year contract extension to remain with Dynamo Moscow. During his first season with HC Slovan Bratislava in 2015‚Äì16, Novak was traded after just 16 games with the club, remaining in the KHL with Russian club, Traktor Chelyabinsk on October 16, 2015.

The first generation Proton Persona (C90) refers to the export name given to the Proton Wira. The first use of the 'Proton Persona' nameplate dates back to November 1993 in the British market. The original Persona was later joined by the 3-door Persona Compact, and 2-door Persona Coup√©. The second generation Proton Persona (CM) launched in August 2007. The CM series is the first Proton model to use the 'Persona' nameplate in its home market. It is based on an extended Proton GEN‚Ä¢2 platform, and was sold as a saloon complement to the GEN‚Ä¢2 hatchback. The CM Persona replaced the Proton Wira saloon in Malaysia and the C90 Persona in its export markets. The third generation Proton Persona (BH) was unveiled in August 2016. It is based on an extended Proton Iriz platform, and is sold as a saloon complement to the Iriz hatchback. It directly replaced the nine-year- old CM Persona in its home market.  First generation (C95, C96, C97, C98, C99; 1993‚Äì2007)  The Proton Wira made its debut in the United Kingdom in November 1993, where it was sold as the 'Proton Persona'. The Persona family initially consisted of the 4-door saloon and 5-door hatchback. Later in November 1995, the new Persona Compact model was introduced, and a 2-door Persona Coup√© joined the range in 1997. The Compact and Coup√© models are the British counterparts of the Proton Satria and Proton Putra in Malaysia. From August 2000, the Satria and Wira nameplates were extended to the British market, and the Coup√© was discontinued when production ended in 2001. The Wira was subsequently replaced by the all-new Proton GEN‚Ä¢2 in winter 2004. The Proton Wira was first exported to Australia in May 1995. It was renamed 'Proton Persona' in 1996, and continued on sale there until 2004. The Persona nameplate was also used for the Wira saloon in Chile.

It is the first Proton model to use the 'Persona' nameplate in its home market. The CM Persona is based on an extended Proton GEN‚Ä¢2 platform, and was sold as a saloon complement to the GEN‚Ä¢2 hatchback. The entire section aft of the B-pillar was re-engineered, and many of the GEN‚Ä¢2's flaws were addressed. Early models of the CM Persona were fitted with the 1.6-litre CamPro S4PH engine, but later models received the improved CamPro IAFM unit. The CM Persona would become a best-seller for Proton, selling over 40,000 units annually prior to the launch of the Proton Prev√©. Proton launched the Persona SE on 26 August 2008. It was pitched as a premium version of the existing CM Persona with exclusive kit and luxury equipment. The CM Persona received a major facelift in March 2010 with the launch of the Persona Elegance. The changes were largely cosmetic, and would set the Persona's exterior styling for the next six years. The final update to the CM series, the Persona SV, was launched in November 2013. The SV brought prices down and standardised all-round disc brakes and twin airbags.  Third generation (BH6; 2016‚Äìpresent)  The third generation Proton Persona (BH) was launched in August 2016. It is based on an extended Proton Iriz platform and shares the latter's 1.6-litre VVT engine and basic structure, but its exterior design has been completely re-engineered to give it a distinct persona. The interior of the BH Persona is largely unchanged over the Iriz, with the main exception of the new two-tier colour scheme. The BH Persona is one class smaller than the outgoing CM Persona, but it offers more headroom, comparable rear legroom and a significantly larger boot. The new BH is also more powerful, fuel efficient and sophisticated than the old CM. It is the latest model to carry Proton's newfound 'affordable safety' USP, and all BH Persona variants have been awarded the full five-star rating by ASEAN NCAP.

A nanoprobe is an optical device developed by tapering an optical fiber to a tip measuring 100 nm = 1000 angstroms wide. Also, a very thin coating of silver nanoparticles helps to enhance the Raman scattering effect of the light. (The phenomenon of light reflection from an object when illuminated by a laser light is referred to as Raman scattering.) The reflected light demonstrates vibration energies unique to each object (samples in this case), which can be characterised and identified. The silver nanoparticles in this technique provides for the rapid oscillations of electrons, adding to vibration energies, and thus enhancing Raman Scattering‚Äîcommonly known as surface- enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). These SERS nanoprobes produce higher electromagnetic fields enabling higher signal output‚Äîeventually resulting in accurate detection and analysis of samples. The term nanoprobe also refers more generically to any chemical or biological technique that deals with nanoquantitles, that is, introducing or extracting substances measured in nanoliters or nanograms rather than microliters or micrograms. For example: * Introducing nanoparticles in aqueous solution to serve as nanoprobes in electrospray ionization mass spectrometry * Extracting nanoquantities of neurochemicals via in vivo microdialysis * Using gold-based metallic nanoprobes for Theranostics (therapeutic diagnostics) In semiconductor manufacturing, nanoprobing is showing potential for conventional IC failure analysis and debugging, as well as for transistor design, circuit, and process development, and even for yield engineering.

Son of the rector of Copdock, Suffolk, and grandson of the 5th Lord Walsingham, he was educated at Eton College and became fluent in French and German. In 1907 he joined the publishing firm of William Heinemann. As he was shy and physically small, a colleague labelled him \\"the dormouse\\". World War I De Grey joined the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve and served in Belgium. In early 1915 he was transferred to Naval Intelligence Division, Room 40 codebreaking section. He, Dilly Knox and Reverend William Montgomery decrypted the Zimmermann Telegram on 17 January 1917. The Zimmermann Telegram was from the German foreign secretary Arthur Zimmermann to the German ambassador Heinrich von Eckardt in Mexico, telling him to offer the Mexican government the return of the states of Arizona, Texas and New Mexico as an inducement to Mexico to side with Germany against the United States. The public disclosure of this secret Mexican-German pact brought the US into World War I. De Grey was promoted and assigned to run the NID's Mediterranean section, liaise with the director of Italian naval intelligence and focus on Austrian cipher traffic. World War II In World War II Nigel de Grey was assigned to the \\"Government Code and Cypher School\\" (GC&CS;) at Bletchley Park, where he concentrated on German traffic encrypted on the Enigma cipher machine. In September 1941 he provided a report to the Prime Minister with the first references from German authorities to their own police battalions systematically levelling villages and removing their populations. One signal boasted of 30,000 executions \\"in the central area\\". Following a warning made in a speech to parliament by Churchill, a German circular in October 1941 cautioned that no further references to \\"sensitive operations\\" should be made on wireless channels. After World War II de Grey remained with GC&CS;, which became GCHQ in 1946. Eventually he became a deputy director and led a team working on Soviet cable traffic. He retired in 1951 and died a very short time later of a heart-attack in Oxford Street, London. His wife, whom he married in 1910, survived him.

A native of Kansas, Adams fought in World War II as an enlisted soldier. He was sent to Korea as a sergeant soon after the outbreak of war there, and was awarded the Medal of Honor for leading a bayonet charge against a numerically superior force in early 1951. Commissioned as an officer shortly after receiving the medal, Adams continued to serve into the Vietnam War, eventually retiring as a lieutenant colonel. Early life and World War II Stanley Taylor Adams was born in De Soto, Kansas, on May 9, 1922. He joined the U.S. Army from nearby in Olathe in 1942. During World War II, he was wounded in action while fighting in North Africa and Italy. Korean War After World War II, he served in Japan as part of the Allied occupation force. In July 1950, shortly after the onset of the Korean War, he was sent to South Korea as a sergeant first class with Company A of the 1st Battalion, 19th Infantry Regiment, 24th Division. In late January 1951, the Eighth Army, of which Adams' unit was a part, launched a counteroffensive against Chinese forces. Company A established a position south of Seoul near Sesim-ni on February 3, and Adams' platoon set up an outpost on a ridge forward of the rest of the company. At about 11:00 that night, enemy troops assaulted and pushed back the companies to either side of Company A, leaving the unit surrounded on three sides. Two hours later, in the early morning of February 4, Adams' forward platoon was attacked by about 250 soldiers. After 45 minutes under intense machine gun and mortar fire, the platoon withdrew to the main company position. Seeing that the opposing force could only be routed by close quarters fighting, Adams led 13 men from his platoon in a bayonet charge against approximately 150 enemy soldiers. He continued to fight in hand-to-hand combat for nearly an hour, despite being shot in the leg and knocked off his feet four times by grenades, until the hostile force began to retreat. When orders came for his battalion to withdraw, he stayed behind to provide covering fire. Adams was subsequently promoted to master sergeant and awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions during the battle. The medal was formally presented to him by President Harry S. Truman in a July 5, 1951, ceremony at the White House. Later years Shortly after receiving the Medal of Honor, Adams was commissioned as a second lieutenant. He retired in 1970 as a lieutenant colonel. He married Wava J. Ware Adams and they had a son, Gary. The marriage ended in divorce. He later married Penny DeGraff and they had a daughter, Joy. In 1981, he married Jean Elizabeth VanderStoep Adams, and was with her until his death. As a civilian, Adams lived in Alaska and worked as an administrator for the Internal Revenue Service there. He later moved to Bend, Oregon, and, after being diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, lived at the Oregon Veterans Home in The Dalles. He died in the veterans home on April 19, 1999, aged 76, and was buried at Willamette National Cemetery in Clackamas County. Adams' widow, Jean, donated his Medal of Honor to the Oregon Veterans Home, where it is displayed in the entryway. Upon her death in 2008, she left a substantial contribution of funds and memorabilia to the home. A multipurpose building, to be named the Stan & Jean Adams Veterans' Community Center, is currently under construction at the facility.

All but one of these stations are owned by the E. W. Scripps Company. Five of the full-powered MTN stations‚ÄîKTVQ, KXLF, KRTV, KPAX, and KTVH‚Äîcarry programming from The CW Plus on their digital subchannels. The MTN CBS affiliates each identify as separate stations, but use a two-way microwave system to share news stories. They are branded as \\"Montana's News Leader\\". History MTN can be traced back to 1955, when Montana broadcasting pioneer Joe Sample, owner of KOOK-TV (now KTVQ) in Billings, began sharing programs with KXLF-TV in Butte. KXLF had signed on three months before KOOK in 1953. KFBB-TV in Great Falls and KMSO-TV in Missoula (now KECI-TV) then began sharing programs with KOOK and KXLF in 1958. KXLJ-TV in Helena (now KTVH) signed on as a satellite of KXLF in 1958. The five stations joined two Idaho stations, KID-TV in Idaho Falls (now KIDK) and KMVT in Twin Falls- to form the Skyline Network. KXLJ exited the network in 1960, leaving it without a node in the capital. KMSO-TV left in 1964, leaving the network without a Missoula outlet. In 1966, KFBB left and Sample bought Great Falls' other station, KRTV. Former logo, used from 1972 to 2019. The Skyline Network stations were originally NBC affiliates but added CBS as a secondary affiliation shortly after the network launched. By 1960, the network had made CBS as the primary and NBC as the secondary affiliate. By 1969, however, affiliation changes made the network unworkable, and it shut down in September. In October, Sample reorganized the network as the Montana Television Network, comprising his three Montana stations. He bought KXLF in 1960 and added KPAX-TV in Missoula as a semi-satellite of KXLF. Sample owned the stations as part of his Garryowen Corporation until he sold them to SJL Broadcasting in 1984, who in turn sold them to Evening Post Industries in 1994. Evening Post ran the stations as part of its Cordillera Communications subsidiary. Combined, the stations and their translators reach 89% of Montana as well as portions of Wyoming. In 2015, Cordillera purchased KTVH-DT in Helena and its Great Falls satellite, KBGF, from Gray Television. The deal reunited KTVH with KTVQ and KXLF. The station, then known as KXLJ-TV had been a satellite of KXLF from its sign-on in 1958 to 1962. It made KTVH a sister station to KXLH-LD, a Helena-based full-time repeater of KRTV. On October 29, 2018, Cordillera announced the sale of the MTN stations to the E. W. Scripps Company as part of a $521 million deal to sell 15 of the 16 television stations that Cordillera owned to Scripps. The deal was completed on May 1, 2019.

Early life  Sa‚Äô√Æd ibn Hakam was born in the city of Tavira in the Algarve (modern Portugal). He studied philology at Seville, the capital of the Almohad Caliph of Al Andalus, and took part in literary reunions of famous poets. Al Andalus had been in a process of decadence primarily due to the downfall of the Abbasid Caliph which meant the closing of a vital commercial relationship. This situation brought a critical spiral of internal conflicts and external invasions. Because of the political instability in Al Andalus, Sa‚Äô√Æd ibn Hakam moved to North Africa, to the cities of Beja√Øa and Tunis, where he served as secretary to the Almohad governors.  Al-Motaserrif of Man√ªrqa  Two years later, he planned to return to Al Andalus, but the situation had worsened, so he was given refuge by the Almohad wali of Medina Mayurqa (Modern Majorca). He was then sent to Man√ªrqa as al-Motaserrif in 1227. His mission was to collect and administrate the taxes and command the army. In 1229, James I of Aragon invaded Mayurqa, but did not take any action at that moment against Man√ªrqa. By 1231, the resistance of Mayurqa‚Äôs Muslims was finally crushed and James I sent three ambassadors to Man√ªrqa, Berenguer de Santa Eugenia, Don Assalit de Gudar and Don Pere Ma√ßa, to negotiate its submission to the Kingdom of Aragon. James I, who at that time had a small number of troops, ordered fires to be set on the coast facing Man√ªrqa as to simulate a larger army and thus put more pressure on the Muslims. After a meeting between the Kadƒ´ Ab√ª ‚ÄòAbd Allah Muhammad, Sa‚Äô√Æd ibn Hakam, the sheiks and three hundred of the principal people of the island, they agreed to become vassals to the new King of Majorca. The treaty of Capdepera was signed on 17 June 1231. It was rumoured that Sa‚Äô√Æd ibn Hakam was the real instigator of the treaty with James I, although his role in the text of the treaty was discreet. The treaty gave wide political autonomy to the island and the military protection of the island by the King of Majorca in exchange for the payment of an annual tribute of three thousand quarters of wheat, a hundred cows and five hundred goats or sheep, later adding two ‚Äúquintals‚Äù (hundredweight) of fresh butter and two hundred bezants for leave to transport the cattle. Ab√ª ‚ÄòAbd Allah Muhammad was the new ruler of Man√ªrqa.  Rise to power  In July 1234, Sa‚Äô√Æd ibn Hakam took over power through an armed coup and negotiated a new treaty with James I, in which he ruled alone with the title of Ra‚Äô√Æs of Man√πrqa. This is believed to be the only time in the history of the island that it was an independent political entity, although tributary to the Kingdom of Majorca. Under his harsh rule, Man√ªrqa became an Islamic law-abiding structured state. It is said that he executed by beheading those Muslims found drunk. He constructed a strong political apparatus in Madina al Jazira (modern Ciutadella) with a council of ministers, secretaries and clan representatives, and a small military force consisting of mercenaries. His political shrewdness allowed for the survival of this Islamic entity while other Muslim territories fell to the Christian Reconquista: Cordoba (1236), his hometown Tavira (1242), and Seville (1248). Only the Kingdom of Granada remained independent, although vassal to the Kingdom of Castille. At the death of James I (1276), the Kingdom of Aragon was split in two: the Kingdom of Majorca (the Balearic Islands and counties of Roussillon and Cerdagne) went to his son James and the Kingdom of Aragon to his other son Peter. Man√ªrqa remained tributary to James II. This division would ultimately mean the fall of Man√ªrqa. Sa‚Äô√Æd ibn Hakam died in 1282 in Madina al Jazira, and his son Ab√ª 'Umar ibn Sa'√Æd became the next and last Ra‚Äô√Æs of Man√ªrqa. Sa‚Äô√Æd ibn Hakam was also an important Islamic intellectual figure of the 13th century, learned in Islamic law and medicine, philologist, grammarian and poet. He managed a great library at Madina al Jazira. Some samples of this collection are kept in the library of El Escorial.

Idrialite usually occurs as soft orthorhombic crystals, is usually greenish yellow to light brown in color with bluish fluorescence. It is named after the Idrija region of Slovenia, where its occurrence was first described. The mineral has also been called idrialine, and branderz in German It has also been called inflammable cinnabar due to its combustibility and association with cinnabar ores in the source locality. A mineral found in the Skaggs Springs location of California was described in 1925 and named curtisite, but was eventually found to consist of the same compounds as idrialite, in somewhat different amounts. Thus curtisite is now considered to be merely a variety of idrialite. Discovery and occurrence Idrialite was first described in 1832 for an occurrence in the Idrija region west of Ljubljana, northwestern Slovenia, mixed with clay, pyrite, quartz and gypsum associated with cinnabar. It also occurs at the Skaggs Springs location in Sonoma County, in western Lake County, and in the Knoxville Mine in Napa County, California. It has also been reported from localities in France, Slovakia and Ukraine. In the Skaggs Springs occurrence, the mineral occurs in a hot spring area of the Franciscan formation, around a vent in the sandstone that gave off inflammable gases. The mineral was described in 1925 and named \\"curtisite\\" after the local resident L. Curtis who called attention to it. The crystals are square or six sided flakes, 1 mm in diameter, yellow to pistachio green in transmitted light. It is associated with opaline silica, realgar (arsenic sulfide) and metacinnabarite (mercuric sulfide), which had been deposited in that order before it. Composition and properties The Curtisite variety is only slightly soluble in hot acetone, amyl acetate, butanol, petroleum ether. The solubility is 0.5% or less in hot carbon bisulfide, carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, diethyl ether, or boiling benzene; about 1.5% in toluene, about 2.5% in xylene, and over 10% in hot aniline. The material purified by repeated recrystallization melts at 360-370 C while turning very black. It sublimes giving very thin iridescent colors. Raman spectroscopy studies indicate that it may be a mixture of complex hydrocarbons including benzonaphthothiophenes (chemical formula: C16H10S) and dinaphthothiophenes (chemical formula: C20H12S). Curtisite and idrialite have been found to be unique complex mixtures of over 100 polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) consisting of six specific PAH structural series with each member of a series differing from the previous member by addition of another aromatic ring. The curtisite and idrialite samples contained many of the same components but in considerably different relative amounts. The major PAH constituents of the curtisite sample were: picene (a PAH with 5 fused benzene rings), dibenzo[a,h]fluorene, 11H-indeno[2,1-a]phenanthrene, benzo[b]phenanthro[2,1-d]thiophene, indenofluorenes, chrysene, and their methyl- and dimethyl-substituted homologues; the major components in the idrialite sample were higher- molecular-weight PAH, i.e. benzonaphthofluorenes (molecular weight 316), benzoindenofluorenes (MW 304) and benzopicene (MW 328), in addition to the compounds found in the curtisite sample. Curtisite is also associated with small amounts of a dark brown oil, that appears to be responsible for some of the yellow color and most of the fluorescence, and can be separated by recrystallization. Based on the composition, it was conjectured that the compounds were produced by medium-temperature pyrolysis of organic matter, then further modified by extended equilibration at elevated temperatures in the subsurface and by recrystallization during migration. When distilled, it produces the mineral wax idrialin. References \\"Curtisite\\" page at the Mindat.org online database.

In non-human primates it consists of the association cortex areas Brodmann area 11, 12 and 13; in humans it consists of Brodmann area 10, 11 and 47. The OFC is considered anatomically synonymous with the ventromedial prefrontal cortex.Phillips, LH., MacPherson, SE. & Della Sala, S. (2002). 'Age, cognition and emotion: the role of anatomical segregation in the frontal lobes: the role of anatomical segregation in the frontal lobes'. in J Grafman (ed.), Handbook of Neuropsychology: the frontal lobes. Elsevier Science, Amsterdam, pp. 73-98. Therefore, the region is distinguished due to the distinct neural connections and the distinct functions it performs.Barbas H, Ghashghaei H, Rempel-Clower N, Xiao D (2002) Anatomic basis of functional specialization in prefrontal cortices in primates. In: Handbook of Neuropsychology (Grafman J, ed), pp 1-27. Amsterdam: Elsevier Science B.V. It is defined as the part of the prefrontal cortex that receives projections from the medial dorsal nucleus of the thalamus, and is thought to represent emotion and reward in decision making.Fuster, J.M. The Prefrontal Cortex, (Raven Press, New York, 1997). It gets its name from its position immediately above the orbits in which the eyes are located. Considerable individual variability has been found in the OFC of humans. A related area is found in rodents. Structure The OFC is divided into multiple broad regions distinguished by cytoarchitecture, including brodmann area 47/12, brodmann area 11, brodmann area 14, brodmann area 13, and brodmann area 10. Four gyri are split by a complex of sulci that most frequently resembles a \\"H\\" or a \\"K\\" pattern. Extending along the rostro-caudal axis, two sulci, the lateral and orbital sulci, are usually connected by the transverse orbital sulcus, which extends along a medial-lateral axis. Most medially, the medial orbital gyrus is separated from the gyrus rectus by the olfactory sulcus. Anteriorly, both the gyrus rectus and the medial part of the medial orbital gyrus consist of area 11(m), and posteriorly, area 14. The posterior orbital gyrus consists mostly of area 13, and is bordered medially and laterally by the anterior limbs of the medial and lateral orbital sulci. Area 11 makes up a large part of the OFC involving both the lateral parts of the medial orbital gyrus as well as the anterior orbital gyrus. The lateral orbital gyrus consists mostly of area 47/12. Most of the OFC is granular, although the caudal parts of area 13 and area 14 are agranular. These caudal regions, which sometimes includes parts of the insular cortex, responds primarily to unprocessed sensory cues. Connections The connectivity of the OFC varies somewhat along a rostral- caudal axis. The caudal OFC is more heavily interconnected with sensory regions, notably receiving direct input from the pyriform cortex. The caudal OFC is also the most heavily interconnected with the amygdala. Rostrally, the OFC receives fewer direct sensory projections, and is less connected with the amygdala, but it is interconnected with the lateral prefrontal cortex and parahippocampus. The connectivity of the OFC has also been conceptualized as being composed of two networks; an orbital network composed of most of the central parts of the OFC, including most of areas 47/12, 13, and 11; a medial network composed of the medial most and caudolateral regions of the OFC, as well as areas 24, 25 and 32 of the medial prefrontal cortex. The medial and orbital networks are sometimes referred to as the \\"visceromotor network\\" and the \\"sensory network\\", respectively. =Afferents= The OFC receives projections from multiple sensory modalities. The primary olfactory cortex, gustatory cortex, secondary somatosensory cortex, superior and inferior temporal gyrus(conveying visual information) all project to the OFC. Evidence for auditory inputs is weak, although some neurons respond to auditory stimuli, indicating an indirect projection may exist. The OFC also receives input from the medial dorsal nucleus, insular cortex, entorhinal cortex, perirhinal cortex, hypothalamus, and amygdala. =Efferents= The orbitofrontal cortex is reciprocally connected with the perirhinal and entorhinal cortices, the amygdala, the hypothalamus, and parts of the medial temporal lobe. In addition to these outputs, the OFC also projects to the striatum, including the nucleus accumbens, caudate nucleus, and ventral putamen, as well as regions of the midbrain including the periaqueductal grey, and ventral tegmental area. OFC inputs to the amygdala synapse on multiple targets, including two robust pathways to the basolateral amygdala and intercalated cells of the amygdala, as well as a weaker direct projection to the central nucleus of the amygdala. Function Multiple functions have been ascribed to the OFC including mediating context specific responding, encoding contingencies in a flexible manner, encoding value, encoding inferred value, inhibiting responses, learning changes in contingency, emotional appraisal, altering behavior through somatic markers, driving social behavior, and representing state spaces. While most of these theories explain certain aspects of electrophysiological observations and lesion related changes in behavior, they often fail to explain, or are contradicted by other findings. One proposal that explains the variety of OFC functions is that the OFC encodes state spaces, or the discrete configuration of internal and external characteristics associated with a situation and its contingencies For example, the proposal that the OFC encodes economic value may be a reflection of the OFC encoding task state value. The representation of task states could also explain the proposal that the OFC acts as a flexible map of contingencies, as a switch in task state would enable the encoding of new contingencies in one state, with the preservation of old contingencies in a separate state, enabling switching contingencies when the old task state becomes relevant again. The representation of task states is supported by electrophysiological evidence demonstrating that the OFC responds to a diverse array of task features, and is capable of rapidly remapping during contingency shifts. The representation of task states may influence behavior through multiple potential mechanisms. For example, the OFC is necessary for ventral tegmental area (VTA) neurons to produce a dopaminergic reward prediction error, and the OFC may encode expectations for computation of RPEs in the VTA. Specific functions have been ascribed to subregions of the OFC. The lateral OFC has been proposed to reflect potential choice value, enabling fictive(counterfactual) prediction errors to potentially mediate switching choices during reversal, extinction and devaluation. Optogenetic activation of the lOFC enhances goal directed over habitual behavior, possibly reflecting increased sensitivity to potential choices and therefore increased switching. The mOFC, on the other hand, has been proposed to reflect relative subjective value. In rodents, a similar function has been ascribed to the mOFC, encoding action value in a graded fashion, while the lOFC has been proposed to encode specific sensory features of outcomes. The lOFC has also been proposed to encode stimulus outcome associations, which are then compared by value in the mOFC. Meta analysis of neuroimaging studies in humans reveals that a medial- lateral valence gradient exists, with the medial OFC responding most often to reward, and the lateral OFC responding most often to punishment. A posterior- anterior abstractness gradient was also found, with the posterior OFC responding to more simple reward, and the anterior OFC responding more to abstract rewards. Similar results were reported in a meta analysis of studies on primary versus secondary rewards. The OFC and basolteral amygdala (BLA) are highly interconnected, and their connectivity is necessary for devaluation tasks. Damage to either the BLA or the OFC before, but only the OFC after devaluation impairs performance. While the BLA only responds to cues predicting salient outcomes in a graded fashion in accordance with value, the OFC responds to both value and the specific sensory attributes of cue-outcome associations. While OFC neurons that, early in learning, respond to outcome receipt normally transfer their response to the onset of cues that predict the outcome, damage to the BLA impairs this form of learning. The posterior orbitofrontal cortex (pOFC) is connected to the amygdala via multiple paths, that are capable of both upregulating and downregulating autonomic nervous system activity. Tentative evidence suggests that the neuromodulator dopamine plays a role in mediating the balance between the inhibitory and excitatory pathways, with a high dopamine state driving autonomic activity. It has been suggested that the medial OFC is involved in making stimulus-reward associations and with the reinforcement of behavior, while the lateral OFC is involved in stimulus-outcome associations and the evaluation and possibly reversal of behavior. Activity in the lateral OFC is found, for example, when subjects encode new expectations about punishment and social reprisal. The mid-anterior OFC has been found to consistently track subjective pleasure in neuroimaging studies. A hedonic hotspot has been discovered in the anterior OFC, which is capable of enhancing liking response to sucrose. The OFC is also capable of biasing the affective responses induced by Œ±-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) antagonism in the nucleus accumbens towards appetitive responses. The OFC is capable of modulating aggressive behavior via a projections to interneurons in the amygdala that inhibit glutaminergic projections to the ventromedial hypothalamus. Electrophysiology Neurons in the OFC respond both to primary reinforcers, as well as cues that predict rewards across multiple sensory domains. The evidence for responses to visual, gustatory, somatosensory, and olfactory stimuli is robust, but evidence for auditory responses are weaker. In a subset of OFC neurons, neural responses to rewards or reward cues are modulated by individual preference and by internal motivational states such as hunger. A fraction of neurons that respond to sensory cues predicting a reward are selective for reward, and exhibit reversal behavior when cue outcome relationships are swapped. Neurons in the OFC also exhibit responses to the absence of an expected reward, and punishment. Another population of neurons exhibits responses to novel stimuli and can ‚Äúremember‚Äù familiar stimuli for up to a day. During cued reward or cued instrumental reward tasks, neurons in the OFC exhibit three general patterns of firing; firing in response to cues; firing before reward receipt; firing in response to reward receipt. In contrast to the medial prefrontal cortex and striatum, OFC neurons do not exhibit firing mediating by movement. Their reward-predictive responses are, however, shaped by attention: when shifting attention between two alternatives, the same OFC population will represent positively the value of a currently attended item, but negatively the value of the unattended item. The encoding of reward magnitude is also flexible, and takes into account the relative values of present rewards. Humans The human OFC is among the least-understood regions of the human brain; but it has been proposed that the OFC is involved in sensory integration, in representing the affective value of reinforcers, and in decision-making and expectation. In particular, the OFC seems to be important in signaling the expected rewards/punishments of an action given the particular details of a situation. In doing this, the brain is capable of comparing the expected reward/punishment with the actual delivery of reward/punishment, thus, making the OFC critical for adaptive learning. This is supported by research in humans, non-human primates, and rodents. Psychiatric disorders The orbitofrontal cortex has been implicated in borderline personality disorder, schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, addiction, post-traumatic stress disorder, Autism, and panic disorder. Although neuroimaging studies have provided evidence for dysfunction in a wide variety of psychiatric disorders, the enigmatic nature of the OFCs role in behavior complicates the understanding of its role in the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders. The function of the OFC is not known, but its anatomical connections with the ventral striatum, amygdala, hypothalamus, hippocampus, and periaqueductal grey support a role in mediating reward and fear related behaviors. Obsessive compulsive disorder Meta analyses of neuroimaging studies in OCD report hyperactivity in areas generally considered to be part of the orbitofrontal segment of the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loop such as the caudate nucleus, thalamus and orbitofrontal cortex. OCD has been proposed to reflect a positive feedback loop due to mutual excitation of the OFC and subcortical structures. While the OFC is usually overactive during symptom provocation tasks, cognitive tasks usually elicit hypoactivity of the OFC; this may reflect a distinction between emotional and non emotional tasks, lateral and medial OFC, or simply just inconsistent methodologies. Addiction Animal models, and cell specific manipulations in relation to drug seeking behavior implicate dysfunction of the OFC in addiction. Substance use disorders are associated with a variety of deficits related to flexible goal directed behavior and decision making. These deficits overlap with symptoms related to OFC lesions, and are also associated with reduced orbitofrontal grey matter, resting state hypometabolism, and blunted OFC activity during tasks involving decision making or goal directed behavior. In contrast to resting state and decision related activity, cues associated with drugs evoke robust OFC activity that correlates with craving. Rodent studies also demonstrate that lOFC to BLA projections are necessary for cue induced reinstatement of self administration. These findings are all congruent with the role that the OFC plays in encoding the outcomes associated with certain stimuli. The progression towards compulsive substance abuse may reflect a shift between model based decision making, where an internal model of future outcomes guides decisions, to model free learning, where decisions are based on reinforcement history. Model based learning involves the OFC and is flexible and goal directed, while model free learning is more rigid; as shift to more model free behavior due to dysfunction in the OFC, like that produced by drugs of misuse, could underlie drug seeking habits. Behavioral disorders Conduct disorder is associated with both structural abnormalities, and functional abnormalities during affective tasks. Abnormalities in OFC structure, activity, and functional connectivity have all been observed in association with aggression. Affective disorders Neuroimaging studies have found abnormalities in the OFC in both MDD and bipolar disorder. Consistent with the medial/reward and lateral/punishment gradient found in neuroimaging studies, some neuroimaging studies have observed elevated lateral OFC activity in depression, as well as reduced interconnectivity of the medial OFC, and enhanced interconnectivity in the lateral OFC. Hypoactivity of the lateral OFC has been frequently observed in bipolar disorder, in particular during manic episodes. Research=Imaging Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to image the human OFC is a challenge, because this brain region is in proximity to the air-filled sinuses. This means that artifact errors can occur in the signal processing, causing for example geometric distortions that are common when using echo-planar imaging (EPI) at higher magnetic field strengths. Extra care is therefore recommended for obtaining a good signal from the orbitofrontal cortex, and a number of strategies have been devised, such as automatic shimming at high static magnetic field strengths. Rodents In rodents, the OFC is entirely agranular or dysgranular. The OFC is divided into ventrolateral (VLO), lateral (LO), medial (MO) and dorsolateral (DLO) regions. Using highly specific techniques to manipulate circuitry, such as optogenetics, the OFC has been implicated in OCD like behaviors, and in the ability to use latent variables in decision making task. Clinical significance=Damage Destruction of the OFC through acquired brain injury typically leads to a pattern of disinhibited behaviour. Examples include swearing excessively, hypersexuality, poor social interaction, compulsive gambling, drug use (including alcohol and tobacco), and poor empathising ability. Disinhibited behaviour by patients with some forms of frontotemporal dementia is thought to be caused by degeneration of the OFC. Disruption When OFC connections are disrupted, a number of cognitive, behavioral, and emotional consequences may arise. Research supports that the main disorders associated with dysregulated OFC connectivity/circuitry center around decision-making, emotion regulation, and reward expectation. A recent multi-modal human neuroimaging study shows disrupted structural and functional connectivity of the OFC with the subcortical limbic structures (e.g., amygdala or hippocampus) and other frontal regions (e.g., dorsal prefrontal cortex or anterior cingulate cortex) correlates with abnormal OFC affect (e.g., fear) processing in clinically anxious adults. One clear extension of problems with decision-making is drug addiction/substance dependence, which can result from disruption of the striato-thalamo-orbitofrontal circuit. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has also been implicated in dysfunction of neural reward circuitry controlling motivation, reward, and impulsivity, including OFC systems. Other disorders of executive functioning and impulse control may be affected by OFC circuitry dysregulation, such as obsessive‚Äìcompulsive disorder and trichotillomania Some dementias are also associated with OFC connectivity disruptions. The behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia is associated with neural atrophy patterns of white and gray matter projection fibers involved with OFC connectivity. Finally, some research suggests that later stages of Alzheimer's Disease be impacted by altered connectivity of OFC systems. Orbitofrontal epilepsy Orbitofrontal epilepsy is rare, but does occur. The presentation of OFC epilepsy is fairly diverse, although common characteristics include being sleep related, automatisms, and hypermotor symptoms. One review reported that auras were generally not common or nonspecific, while another reported that OFC epilepsy was associated auras involving somatosensory phenomenon and fear. AssessmentVisual discrimination test= The visual discrimination test has two components. In the first component, \\"reversal learning\\", participants are presented with one of two pictures, A and B. They learn that they will be rewarded if they press a button when picture A is displayed, but punished if they press the button when picture B is displayed. Once this rule has been established, the rule swaps. In other words, now it is correct to press the button for picture B, not picture A. Most healthy participants pick up on this rule reversal almost immediately, but patients with OFC damage continue to respond to the original pattern of reinforcement, although they are now being punished for persevering with it. Rolls et al. noted that this pattern of behaviour is particularly unusual given that the patients reported that they understood the rule. The second component of the test is \\"extinction\\". Again, participants learn to press the button for picture A but not picture B. However this time, instead of the rules reversing, the rule changes altogether. Now the participant will be punished for pressing the button in response to either picture. The correct response is not to press the button at all, but people with OFC dysfunction find it difficult to resist the temptation to press the button despite being punished for it. =Iowa Gambling Task= A simulation of real life decision-making, the Iowa gambling task is widely used in cognition and emotion research. Participants are presented with four virtual decks of cards on a computer screen. They are told that each time they choose a card they stand to win some game money. They are told that the aim of the game is to win as much money as possible. Every so often, however, when they choose a card they will lose some money. The task is meant to be opaque, that is, participants are not meant to consciously work out the rule, and they are supposed to choose cards based on their \\"gut reaction.\\" Two of the decks are \\"bad decks\\", which means that, over a long enough time, they will make a net loss; the other two decks are \\"good decks\\" and will make a net gain over time. Most healthy participants sample cards from each deck, and after about 40 or 50 selections are fairly good at sticking to the good decks. Patients with OFC dysfunction, however, continue to perseverate with the bad decks, sometimes even though they know that they are losing money overall. Concurrent measurement of galvanic skin response shows that healthy participants show a \\"stress\\" reaction to hovering over the bad decks after only 10 trials, long before conscious sensation that the decks are bad. By contrast, patients with OFC dysfunction never develop this physiological reaction to impending punishment. Bechara and his colleagues explain this in terms of the somatic marker hypothesis. The Iowa gambling task is currently being used by a number of research groups using fMRI to investigate which brain regions are activated by the task in healthy volunteers as well as clinical groups with conditions such as schizophrenia and obsessive compulsive disorder. The faux pas test is a series of vignettes recounting a social occasion during which someone said something that should not have been said, or an awkward occurrence. The participant's task is to identify what was said that was awkward, why it was awkward, how people would have felt in reaction to the faux pas and to a factual control question. Although first designed for use in people on the autism spectrum, the test is also sensitive to patients with OFC dysfunction, who cannot judge when something socially awkward has happened despite appearing to understand the story perfectly well.

In 1906 the Russo-Japanese war was being waged and two names stood out, Admiral Togo of the Japanese fleet and Admiral Makaroff of Russia. In 1906 Pelly Siding was incorporated as a village and renamed Togo after the Japanese admiral, and the next community to the east on the CNR line (5 miles) was named Makaroff (Manitoba) in honour of the Russian admiral. Despite the small population, Togo has a post office, Lutheran church, curling/skating rink, drop-in centre. Besides farming, local activities include fishing (see: Lake of the Prairies) or playing hockey. There used to be several grain elevators located just off the railway. NHL player Ted Hampson is from the village. Reginald John Marsden Parker from Togo served as the Lieutenant Governor of Saskatchewan. Togo station receives Via Rail service. In April 2013, a passenger train derailed near the village. No one was injured.  History  Togo incorporated as a village on September 4, 1906.

Subtle influences may include exploration of new, lawless frontiers, while more overt influences may feature literal cowboys in outer space who use rayguns and ride robotic horses. Although initially popular, a strong backlash against perceived hack writing caused the genre to become a subtler influence until the 1980s, when it regained popularity. A further critical reappraisal occurred in the 2000s with Firefly and Cowboy Bebop.  Setting  A space Western may emphasize space exploration as \\"the final frontier\\". These Western themes may be explicit, such as cowboys in outer space, or they can be a more subtle influence in space opera. Gene Roddenberry described Star Trek: The Original Series as a space Western (or more poetically, as \\"Wagon Train to the stars\\"). Firefly and its cinematic follow-up Serenity literalized the Western aspects of the genre popularized by Star Trek: it used frontier towns, horses, and the styling of classic John Ford Westerns. Worlds that have been terraformed may be depicted as presenting similar challenges as that of a frontier settlement in a classic Western. Six-shooters and horses may be replaced by ray guns and rockets.  History  Rear cover of first issue of Galaxy featuring criticism of the space Western subgenre Westerns influenced early science-fiction pulp magazines. Writers would submit stories in both genres, and science-fiction magazines sometimes mimicked Western cover art to showcase parallels. In the 1930s, C. L. Moore created one of the first space Western heroes, Northwest Smith. Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon were also early influences. After superhero comics declined in popularity in 1940s America, Western comics and horror comics replaced them. When horror comics became untenable with the Comics Code Authority in the mid-1950s, science-fiction themes and space Westerns grew more popular. By the mid-1960s, classic Western films fell out of favor and Revisionist Westerns supplanted them. Science- fiction series such as Lost in Space and Star Trek presented a new frontier to be explored, and films like Westworld rejuvenated Westerns by updating them with science-fiction themes. Peter Hyams, director of Outland, said that studio heads in the 1980s were unwilling to finance a Western, so he made a space Western instead. Space operas such as the Star Wars film series also took strong cues from Westerns; Boba Fett, Han Solo and the Mos Eisley cantina, in particular, were based on Western themes. These science fiction- films and television series offered the themes and morals that Westerns previously did. This frontier view of the future is only one of many ways to look at space exploration, and not one embraced by all science-fiction writers. The Turkey City Lexicon, a document produced by the Turkey City science-fiction writers' workshop, condemns the space Western as the \\"most pernicious\\" form of a pre-established background that avoids the necessity of creating a fresh world. Galaxy Science Fiction ran an advertisement on its back cover, \\"You'll never see it in Galaxy\\", which gave the beginnings of make-believe parallel Western and science-fiction stories featuring a character named Bat Durston. Such scathing attacks on the subgenre, along with further attacks on space operas, caused a perception that all space Westerns were by definition hack writing and not \\"true\\" science fiction. Although the underlying themes remained influential, this bias persisted until the 1980s, when the release of the film Outland and children's cartoons such as Bravestarr and The Adventures of the Galaxy Rangers re-popularized explicit themes of cowboys in space. In the late 1990s, anime series such as Cowboy Bebop and manga such as Outlaw Star and Trigun became prime examples of the genre. In the 2000s, Firefly won critical acclaim, further causing a critical reassessment of space Westerns. Games such as StarCraft, the Borderlands series, Exoplanet: First Contact and The Outer Worlds have also popularized the space Western theme. In the 2010s, shows such as Westworld and The Mandalorian have continued the space Western theme.

On the nearby 8th Concession Road, just off Centre Rd. lies Somerset Farm Store where locals and visitors can pick up fresh produce and homemade pies. West Avenue Cider is part of the Somerset Orchard family. Carlisle downtown The Carlisle Golf & Country Club is a 27-hole public golf course that is part of the KANEFF group which also has various golf courses across the Golden Horseshoe, including Lionhead, Royal Niagara, Century Pines, and Royal Ontario. Carlisle was once host to Bluegrass Canada, a Folk Festival which kicked off the beginning of every summer. The festival was famed throughout the province and attracted talent and participants from across Canada and the US. Carlisle was also home to an Ostrich Farm, but the animals were deemed too dangerous for the growing area. Carlisle is where you will find Progreston Falls under the rumbling of an active freight train trellis. Parks and recreation Carlisle has numerous soccer fields, parks, baseball diamonds, and small forests. Courtcliffe Park is a naturalized area with streams, bridges, walkways and trails. There are four middle-sized soccer fields and one mini soccer field in the park, as well as ample parking. This park also contains swings, and non-traditional play equipment designed for 5-12 year olds, although 9-14 year olds find it particularly attractive because it challenges them. The Carlisle Conservation Area is located within the Village of Carlisle along Bronte Creek, east and west of Centre Road, and is administered by Conservation Halton. Trout were stocked in this reach of the creek in the 1970s. Existing fishing opportunities are generally restricted to pumpkinseed, creek chub and white sucker; however, largemouth bass, northern pike and brown trout may also be angled in the slow-moving waters. A parking lot to the north of Bronte Creek off Centre Road provides excellent access to this area where you can easily drop your canoe or kayak in the water, or simply fish off the bridge. Education Two elementary schools serve the students of Carlisle, both of which are located at the intersection of Centre Road and Concession Road 10 E, just north of the town proper. Carlisle downtown, Community Hall Balaclava Elementary School is a K-8 public school administered by the Hamilton-Wentworth District School Board Our Lady of Mount Carmel Catholic Elementary School is a pre K- grade 8 catholic school and daycare centre. It is administered by the Hamilton-Wentworth Catholic District School Board Upon graduation, students from these schools may go on to attend Waterdown District High School or St. Mary Catholic Secondary School (Hamilton, Ontario) Community Carlisle is a diverse community filled with individuals who have settled in the region from all over the world. The town is considered to be very humble and accepting. Most homeowners are families with younger children, as there are many recreational parks in the area. There are stores, businesses and agricultural supply shops that serve the local population. Major construction in Waterdown, Ontario in 2016 resulted in an increase in traffic in the neighborhood as individuals sought to travel the least busy commuter routes, while having an easy access to stores like the local LCBO Agency. Film and television The Bates & Green gas station (no longer a gas station, but a full-service garage and Napa Auto supplier) has been used as a filming location for scenes from the Canadian comedy series The Red Green Show, as well as motion pictures. The Carlisle Public Arena has been used on at least one occasion for the filming of a major motion picture. Carlisle General Store was used in the film The Ref.

Founded in 1871, the Academy currently enrolls 1,478 students in sixth through twelfth grade, with the majority of students coming from the Providence metropolitan area. History La Salle Academy had its beginnings in 1871 as an elementary school for boys in downtown Providence. The school served the boys of the Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul and Saint John parishes and was staffed by a diocesan priest, a layman, and three De La Salle Christian Brothers. The school became known as the ‚ÄúBrothers‚Äô School‚Äù and was renamed La Salle Academy when its status was changed from an elementary school to an academy. The early years were ones of happy growth and steady expansion. As the school gained a reputation for its outstanding educational program, the building at the intersection of Broadway and Fountain Street could no longer accommodate the demand. The Bishop of Providence authorized the building of a new school closer to the city limits. The present structure was dedicated on September 21, 1925. The La Salle name was not lost in downtown Providence, however, for the major intersection near the site of the old school is familiar to Rhode Islanders as ‚ÄúLa Salle Square.‚Äù The new building saw notable achievement in many areas. The band and drama programs flourished. Athletic programs, especially football, hockey, and track were widely acclaimed. And La Salle began to see numbers of its graduates achieve prominence in the Church, in education, in government, in business, and in the arts. In 1983 the Bishop of Providence announced a plan which merged La Salle Academy with St. Mary Academy of the Visitation and St. Patrick High School, two all-girls schools. Six years later, in 1989, another significant development occurred: the governance of the school was transferred from the Diocese of Providence to a newly formed, independent, non-profit corporation comprising six De La Salle Christian Brothers, which has full authority over the management and operation of the Academy. Recent developments have included the establishment of a transition program, for students who need a closely monitored program in the development of academic success; PEGASUS 7/8 Program for gifted seventh and eighth-graders and the matching PEGASUS 9-12 Program for gifted high school students; the McLaughlin Athletic Center (2000); the Brother Michael McKenery Arts Center (2000); and the Shea Science and Student Center (2004). The Pegasus 7/8 Program was discontinued in 2017 in favor of a 6-8 middle school. It is called De La Salle, and is home to roughly 200 students. In 1991 the U.S. Department of Education designated La Salle Academy as a Blue Ribbon Exemplary School. Campus facilities *Main Building ‚Äì The largest and oldest academic building on campus, dedicated in 1925 when the Academy moved from its location in downtown Providence to the current location in the Elmhurst neighborhood. It houses most of the classroom facilities as well as the library, computer labs, administrative offices, and the college counseling center. The first floor of one wing is devoted to the De La Salle Middle School (6,7,8). *Brothers' Chapel ‚Äì The campus chapel in which daily mass is celebrated. *Brothers' Residence ‚Äì Home to the members of the De La Salle Christian Brothers who teach at the school as well as the brothers who have retired from teaching. The Brothers' Residence also includes the Office of the President and the Alumni Center. *McLaughlin Athletic Center ‚Äì Includes a field house with three multi-use courts, men's and women's locker rooms, weightlifting facilities, a dance studio, and classrooms. (completed in 2000) *Brother Michael McKenery Arts Center ‚Äì Includes a state-of-the-art theatre, as well as studio and rehearsal space for the fine and performing arts. It also has a photography lab, television studio, and video editing facilities. (completed in 2000) *Shea Science and Student Center ‚Äì Connected to the main building by a two-story footbridge, it houses all of the laboratory classrooms for the sciences, a dining hall, school store, and campus ministry office. (completed in 2004) *Cimini Stadium ‚Äì Home to the men's and women's soccer and lacrosse teams as well as the men's football team. *Cronin Field ‚Äì Home to the men's baseball team. *Other athletic facilities include the softball field, practice fields for football and lacrosse, and six tennis courts. The golf team's home course is Alpine Country Club in Cranston, Rhode Island. The cross country home course is currently at Colt State Park in Bristol, Rhode Island. The fields were fully completed in fall of the 2011‚Äì2012 school year. Athletics La Salle's 64 teams in 18 sports are referred to as the Rams for men's sports, and the Lady Rams for women's sports. Nearly all teams compete in Division I of the Rhode Island Interscholastic League (RIIL). La Salle Academy was noted in May 2005 by Sports Illustrated magazine for having the best athletic program in Rhode Island. The La Salle Rams Football team has been successful winning the State Championship In 2008 and most recently in 2017. The men's soccer team won six consecutive state championship titles from 2000 to 2005, and the women's soccer team won five consecutive titles from 2001 to 2005. In addition, the gymnastics team has secured ten consecutive state titles (2003‚Äì2012), with New England Championship titles in 2003 and 2009. The men's lacrosse team won 8 consecutive state championship, from 2012, to 2019. Since 2013, the men's cross country team has won three consecutive New England Championship titles, and 5 in the last seven years. This has lead to two berths to compete at the 2014 Nike Cross Nationals as well as the 2019 events in Beaverton, Oregon. They finished 18th, and 6th respectively. The women's team has had equal success, winning eight states cross country titles and going to Nike Cross Nationals in 2009, 2015 (9th), and 2016 (18th). The women's track teams won the 4x1Mile relay at New Balance Nationals in 2015 indoors, 2015 outdoors, 2016 indoors, and was runner up in 2016 outdoors. La Salle's sports rivals are other Rhode Island independent, Roman Catholic schools including Bishop Hendricken High School, Mount Saint Charles Academy, and St. Mary Academy - Bay View. East Providence High School is La Salle's traditional opponent in a Thanksgiving Day football rivalry that dates back to 1929.

Written in 1998, it is set mainly in Trenton, but also includes Point Pleasant and Atlantic City. Plot summary Stephanie is infuriated to learn that her boss/cousin, Vinnie, has hired her arch-rival Joyce Barnhardt as another bounty hunter. Vinnie tells her to \\"be professional\\" and focus on tracking down her latest FTA: Maxine Nowicki, a waitress accused of stealing her ex- boyfriend's car and jumping bail. Eddie gives Stephanie a coded message from Maxine, that references some \\"property\\", and explains that Maxine has some embarrassing love letters he once wrote to her, and promises Stephanie an extra $1,000 to let him talk to Maxine before she delivers her to the cops, which Stephanie agrees to. Looking for help cracking the codes from her neighbors, one of them steers her to a nephew, Salvatore Sweet, who has a knack for such things. \\"Sally\\" is an aspiring rock musician who made his big breakthrough performing in drag. With Sally's help, Stephanie decodes the message, which leads her to the second, and third, and so on. Maxine's trail takes Stephanie and her hangers-on‚ÄîSally, former-prostitute-turned-backup Lula, and even Stephanie's Grandma Mazur‚Äîall over Trenton, to Point Pleasant, and even to Atlantic City. Stephanie encounters Maxine several times, but never manages to capture her. Along the way she interviews Maxine's mother and her friend Margie, learning that someone else has been visiting them and demanding Maxine's whereabouts, going so far as to scalp Mrs. Nowicki and cut off one of Margie's fingers. Alarmingly, someone is stalking Stephanie, leaving threatening notes warning her to stay away from their boyfriend. When the stalker throws a firebomb through Stephanie's bedroom window, Stephanie is thankfully not home, but her apartment is almost entirely destroyed. In fright, she takes her hamster, Rex, and goes to stay with Morelli at his house, and she and Morelli finally resume their intimate relationship. The stalker is found to be Sugar, who Stephanie and Morelli apprehend at a nightclub. One of Eddie's friends confides to Stephanie that Eddie passed him a counterfeit $20 bill, and Morelli admits that he has been working with the U.S. Treasury, monitoring a suspected counterfeiter in the area. When Eddie Kuntz disappears, Stephanie talks to his Uncle Leo and Aunt Betty, who appear unconcerned and refuse to answer any questions. A bit later Stephanie goes snooping through Leo and Betty's basement, and finds a corpse wrapped in a garbage bag. Leo and Betty catch her and are about to kill her, when Lula distracts them with a gunshot through the window, allowing Stephanie to run and call for help. At the same time the police arrive to arrest Betty and Leo, Eddie Kuntz appears, having been kidnapped by Maxine and released after being tattooed with derogatory slogans. A tip from Eddie's friend sends Stephanie and Lula to the airport, intercepting Maxine before she can leave the country. Joyce Barnhardt actually makes the apprehension first, but Stephanie and Lula, deciding they have earned the \\"collar\\", tase Joyce and leave her unconscious behind the wheel of her car. Mrs. Nowicki and Margie are also waiting at the airport, but Stephanie lets them go, since she has no authority to detain them. Morelli reports that the investigation has turned out very well for the police: Leo is a retired enforcer for the mob in Detroit; twenty years ago, he stole a set of well-made counterfeiting plates and later decided to set up business in Trenton, washing the money through a dry cleaner's owned by another ex-Mafioso. Eddie helped with the counterfeiting, and couldn't resist bragging to Maxine about what a \\"big shot\\" he was. Maxine was once in love with Eddie, but he was abusive and unfaithful, and she planned the perfect revenge: after she was bailed out of jail for stealing his car, she pretended to make up with Eddie, persuaded him to show her the plates, then stole them. The coded messages were a game to torment Eddie, who was desperate to get the plates back, but Maxine did not anticipate that Leo would go hunting for her himself, including mutilating her mother and Margie. He also killed his partner, the dry cleaner (the body Stephanie found in his basement). Eventually, Maxine demanded $1 million in genuine money in exchange for the plates, and Leo complied. Maxine was planning to leave the country with her mother and Margie when Stephanie caught up with her. Stephanie and Morelli's sympathies are firmly with Maxine, and Morelli adds that no additional charges will likely be pressed against Maxine‚Äîthere is no evidence of the blackmail, and Eddie is too humiliated to prosecute her for kidnapping‚Äîso Maxine will likely serve a short jail sentence for the original auto theft charge, and then be free to join Mrs. Nowicki and Margie and enjoy her million dollars. Morelli invites Stephanie for a celebratory ride on his Ducati motorcycle. Stephanie, afraid of being relegated to the \\"helpless female\\" role in their burgeoning relationship, demands that he make the ultimate concession and let her drive. Morelli concedes, but says she will owe him later.

It was written in 1999. Plot summary The only Failure-to- Appear (F.T.A.) Vinnie has for Stephanie is so minor league (Briggs), that she focuses her attention on the mysterious disappearance of her Uncle Fred instead. Mabel gives Stephanie some photos she found in Fred's desk of half- opened garbage bags, containing dismembered human body parts. She insists the photos are recent, and very unusual for Fred. Stephanie sees enough to identify the body as a woman's, and gives duplicates of them to her on- again/off-again boyfriend, Detective Joe Morelli, who passes them on to the sergeant in charge of the case. Mabel tells Stephanie that Fred had been furiously pursuing RCG Waste Haulers to get his $2 back because they skipped picking up garbage at his house one time. RCG (Ruben, Grizolli, and Cotell) had refused to refund him, because his payment wasn't in the system - they demanded to see his cancelled check. He was on his way to bring a copy of that to RCG when he disappeared. While Stephanie is starting to look into Fred's activities, Bunchy shows up, mysteriously demanding that Stephanie find Fred for him. Since the Fred mystery is on her own personal time, Stephanie is facing financial hardship and out of desperation she takes a job with Ranger's security company to make ends meet. Ranger assures her the jobs are morally justifiable, if not entirely legal, but Stephanie is (again) over her head while tagging along with Ranger's men. The activities start with \\"Interior decorating\\" -forcibly evicting the occupants of a drug den in a slum apartment building - which ends up in an explosion when the main being evicted is shot by an old lady in a pink nightgown, and the explosives he has attached to himself go off. Further activities include chauffeuring a sheikh; and distracting a deadbeat in a bar while his car is repossessed. To add to all of Stephanie's problems, Morelli informs her that Benito Ramirez, the psychopathic boxer who attacked Lula and threatened her in One for the Money has been released from prison thanks to the work of expensive lawyers. Ramirez begins stalking her again, playing his game of psychological torture with her. Meanwhile, Ranger lets her use a Porsche Turbo as a \\"company car\\" while working for him, which is both exciting and nerve-wracking. On the Morelli front, she is trying to keep her distance because of their relationship goals mismatch, but seeing him with Terry Gilman makes her see red. Fred's disappearance looks increasingly serious when RCG's receptionist Martha is found shot to death. The next day another employee, Larry Lipinski, apparently commits suicide, leaving behind a note confessing to the Martha's murder. John Curly - an employee at the cable company accused of ripping off customers - was hit by a truck. Stephanie matched the gruesome garbage photos partially to the picture of Larry and his wife used at his memorial, especially since she had 'mysteriously disappeared' around the same time. Stephanie, Grandma Mazur and Bunchy question the wife of the guy being cheated by the cable company, and found out John Curly had taken all the related cancelled checks. Further investigating reveals that both the cable company and RCG are routing a small percentage of customer payments to a different bank - skimming funds for personal use. While she is investigating, a bomb blows up the Porsche, thankfully without hurting anyone. She shares her suspicions with Morelli, who confirms that the Trenton Police and federal authorities are investigating the same crimes. Vito Grizzoli is co-owner of the garbage company, so at first the police suspected money laundering, then they realized that someone is skimming from Vito's profits. Vito is cooperating with the investigation, but prefers to keep the police at arm's length, so he uses Terry (his niece) and Morelli as intermediaries. \\"Bunchy\\" is actually a federal agent named Bronfman, who thinks that Fred somehow stumbled on the scam, and that is why he disappeared. As the information starts to fall in to place, Allen Shempsky - the bank manager - breaks into Stephanie's apartment, ties up Briggs and ambushes Stephanie, holding her at gunpoint. He says he and Tipp started small, skimming a modest amount just for occasional gambling stakes, but started taking more and more. Larry and Curly got involved, and it started to unravel when Larry's estranged wife, Laura, found out and demanded part of the money. Allen and Larry killed her, Fred happened to see them dumping her body and so Allen killed Fred. Allen also killed Martha, then Larry, and then Curly. He had set the explosives in the car Stephanie was driving when he realized she was close to figuring things out. Allen is about to kill Stephanie, when Ramirez jumps into the window from her fire escape. Allen empties his gun at Ramirez, killing him, and allowing Stephanie to flee outside and borrow her neighbor's gun. Before she can return to her apartment, Allen escapes. Stephanie had already promised Ranger to chauffeur Ahmed back to the airport. While she is en route, with Grandma Mazur in the front seat, Briggs calls, having hacked the bank's records and found out that Allen was booked to fly out of the airport within the hour. With Grandma and Ahmed's help, Stephanie apprehends Allen, who confesses where he buried Fred. Stephanie learns Allen was actually stealing from Larry and Curly (who were skimming from Vito). Returning home from Fred's memorial service, Stephanie decides it is time to make a choice; she dresses in a slinky cocktail dress, then calls one of the two men in her life and asks him to come over. The novel ends without saying which one she called.

Biography  Crookshank studied at King's College London and qualified for medicine in 1881. He served briefly as an assistant to Joseph Lister, a physician noted for his work promoting antiseptics and sterile surgery. In 1882, Crookshank served as a doctor with the British armed forces sent to Egypt as a result of the Urabi Revolt; he was decorated for his service at the Battle of Tel el-Kebir. On return from Egypt, Crookshank toured Europe in 1884 for further medical training. In Berlin, he visited the laboratory of Robert Koch and learned methods of isolating bacterial strains to investigate infectious diseases. When he returned to London, Crookshank wrote a textbook, An Introduction to Practical Bacteriology Based on the Methods of Koch, which was published in 1886. Subsequent editions were published under differing titles in 1887, 1890 and 1896, and a French translation by H. Bergeaud was published in Paris as soon as 1886. In 1885, Crookshank founded one of the world's first bacteriological laboratories for human and veterinary pathology in London.Brought to light: photography and the invisible, Corey Keller, Jennifer Tucker, Tom Gunning; San Francisco Museum of Modern Art; 2008 Crookshank was also interested in the use of photography to study bacteria and published Photography of Bacteria in 1887, the first text in English devoted solely to the photography of bacteria. In the introduction to this book he wrote that the photographs were \\"intended to convince scoffers of the essential truth of the new Science, that specific, often morphologically distinct, microorganisms were the cause of particular infectious diseases\\". During this time he became interested in the study of infectious diseases in animals and in 1886 was awarded the chair of Comparative Pathology and Bacteriology at King's College London. In his new role he was asked to investigate an outbreak of cowpox in Lechlade, Gloucestershire. His investigations led him to reconsider the use of cowpox-derived vaccines to immunize against smallpox, a treatment developed by Edward Jenner nearly a hundred years earlier. His conclusion was that such vaccines were ineffective in preventing smallpox because the two diseases (cowpox and smallpox) were \\"totally distinct\\". Instead of a cowpox-derived vaccine, he advocated the use of a more dangerous vaccination using attenuated smallpox. In 1889, he published a two-volume treatise on the subject, A History and Pathology of Vaccination. Vaccination policies were a divisive topic at the time and in the ensuing controversy that resulted from his publication, Crookshank quit his chair at King's College London in 1891. He continued to speak out on health matters but never worked in a laboratory again. He subsequently, however, focused on the encouragement of agricultural and veterinary science, serving as a governor of the Royal Veterinary College until his death. In 1894, Crookshank was appointed Justice of the Peace for Sussex, and in 1906 stood unsuccessfully as East Grinstead's parliamentary candidate as a Unionist and tariff reformer. In later life, he travelled extensively in the Dominions, becoming a skilled big-game hunter and deputy chairman of two Scottish-Australian corporations.

It is located on 60th Avenue and its intersection with 118th Street. It is the stadium of the Club de Gimnasia y Esgrima La Plata, and nowadays has the capacity to accommodate approximately 33,500 spectators. The stadium was named in honor of Juan Carmelo Zerillo, who was president of the club between 1929 and 1931. During his tenure, Gimnasia y Esgrima won its first official title, the 1929 Primera Divisi√≥n championship.  History  Zerillo in 1929 On March 22, 1923, work began to build the stadium, with a field's dimensions of 118 meters long and 74 meters wide. On April 26, 1924, a ceremony was held, with the presence of then Governor, Dr. Cantilo. The official inauguration, however, was postponed until the anniversary of the city of La Plata, on November 19, with Gimnasia playing a friendly match against Uruguayan club Pe√±arol. The stands were made of wood, as it was traditional at that time. The club added a concrete covered structure to house the club members. This covered structure, situated in the midfield, was finished in 1931; individual seats were added to it in the late 1940s. This structure has been classified as a historical building by the city of La Plata (City order #1579). View of the stadium's official stands, c. 1931 During a La Plata derby game in 1959, one of the wooden stands collapsed, causing dozens of injuries and the suspension of the match. Over the years the stadium changed its structure, in order to harbor a greater number of public. After the club's remarkable campaigns in the 90s and the delay of the construction of the Estadio Ciudad de La Plata, Gimnasia's coach Carlos Timoteo Griguol required the then club's president, H√©ctor Delmar, to expand the capacity of the stadium to meet the standards required by FIFA, which said that from 2001 no first division club could have their stadium built with wood. Between 2006 and June 2008, the stadium could not be used for official tournaments, due to new safety standards the Co.Pro.Se.De (Coprosede) committee created in 2002 with the aim of reducing incidents of violence at sporting events in the Province of Buenos Aires. The president at the time, Juan Jos√© Mu√±oz, decided to use the Estadio Ciudad de La Plata to play the home games. This decision taken by Mu√±oz was done without calling an assembly. This unilateral decision resulted in several complaints. The management board that took the reins of the club in 2008 began some repairs and improvements of facilities in early 2008 to get the approval of the Coprosede to play official matches. On June 21, 2008, Gimnasia played again an official game in El Bosque, against Lan√∫s. Since the start of the Apertura 2008 tournament, Gimnasia use their Stadium of The Forest for most home games.

They are currently playing in the fourth tier of Croatian football. The club's arguably biggest success came when they won promotion to the Croatian First League in 2000. However, they only spent two seasons in the top flight before being relegated back to the Croatian Second League in 2002. In 2007, they finished bottom of the Croatian Second League and were relegated to the Croatian Third League, going on to end up playing in the fourth tier of Croatian football following another relegation in 2008. The club was played their home matches at the Stadion SRC Mladost, ƒåakovec, which has been their home ground since 1987 and can hold approximately 8,000 people. The stadium has also been used by NK Meƒëimurje following their formation in 2003. The team's supporters group was called the Demons (). History=Early history The club was founded in 1920 as ƒåakoveƒçki ≈°portski klub (ƒå≈†K; ) and competed in regional championships in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Their first and so far only title came in 1938, when they won the Drava Banovina Championship. During World War II, ƒåakovec was occupied by Hungary so the club played in Hungarian competitions until the city was liberated in 1945. After the war, the name of the club was changed to NK Jedinstvo ƒåakovec () and this name was used over the following two decades. In the mid-1960s, the club was bought by MTƒå, a local clothing company, and renamed MTƒå ƒåakovec. In 1983, the club merged with NK Sloga ƒåakovec, at the time the only other football club within the city, and was renamed MTƒå-Sloga ƒåakovec. The cooperation between the two clubs ended in 1987, with the club being renamed NK ƒåakovec. NK Sloga ƒåakovec also continued to exist as a separate club. During the Yugoslav era, the club's greatest success came when they reached the Round of 16 in the Yugoslav Cup in 1949 and 1952. In 1949, they were knocked out by Buduƒánost Titograd, suffering a 2‚Äì1 home defeat, and three years later they were crushed 7‚Äì0 by FK Sarajevo. History after Croatian independence NK ƒåakovec were first promoted to the Croatian Second League in 1992, but were relegated back to the Croatian Third League after finishing in 15th place. However, the club quickly returned to the Second League in 1994. Between 1994 and 1996, the club was known as NK ƒåakovec Union, with \\"Union\\" being the name of a local catering company serving as their main sponsor at the time. They also spent one season playing in the short-lived Croatian First B-League, continuing to play in the Second League after the First B-League folded in 1997. The club was again renamed NK ƒåakovec in December 1996, when it was bought by a group of local businessmen in order to save it from folding due to financial difficulties. In 1998, the club finished top of the Northern Division of the Croatian Second League, securing a place in the promotion play-offs for the Croatian First League. In the play-offs, played at a neutral venue in Velika Gorica, they failed to clinch promotion following a goalless draw against Jadran Poreƒç and a 2‚Äì1 defeat against Segesta. The 1998‚Äì99 season saw the club missing promotion to the top flight after finishing fourth in the unified Croatian Second League. However, they finally clinched promotion to the Croatian First League the following season after finishing runners-up of the Second League. After the promotion, the club signed former Dinamo Zagreb manager Ilija Lonƒçareviƒá, who went on to manage the team in the first half of the 2000‚Äì01 season. The club also signed several players with top-flight experience in order to enforce the squad. Their first game in the Croatian First League ended in a 2‚Äì0 defeat away at Hrvatski dragovoljac. However, they clinched their first top-flight point in their first home fixture of the season, being held to a 2‚Äì2 draw in a derby game against Varteks Vara≈ædin. Their first top- flight win came in their fourth game of the season, when they grabbed a surprising 2‚Äì0 win at home to Hajduk Split, who went on to clinch the league title at the end of the season. The team continued to deliver some good results during the autumn of 2000, including a goalless draw at home to Dinamo Zagreb, and even fought for a spot in the top-6 group, the Championship League, but eventually fell short by 5 points and finished the first part of the season in 7th place. This meant they continued to play in the bottom-6 group, the Relegation League, after the league was split in two groups in March 2001. Finishing 2nd in the Relegation League, they clinched 8th place in the overall standings. Their league record for the season included 10 wins, 9 draws and 13 defeats. The team went on to start the 2001‚Äì02 season strongly, recording two wins in the opening two matches and topping the table on Day 2. However, they ran out of luck thereafter and found themselves winning only 7 of their remaining 28 league matches, with 5 draws and 16 defeats. They finished 14th among 16 teams in the league that season and were effectively relegated back to the Croatian Second League. Many key players left the club immediately after the relegation in 2002, while some of them later moved to NK Meƒëimurje, a new club formed in the summer of 2003 and playing in the same stadium. NK Meƒëimurje went to play in the top flight between 2004 and 2008, and were again promoted there in 2009 after spending one season in the Croatian Second League. NK ƒåakovec experienced mixed fortunes in the Croatian Second League in the years following their relegation from the top flight, managing two 3rd-place finishes in the Northern Division of the league in 2003 and 2005. Following an 8th-place finish in the Northern Division of the Second League in 2006, they went on to play in the unified Second League in the 2006‚Äì07 season. However, they finished bottom of the 16-team league and were relegated to the Croatian Third League. Playing in the Eastern Division of the Third League, they ended up being relegated to the fourth tier of Croatian football in 2008.

It was published in 2001. Plot summary Stephanie's latest quarry is Eddie DeChooch, a septuagenarian semi-retired mobster who was arrested for smuggling cigarettes into New Jersey from Richmond, Virginia. Stephanie finds him in a state of abject depression at his home, but he eludes her and, while searching the house for clues, Stephanie finds a dead body in his shed, an elderly woman named Loretta Ricci, shot multiple times. Stephanie soon learns that she is not the only one searching for DeChooch; two Mafia types, Benny and Ziggy, are following her around and making themselves at home in her apartment, while her boyfriend, police detective Joe Morelli, wants to question DeChooch about the dead woman in his home. At the same time, Stephanie's friend \\"Mooner\\" is worried because his friend and roommate, Dougie Kruper, has disappeared. At home, Stephanie's dinner with her family is interrupted by the surprise appearance of her older sister, Valerie, with her two young daughters, whose \\"perfect\\" life in California came to an abrupt end when her husband abandoned her for their teenage babysitter. Over the next few days, Valerie proposes a number of radical schemes to get her life back under control, ranging from following Stephane's example as a bounty hunter to becoming a lesbian. Stephanie learns that DeChooch is searching for something, and tries to tempt him into the open by claiming to have whatever \\"it\\" is. Connie Rosoli, the office manager for Stephanie's boss, finds out from her Mafia-affiliated family members that DeChooch is looking desperately for a human heart! When DeChooch was in Richmond, the Mafioso he was collecting the cigarettes from, Louis \\"Louie D.\\" DiStephano, died of a sudden heart attack. DeChooch telephoned his boss back in Trenton, but misheard his boss's instructions to escort the body back to Trenton for burial (\\"bring the fart to me\\") as instructions to bring Louie D's heart back. DeChooch cut out Louie D's heart and brought it back to Trenton, but now he's lost it, and Louie's widow, Sophia, is demanding that he get it back. DeChooch kidnaps Stephanie's Grandma Mazur and demands the heart in exchange for her. Stephanie manages to rescue her by swapping her for a pig's heart from the butcher shop. When Mooner also disappears, Stephanie tracks him and Dougie down, with Ranger's help, in the basement of Sophia DiStephano's home in Richmond, where she has been torturing them for the location of the heart. Ranger and Stephanie free Mooner and Dougie, though Sophia manages to escape. Mooner and Dougie confess that DeChooch tasked them to take an ice cooler to Richmond, but they had no idea what was in it, and it turns out that a neighborhood dog ate the heart from the cooler while it was unattended, and Dougie inadvertently delivered an empty cooler to Sophia. The only thing left is to arrest DeChooch. Stephanie confronts him at his home, and asks him if he killed Loretta Ricci. He says no; Loretta gave herself a fatal heart attack while trying, over-enthusiastically, to rouse him from impotence. He shot her body in frustration, and also to conceal the real cause of death (because it was too embarrassing). Sophia appears, holding both of them at gunpoint, and demanding that Stephanie cut out DeChooch's heart, as \\"an Eye for an eye\\". Stephanie manages to subdue Sophia, who is arrested by the police. DeChooch admits that he is too tired to keep running, but insists, for the sake of his pride, that he be brought in by Ranger, not a woman. The novel ends with Ranger approaching Stephanie in her apartment, reminding her that they have \\"unfinished business\\" - specifically, she promised to spend a night with him if he helped her capture DeChooch.

Plot summary The prologue begins at the point where High Five ended, revealing who Stephanie picked: Ranger or Joe Morelli. Five months later... Stephanie's latest FTA, Carol Zabo, is attempting to avoid jail-time by jumping off a bridge to drown herself. Stephanie talks her down by promising to persuade the man who reported her not to press charges. Returning to the bonds office, Stephanie is handed a nightmare assignment: Ranger has gone FTA, and Stephanie has to track him down. Apart from her attraction to and respect for Ranger, Stephanie knows that his skills as a bounty hunter are far beyond hers. Ranger was scheduled to appear in court for a minor charge of carrying a concealed weapon, but he is also wanted for questioning related to a fire in an office park, where Homer Ramos, the son of notorious international arms dealer Alexander Ramos, was killed. Stephanie is afraid Ranger might be suspected of murdering Homer, and even more afraid that he might have actually done it. To complicate matters, Stephanie also has to deal with: *Being followed by two hit men, waiting for Ranger to make contact with her; *Being followed by her nemesis, Joyce Barnhardt, expecting the same; *her eccentric Grandma Mazur moving into her apartment after an argument with Stephanie's father; *being saddled with a giant, voracious dog named Bob; Stephanie initially agrees to dog-sit Bob as a favor to the police officer who arrested Carol Zabo, in exchange for him dropping the charges, but then realizes that the move is meant to be permanent; *having to track down the high-bond FTAs normally given to Ranger, including a psychopathic killer/rapist, Morris Munson. Ranger makes contact with her (without giving her the opportunity to capture him) and asks her to do surveillance on the Ramos family's properties in Jersey. When she drives past the Ramos compound in Deal, she is surprised when Alexander, the Ramos patriarch himself, jumps into her car alone and offers her $20 to drive him to a bar so he can smoke without interference. Over drinks, Stephanie pretends to recognize Alexander from news coverage and expresses her condolences over Homer's death. Alexander is dismissive, saying Homer was \\"stupid and greedy\\", and caused his own death. Breaking into the Trenton home of Alexander's eldest son, Hannibal, Stephanie and Lula find Homer's ex-girlfriend, Cynthia Lotte, searching the house for the jewelry and the silver Porsche that Homer gave her as gifts. They find the Porsche, with a dead man sitting behind the wheel, shot through the head. Cynthia insists on driving away with her Porsche, so Stephanie and Lula are forced to help her shove the corpse out the door, before Stephanie reports the crime. A short time later, Cynthia is also found shot to death, behind the wheel of the Porsche. Growing impatient, the two hit men, Mitchell and Habib, kidnap Stephanie and bring her before their boss, Arturo Stolle. Stolle says she is to act as the bait for Ranger, but she escapes through the window of the warehouse room they lock her in. Needing to make contact with Ranger again, she asks Carol Zabo to ambush Joyce Barnhardt and ensure that Stephanie is not followed to her meeting. However, this backfires when Joyce orders Stephanie to deliver Ranger to her, or else she will press charges against Carol and likely prompt her to attempt suicide again. Stephanie and Lula manage to trick Joyce into kidnapping an old acquaintance of Lula's who marginally resembles Ranger. Stephanie confers separately with Morelli and Ranger, and she figures out the mystery. Ranger explains that Arturo Stolle's normal \\"slice of the Trenton crime pie\\" is human trafficking, but recently has diversified into drug dealing. He recruited Homer Ramos to be the bagman for his operation, believing that the other Jersey crime factions would be hesitant to cross Alexander. But instead, Homer's actions upset the boundaries between the factions, where previously the Ramos family has restricted their illegal activities to arms, while the mob has enjoyed a monopoly on drugs. Ranger has been acting as an intermediary between the factions, hoping to prevent a crime war. Eventually, the mob decided to have Homer assassinated. Stephanie shrewdly guesses that Homer's death was faked, and Alexander and Hannibal have been hiding him in their houses until he can be slipped out of the country. When she returns home, Stephanie is confronted and held at gunpoint by Homer, who has been searching frantically for the bag of money he was carrying to the meeting with Ranger. It was originally in the trunk of the Porsche, and he first thought that Cynthia had taken it, but now believes that only Stephanie could have it. Before Homer can shoot her, Ranger appears and subdues him. Later, Morelli gleefully reports to her that Homer has given the police and the FBI enough evidence to indict both Alexander and Hannibal, and that Mitchell and Habib, arrested for kidnapping, have likewise turned evidence on Stolle. In secret, Stephanie learns that, after she drove away in the Porsche, Cynthia unwittingly threw the gym bag filled with money out of the trunk while cleaning it, and it was picked up by Stephanie's friend and sometime-FTA, \\"Mooner\\" and his friend Dougie. She decides to let them enjoy it. After Stephanie spends the night at Morelli's house, they are confronted the next morning by his mother and grandmother, who scold her for taking advantage of him. To her surprise, Morelli assures them that he plans to marry Stephanie.

It is characteristic for the elder generation. The younger generation usually (but not always) uses standard Danish pronunciation. An example of G√∏tudanskt is the jingle children use when sledging: ‚ÄòAway from the road! The king is sledding‚Äô, where comes from the Faroese verb ‚Äòto sled‚Äô. Another is from Poulsen (1993): , where corresponds to Faroese and to Faroese , ‚ÄòThe big ones (coalfish) outside the skerry can break fishing rods‚Äô.

It was written in 2002. Hard Eight revolves around a child custody bond, rather than a criminal bail bond, and marks the (sometimes repeated) departure of the series from Stephanie chasing bad guys to Stephanie being stalked by bad guys. The ninth, tenth, eleventh and twelfth volumes likewise revolve around Stephanie having a stalker. Plot Stephanie is asked by her parents' next-door neighbor, Mabel Markowitz, to find her granddaughter, Evelyn and great-granddaughter, Annie, who have disappeared. During a messy divorce with her ex-husband, Steven Soter, Evelyn was forced to post a child custody bond, and Mabel used her house as collateral. If Evelyn is not found, then the bond company will foreclose on her house, and the money will be forfeited to Steven. Mabel asks for Stephanie's help, since as a bounty hunter she is the closest thing Mabel knows to a detective. Stephanie is unable to refuse, even though she is not a private investigator. After interviewing Evelyn's bondsman, Les Sebring, and Steven Soter, Stephanie is baffled; Steven was domineering and abusive, and Evelyn had no friends or other family members she might go to in an emergency, and no one has any idea where she might have gone. Steven seems to be less concerned about Annie's well-being than he is eager to get his hands on the bond money. While snooping through Evelyn's apartment, Stephanie encounters her landlord, a local crime boss named Eddie Abruzzi. He warns Stephanie that if she knows where Evelyn is, she should tell him, or else he will \\"declare war\\" and she will be \\"the enemy.\\" Stephanie's mentor, Ranger Manoso, explains to her that Abruzzi is an avid wargamer, and tends to frame everything in quasi-military terms. At the Plum home, a new crisis arises when Stephanie's \\"perfect\\" sister, Valerie, gets fired from her job at the bank. Stephanie's mother turns to her in desperation, and Stephanie improvises, setting Valerie up with Albert Kloughn, Evelyn's hapless divorce lawyer. Kloughn's practice has been slow in taking off, so he soon becomes attached to Stephanie, following her and Lula around in trying to apprehend fugitives and investigate Evelyn's whereabouts. As she is trying to track down Evelyn, Stephanie is unnerved to realize that she is being stalked. First, someone leaves a bag of wild snakes attached to her apartment door, then a large tarantula on the seat of her car. Worse, men dressed in animal costumes are following her around. An attack by one of the men destroys Stephanie's car, then a second. When the men try to kidnap her, her mother sees them and impulsively runs over one with her car. Finally, Stephanie comes home one night and finds Steven Soter on her living room couch, shot through the head. The police investigate, and when she asks Joe Morelli how the body got into her apartment without any of her neighbors noticing, she is horrified by his answer: Soter's body was sawed in half at the waist, and the pieces were carried in with two large bags, then taped back together. Stephanie realizes that Abruzzi is \\"conducting psychological warfare\\" against her, believing that she knows where Evelyn is. Ranger asks around and finds out that Abruzzi is searching obsessively for his most prized possession: a medal that once belonged to Napoleon. Abruzzi, besides being a wargamer, is an avid collector of military memorabilia, and believes the medal is a lucky talisman. Ranger admits he doesn't know why Abruzzi would think Evelyn has the medal, but obviously he does. Then Ranger informs her that he is collecting on her \\"debt\\" to him, and, since Stephanie is on a \\"break\\" from her relationship with Morelli, she consents to have sex with Ranger. With Soter's death, the child custody bond is no longer necessary, and Mabel is relieved to be told that her house is safe, but Evelyn does not resurface. Stephanie eventually tracks her to the airport, before she is about to leave for Miami with Annie. Evelyn explains that Steven was in debt to Abruzzi, and was scared of him, but Abruzzi considered Steven a member of his \\"command\\", and so invited Steven and all of his \\"troops\\" with small children to Abruzzi's daughter's birthday party. While she was there, Annie wandered into Abruzzi's office and palmed the medal, thinking it was a party favor. Now that Evelyn is finally free of Steven, she has arranged to sell the medal to a collector in Miami for enough money to start a new life. She knew Abruzzi was threatening Mabel, but she couldn't come out of hiding or go to the police, knowing that \\"the law moves too slowly for a guy like Abruzzi.\\" Stephanie, seeing how scared and desperate Evelyn is, lets her and Annie go. When Stephanie returns to her apartment, Abruzzi's men appear in a van, holding Valerie at gunpoint, telling Stephanie to come with them or they'll kill her sister. Stephanie complies, and Valerie is released. Stephanie is brought to Abruzzi at a safe house, and he begins torturing her - searing her arm with a hot poker - for Evelyn's exact location in Miami, which she doesn't know. Before he can do more, Valerie, who has followed them, jumps into the van and drives it through the wall of the house, allowing both her and Stephanie to escape. Running home, Stephanie calls both Morelli and Ranger. After listening to her story, Ranger excuses himself, and a short time later, Abruzzi is found dead in his car, with a note saying that he has killed himself over some recent business failures. Stephanie is unnerved to know that Ranger has killed Abruzzi to keep her and Evelyn safe, but she and Morelli silently agree not to pursue it any further.

Baron North, of Kirtling Tower in the County of Cambridge, is an abeyant title in the Peerage of England. Its most famous holder was Frederick North, 2nd Earl of Guilford, 8th Baron North, who served as Prime Minister of Great Britain from 1770 to 1782, a period which included most of the American Revolutionary War.  History  The title was created on 17 January 1554 for Sir Edward North, a successful lawyer, clerk of the Parliament and chancellor of the Court of Augmentations. The barony was created by writ, which means that it can descend through both male and female lines. Lord North was succeeded by his son Roger, the second Baron. He was English ambassador to France, Treasurer of the Household and Lord-Lieutenant of Cambridgeshire. On his death the title passed to his grandson Dudley, the third Baron. He was also Lord-Lieutenant of Cambridgeshire. He was succeeded by his son, also named Dudley, the fourth Baron. He represented Horsham and Cambridgeshire in the House of Commons. His second son the Hon. Sir Francis North was created Baron Guilford in 1683. Lord North was succeeded by his eldest son, the fifth Baron. He married a daughter of the first Baron Grey of Warke and in 1673, four years before he succeeded his father, he was raised to the Peerage of England in his own right as Baron Grey, of Rolleston in the County of Stafford. He was succeeded in both peerages by his son, the sixth Baron. He served as Lord-Lieutenant of Cambridgeshire. He was created a Jacobite peer as 'Earl North' on 6 January 1722. He was childless and on his death in 1734 the Jacobite earldom (such as it was) and the barony of Grey became extinct. He was succeeded in the barony of North by his cousin the third Baron Guilford, who became the seventh Baron North as well. In 1752 he was created Earl of Guilford in the Peerage of Great Britain. The barony of North remained a subsidiary title of the earldom until the death of his grandson, the third Earl, in 1802. He had no sons and was succeeded in the barony of Guilford and earldom by his younger brother (see the Earl of Guilford for later history of these titles). The barony of North, meanwhile, fell into abeyance between his daughters. The peerage remained in abeyance for thirty-nine years, until the abeyance was terminated in 1841 in favour of the late Earl's second daughter Susan North, who became the tenth holder. She was the wife of John North, a Colonel in the Army and Member of Parliament. Born John Doyle, he had assumed the surname of North in lieu of Doyle in 1838. The title descended in the direct line until the death of her great-great- grandson, the thirteenth Baron (who had succeeded his grandfather), in 1941. Lord North was killed in action as a member of the crew of HMS Neptune. On his death the barony fell into abeyance between his two sisters, Dorothy Anne Graham (1915-2011) and Susan Silence Beauchamp (1920-1999).

Written in 2003, it's the second book in a row that doesn't revolve around a criminal bond, and the first to take Stephanie out of New Jersey and into the neon glitz of Las Vegas. To the Nines appeared on the USA Today list of 150 best-selling novels for 17 weeks, peaking at number 2. Plot introduction Stephanie Plum is a bounty hunter and amateur detective, who with a combination of luck and intuition usually gets the job done (though often by accident). She's got all the normal concerns in life: the rent, her family, men; yet all of her concerns are topped by the minor fact that someone is usually trying to kill her. Explanation of the novel's title The title appears to come from the common phrase, 'dressed to the nines'. Plot summary Stephanie's cousin and boss, Vinnie, has written the visa bond for Samuel Singh, an Indian immigrant working temporarily in New Jersey. Now he has gone missing, and his landlord, Mrs. Apusenja, insists that Vinnie track him down. She claims Singh is engaged to her daughter, Nonnie, but Nonnie appears more concerned for her dog, \\"Boo,\\" who went missing at the same time. Partnered with Ranger, Stephanie begins with TriBro, Singh's workplace, owned by three brothers, Andrew, Bart and Clyde Cone. While Andrew is helpful and Clyde is very enthusiastic about the case, Bart Cone gives Stephanie the creeps. Her boyfriend, Joe Morelli, does a background check and finds that Bart Cone was a suspect in the unsolved murder of a woman named Lillian Paressi. Circumstantial evidence tied him to the crime scene, but the indictment was dismissed when the DNA evidence proved negative. After returning home from TriBro, Stephanie is unnerved to find a bouquet of white carnations and red roses, accompanied by photographs of a murdered woman. She also receives some rather creepy emails. Based on the Apusenjas' description of his habits, Stephanie identifies Singh's only friend, an Indian man named Howie that works at a nearby McDonald's. While she is questioning him outside the restaurant, a passing motorist shoots him between the eyes. Stephanie only gets more nervous when she questions Lillian Paressi's friend, who remembers that Lillian also received a bouquet of carnations and roses. Andrew Cone excitedly calls Stephanie to tell her that Singh has applied for a job in Las Vegas, and his prospective employer called TriBro for a reference. Stephanie sets out for Vegas, accompanied by her sidekick Lula and Vinnie's secretary, Connie Rossoli. They rescue Boo from the home of a woman Singh was living with, but Stephanie gets a call from Morelli, who was informed by the Vegas police that Singh's body was found in a car at the airport, shot execution style. Afraid that the \\"Roses and Carnations Killer\\" has followed them to Nevada, Stephanie and Connie quickly return to New Jersey; Lula, afraid to fly again, decides to drive cross-country with Boo for company. Drafted to attend a birthday dinner for Morelli's uncle, Stephanie is even more unnerved when Morelli's spooky Grandma Bella claims to have \\"visions\\" of Morelli being married with many children, but losing his wife to a violent death. Ranger assigns his security company's employees to keep Stephanie safe, but two of them are badly injured while following her around: Tank, Ranger's right-hand man, suffers a broken leg when a fugitive jumps out his window and lands on him; later, when Stephanie's pregnant sister Valerie goes into labor, her water breaks over the second man, Cal, who faints dead away and suffers a concussion hitting his head on the floor. Stephanie's new niece, her older sister Valerie's daughter with Albert Kloughn, is born. She is named Lisa. Stepping outside the hospital to get some air, Stephanie is accosted by a teenager with a gun, who calls himself \\"Fisher Cat\\" and tells her she is the prize of a \\"game\\" - the winner is the one who succeeds in killing her. Stephanie disarms Fisher Cat with a groin kick, but is knocked unconscious by his stun gun. When she regains consciousness, Fisher Cat is dead beside her, shot twice through the head. Morelli examines Fisher Cat's laptop and finds that the game is run through an online chat room, by \\"The Webmaster.\\" Unwilling to let go of her suspicion that Bart Cone is the Roses and Carnations Killer, Stephanie goes back to the TriBro factory to confront him, only to discover that the Webmaster is the youngest brother, Clyde (his \\"Webmaster\\" appellation has less to do with his online role in masterminding the game than with his lifelong passion for Spider-Man comics). Clyde killed Lillian Paressi, which is why Bart was circumstantially linked to the crime, but the DNA evidence was inconclusive. Clyde also killed Howie, Samuel Singh, and Fisher Cat. He has also kidnapped Lula and Albert and wired them to a bomb in another part of the factory. Still playing his \\"game\\", Clyde draws a gun and stalks Stephanie through the factory floor, but Stephanie manages to find a gun concealed in Bart's desk and return fire, killing Clyde. Ranger and Morelli arrive and defuse the bomb, freeing Lula and Albert. After spending the night with Morelli, Stephanie is greeted the following morning by his mother and Grandma Bella, who admits that the woman in her vision was someone else's wife, but \\"maybe she was just sleeping.\\" Characters in To the Nines *Stephanie Plum - detective and protagonist *Lula - Stephanie's partner who is on the Atkins diet *Vinnie - Plum's cousin and boss *Samuel Singh - a bondee who is on the run *Andrew, Bart and Clyde Cone - Brothers, owners of TriBro, Singh's workplace * Mrs Apusenja - Singh's landlord * Nonnie Apusenja - Daughter of Mrs Apusenja and engaged to Singh  Trivia  *This is only the second time Stephanie has killed someone with a gun, after Jimmy Alpha in One for the Money.

Origin The City of Trenton dates back to the British colonial era, when it was chartered as 'a municipality within the royal realm of subjects under the Royal Throne'. Boundaries were recorded for the village of Trenton, or Trenton Township, as of June 3, 1719. After the American Revolution, Trenton became the capital of the state of New Jersey (as of November 25, 1790), and the City of Trenton was formed on November 13, 1792, within Trenton Township. What remained of Trenton Township was absorbed by the city of Trenton on April 10, 1837.The Story of New Jersey's Civil Boundaries: 1606‚Äì1968, John P. Snyder, Bureau of Geology and Topography; Trenton, New Jersey; 1969. pp. 164-165. Accessed August 21, 2012. Sections within the city, such as Chambersburg, Wilbur, Stacy's Mill, and Stuyvesant Heights, were autonomous villages or towns eventually absorbed by or annexed to Trenton. Between 1875 and 1900, the city's population and economic base swelled, prompting a revision and consolidation of its boundaries. In 1901, a 'Ward' system, loosely modeled after New York City, was adopted, dividing the city into four distinct units (North, South, East, and West Wards) with their own representatives serving under a single mayor within an elected city council. Buildings Until the first decade of the 20th century, much of North Trenton was made up of working farms, orchards, and large estates. After 1910, however, industrial development and population growth led to rapid development. By 1920, the North Ward was home to approximately a quarter of the city's population. North Trenton attracted a large middle-class, professional population, which coincided with the construction of modern, 'planned' neighborhoods situated around parks and green space. Several commercial districts, such as the Five Points (or Battle Monument Square), were established, and thrived from the 1920s to the 1960s. According to a New Jersey Historical Architecture survey, approximately seventy percent of all existing homes and buildings in North Trenton were constructed between 1919 and 1940. Despite decades of economic decline, North Trenton still boasts a diverse range of noteworthy architecture ‚Äî again, constructed primarily between 1919 and 1940. This 21-year period constitutes the area's 'golden age'. During this time North Trenton attracted a large middle-class population, and a variety of immigrant groups primarily from southern and eastern Europe. Many of the homes in the area between Brunswick and Princeton Avenues were developed by the British-born builder Samuel Hilton, and are considered architecturally significant. In the 1930s, project buildings, or federally subsidized housing similar to those in New York City were developed between Brunswick Avenue and Perry Street. The area around the Trenton Battle Monument, the heart of North Trenton, still retains blocks of once-fashionable row-houses built in the Queen Anne and Edwardian styles. The Trenton Orthopedic Hospital, which still stands at the corner of Brunswick and Cavell Avenues, was built in the 1920s and is a superb example of Art Deco style. The hospital served as an important polio treatment center in the 1930s, 40s, and 50s, and continued to operate as such until it was closed in 1970. Many of the buildings in the Battle Monument area were abandoned in the 1960s, and eventually torn down. People In the first half of the 20th century, while most of Trenton was segregated or defined by distinct ethnic neighborhoods, North Trenton was one of the few sections of the city where blacks, and whites of all ethnic backgrounds, lived together. North Trenton was regarded as a middle-class 'melting pot' peopled by a vibrant professional class which formed an important economic and cultural foundation for the city. After World War One, North Trenton became a magnet for Polish and Sicilian immigrants. It simultaneously attracted a thriving African-American middle class. The northernmost end of Brunswick Avenue became the heart of a 'Little Poland' district, while Italian neighborhoods emerged just north of the Battle Monument. Spring Street and Pennington Avenue formed the core of a thriving African-American community made up of black professionals who formed a distinct middle-class community unique for that time. North Trenton's diverse catalog of residents also included Russians, Middle-Easterners, Jews, and Anglos of English and Scottish descent. In 1939, a government study recognized North Trenton as one of the most successful and harmonious 'integrated' urban areas in the country, and designated it as a 'model' of economic and social vitality. In the 1930s, many important African-Americans, such as baseball's Willie Mays, and the writer Harriet Lee, lived in North Trenton. Edna Cuthbert, an African-American clothing designer, operated a successful studio in North Trenton from 1922 to 1954, and made a name for herself as a stylist and designer for many black celebrities of that time, including the singer Lena Horne. African-American painters, poets, and writers organized the North Trenton Round-Table, an arts society that published its own journal and staged theatrical performances from the mid-1920s to the early 1950s. The actor, singer, and social activist Paul Robeson contributed to the Round Table for many years. An Italian Theater group, The Bond Street Society, was organized in 1928, along with several Italian musical societies. In 1930, the Fanzini School of Dance was organized in North Trenton, and functioned into the 1950s. Many of its students went on to become successful Broadway and Hollywood dancers. Several Polish and Yiddish arts and theater groups also thrived in North Trenton from the 1920s to the early 1960s. Samuel Alito, the late Supreme Court Justice of the United States, was born and raised in North Trenton, as was Norman Schwarzkopf, the commander of U.S. forces in the first Gulf War (1991). By the late 1960s, however, economic and social changes saw a steady exodus of middle-class families from the North Ward, while numbers of poor migrants from the Southern states filled the vacuum. Racial tensions and economic decline reversed North Trenton's fortunes. The middle-class exodus reached a climax in 1968, when race riots engulfed the Battle Monument area. By the 1970s, the North Ward's population had dropped by over forty percent, and its once-vibrant neighborhoods and business districts were abandoned. Today, the area is considered one of the most economically and socially distressed in the city, and has struggled to rebound from the decline and turmoil of the late 1960s. The Ward is still home to a major medical facility, Capital Health System ‚Äì Fuld Campus. Several important sites remaining in North Trenton reflect the area's pre-1968 heyday, such as the Battle Monument (a tall granite shaft modeled after Nelson's Column in London) which commemorates the Revolutionary War victory of Washington's troops over the British. This battle is considered by many historians as the turning point of the American struggle for independence. Several noteworthy churches stand in North Trenton. Our Lady of the Divine Shepherd, built in 1940, was designed by the French-born architect Paul Neas, and served as the only African-American Catholic church in Trenton until it was merged with Blessed Sacrament Parish in 2002. The Polish Falcon Hall, built in 1910, was designed by the Polish- born Frederyk Poszki, a royal architect who fled Russia on the eve of the Communist Revolution. Still standing, it now serves as a community center for Polish immigrants. North Trenton retains a large Polish-American neighborhood that borders Lawrence Township. North Trenton is home to the historic Shiloh Baptist Church, one of the largest churches in the city of Trenton and one of the oldest African American churches in New Jersey, founded in 1888. The Lincoln School, an important example of 1920s Mediterranean Revival architecture, served as a high school for African-American students from 1929 to 1955, and still functions as a middle-school. Between 1880 and 1950, North Trenton attracted a large number of Polish immigrants. In 1919, a Polish parish was established on Brunswick Avenue by Polish Immigrants, St. Hedwig's Church, considered one of the most aesthetically noteworthy houses of worship in the city, remains a thriving Catholic church. North Trenton is also home to St. Mary's Cathedral, the seat of the Catholic Diocese of Trenton. The current cathedral was completed in 1959 to replace the original, Gothic structure destroyed by fire in 1956. Between 1899 and 1955, North Trenton was home to one of the only functioning Islamic mosques in New Jersey, founded by immigrants from the Ottoman Empire. A Jewish synagogue also functioned in North Trenton from 1899 to 1959. Both the Muslim and Jewish populations of North Trenton scattered and relocated to the neighboring suburbs of the city in the 1960s.

Life He was born into a noble family in the region around Loudun. The Reformation was strong in Loudun, and in terms of religion, Des Escuteaux seems to have been somewhat sympathetic toward the Huguenots. Works He was responsible for 13 novels of love and adventure and one anthology published between 1601 and 1628. Like his contemporaries Antoine de Nerv√®ze and Fran√ßois du Souhait, Des Escuteaux is one of the authors most often associated with the so-called \\"sentimental novel\\" (or \\"amours\\") published during the reign of Henry IV of France. Unlike these other authors, Des Escuteaux was not a prince's secretary and he apparently only worked on novels and not on plays or works of moral philosophy. The first five novels by Des Escuteaux were dedicated to noble ladies, but it is unsure to what degree he profited from their patronage. These ladies were: Ren√©e de Coss√©, who was the daughter of Artus de Coss√©, the wife of Charles of Montmorency and the cousin of Charles II de Coss√©, duc de Brissac; Isabel de Rochecho√ºart (dame de Les√©); Lucr√®ce de Bo√ºill√© (mademoiselle de Cr√©ance); Jeanne de la Bruneti√®re (dame de Vaudor√©); and Catherine de Mars (comtesse douairi√®re de Caravas). The publication of Nerv√®ze's first novels preceded Des Escuteaux's by two or three years, as too Nerv√®ze's anthology of short novels, but judging from the number of editions and places of publication, it seems that Des Escuteaux's novels had a longer period of success than Nerv√®ze's. Many of Des Escuteaux's novels are more adventurous (pirates, kidnappings, battles) than sentimental, and they clearly show the influence of the Renaissance Hispano-Portuguese adventure novel (like Amadis of Gaul) and the ancient Greek novel (like those of Heliodorus of Emesa and Achilles Tatius). Occasionally however, Des Escuteaux abandons the adventurous tradition for more realistic situations, such as portraying Italian courtly marriage alliances (Clarimond et Antonide) or the impact of the unintended killing of an uncle on the family of the beloved (Lydiam et Floriande). Des Escuteaux's novels take place in a variety of far-flung settings and historical periods (including in France during the reign of Charles VII of France, the Baltic under the Vandals, Armenia and Cappadocia, and the Eastern coast of Africa (Sofala)) and generally feature a sublimely beautiful virgin lady (whose beauty drives men crazy) and a noble knight who is trying to rescue her. Des Escuteaux has many passages showing the first tender moments of the lovers' self-discovery and revelation of their feelings, but he also revels in having his chaste female characters fighting back the libidinous attentions of their kidnappers. In a few of his novels, Des Escuteaux abandons the idealized portrait of his female characters and portrays them as flighty, vicious or cruel (vain and avaricious mothers who seek socially advantageous marriages for their daughters are a preferred target of his criticism). In the first half of the 17th century, Des Escuteaux was often grouped with Nerv√®ze by critics (such as Charles Sorel) who decried their stylized, rhetorically ornate and metaphoric language, but he is an essential figure in the development of language (prefiguring the Pr√©cieuses) and the novel in France and had a direct influence on Madeleine de Scud√©ry and other novelists in the 1640s.

Ramree Island (Yangbye Kywan) lies off the Burma coast, south of Akyab (now Sittwe). The island had been captured by the Imperial Japanese Army in early 1942, along with the rest of Southern Burma. In January 1945, the Allies launched an attack to retake Ramree and its neighbour Cheduba Island, to establish airbases on the islands for the supply of the mainland campaign. There have been reports of Japanese soldiers being eaten by saltwater crocodiles living in the inland mangrove swamps; the Guinness Book of World Records has listed it as \\"worst crocodile disaster in the world\\" and \\"most number of fatalities in a crocodile attack\\" but scientists and historians have dismissed this as implausible. Background The early capture of Akyab made the 26th Indian Infantry Division (Major-General Henry Chambers) available for an attack on Ramree Island, to the south, the island being long and wide, flat and an obvious site for airfields. A plan was ready by 2 January, when it was clear that the advance of the Fourteenth Army (Lieutenant-General William Slim) would soon pass beyond the range of its airbases at Imphal and Agartala; replacements at Chittagong, Akyab and Ramree would be needed. On 14 January, the 26th Indian Division was ordered to attack Ramree on 21 January, as a Royal Marine detachment from 3 Commando Brigade occupied Cheduba Island. The Japanese garrison of Ramree consisted of the II Battalion, 121st Infantry Regiment (Colonel Kanichi Nagazawa), part of the 54th Division, with artillery and engineer detachments to act as an independent force. Prelude The battle started with Operation Matador, an amphibious assault to capture the strategic port of Kyaukpyu at the north end of Ramree Island and the airfield near the port, south of Akyab across Hunter's Bay. The invasion force was led by three Joint Assault Commanders, Captain Bush RN, Major-General Cyril Lomax and Wing Commander H. Smith. Reconnaissance carried out on 14 January 1945, found that Japanese forces were placing artillery in caves overlooking the landing beaches on Ramree and the Royal Navy assigned the battleship , the escort carrier , light cruiser , the destroyers Rapid, Napier, Norman and Pathfinder, with the sloops Flamingo and . The large number of ships was intended to provide more firepower in support of the landing force. On 21 January, an hour before the 71st Indian Infantry Brigade (Brigadier R. C. Cotterell-Hill) was to land, Queen Elizabeth opened fire with of -shell from the main battery, the fall of shot being watched by aircraft from Ameer. Phoebe also joined the bombardment, along with Consolidated B-24 Liberators, North American B-25 Mitchells and Republic P-47 Thunderbolts of 224 Group Royal Air Force (RAF), under the command of HQ RAF Bengal and Burma, that strafed and bombed the beaches. Battle The assault troops were slightly delayed when a motor launch and a landing craft struck mines but landed unopposed on the beaches west of Kyaukpyu at securing the beachhead by the afternoon. The following day, the 4th Indian Infantry Brigade (Brigadier J. F. R. Forman) landed, took over the beachhead and occupied Kyaukpyu and on 23 January, the 71st Infantry Brigade advanced southwards, down the west coast. Two days later Mayin was occupied and the troops reached the Yanbauk Chaung the next day. Resistance at the chaung from the troops of the II Battalion, 121st Regiment increased and on 31 January, the 71st Brigade was ordered to move inland, north-east towards Sane, then head south towards Ramree town. The 4th Brigade was to keep the defenders at Yanbauk Chaung under pressure and follow up vigorously should they retire. (On 26 January in Operation Sankey, a Royal Marine force landed on Cheduba island, about from the south-west coast of Ramree Island and found it unoccupied.) On Ramree, the Japanese garrison put up tenacious resistance but on 1 February, the 71st Indian Infantry Brigade reached Sane and parts of the 36th Indian Infantry Brigade, from reserve, took Sagu Kuyun Island and relieved the marines on Cheduba Island. When the British outflanked a Japanese stronghold, the abandoned the base and marched to join a larger battalion of Japanese soldiers across the island. The route took the Japanese through of mangrove swamp and as they struggled through it, the British encircled the area. Trapped in deep mud-filled land, tropical diseases soon started to afflict the soldiers, as did scorpions, tropical mosquitoes and saltwater crocodiles. On 7 February, the 71st Indian Infantry Brigade and supporting tanks reached the town of Ramree and found determined Japanese resistance. The 4th Indian Infantry Brigade had advanced to Ledaung Chaung and then moved east to reinforce the attack; the town fell on 9 February. The navy and the 26th Indian Infantry Division then concentrated on blockading the chaungs (small streams) on the east coast to prevent the Japanese from escaping to the mainland. A Japanese air raid on 11 February seriously damaged a destroyer with a near miss and forty small craft were sent by the Japanese from the mainland to rescue the survivors of the garrison. Japanese resistance on the island ended on 17 February and the Allied blockade was maintained until 22 February, sinking many of the rescue craft and inflicting many casualties on the Japanese troops hiding in the mangrove swamps; about managed to get away. Cheduba Island was not garrisoned and the 22nd East African Brigade was sent to hold Ramree Island. Aftermath=Analysis In 1965, the British official historian Stanley Woodburn Kirby wrote that the Japanese defence of the island and the escape of about against \\"fearful odds\\", had been courageous and determined. It took until 16 April for the airfield to be used for transport sorties, Akyab having come into use on 1 April. It had been vital to complete the occupation of Ramree Island quickly, as Operation Dracula against Rangoon needed to commence in the first week of May at the latest, to have a chance of finishing before the monsoon. The experience in co-operation between the 26th Indian Division and the navy in the war of chaungs and small ports along the Arakan coast was intended to be exploited in the attack. An estimate put naval gunfire support from 4 January to 13 March for the land operations at Akyab, Ramree and Cheduba at The navy also carried of stores and Crocodile attack Some British soldiers, including the naturalist Bruce Wright, who participated in the battle, claimed that the large population of saltwater crocodiles native to the mangrove swamps on Ramree Island preyed on the trapped Japanese force at night and ate many soldiers. Wright gave a description in Wildlife Sketches Near and Far (1962), quoted by Frank McLynn, If Wright was correct, the Ramree Island crocodile attacks would have been the worst recorded in history. The British Burma Star Association seems to lend credence to the swamp attack stories but appears to draw a distinction between the survivors of one attack and the who were left to fend for themselves in the swamp. In his memoir, An Odyssey in War and Peace, Lieutenant-General J.F.R. Jacob recounted his experiences during the battle, These figures have been disputed by other historians, who call the event an urban myth. McLynn wrote The British official history (War against Japan volume IV, The Reconquest of Burma, 1965 [2004]) referred only to \\"crocodile-infested mangrove swamps\\".

It was written in 2004. The novel depicts Stephanie's inadvertent exposure to the worsening gang activity in Trenton, which leads to her being targeted for assassination. Plot summary Stephanie and Lula happen to be waiting outside a deli when a young man in a red Devil mask runs outside after robbing it, only to find that his getaway bicycle's tire is flat, Lula having shot it while trying to disprove Stephanie's doubts about her marksmanship. \\"Red Devil\\" throws a Molotov cocktail into the store, but the owner throws it back before it explodes, accidentally destroying Stephanie's latest car. Her boyfriend, police detective Joe Morelli, warns her that gang activity in Trenton is worsening, and \\"Red Devil\\"'s gang, the \\"Comstock Street Slayers\\", may decide to target her, especially if he believes Stephanie can identify him without his mask. By coincidence, Stephanie is driving her latest FTA, Salvatore \\"Sally\\" Sweet, and her Grandma Mazur, to the police station, when she notices Red Devil and several gang cohorts at a fast food drive-through. She calls the police, but the gang opens fire with automatic weapons, wounding her friend, Officer Eddie Gazzara, though not seriously. Furious and terrified in equal measure, Stephanie tries to think of a way to neutralize the gang, especially since she refuses Morelli's attempts to keep her under house arrest at his home. Stephanie's mentor, former Special Forces soldier and bounty hunter Carlos \\"Ranger\\" Manoso, loans Stephanie the use of a truck from his security company's fleet. On a whim, she follows the truck's GPS system to its previous location, which turns out to be a high- security office building with a luxurious apartment on the top floor, where Stephanie decides to wait out the crisis, at least until Ranger returns from his out-of-state trip. Although she feels that she and her family members are safe for the time being, she can't relax until the gang is no longer a threat to her. Stephanie catches a break when she recognizes her latest FTA, Anton Ward, as the Red Devil. She, Connie Rosoli and Lula bail Ward out of jail and spirit him to their boss, Vincent Plum's second home in Point Pleasant, intending to interrogate him about the gang's intentions, but none of them can sufficiently intimidate him. When Ranger returns from his trip, Stephanie takes him to Ward, who quickly confesses: after the Slayers' Trenton \\"captain\\" was killed, the gang brought \\"Junkman\\", a ranking member of the gang's Los Angeles branch, to fill the vacancy, but to prove himself to the gang, he is required to kill a list of targets, including two rival gang members and one police officer (which he already has), and finally Stephanie. As a bounty hunter, Stephanie has apprehended several members of the gang in the past, all of whom consider it humiliating to be brought to jail by a woman. Stephanie is sickened to hear that the Slayers' plan is to kidnap and gang-rape her before Junkman kills her. Ranger offers Stephanie the continued use of his apartment, but when Morelli tells her that someone tentatively identified as Junkman has been arrested, Stephanie considers the threat over and rushes out to attend her sister Valerie's bridal shower. Stepping outside the hall, she is kidnapped without warning and brought to a children's playground where the Slayers hold court at night. Before she is attacked, however, Sally Sweet, whose band was playing at the shower and saw her being abducted, drives his school bus onto the scene and opens fire on the gang members with a fully automatic Uzi, killing several, including Junkman, and causing the rest to flee. Before the police and Ranger's men arrive, Stephanie places dropped guns into the hands of the dead Slayers to ensure that it appears they fired first and Sally acted in defense of himself and her. Morelli and Ranger, amused at having been \\"upstaged by a man in a strapless dress,\\" congratulate Sally for his heroism and mention that the city has posted a $10,000 reward (\\"ten big ones\\") for Junkman's capture.

So she quits her job as a bail enforcement agent and resolves to get a normal job and a normal life. However, events conspire against her. Her three attempts at a normal job - working at a button factory, the Kan-Kleen Dry-Cleaning Service, and serving fast-food chicken at Cluck-in-a-Bucket - all end in disaster, partly because someone is, once again, attempting to kill her. It's someone she knows, and someone who knows her too well, but, as her on-again/off-again boyfriend, cop Joe Morelli points out, she's made a lot of enemies. At the same time, Stephanie is trying to avoid having to wear an eggplant-colored gown as maid of honor at her sister Valerie's upcoming wedding. The wedding itself hits a snag when Valerie's hapless fianc√©, lawyer Albert Kloughn, makes an insensitive remark about her weight at a family dinner, and she vows not to get married unless she can lose at least sixty pounds in less than ten days. Stephanie becomes convinced that the man stalking her is Spiro Stiva, the fugitive son of the Burg's favorite undertaker, Constantine. Spiro disappeared when Stephanie and her Grandma Mazur inadvertently burned down the Stiva funeral home in Two for the Dough, and now it looks like Spiro is back for revenge. *A car bomb claims Stephanie's Saturn as her ex-boss, Mama Macaroni, is trying to drive away in it; *Stephanie's last customer at Cluck-in-a-Bucket heaves a bomb through the drive-through window, and Stephanie catches a glimpse of a heavily scarred face before he drives off. *While escorting Grandma Mazur at a funeral viewing at Stiva's parlor, the same scarred man runs over Morelli with a car, breaking his leg. Stephanie's mentor, ex-Special Forces mercenary Ranger Manoso, offers her a job with his security firm, running background checks on persons of interest. Despite her trepidation at being too close to Ranger, and the friction it causes with Morelli, she accepts for the security it offers her. While running information searches, Stephanie discovers evidence linking Spiro's reappearance with the disappearance of four older men from the Burg, all of whom disappeared on the same day and were later found shot to death in a shallow grave outside Trenton. All four men were United States Army veterans, stationed at Fort Dix at the same time as Constantine Stiva. In a fit of depression, Stephanie confides to Morelli that she quit her job as a bounty hunter because she feels \\"stupid and boring\\" - she has no career path, no hobbies, no strong interests, and nothing she's really good at. Morelli smiles and says that, while \\"stupid\\" is sometimes \\"a tough call,\\" he finds her anything but boring. While Stephanie's mother was complaining about Stephanie's lack of direction, Stephanie recklessly told her family a small lie, claiming that she can play the cello - and before she knew it, her mother has rented one for her to play at Valerie's wedding. Now she has to find a way out of that predicament as well. Fortunately for her, two events intervene on her behalf: a bomb blows up Morelli's garage (with the cello inside) on the night of the wedding reception; the next day, Valerie calls from the airport to cancel the wedding, as she, her three children, and Albert are all leaving for Disney World, and may not come back. After driving Grandma Mazur to another viewing at the funeral home, Stephanie goes snooping through Constantine Stiva's attached house, looking for signs that Spiro is hiding out there. Then she is tazed unconscious and wakes up in a coffin, being wheeled into an abandoned house in Spiro's name. Her kidnapper turns out to be Constantine himself. Spiro, he confides, died in the fire, but makes a convenient scapegoat for what Constantine had to do. Thirty-six years ago, he masterminded an armored car hijacking at Fort Dix; he and four Army buddies stole $7 million and hid it in a vault in the basement of the funeral home, doling out shares at 10-year intervals. It was arranged that all five of them were needed to open the vault, but Constantine eventually figured out the combination and \\"borrowed\\" from the stash from time to time, then had to take it all to rebuild his business after the funeral home burned down. A month ago, one of his accomplices was diagnosed with cancer and requested his entire remaining share of the money. Constantine called all of them to a meeting, ostensibly to vote on the distribution, and Constantine shot and buried them all. Now he has to kill Stephanie in order to complete the illusion that Spiro is the one responsible. He locks her in the basement and heads out to do one last Spiro impersonation. Before he returns, Stephanie is rescued from the basement by Ranger and his crew, who have been looking non-stop for her in the six hours since she disappeared. Ranger pleads with Stephanie to go home and stay safe while he and his men stay behind to apprehend Constantine. He goes so far as to handcuff her to his right-hand man, Tank, who escorts her to Morelli's house before releasing her. On the pretext of taking Morelli's dog, Bob, for a walk, Stephanie borrows her family's Buick and stakes out the Stiva house, while Ranger is lying in wait for him. When Constantine pulls into the garage, Stephanie rear-ends his car with the Buick, crushing the car and trapping Constantine behind the air bag. Stephanie tells Ranger she feels much better, and decides that, while learning to play the cello might be fun, she doesn't need to, as her life is already plenty interesting. Characters *Stephanie Plum - the protagonist, a fugitive apprehension agent who quits her job and works at a button factory, Kan Klean dry cleaner, and a fast food restaurant known as Cluck-in-a-Bucket.

It stars John Neville as the duke and Susan Hampshire as the duchess, was written and produced by Donald Wilson, and was directed by David Giles. It is notable as being the first programme shown on PBS's long-running Masterpiece series in the United States. Wilson and Giles were fresh from their success in writing and directing The Forsyte Saga, which also starred Susan Hampshire and Margaret Tyzack.  Overview  The serial presents the lives of John and Sarah Churchill from their meeting in 1673 until a time shortly after the death of Queen Anne in 1714, and illustrates, along the way, much of the context of contemporary English politics. Like many BBC serials of the era, it was made on a low budget, with sound-studio sets, and generally avoided battle and crowd scenes because they were unable to stage them in a convincing manner. The series is based on the Marlboroughs' famous descendant Winston Churchill's life of his ancestor the Duke, and as such presents a very favourable portrait of the Marlboroughs.

It was an early form of subscription television that was offered to prospective subscribers as either a standalone service to those that did not have access to cable television- originated premium services (such as HBO and Showtime), or as an additional viewing alternative thereto. Super TV broadcast on two television stations: WCQR channel 50 in Washington, D.C., from 1981 to 1985, and WNUV channel 54 in Baltimore, from 1982 to 1986. History Super TV was launched by Subscription Television of Greater Washington‚Äîa joint venture of Field Enterprises and Clint Murchison Jr.‚Äîand began broadcasting on WCQR, a new-to- air station, when it signed on November 1, 1981. The company had a rough start out of the gate: a computer problem caused some 20 percent of its 5,000 customers in the first month to not receive full service, while customer service phone lines were jammed. Typical of subscription services, Super TV programmed movies, sports, and special events, as well as an optional Night Life adult package. Super TV began broadcasting over another new station on July 1, 1982, when Baltimore's WNUV began broadcasting. Within a month, the service had 10,000 Baltimore subscribers in addition to 45,000 in its Washington market. One of the service's major selling points was a package of 16 Baltimore Orioles baseball games, announced by Ted Patterson and Rex Barney; however, interest in the 16-game package waned when Home Team Sports launched as a cable channel in 1984, and Super TV dropped it after two years when HTS started up. The service reached its peak in subscribers in 1983: 85,000 subscribers, with 30,000 of those in Baltimore. Unlike many similar services, Super TV maintained a part-time schedule throughout its entire existence, never switching to a 24-hour schedule; it broadcast Monday through Fridays from 7:00 p.m. to 2:00 a.m. and from 5:00 p.m. to 2:00 a.m. on weekends. As STV declined nationwide, Super TV began to lose subscribers, though delays in wiring Baltimore for cable gave the service a reprieve. The owner of WNUV, the Baltimore station, would state that he realized Super TV would be going out of business as early as January 1984; later that year, he began a campaign to raise the profile of the station outside of Super TV programming. After the sale of WCQR, Super TV ceased programming on the station on December 31, 1985; the station itself was relaunched as WFTY on the first day of 1986. While Super TV was able to retune most of its customers' equipment to receive WNUV instead, some viewers in northern Virginia and areas far from the WNUV transmitter were not able to continue. However, the number of subscribers continued to fall rapidly, from 28,000 in late 1985 to 14,000 in early 1986. As a result of the company's failure and WNUV's desire to become a full-time commercial independent, Super TV broadcast for the last time on March 31, 1986. Technology The Zenith SSAVI (sync suppression and video inversion) was used as the decode the signal, however it had no external controls other than a small chrome button atop the decoder box to select between standard television signals or Super TV. In a then-pioneering effort at thwarting piracy, the station could address each box individually to authorize decoding of programs, including one-time pay-per-view broadcasts or adult program options. In addition, to defeat simple home-engineer descrambling techniques, video inversion was done selectively, often when the video frame was light overall, causing the scrambled picture to retain in a darker tint than the elevated sync pulses. In certain cases, video was inverted on alternate frames. The audio transmitted on the standard audio channel was a \\"barker\\" announcement, informing would-be customers that Super TV was a scrambled service and required a subscription to view its content. The monaural audio used for Super TV's film broadcasts was transmitted on a subcarrier, which would later be used to transmit the difference signal of multichannel television sound after 1984. Until the first MTS sets became available in 1985, most conventional television sets could not decode the audio; however shortly afterward, the barker channel would be transmitted on the right audio channel and the monaural program audio feed would transmit on the left.

Background Erdemoviƒá was born in Tuzla, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Yugoslavia. He was mobilized into the VRS 10th Sabotage Detachment, a part of the Bosnian Serb army. Srebrenica In July 1995, Erdemoviƒá and his unit were sent to Branjevo military farm in the village of Pilica, north of Zvornik. After the VRS forces took over Srebrenica on 11 July, the Serbs began to send male Bosniaks to various locations for execution. One of those places was the farm in Pilica, 15 kilometers from the border with Serbia, where Erdemoviƒá and the 10th Sabotage Detachment were tasked by General Ratko Mladiƒá to execute about 1,200 Bosniak men and boys between the ages of approximately 17 and 60 years, who had surrendered to the members of the Bosnian Serb police or army near Srebrenica. On 16 July, the prisoners were bused to the farm and gunned down in groups of ten. Erdemoviƒá allegedly resisted the order, but was then told that he either shot them, or hand his gun to another, and join those to be killed. After the murders were over the victims were buried in mass graves. While it is unknown exactly how many people were personally killed by Erdemoviƒá, he estimated it was around 70 men and boys. After the massacre, Erdemoviƒá returned home, but reportedly felt guilt-ridden over the crimes he had committed. Fellow soldiers of the 10th Sabotage put pressure on him not to say anything, including a Serbian soldier, Stanko Savanoviƒá. One evening, while meeting in an undisclosed bar, Savanoviƒá shot Erdemoviƒá, wounding him badly in the torso. In early 1996, Erdemoviƒá sought out an ABC field reporter and testified on camera about what happened at Srebrenica. Several days later, he was arrested and charged with war crimes in the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. Trial This Erdemoviƒá case was significant in the Tribunal being it was the first application of the defence of duress, claiming that his life had been threatened and that he had no choice. It was found that it did not absolve him of guilt, but could be a mitigating factor in his sentencing. On 29 November 1996, Erdemoviƒá was sentenced to ten years in prison, convicted of murder as a crime against humanity. He was the first person to enter a guilty plea at the Tribunal, He was the only member of the 10th Sabotage Detachment to actually be tried for the war crimes, while the rest remained on the Tribunal's most wanted list. Erdemoviƒá appealed and his sentence was later reduced by ICTY to five years in 1998, accepting that he committed the offences under threat of death had he disobeyed the order. Credit was given for time served since 28 March 1996. On 13 August 1999, he was granted early release. Upon serving his sentence in a Norwegian prison, Erdemoviƒá entered the Tribunal Court's witness protection program and testified at the trial of Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá. > I wish to say that I feel sorry for all the victims, not only for the ones > who were killed then at that farm, I feel sorry for all the victims in the > former Bosnia and Herzegovina regardless of their nationality.

It is now a virtual museum America's Black Holocaust Museum (ABHM), located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, is a memorial museum dedicated to the history of the Black Holocaust in America. It was founded in 1988 by James Cameron, who became well known to have survived a lynching. The new ABHM, which is scheduled to open fall 2019, is located on the ground floor of the newly built Griot building at 401 W. North Ave., Milwaukee. The Griot Building was named for Cameron; \\"griot\\" is a West African term for an oral historian and news-bringer. Cameron died in 2006. In 2008, the museum's board of directors announced that the museum would be closed temporarily because of reduced funding during the 2008 Great Recession. The 501(c)3 nonprofit Dr. James Cameron Legacy Foundation was created in 2012 to continue the legacy and vision of Dr. Cameron. In 2012, the Foundation re-opened ABHM as a 3200+ page virtual museum at www.abhmuseum.org. In 2016, the Foundation began planning to return the museum to a new home. The new physical museum, located on the ground floor of the Griot building at 401 W. North Avenue in Milwaukee's historic Bronzeville neighborhood, is now scheduled to open in Fall 2019. The exact date of its Grand Opening was to be announced on www.abhmuseum.org. History=James Cameron After surviving a lynching at age 16 in which two companions died, and subsequently spending five years in prison, James Cameron was determined to do something important with the rest of his life. He got an education, worked hard, raised five children, and spent his life studying the African-American experience in the United States. He worked in civil rights, wrote independent articles, pamphlets and a memoir called A Time of Terror: A Survivor's Story). Cameron also amassed a large collection of materials and artifacts related to African- American history. After retirement, Cameron and his wife visited Yad Vashem, the Holocaust memorial museum in Israel. He thought that museum's focus on the personal history of individuals and their stories led to a better understanding of the reality of the Holocaust. Then living in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in 1988 he founded his museum with the help of philanthropist Daniel Bader, having collected materials on the African-American experience in the US for many years. Physical museum ABHM's facility, located in Milwaukee, is the only memorial and museum that interprets the African American experience in the United States as an ongoing holocaust (series of mass atrocities) from the time of captivity in Africa to the present day. The museum examines the tragic legacies of slavery and promotes racial repair, reconciliation, and healing through developing awareness and empathy. Cameron died in 2006; in 2008, the museum's board of directors announced that the museum would be closed temporarily because of financial problems. The original museum was demolished in early 2017. The site, including the former Garfield Avenue School, was redeveloped as the Historic Garfield School Redevelopment Program. On April 4, 2017, the developers broke ground on a new building called The Griot on the footprint of the original museum. The new museum is located on the ground floor of the Griot and was scheduled to open in 2019. Virtual museum A new ABHM was established as a \\"virtual museum\\" by ABHM's Board of Directors, after the bricks-and-mortar museum closed. The new format came online as a virtual museum on February 25, 2012, in celebration of Cameron's birthday and Black History Month. The online museum is operated by the nonprofit Dr. James Cameron Legacy Foundation Inc. The virtual museum attracts 5 million visitors per year from over 200 countries. The \\"online\\" experience complements the \\"onsite\\" experience by recounting many of the seldom-told and untold stories of both tragedy and triumph, through short texts, pictures, videos, documents and links to further reading and other resources. Educational focus While there is also a Black Holocaust memorial in Savannah, Georgia, the ABHM facility serves as a center for education and scholarship related to the Black Holocaust and as a supportive forum for sharing thoughts about race and racism in America. Exposing visitors to historical aspects of African-American cultural identity is achieved through educational exhibits, special programming, and guided tours about seven distinct historic eras. These eras are also interpreted in the Virtual Museum: * African Peoples Before Captivity * Kidnapped: The Middle Passage * Three Centuries Of Enslavement * Reconstruction: A Brief Glimpse of Freedom * One Hundred Years of Jim Crow * I Am Somebody! The Struggle for Justice * NOW: Free At Last? ABHM welcomes visitors of all races and backgrounds, and encourages community understanding of the nation's history of racism, prejudice, social change and cross-cultural understanding.

In New York, he studied print and graphic arts but worked in clerical jobs. Acting career A cross dresser and drag queen, he took his name from the 1940s Hollywood starlet Mar√≠a Montez. His acting career started somewhat by chance when he met avant-garde filmmaker Jack Smith, who included him in his 1963 underground classic Flaming Creatures. Montez did not attend acting school, instead he admits he learned acting \\"from watching old movies\\". Warhol gave Montez the \\"superstar\\" status he bestowed on his prot√©g√©s, but in spite of working in many of his films, Montez never developed a close relationship with the famously laconic Warhol. Montez was also a co-founder of Charles Ludlam's Ridiculous Theatrical Company, which rehearsed at Montez's loft in SoHo. Retirement from the film industry In January 1977, Montez moved to Orlando, Florida. After moving to Florida, he quit entertainment altogether and remained out of the public eye until 2006 when he appeared in a documentary about filmmaker Jack Smith. In Florida, he returned to working clerical jobs.

Completed in 1876 for Edward C. Hegeler, a partner in the nearby Matthiessen Hegeler Zinc Company, the mansion was designed in 1874 by noted Chicago architect William W. Boyington. The mansion is now owned and operated by the Hegeler Carus Foundation, and is open to the public. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2007.  History  Boyington, the architect who designed the mansion, is noted for the Chicago Water Tower, the Joliet State Penitentiary, and for completing the Illinois State Capitol. The interior was done by August Fiedler, who designed a unique parquet floor and hand-painted ceiling for each public room. The mansion, which has seven levels, has 57 rooms with a total of about 16,000 square feet of interior space. The Hegeler Carus Mansion was initially home to Hegeler, his wife Camilla Hegeler, and their large family. In 1887, Hegeler launched the Open Court Publishing Company to provide a forum for the discussion of philosophy, science and religion, and hired the German scholar Dr. Paul Carus to serve as managing editor. The company was located on the first level of the house. In 1888, Carus married Hegelers‚Äô daughter Mary. The mansion is where Carus wrote over 70 books, countless articles and served as editor of two scholarly publications, The Open Court and The Monist. Carus invited editorial contributions from the likes of Charles Sanders Peirce, William James, Leo Tolstoy, F. Max M√ºller, Gottlob Frege and Bertrand Russell. Carus hosted a historical meeting of East and West immediately after the 1893 Chicago Columbian Exposition, bringing together eminent Oriental religious scholars. This led to Open Court's publishing program emphasizing classics of eastern religious thought. Zen scholar D. T. Suzuki spent 11 years in La Salle working with Carus on this programme. After Carus, who had lived with his family in the mansion for many years, died in 1919, the house was occupied mainly by his children. In 2001, its sole resident was 99-year-old Alwin Carus, one of six children of Paul and Mary, who died in 2004. Recent developments In 1995 the Hegeler Carus Foundation was created. That year, the mansion was put on the National Register of Historic Places. In recent years, members of the Carus family and others have done much restoration of the mansion. On March 29, 2007, the Hegeler Carus Mansion was designated a National Historic Landmark.National Register of Historic Places Listings In 2008, the foundation launched a project to reassemble the mansion's gymnasium and its apparatus, considered to be a unique surviving example of a late 19th- century physical culture facility. The foundation also owns the Julius W. Hegeler I House, located directly across the street, which is undergoing restoration. In celebration of the 2018 Illinois Bicentennial, Hegeler Carus Mansion was selected as one of the Illinois 200 Great Places by the American Institute of Architects Illinois component (AIA Illinois).  Current uses  The mansion hosts numerous public programs, and is open for public tours. It is particularly notable for its high Victorian stencils and wall and ceiling paintings, its woodwork, and its history.

Retrieved 2016-07-03 the album was finally released on CD, vinyl and cassette on January 15, 1993 through Lookout Records. Due to a \\"cymbal hissing\\" in the original vinyl version, the album was remixed and re-released soon afterwards. After the band's popularity had grown with their previous album My Brain Hurts, the group felt pressured with the follow-up album.Screeching Weasel - Thank You Very Little liner notes. Retrieved 2016-07-02 While most of Wiggle is in a similar vein to their previous album, some songs saw the band experimenting with new wave and a few featured a more hardcore-influenced sound reminiscent of the group's earlier material. In retrospect, vocalist Ben Weasel has voiced dissatisfaction with the album, mainly the songs that were chosen for it. However, he considers the band's performance and the album's production better than My Brain Hurts. The album was remastered and reissued by Asian Man Records in 2005 shortly after the band had removed its catalog from Lookout due to unpaid royalties and a vinyl version was released by Recess Records in 2009. Background Shortly after the recording of My Brain Hurts, bassist Dave Naked was fired from the band at the insistence of guitarist Dan Vapid and was initially replaced by Scott \\"Gub\\" Conway, who toured with the band in support of the album. Conway himself was replaced after the tour by Vindictives bassist Johnny Personality, who vocalist Ben Weasel considered a \\"outstanding bass player\\".Screeching Weasel - Kill the Musicians liner notes. Retrieved 2016-07-02 Weasel had briefly played with The Vindictives in 1990 on their first EP and Personality auditioned for Weasel and John Jughead's band the Gore Gore Girls during Screeching Weasel's brief break-up the same year. In February 1992, the band went to engineer Steve Albini's house in Chicago to record demos for their next album, with Albini serving as engineer and Naked Raygun drummer Eric Spicer producing. Two of the songs from the session, \\"Crying in My Beer\\" and \\"Jeannie's Got a Problem with Her Uterus\\", were re- recorded for Wiggle, while \\"Going Home\\" was released on a split EP with the Pink Lincolns (and later released on the CD version of the album) and \\"Celena\\" was featured on the compilation album It's a Punk Thing, You Wouldn't Understand. Recording In June 1992, the band went to Sonic Iguana Studios in Lafayette, Indiana to record Wiggle with studio owner Mass Giorgini producing. Giorgini would go on to produce several of the band's later albums and also served as their bassist from 1996 to 2001. The band recorded several songs during the sessions, including the non-album single \\"Radio Blast\\" and its b-side \\"The Girl Next Door\\", a re-working of the song \\"Cindy's on Methadone\\" titled \\"Shirley's on Methadone\\" for a film called Shirley Pimple (which was never released as the director ended up in prison) and a cover of the song \\"Achtung\\" by the band The Authorities for a tribute album (which was also never released). Another song from the session, \\"Amy Saw Me Looking at Her Boobs\\", originated as a composition by Joe King (Joe Queer) of The Queers from 1990 that Weasel finished. The song was later re-worked by The Queers as \\"Fuck the World\\" on their album Love Songs for the Retarded, which Screeching Weasel also recorded a version of. Weasel later called the sessions for the album an \\"enormous pain in the ass\\" due to the long recording process and that he \\"wasn't singing like [him]self\\", saying his vocals on the album were \\"horrible.\\" He also stated that he was having relationship problems with his girlfriend at the time of the recording, which resulted in \\"fucking up [his] head\\" and having \\"no idea what should go on the album and what shouldn't.\\" Track listingPersonnel * Ben Weasel ‚Äì lead vocals * John Jughead ‚Äì lead guitar * Danny Vapid ‚Äì rhythm guitar, backing vocals, bass on \\"Teenage Slumber Party\\" * Johnny Personality ‚Äì bass * Dan Panic ‚Äì drums Additional performers * Doug Ward ‚Äì rhythm guitar on \\"Teenage Slumber Party\\" * Brian Vermin ‚Äì drums on \\"Teenage Slumber Party\\" Production * Mass Giorgini ‚Äì producer, engineer * Todd Barrett ‚Äì album layout * Martin Sorrondeguy; Dan Mueller ‚Äì photography * Eric Spicer ‚Äì producer on \\"Going Home\\" * Steve Albini ‚Äì engineer on \\"Going Home\\" References Category:Screeching Weasel albums Category:1993 albums Category:Lookout!

The murder of Kelly Cook Standard is known in Alberta for the tragic abduction and murder of one of its residents, 15-year-old Kelly Cook, in 1981.RCMP cold case report on murder of Kelly Cook archive.org copy of RCMP cold case report on murder of Kelly Cook The Grade 10 student regularly babysat for townsfolk, and on the morning of April 22, 1981, she received a phone call from a man who identified himself as Bill Christensen. He asked her to babysit for him that evening. Although she did not know the caller, she agreed, as 'Christensen' was a common surname in the area and crime was virtually unknown in the village, with residents routinely leaving their doors unlocked. The caller arranged to pick Kelly up that evening and drive her to his residence. At 8:30 that evening, a car pulled up in front of the house where she lived with her parents and siblings. The driver did not leave his car, and Kelly walked out of her house and climbed into the automobile's front passenger seat. The car then immediately drove off. A few hours later, her anxious parents, concerned that Kelly had not called or returned home, called the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. A massive local search was launched but yielded almost no clues. Two months after her abduction, on June 28, her badly decomposed body was discovered by a young man riding his dirt bike in Chin Lakes, an irrigation canal south of the Town of Taber, southeast of her hometown of Standard. The case caught the public's attention like few other murder cases because it was so unusual, with the killer actually picking up his victim at her house while her mother watched through the window. Despite the publicity generated by this murder case, and a $100,000 reward offered by the Village of Standard for information leading to the arrest of Kelly's killer, the case currently remains unsolved.

Description Excalibur was developed as a longer-ranged alternative to conventional artillery shells, with GPS guidance for improved accuracy. Excalibur has a range of approximately depending on configuration, with a circular error probable (CEP) of around . The extended range is achieved through the use of folding glide fins, which allow the projectile to glide from the top of a ballistic arc towards the target. The munition was co- developed by United States-based Raytheon Missile Systems (guidance system) and the Swedish BAE Systems Bofors (body, base, ballistics and payload). Excalibur is used to minimize collateral damage, for targets beyond the range of standard munitions, for precise firing within of friendly troops, or when firing in a straight line from the launching cannon is limited by terrain.

History First operational use of M982 Excalibur, against a suspected insurgent safe house north of Baghdad on 5 May 2007. US Army artillerymen preparing an M982 Excalibur round for firing in Afghanistan, 2008. Excalibur started as a development program in 1992. The Operational Requirements Document (ORD) of May 1997 called for 200,000 rounds of an unguided munition with increased range at an estimated cost of $4,000/round, and Texas Instruments was awarded the initial EMD contract on 23 January 1998. In November 2001 the volume was cut to 76,677 rounds and soon after this was further reduced to 61,483, but the developers were encouraged by the Indian experience of using Russian Krasnopol guided shells against Pakistani bunkers in the Kargil War of 1999. In March 2004 the program was merged with a Swedish/U.S. program to create Trajectory Correctable Munitions, reflected in a new ORD in September 2004 which removed the Dual-Purpose Improved Conventional Munition \\"cluster bomb\\" variant in favor of the discriminating munition variant. Later that year the U.S. Army reduced its planned order to 30,000 rounds. Low-rate production of 500 rounds was approved in May 2005 and Raytheon was awarded a contract to produce 165 rounds in June 2005, worth $22.1 million. In September of that year, the round was successfully demonstrated at Yuma Proving Ground, Arizona.Troops could have new Picatinny- developed smart artillery munition by March - RDECOM Magazine Raytheon was awarded a $42.7 million contract for production of 335 Excalibur projectiles and related test articles and services in June 2006 for that fiscal year. In August 2006, technical problems relating to environmental sensitivity and GPS signal lock were discovered, pushing the expected in-service date to spring 2007. Testing in September demonstrated an actual average CEP of or better. Increment Ia-1 completed testing in early 2007 and in April that year the U.S. Army approved an Urgent Material Release to allow deployment to Iraq. The Excalibur was first operationally fired in Iraq in May 2007. Increment Ia-2 achieved a range in a live-fire demonstration in April 2007 and in July the Army Acquisition Executive approved the Milestone C decision for Ia-2 to enter low-rate production. The munition was developed with US$55.1 million in financial assistance from Sweden, which expected to receive service rounds in 2010. The Excalibur debuted in Afghanistan in February 2008. The Australian Army ordered US$40 million of Excalibur rounds in October 2007, an order revised in April 2008 to an estimated US$58 million.Defense Security Cooperation Agency, 1 October 2007 Defense Security Cooperation Agency, April 2008 In 2008 unit cost was US$85,000. In September 2008 both Raytheon and Alliant Techsystems were awarded competitive development contracts for Increment Ib mass production, but Raytheon secured the final manufacturing contract in August 2010. Test firings of Increment Ia-1 rounds in March 2009 revealed that the Honeywell inertial measurement unit was not up to standard, and it was replaced by a unit from Atlantic Inertial Systems. In April 2010 the U.S. Army's planned order was cut further, from 30,000 rounds to 6,264, which increased the unit cost sufficiently that it triggered an investigation under the Nunn‚ÄìMcCurdy Amendment. Normally a Nunn-McCurdy breach signals a program in trouble, but a 2012 RAND report concluded that the unit cost increases were caused by the cuts in procurement numbers: fewer shells were needed for the same effect, due to the improved accuracy of modern artillery. The Excalibur gives U.S. brigade commanders a precision weapon that is locally available, regardless of weather conditions (unlike bombs dropped from aircraft). Because the M982 is so accurate, the risks of friendly-fire casualties and collateral damage are no longer deterrents to using gun artillery in urban environments, and the Excalibur is sometimes called in only away from friendly infantrymen. In February 2012, a US Marine Corps M777 howitzer in Helmand province, Afghanistan, fired a single Excalibur round that killed a group of insurgents at a Marine-record range of .

Defense News. 6 February 2020. Excalibur N5 In September 2015, Raytheon conducted a live fire guided test flight of the Excalibur N5, a company-funded initiative to reduce the 155 mm Excalibur shell to for use with naval guns mounted on destroyers and cruisers. The Excalibur Ib and N5 have 70% commonality, 99% identical software, and the same guidance & navigation unit (GNU). Its primary uses would be to allow warships to accurately fire shells against land targets in support of troops ashore and inexpensively destroy fast attack craft (FAC) at longer ranges. Unguided shells from Mark 45 naval guns have a range of , but can deliver accurate fire only out to , while small cruise missile-carrying attack boats can launch from away. Like the land-based version, the Excalibur N5's guidance fins pop out after launch to glide the round out to longer ranges before turning nose-down and diving to the target, extending range to depending on gun barrel length; although range would be greater with rocket assistance, cost would also be greater. Alternative seekers will be added to hit maneuvering targets, such as laser guidance that requires a spotter to designate it, and millimeter wave radar that needs no outside guidance.

The last is called \\"Ram Power,\\" . Athletics Highland competes in athletics in IHSAA Class 5A, with the largest schools in the state. It is currently a member of the High Country Conference (5A), with Idaho Falls, Skyline, Hillcrest, and Madison. Intra-city rivals Pocatello and Century are in Class 4A; Pocatello was in the top classification until the arrival of Century in 1999. Highland's enrollment in 2011 was among the lowest in 5A. In its early years, Highland was a member of the Southern Idaho Conference, which spanned from Caldwell in the west to Idaho Falls in the east (the current SIC is limited to southwest Idaho, in both 5A and 4A). Over its history, the Highland football program has been one of the best in the state and last won the 5A state championship in 2014.idhsaa.org - Idaho high school football - state champions The Rams have won a total of ten official state championships, the first in 1984. Prior to the introduction of the A-1 (now 5A) playoffs in 1979, Highland won three unofficial state titles in the writers' poll, in 1972, 1973, and 1976, and were runners-up twice, in 1970 and 1975, behind only undefeated Borah of Boise both years. The boys' cross country team won nine state titles in ten years from 1981-90, with streaks of five and four consecutive titles.

Born in Krak√≥w, she was the eldest daughter of King Casimir IV of Poland of Poland and Archduchess Elisabeth of Austria. Life In 1468, her hand was requested by Matthias Corvinus, King of Hungary, who on 8 April of that year sent Protas ƒåernohorsk√Ω z Boskovic, Bishop of Olomouc as his representative. With this marriage, the Hungarian ruler hoped to gain a valuable ally against his rival for the Bohemian throne, George of Podƒõbrady. At the same time, negotiations began for a marriage between the second daughter of Casimir IV, Sophia with Archduke Maximilian of Austria, son and heir of Emperor Frederick III; thus, the Polish King would guarantee that future rulers of Austria and Hungary would be his descendants.Elizabeth of Austria, wife of Casimir IV and mother of Hedwig, was the sister of Ladislaus the Posthumous, King of Bohemia and Hungary and Duke of Austria, who died childless in 1457. The efforts of Matthias Corvinus for Hedwig's hand were supported by both the Emperor and Pope Paul II. However, since 1462, Casimir IV had had an alliance with George of Podƒõbrady, which caused Pope Pius II suspicion after the Thirteen Years' War, during which Poland fought against the Teutonic Order. In addition, the princess's mother Queen Elizabeth was also against the match, stating that Matthias is a peasant, a midget, a Vlach, a dog, simply not worthy of her (pl: Matyasz ch≈Çop, kurczek, Wo≈Çoszyn, pies, niegodziem jej).M. Duczmal: Jagiellonowie. Leksykon biograficzny, p. 282. Despite this, Bishop Protas was chosen to be godfather at the baptism of the new son of King Casimir IV, born on 27 April 1467, who was named Frederick after the Emperor. In 1469, the Catholic party of the Kingdom of Bohemia formally offered the crown to Matthias Corvinus. George of Podƒõbrady sought the support of Poland, promising the succession of the eldest son of Casimir IV, Vladislaus in exchange of their help. Corvinus, fearing this Polish-Bohemian alliance, again requested the hand of Hedwig, but was refused. On 20 October 1470, Casimir IV and Frederick signed a treaty in the city of Graz, and a possible marriage between Hedwig and Maximilian was also discussed. Matthias Corvinus asked the hand of Hedwig again in July 1471 and in September 1473 until finally, a definitive refusal was made by Queen Elizabeth. At the beginning of 1473, two counselors sent by Albert IV, Duke of Bavaria-Munich arrived in Poland with a marriage proposal; however, Casimir IV refused the offer because at that time, he was already negotiating a marriage between his eldest daughter and George, son and heir of Louis IX, Duke of Bavaria-Landshut. Casimir IV, in order to protect his south-western borders with the Kingdom of Bohemia (subject to the rivalry between his son Vladislaus and Matthias Corvinus), decided to enter into a closer alliance with Bavaria. In 1473, the Polish deputies Stanis≈Çaw Kurozwƒôcki and Pawe≈Ç Jasie≈Ñski were sent to the Landshut court to begin talks for a marriage between Hedwig and George. As a result, on 7 or 10 September 1474, Duke Louis IX of Bavaria- Landshut sent an official message asking Hedwig's hand for his son. Negotiations took place in the cities of ≈Åƒôczyca and Radom, where on 30 December, Hedwig agreed to marry George. The next day, the marriage contract was signed. Hedwig received as a dowry to the amount of 32,000 Hungarian z≈Çoty, payable in 5 installments over the next five years. The cost of the trip of the Polish princess to her new home reached 100,000 z≈Çoty. Due to the fact that the future spouses were closely related (Hedwig's maternal grandfather Albert V of Austria was a brother of George's paternal grandmother, Margaret of Austria), the Polish Royal Chancellor Uriel G√≥rka travelled to Rome in 1475 to seek the required dispensation, which was granted by Pope Sixtus IV on 26 May of that year. Hedwig arrived with her family in Pozna≈Ñ, where on 10 October 1475, she said goodbye to them. With a large retinue of approximately 1,200 knights, she arrived in Wittenberg on 23 October. She was accompanied, among others, by Anna, widow of Boles≈Çaw II, Duke of Cieszyn. On 14 November 1475, Hedwig and her retinue finally arrived in Landshut, an event which inspired the famous medieval pageant Landshut Wedding. The wedding ceremony took place that day at St. Martin's Church, with the service being officiated by Bernhard von Rohr, Archbishop of Salzburg. Several German rulers attended the wedding, included Emperor Frederick III and his son Maximilian, Albrecht III Achilles, Elector of Brandenburg, Sigismund, Archduke of Further Austria and ruler of Tirol, Philip, Elector Palatine, Albert, Margrave of Baden-Hachberg, Counts Ulrich V of W√ºrttemberg-Stuttgart and Eberhard V of W√ºrttemberg-Urach, Landgrave Louis I of Leuchtenberg and Count Otto of Henneberg-Aschach. The wedding feast was held the next day, with 9,000 people attending. Coats of arms of Duke George and Hedwig Jagiellon, Burghausen Castle. In 1479, Hedwig became Duchess-consort of Bavaria-Landshut after the death of her father-in-law. Her marriage was unsuccessful; her husband was a known alcoholic and womanizer. In 1485, George banished his wife from the Ducal court in Landshut and placed her in Burghausen Castle, where she lived with her own court and numerous servants, but ‚Äì according to contemporary chroniclers ‚Äì deprived of all the pleasures of the world and comforted only with her loneliness.M. Duczmal: Jagiellonowie. Leksykon biograficzny, p. 289. It is not known whether she was accompanied by her children in her exile. Hedwig, who signed her letters as geborene K√∂nigin von Polen (Queen of Poland by birth), didn't maintain close contact with her family. On 31 January 1503, her brother, King Alexander of Poland, wrote to her husband that he hadn't known that Hedwig had died eleven months previously. Hedwig, Duchess of Bavaria-Landshut, died unexpectedly on 18 February 1502 at Burghausen Castle. She was buried in the Cistercian monastery of Raitenhaslach near Burghausen. When the monastery was secularized in 1803, her tombstone was destroyed. However, there is a commemorative stone in the floor of the Church in the place where her grave was previously located.

It is the oldest of the three traditional high schools of the Pocatello/Chubbuck School District, and serves the southwest portion. The school colors are red and blue and the mascot is an Indian; the city's namesake, Chief Pocatello, was the leader of the Shoshone people. History The school was constructed in late spring and summer of 1892 at a cost of $18, 281. According to the Bannock County Historical Society, the school was originally called West Side School, holding all grades in the same school. Pocatello High School was the most impressive building in the area during the early 1900s and on many occasions the school served as a town square where concerts and athletic contests were held. Two presidents of the United States spoke on the grounds of Pocatello High School, President Theodore Roosevelt in 1902 and William Howard Taft in 1908.John F. Kennedy visited in 1962 and spoke during a campaign trip. In 1914, a fire started in the boiler room and the high school burnt completely to the ground. The school was rebuilt in exactly the same location. In 1939, the old school was remodeled and additions were made including a new gymnasium currently known as \\"the pit\\". In 1996 major renovations were added to the school which took three years to complete. These renovations included new floors, lights, sidewalks, heating system, and windows.Pocatello High Reborn A new gymnasium known as \\"the palace\\" was built between 2004 and 2006.

It was developed almost simultaneously in 1935 by Henry Eyring, Meredith Gwynne Evans and Michael Polanyi. The equation follows from the transition state theory, also known as activated- complex theory. If one assumes a constant enthalpy of activation and constant entropy of activation, the Eyring equation is similar to the empirical Arrhenius equation, despite the Arrhenius equation being empirical and the Eyring equation based on statistical mechanical justification. General form The general form of the Eyring‚ÄìPolanyi equation somewhat resembles the Arrhenius equation: \\\\ k = \\\\frac{\\\\kappa k_\\\\mathrm{B}T}{h}\\\\mathrm{e}^{-\\\\frac{\\\\Delta G^\\\\ddagger }{RT}} where ŒîG‚Ä° is the Gibbs energy of activation, Œ∫ is the transmission coefficient, kB is Boltzmann's constant, and h is Planck's constant. The transmission coefficient is often assumed to be equal to one as it reflects what fraction of the flux through the transition state proceeds to the product without recrossing the transition state, so a transmission coefficient equal to one means that the fundamental no-recrossing assumption of transition state theory holds perfectly. It can be rewritten as: k = \\\\frac{\\\\kappa k_\\\\mathrm{B}T}{h} \\\\mathrm{e}^{\\\\frac{\\\\Delta S^\\\\ddagger }{R}} \\\\mathrm{e}^{-\\\\frac{\\\\Delta H^\\\\ddagger}{RT}} One can put this equation in the following form: \\\\ln \\\\frac{k}{T} = \\\\frac{-\\\\Delta H^\\\\ddagger}{R} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{1}{T} + \\\\ln \\\\frac{\\\\kappa k_\\\\mathrm{B}}{h} + \\\\frac{\\\\Delta S^\\\\ddagger}{R} where: *\\\\ k = reaction rate constant *\\\\ T = absolute temperature *\\\\ \\\\Delta H^\\\\ddagger = enthalpy of activation *\\\\ R = gas constant *\\\\ k_\\\\mathrm{B} = Boltzmann constant *\\\\ h = Planck's constant *\\\\ \\\\Delta S^\\\\ddagger = entropy of activation If one assumes constant enthalpy of activation, constant entropy of activation, and constant transmission coefficient, this equation can be used as follows: A certain chemical reaction is performed at different temperatures and the reaction rate is determined. The plot of \\\\ \\\\ln(k/T) versus \\\\ 1/T gives a straight line with slope \\\\ -\\\\Delta H^\\\\ddagger/ R from which the enthalpy of activation can be derived and with intercept \\\\ \\\\ln(\\\\kappa k_\\\\mathrm{B}/h) + \\\\Delta S^\\\\ddagger/ R from which the entropy of activation is derived. Accuracy Transition state theory requires a value of the transmission coefficient, called \\\\kappa in that theory. This value is often taken to be unity (i.e., the species passing through the transition state AB^\\\\ddagger always proceed directly to products and never revert to reactants and ). To avoid specifying a value of \\\\kappa, the rate constant can be compared to the value of the rate constant at some fixed reference temperature (i.e., \\\\ k(T)/k(T_{Ref})) which eliminates the \\\\kappa factor in the resulting expression if one assumes that the transmission coefficient is independent of temperature. Error propagation formulas Error propagation formulas for \\\\ \\\\Delta H^\\\\ddagger and \\\\ \\\\Delta S^\\\\ddagger have been published. NotesReferences   Chapman, S. and Cowling, T.G.

Career Lange was born in Shrewsbury. His career began in 1997, signing his first recording contract with Additive Records in the UK. Early popularity was achieved with a collection of releases attracting the attention of industry leaders such as Paul van Dyk, Sasha, Paul Oakenfold and Judge Jules. A mixture of slow build-ups and melodic choruses gave Lange several hits in the UK Singles Chart. His first success was his remix of DJ Sakin's \\"Protect Your Mind\\", which became a club track. This was followed by his Lost Witness \\"Happiness Happening\\" remix. Other remix credits include work for Faithless and The Pet Shop Boys (the Lange remix of \\"New York City Boy\\" featured on their PopArt album's bonus \\"remix disc\\"). In 1999, he released the vinyl-only single \\"I Believe\\" featuring vocals by Sarah Dwyer charting at No. 68. A year later, in 2000, he released the single \\"Follow Me\\" on Positiva, featuring the vocals of Cecily Fay from The Morrighan. Upon its release, the track was deemed chart ineligible as the CD single contained six tracks (including the previous release \\"I Believe\\") and over 40 minutes of music (at the time, chart rules stated that CD singles could only contain three tracks with a total running length of 20 minutes). Thus the single reached No. 1 on the UK budget album chart upon release, staying in the chart for four weeks. \\"I Believe\\" and \\"Follow Me\\" were re-released as part of Positiva Records 10th birthday celebrations in 2003, reaching No. 12 in the UK budget album chart. \\"Drifting Away\\" reached No. 9 in the UK Singles Chart in 2002, and resulted in Lange performing on the BBC One's Top of the Pops and also the Pepsi Chart Show. Lange was also behind the SuReaL track \\"You Take My Breath Away\\", which peaked at No. 15 in the UK in 2000. Lange mixes have accumulated many appearances on compilation albums, including two tracks on the million-selling EMI Now That's What I Call Music! series. Other more club-orientated projects include his 'Firewall', 'LNG', and 'Vercetti' guises. In 2003, Firewall's \\"Sincere\\" was released on Armin Van Buuren's A State of Trance record label, and was re-released on Lange's own label, Lange Recordings. His 2003 track, \\"Don't Think It (Feel It)\\" (featuring Leah) peaked at No. 59 in the UK Singles Chart. In 2005, Lange went down the commercial road again with the release of the vocal track \\"If I ever see you again\\", under the name of Offbeat, however this only made number 136 in the UK Charts, probably due to it being a 12\\" release only despite the apparent mainstream appeal of the track. http://www.zobbel.de/cluk/CLUK_O.HTM Lange has found similar success as a club DJ, reaching No. 37 in the DJ Mag poll. As well as playing some of the UK's biggest clubs (including Godskitchen, Gatecrasher, Passion, Gallery, and Slinky), Lange regularly tours internationally. Touring has taken him to Australia, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Hungary, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, Russia, China, Singapore, Sweden, Switzerland, Ibiza, Canada and the United States. Lange has headlined music festivals including Australia's Summadayze (alongside Ti√´sto), the Popsicle festival in San Francisco, Spooky and WEMF in Canada, and Fortdance in St Petersburg performing alongside Ferry Corsten and Ti√´sto. He released his debut album Better Late Than Never on Maelstrom and Lange Recordings in 2007. The album had one CD of new material, and a second disc called History that highlighted some of his past hits from 1998 to the present. Three singles from the album had successful releases; those were \\"Songless\\", \\"Angel Falls\\" and the most successful release, \\"Lange feat. Sarah Howells ‚Äì Out of the Sky\\". That release retained a top 10 position on the Beatport Trance Chart for a considerable time after the track's release in October 2008, and earned Lange the nomination as one of the Beatport Top 10 selling Trance Artists in 2008. In 2010, he released his second album, Harmonic Motion. In 2013, his third album \\"We Are Lucky People\\" was released.

It is found in Somalia, the Southern Red Sea region of Eritrea, and the Afar Region of Ethiopia. The legs of the Somali wild ass are striped, resembling those of its relative, the zebra. Current distribution and habitat There are likely fewer than 1,000 animals (or even 700) in the wild and the IUCN Red List of endangered species described it as \\"critically endangered\\". This means they face an extremely high risk of extinction in the wild. A few hundred specimens live in Somalia, Eritrea and Ethiopia. Reproduction Somali Wild Asses typically give birth in the spring, a common characteristic among equids, after a year-long gestation. Within hours, the foal is up on its legs and keeping up with its mother. At around five days old, the foal is already nibbling grass. By the time its two weeks old, the foal is grazing regularly, however, still depending on its mother's milk for fluids. The foal is weaned by 12 to 14 months, but still stays close to its mother, only leaving to play or feed with the other foals in the herd. Behavior Due to the limited resources found in their habitat, Somali Wild Asses live in a fission-fusion society. Most adults live alone, but sometimes form small herds consisting of females and their young. In areas that have more resources, or have more rain, they will sometimes fuse together to form larger temporary herds. Stallions can maintain territories as large as nine square miles. They frequently leave dung piles as markers to remind them of their territory's boundaries. While females are welcome in their territories, stallions will often fight other males who try to mate with females in their territories. However, stallions have been observed allowing males into their territories for grazing, as long as they show no interest in his harem. Captivity=Global population , there are about 200 individuals in captivity around the globe living in 34 zoos, as well as three animals (as of 2009) in the Yotvata Hai-Bar Nature Reserve in Israel, to the north of Eilat. The international studbook is managed by Tierpark Berlin. Zoo Basel Somali Wild Ass at Zoo Basel The leading zoo for breeding this rare ass is Zoo Basel, Switzerland. Its breeding program manages the European studbook for the Somali wild ass and coordinates the European Endangered Species Programme (EEP) ‚Äì as well as the global species committee of the Somali Wild Ass since 2004. Zoo Basel started keeping Somali wild asses in 1970 and had its first birth in 1972. Since then, 11 stallions and 24 females (as of 2009) were born and survived childhood. Today, all Somali wild donkeys in captivity are related to the original group at Zoo Basel. As of January 18, 2012, there are four Somali wild donkeys in Basel: The stallion \\"Gigolo\\" (3) and three females (among them \\"Yogala\\"-14). France Since 1987, the R√©serve Africaine de Sigean, in the south of France, has had a number of Somali wild asses, with births occurring regularly, including two on June 30, 2010 and March 29, 2013. United States Only five institutions breed Somali wild ass in the United States: Dallas Zoo, St. Louis Zoo, San Diego Zoo Safari Park, Zoo Miami, and White Oak Conservation in Yulee, Florida. White Oak received a herd in 2008 as part of an international effort to save Somali wild ass from extinction. Since then, the herd has produced 18 foals, including several born in spring 2013. The Dallas Zoo has just had two Somali wild ass foals, both female, one born July 9 and the other on July 19, 2017. The St. Louis Zoo's most recent birth was on July 30, 2019. The San Diego Zoo Safari Park is home to eleven Somali Wild Asses, the largest population of Somali Wild Asses in North America. The park received its first herd from the Basel Zoo in 1981. Their first foal was born in 1986. Since then, 49 foals have been born, the most recent being a female born on March 17, 2018. San Diego Zoo Global also works to help save this endangered species in the wild. Domestication Marwell Zoo Domestic donkeys found in Italy are typically descended from the Somali wild ass, as opposed to those from other European countries where domesticated stock are usually descended from the Nubian wild ass. Conservation A conservation project (mainly supported by Zoo Basel) in Eritrea counted (before 2014) 47 Somali wild asses living in the mountains between the Buri Peninsula and the Dalool Depression, which is within the larger Danakil Depression, near Eritrea's border with Ethiopia. As mentioned above, a protected population of the Somali wild ass exists in the Yotvata Hai-Bar Nature Reserve. This Israeli reserve was established in 1968 with the view to bolster populations of endangered desert species. NotesReferences * Moehlman, Patricia D. (ed). 2002.

The standard entropy of activation is symbolized ŒîS‚Ä° and equals the change in entropy when the reactants change from their initial state to the activated complex or transition state (Œî = change, S = entropy, ‚Ä° = activation). It determines the preexponential factor A of the Arrhenius equation for temperature dependence of reaction rates. The relationship depends on the molecularity of the reaction: for reactions in solution and unimolecular gas reactions A = (ekBT/h) exp(ŒîS‚Ä°/R), while for bimolecular gas reactions A = (e2kBT/h) (RT/p) exp(ŒîS‚Ä°/R). In these equations e is the base of natural logarithms, h is the Planck constant, kB is the Boltzmann constant and T the absolute temperature. R' is the ideal gas constant in units of (bar¬∑L)/(mol¬∑K). The factor is needed because of the pressure dependence of the reaction rate. R' = 8.3145 √ó 10‚àí2 (bar¬∑L)/(mol¬∑K).Laidler, K.J. and Meiser J.H. Physical Chemistry (Benjamin/Cummings 1982) p.381-2 The value of ŒîS‚Ä° provides clues about the molecularity of the rate determining step in a reaction, i.e. the number of molecules that enter this step.Laidler and Meiser p.365 Positive values suggest that entropy increases upon achieving the transition state, which often indicates a dissociative mechanism in which the activated complex is loosely bound and about to dissociate. Negative values for ŒîS‚Ä° indicate that entropy decreases on forming the transition state, which often indicates an associative mechanism in which two reaction partners form a single activated complex.James H.

Instead of using a Stratocaster-body style, it uses one similar to a Jaguar/Jazzmaster body style. It was also a departure from the typical \\"Stratocaster\\"-style headstock, instead featuring a long headstock nicknamed the \\"hockey-stick\\" headstock. The original Electric XII employed a unique split pickup design and had a 4-way pickup rotary selector allowing for neck, neck & bridge in parallel, in or out of phase, and bridge only options as opposed to the Alternate Reality version which sports a standard 3-way toggle switch for pickup selection. It also used a string-through-body design similar to a Telecaster to help increase sustain. Designed by Leo Fender, the Fender Electric XII was introduced in late 1965 with the bulk of the production taking place in 1966 before it was discontinued around 1970. Unlike its competitors' electric 12-string models which were simply existing 6-string guitars with six extra strings, the Fender Electric XII was a purpose-built 12-string designed to capture a part of the folk-rock market. The bridge has an individual saddle for each string making precise intonation possible. The Electric XII was not particularly popular during its run, and by 1969, it was dropped from the Fender line before being reintroduced as a part of the Alternate Reality series in 2019. The body overstock was used for the Fender Custom ( Fender Maverick). Some notable users of the Electric XII were Pete Townshend, who used it extensively on the album Tommy, folk-rocker Tim Buckley, and Jimmy Page, who used it on Led Zeppelin's famous \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" on the studio recording and on Jeff Beck's \\"Beck's Bolero\\". Gene Clark of The Byrds was seen using one on a May 1965 television appearance. Eric Clapton used it for the recording of \\"Dance the Night Away\\" with the band Cream in 1967. Lou Reed and Sterling Morrison purchased matching Fender XIIs before the sessions for the Velvet Underground's eponymous third album in 1968. Johnny Winter also used one briefly (strung as a regular six-string) during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Also in the 1980s, Bryan Adams' hit \\"Summer of '69\\" was built around a Fender Electric XII riff. Pye Hastings used one during the early days of Caravan, notably on their album For Girls Who Grow Plump In The Night in 1973. Gustavo Cerati of Soda Stereo played and recorded with a Fender XII between 1988 and 1990, notably seen in the videos of \\"En la ciudad de la furia\\" and \\"de M√∫sica ligera\\". Chad Taylor of Live prominently used a lake placid blue Fender XII both on stage and in the studio, most notably to write and record the single \\"Run to the Water\\", as well as several other tracks on the band's platinum album The Distance to Here. Krist Novoselic of Nirvana also played the Fender XII while he was in Sweet 75. The Verve guitarist Nick McCabe used a Fender Electric XII for live performances on the band's 2008 comeback tour, notably on 'Space and Time' from their 1997 album Urban Hymns. Tom Petty used a white Fender XII for the first half of his 2006 North American Tour instead of his signature Rickenbacker 12-string. John Paisano, the \\"official\\" guitarist of Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass used the Fender Electric XII extensively. It is heard in the intro of their recording of \\"Wade in the Water\\". The guitar is also seen played by Steve Bartek on the Oingo Boingo Farewell DVD/video. Jason Mozersky of Relentless7 also uses an Electric XII. Mike Einziger, guitarist of Californian band Incubus, used an Electric 12 for the intro of the song \\"Love Hurts\\" off the band's 2008 album, \\"Light Grenades\\".

The Gaels are an ethno- linguistic group, traditionally viewed as having spread from Ireland to Scotland and the Isle of Man. \\"Gaelic\\", as a linguistic term, refers to the Gaelic languages but can also refer to the transmission of any other Gaelic cultural feature such as social norms and customs, music and sport. It is often referred to as a part of Celtic identity as Ireland, Scotland and the Isle of Man are all considered Celtic Nations, and the Gaelic languages are considered a sub-group of the Celtic languages, of which many such as Welsh for example have also undergone Celticisation. Early history Examples of Gaelicisation in history include the Picts, Hiberno-Normans, Scoto-Normans and Norse-Gaels. Modern era Today, Gaelicisation, or more often re- Gaelicisation, of placenames, surnames and given names is often a deliberate effort to help promote the languages and to counteract centuries of Anglicisation. Isle of Man The Manx language, which is very similar to Irish, has undergone a major revival in recent years, despite the language being so rarely used that it was even mislabelled as extinct by a United Nations report as recently as 2009. The decline of the language on the island was primarily as a result of stigmatisation and high levels of emigration to England. There are now primary schools teaching in the medium of Manx Gaelic, after efforts mainly modelled on the Irish system. The efforts have been widely praised, with further developments such as using technology to teach the language being put into place. IrelandIrish= Estimates of numbers of native speakers of the Irish language in the Republic of Ireland in 2000 ranged from 20,000 to 80,000.: 20,000 to 80,000 speakers out of a population of 3.5 to 5 million. According to the 2006 census for the Republic, 85,000 people used Irish daily outside of school and 1.2 million used Irish at least occasionally. In the 2011 Census, these numbers increased to 94,000 and 1.3 million, respectively. Active Irish speakers probably comprise 5 to 10 per cent of Ireland's population. In recent decades there has been a significant increase in the number of urban Irish speakers, particularly in Dublin. The dispersed but large, educated and middle-class urban Gaeilgeoir community enjoys a lively cultural life and is buoyed by the growth of Irish medium education and Irish-language media. In some official Gaeltachta√≠ (Irish- speaking regions) areas, Irish remains a vernacular language alongside English. In Northern Ireland the Gaelicisation process is significantly slower and less-supported than elsewhere on the island and the status of the Irish language in Northern Ireland is the subject of heated political debates.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern- ireland-50978082https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/explainer- breaking-the-deadlock-over-an-irish-language-act-1.4135275 =Ulster Scots= Ulster Scots is spoken in mid and east Antrim, north Down, north- east County Londonderry, and in the fishing villages of the Mourne coast. It is also spoken in the Laggan district and parts of the Finn Valley in east Donegal and in the south of Inishowen in north Donegal.Caroline I. Macafee (ed.), A Concise Ulster Dictionary. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1996; pp. xi‚Äìxii. The 1999 Northern Ireland Life and Times Survey found that 2% of Northern Ireland residents claimed to speak Ulster Scots, which would mean a total speech community of approximately 30,000 in the territory. Other estimates range from 35,000 in Northern Ireland, to an \\"optimistic\\" total of 100,000 including the Republic of Ireland (mainly the east of County Donegal). In the 2011 census of Northern Ireland, 16,373 people (0.9% of the population) stated that they can speak, read, write and understand Ulster Scots and 140,204 people (8.1% of the population) reported having some ability in Ulster Scots. Scotland In Scotland, Scottish Gaelic and traditional Gaelic customs such those manifested at the Highland Games, with traditional sports such as the caber toss, are mainly restricted to the Highlands and islands. In the 21st Century, Scottish Gaelic literature has seen development and challenges within the area of prose fiction publication,Storey, John (2011) \\"Contemporary Gaelic fiction: development, challenge and opportunity\\" Lainnir a‚Äô Bh√πirn' - The Gleaming Water: Essays on Modern Gaelic Literature, edited by Emma Dymock & Wilson McLeod, Dunedin Academic Press. and phrases such as Alba gu br√†th may be used today as a catch-phrase or rallying cry.

P.4&:1-1948 Dudley North, 3rd Baron North (158116 January 1666) was an English nobleman and politician. Biography North was the son of Sir John North and of Dorothy, daughter and heiress of Sir Valentine Dale. He succeeded his grandfather, Roger North, 2nd Baron North, at the age of nineteen. He was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, and married in 1599 Frances, daughter of Sir John Brocket of Brocket Hall in Hertfordshire. He travelled in Italy, took part in the campaign of 1602 in the Netherlands, and on his return became a conspicuous figure at court, excelling in athletic exercises as well as in poetry and music, and gaining the friendship of Prince Henry. In 1606, while returning from Eridge to London, he discovered the springs at The Pantiles, Tunbridge Wells, which cured North himself of a complaint and quickly became famous. He also recommended the Epsom springs to the public. He supported and subscribed to the expedition to Guyana made by his brother Roger North () in 1619, and when Roger departed without leave Dudley was imprisoned for two days in the Fleet. In 1626 he attached himself to the party of Lord Saye and Sele in the Lords, who were in sympathy with the aims of the Commons; and when the civil war broke out he was on the side of the parliament. In 1641 he was a member of the Lords committee on Religion, and served on the committee to consider Laud's attainder in 1644, finally voting for the ordinance in January 1645. He was placed on the admiralty commission in 1645, and acted as Lord Lieutenant of Cambridgeshire. He was one of the small group of Lords who continued attendance in the House of Peers, and on 19 December 1648, with three others, visited Fairfax, when they \\"cast down their honors at his Excellency's feet\\" and protested their desire not to retain any privileges prejudicial to the public interest.Gardiner's Civil War, iv. 285 He passed the rest of his life in retirement at Kirtling in Cambridgeshire. He died leaving a daughter (Dorothy) and two sons, the elder of which, Sir Dudley, succeeded him as the 4th Baron North. Works Dudley North wrote A Forest of Varieties (1645), a miscellany of essays and poems, another edition of which was published in 1659 under the title of A Forest promiscuous of various Seasons' Productions.

History One of great hotels of the 19th-century Europe, the Grand Hotel Europe opened its doors to the public on 28 January 1875, replacing an earlier inn situated on the same site. In the 1910s, the hotel was remodelled in the Art Nouveau style to designs by Fyodor Lidval and Leon Benois. The latest major renovation was carried out between 1989 and 1991. The hotel was featured in the 1995 James Bond movie GoldenEye. However, none of the movie was shot at the hotel, the exterior used was actually the Langham Hotel, London, while the interiors were sets. Its marble-and-gilt interiors, sweeping staircases and elegant furniture have attracted crowds of well-to-do visitors, including Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky, Elton John, Bill Clinton, Ivan Turgenev, Claude Debussy, H. G. Wells, Igor Stravinsky, Gustav V of Sweden and Jacques Chirac to name only a few notables who lodged there.

Devo 2.0 (also known as DEV2.O) was a pop group quintet, created for Walt Disney Records (with the participation of Devo), of child actors who sing, dance, and (in their music videos and photo shoots) mime playing instruments along to songs re-recorded by some of the original members of Devo. Jerry Casale directed all nine of the videos. Actress Jacqueline Emerson, who later appeared in The Hunger Games, was a member. The band split up in 2007 when lead singer Nicole Stoehr and lead guitarist Nathan Norman quit after their album was a flop.  Background  While the music on the album was written and recorded by DEVO and merely dubbed in over footage in which the four dancing children appear to be performing, some of the members are musicians. Devo 2.0 band member Nathan Norman states they do play their own instruments with mild help from sequencers. Mark Mothersbaugh said that the band re- recorded their own music due to budgetary restraints. An eponymous DVD and CD combo was released March 14, 2006. Two new songs, \\"Cyclops\\" and \\"The Winner\\", were written by Devo for the album. In the summer of 2006 the band began a limited series of live performances. Altered lyrics The lyrics to some of the songs they perform have been edited to make them more \\"family friendly\\" and remove much of the innuendo and irony typical of Devo songs. * In \\"Through Being Cool\\", for instance, the line \\"Eliminate the ninnies and the twits\\" is changed to \\"Eliminate the time you waste in cliques\\". * The innuendo-filled \\"Girl U Want\\" is perhaps the most-changed song with all lyrics modified, and is sung by Devo 2.0's singer Nicole Stoehr as \\"Boy U Want\\". *The song \\"Beautiful World\\" remains mostly unchanged until the end, where the words, \\"It's a beautiful world for you/It's not for me\\" have been changed to \\"It's a beautiful world for you/I guess me too\\". In addition, the bridge lyrics \\"Boy and girl with the new clothes on/You can shake it to me all night long hey hey\\" have been changed to \\"Boy and girl with the new clothes on/You can pose and party all day long hey hey\\". *In \\"Big Mess\\" the line \\"I'm a boy with a gun\\" became \\"I'm a girl havin' fun\\". *In \\"Freedom of Choice\\", the line \\"Freedom from choice is what you want\\" was changed to \\"Freedom of choice is what you want\\", and the line \\"he went in circles/til he dropped dead\\" became \\"he went in circles/til he dropped down\\". *The theme of \\"Uncontrollable Urge\\" changed from social anxiety to craving snack foods, and \\"Jerkin' Back 'N Forth\\", a song about a woman saying one thing but meaning another, is now a perky song about dancing. * The song \\"The Winner\\" is a re-recording with new lyrics of \\"If the Shoe Fits\\" by Jihad Jerry & the Evildoers. The anti-George W. Bush sentiment was replaced by a song about perseverance and thinking for oneself. In 2010, Jerry Casale in an interview conducted by the AV Club's Sam Adams, mentioned his amusement by Disney's forced alterations, saying, \\"You went beyond getting mad to just like going, 'This is proof of devolution.

This visualization begins by showing how a typical spacecraft (NIMBUS-7) communicated with the ground before TDRS. Visualization depicting TDRS satellites communicating with customer satellites. A tracking and data relay satellite (TDRS) is a type of communications satellite that forms part of the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) used by NASA and other United States government agencies for communications to and from independent \\"User Platforms\\" such as satellites, balloons, aircraft, the International Space Station, and remote bases like the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station. This system was designed to replace an existing worldwide network of ground stations that had supported all of NASA's crewed flight missions and uncrewed satellites in low-Earth orbits. The primary system design goal was to increase the amount of time that these spacecraft were in communication with the ground and improve the amount of data that could be transferred. These TDRSS satellites are all designed and built to be launched to and function in geosynchronous orbit, above the surface of the Earth. The first seven TDRSS satellites were built by the TRW corporation. The three later versions have been manufactured by the Boeing corporation's Satellite Systems division. Thirteen satellites have been launched; however, one was destroyed in the Challenger disaster. TDRS-1 was decommissioned in October 2009. TDRS-4 was decommissioned in December 2011. Ten TDRSS satellites are currently in service. All of the TDRSS satellites have been managed by NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. The contract for TDRS versions L & K was awarded to Boeing on December 20, 2007. On November 30, 2011, NASA announced the decision to order an additional third-generation TDRS satellite, TDRS M. Operations The first tracking and data relay satellite was launched in 1983 on the Space Shuttle Challenger's first flight, STS-6. The Boeing-built Inertial Upper Stage that was to take the satellite from Challenger's orbit to its ultimate geosynchronous orbit suffered a failure that caused it not to deliver the TDRS to the correct orbit. As a result, it was necessary to command the satellite to use its onboard rocket thrusters to move it into its correct orbit. This expenditure of fuel reduced its capability to remain in a geostationary orbit; by late 1997 the orbit had changed to the point that the satellite was able to see the South Pole, and an uplink/downlink station was installed at Amundsen‚ÄìScott South Pole Station in January 1998; TDRS-1 was an important communication uplink for Antarctic research until 2009. The second tracking and data relay satellite was destroyed along with Challenger shortly after launch during the STS-51-L mission in January 1986. The next five TRW- built TDRSS satellites were successfully launched on other Space Shuttles. Three follow-up Boeing-built satellites were launched by Atlas rockets in 2000 and 2002. A NASA Press Release summarized the capabilities of the system as a whole: > \\"Working solo, TDRS-1 provided more communication coverage, in support of > the September 1983 Shuttle mission, than the entire network of NASA tracking > stations had provided in all previous Shuttle missions.\\" The first generation of TDRS are planned to be retired in 2015. TDRSS ground terminals The two TDRSS satellite ground terminals are located at NASA White Sands Complex, which is in the Las Cruces area. All radioed commands and received telemetry that go to and from the tracking and data relay satellites go by way of these terminals at the White Sands Complex. At first, just one large ground terminal system for the TDRSS was designed and built. However, some years later, due to increased user demand NASA ordered the design and construction of a second ground terminal system about away. Thus, there are now two functionally identical and redundant satellite ground terminals there, which are known as the White Sands Complex. Due to a Zone of Exclusion, no user support over the Indian Ocean, a ground terminal was built in Guam to support TDRS.  Bilateration ranging transponder system  The bilateration ranging transponder system (BRTS) provides tracking support for TDRS spacecraft. BRTS consists of four sites located at White Sands Missile Range (WSC), Guam (GRGT), Ascension Island (ACN), and Alice Springs, Australia (ALS).Space Network Ground Segment Sustainment (SGSS) Mission System Requirements Document (MSRD). Section 3.5. NASA/GSFC: November 21, 2008 Design The communications systems of the TDRSS satellites were designed to support multiple missions at the same time. Each satellite has S band, Ku band (1st Gen only), and Ka band (2nd gen only) electronic communication systems hardware that operate at different carrier frequencies and also support various data-rates. The newer Boeing satellites are able to support more communications than the older TRW-built satellites.

Thus, satellites that are lost in launch failures or have massive malfunctions are never numbered.

The base three geosynchronous satellites (one a standby) track and receive data from satellites for relay to a ground station. The two primary active satellites are separated in orbit by at least 130 degrees longitude. One system is used for tracking satellites with apogees below 2000 km (the great majority of satellites), and the other for those with higher apogees. Use of operating frequencies near 2150 (plus or minus 150) MHz and near 14.3 (plus or minus 0.9) GHz were the initial plan. TDRSS was originally intended to support satellites with apogees below 12,000 km. Spacecraft in the TDRSS require only one communications system, since ground-based telemetry stations will be compatible with TDRSS equipment.

Cast in 953, the iron lion is the largest known and oldest surviving iron-cast artwork in China. Description Recreation of the Iron Lion The Iron Lion in 1907 The Iron Lion of Cangzhou is 5.78 m (19 ft) high, 6.5 m (21 ft 4 in) long, 3.17 m (10 ft 5 in) wide, and has an estimated weight of 40 tonnes (44 tons). According to Donald B. Wagner, it is 5.4 m high, 5.35 m long, 3 m wide, and weighs 50 tonnes. On its back, it carries a basin-shaped lotus throne with a maximum diameter of about 2 m (6 ft 7 in) and a height of 70 cm (28 in). Presumably, the iron lion was originally displayed inside a Buddhist temple and carried a bronze statue of the bodhisattva Manjusri on the lotus seat. The bronze statue was later removed, maybe because of the higher value of the bronze.http://donwagner.dk/CANGZHOU/CANGZHOU.html The iron lion is a cultural icon in Cangzhou, the city is referred to as the \\"Lion City\\" and a local beer (Cangzhou Lion Beer) is named after the sculpture. Casting The iron lion was cast using a piece-moulding technique in a single mould. In this technique, which has also been used in ancient Chinese bronze-casting, a clay model of the sculpture is made and covered with a new layer of clay after drying. This outer layer of clay is then cut into pieces and removed before it dries completely. In the next step, material is taken off the surface of the inner clay model in order to provide room for pouring the iron between the outer and inner mould. Hence, \\"seams\\" visible on the cast do not represent boundaries between separate iron pieces, but are impressions of the seams between the pieces of the outer mould. Casting did proceed in several stages between which the iron already poured into the mould did cool down. As a result, fault lines were introduced into the cast at regular intervals which mark the filling height of the mould at successive casting stages. These fault lines were bridged by the craftsmen carrying out the cast with pieces of wrought iron which were plunged into the solidifying surface of the iron from the previous pour and then covered in the next pour. Traces of these bridging pegs as well as those of wrought iron spacers used to separate the outer mould from the core can still be found in the sculpture. Conservation Over the years, the iron lion sculpture has sustained various kinds of damage: By 1603, its tail had been lost. In 1803, a storm toppled the statue resulting in damage to its snout and belly. In 1886, it was supported with stones and bricks on the orders of a local magistrate. In 1961, it was listed as a national key cultural relic. In 1984, the iron lion was remounted on a stone pedestal. Its legs were filled with a sulfate compound. Probably due to these interventions, cracks began to appear in the sculpture. Therefore, most of the compound was removed during restoration work carried out in 2000.

The first issue of Feature Funnies Publication history The series started out as a reprint collection of newspaper comic strips that was published by Harry \\"A\\" Chesler between 1937 and 1939, for twenty issues entitled Feature Funnies. It featured cannily mixed color reprints of popular newspaper comic strips like Joe Palooka, Mickey Finn and Dixie Dugan with a smattering of new features. Publisher Everett M. \\"Busy\\" Arnold, deducing that Depression-era audiences wanted established quality and familiar comic strips for their hard- earned dimes, formed the suitably titled Comic Favorites, Inc. in collaboration with three newspaper syndicates: the McNaught Syndicate, the Frank J. Markey Syndicate and Iowa's Register and Tribune Syndicate. (Comic Favorites later became an imprint of Arnold's Quality Comics, established in 1939.) Hiring cartoonist Rube Goldberg and Goldberg's assistant, Johnny Devlin,Jay, Alex. \\"Ink-Slinger Profiles by Alex Jay: Johnny Devlin,\\" Stripper's Guide (June 11, 2018). Arnold in mid-1937 began publishing Feature Funnies from his office as at 389 Lexington Avenue in Manhattan. Goldberg drew many of the covers. The new material came from comics \\"packagers,\\" small studios that sprang up to produce comics on demand for publishers looking to enter the emerging comic-book field. Arnold initially bought from the quirkily named Harry \\"A\\" Chesler shop but later relied solely on Eisner & Iger, headed by Will Eisner and Jerry Iger. \\"I believe the first feature I purchased from Eisner & Iger was 'Espionage' in 1938 for Feature Comics (then Feature Funnies),\\" Arnold recalled in the early 1970s.Steranko, Jim, The Steranko History of Comics 2 (Supergraphics, 1972), p. 92 Other newspaper comic strip characters in Feature Funnies included the constantly bickering Bungle Family and girl reporter Jane Arden.

The heritage-listed area is located approximately north of Perth, along the East Indian Ocean. The distinctive Ningaloo Reef that fringes the Ningaloo Coast is long and is Australia's largest fringing coral reef and the only large reef positioned very close to a landmass. The coast and reef draw their name from the Australian Aboriginal Wajarri language word ningaloo meaning \\"promontory\\", \\"deepwater\\", or \\"high land jutting into the sea\\". The Yamatji peoples of the Baiyungu and Yinigudura clans have inhabited the area for over 30,000 years.

Cape Range National Park and Ningaloo Reef from the air. The World Heritage status of the region was created and negotiated in 2011, and the adopted boundary included the Ningaloo Marine Park (Commonwealth waters), Ningaloo Marine Park (State waters) and Muiron Islands Marine Management Area (including the Muiron Islands), Jurabi Coastal Park, Bundegi Coastal Park, Cape Range National Park, and the Learmonth Air Weapons Range. The site was gazetted on the Australian National Heritage List on 6 January 2010 under the . In 1987 the reef and surrounding waters were designated as the Ningaloo Marine Park. Reputation Although most famed for its whale sharks which feed there during March to June, the reef is also rich in coral and other marine life. During the winter months, the reef is part of the migratory routes for dolphins, dugongs, manta rays and humpback whales. The beaches of the reef are an important breeding ground of the loggerhead, green and hawksbill turtles. They also depend on the reef for nesting and food. The Ningaloo supports an abundance of fish (500 species), corals (300 species), molluscs (600 species) and many other marine invertebrates. The reef is less than half a kilometre offshore in some areas, such as Coral Bay. In 2006, researchers from the Australian Institute of Marine Science discovered gardens of sponges in the marine park's deeper waters that are thought to be species completely new to science. The short- nosed sea snake, thought to have been extinct for 17 years, was found on Ningaloo Reef in December 2015. Conservation controversy In the early 2000s there was much controversy about the proposed construction of a resort at an area called Mauds Landing, which was a major nesting ground of the loggerhead turtle. It was also feared that the resort would be generally degrading to the entire marine park. Author Tim Winton, who lives in the area, was vocal in his opposition to the development. In 2002, when he won the WA Premier's Book Award, he donated the 25,000 prize money to the community campaign to save the reef. Ultimately the planned resort did not go ahead. However, developers continue to take an interest in the area. Ningaloo Collaborative Research Cluster The Ningaloo Collaboration Cluster is a major research project that commenced in the region in 2007. It is part of the CSIRO flagship Collaboration Fund Research Initiative. The project involves researchers from the CSIRO, Sustainable Tourism Cooperative Research Centre and a range of Australian Universities including Curtin University of Technology, Murdoch University, University of Western Australia, Australian National University and the University of Queensland. The project will deliver a dynamic model of Ningaloo incorporating socioeconomic and environmental load implications of human activity in the region that can be integrated with an ecological model of the region with the ultimate aim of developing planning tools and management models to ensure sustainable use of the region. The study involves the collection and processing of socioeconomic data from tourists and the host communities of Exmouth, Coral Bay and Carnarvon. It also involves the collection of data concerning the environmental load of human activity including natural resource use, waste generation, pollution, visual impacts and impacts on flora and fauna. The interactive project involves key stakeholders in the region including the WA Department of Environment and Conservation, the Shires of Carnarvon and Exmouth, local tourism organisations and Tourism WA, the Gascoyne Development Commission, the WA Department of Water and Environment, researchers from Wealth from the Oceans and Ningaloo Project, Chambers of Commerce, WA Department of Energy and Resources, WA Department of Fisheries, the WA Department for Planning and Infrastructure, the Ningaloo Sustainable Development Committee and Ningaloo Sustainable Development Office, Yamatji Land and Sea Council representatives, and the Ningaloo research community along with other cluster project members and the state's Ningaloo project.

Points could be used to purchase video games and downloadable content from Xbox Live Marketplace, digital content such as music and videos on Zune Marketplace, along with content from Windows Live Gallery. In June 2013, Microsoft announced that it would phase out Microsoft Points by the end of 2013, in favor of using local cash currencies (such as the United States dollar and Euro) on its digital distribution platforms. An Xbox 360 software update implementing this change was released on August 26, 2013; users' existing Microsoft Points were converted into an equivalent amount of local currency for purchases.  Distribution  Microsoft Points were sold online and through gift cards at retail outlets. In North America, points could only be purchased in 400 point increments. In the United States, the minimum 400 points cost $5 to purchase, 800 cost $10, while 1600 cost $20.  Criticism  The Microsoft Points system was criticized for being deceptive in terms of actual real-world cost, as well as for users often having to purchase more points at once than those they immediately needed. In his review of the Zune, Paul Thurrott argued that \\"a song on Zune typically costs 79 Microsoft Points, which, yes, is about 99 cents. But it seems to be less because it's just 79 Points.\\" Walter Mossberg also noted that \\"to buy even a single 99 cent song from the Zune store, you have to purchase blocks of \\"points\\" from Microsoft, in increments of at least $5. You can't just click and have the 99 cents deducted from a credit card, as you can with iTunes. So, even if you are buying only one song, you have to allow Microsoft to hold on to at least $4.01 of your money until you buy another.\\" Xbox product director Aaron Greenberg defended the Points system, arguing that the system was intended to reduce the number of individual credit card transaction fees Microsoft would have to manage for its users.  Discontinuation  The Xbox services launched alongside Windows 8‚ÄîXbox Music and Xbox Video (which both succeed Zune Marketplace) defaulted to using credit card transactions with local currency for purchases instead of Microsoft Points. However, when accessed from an Xbox 360 console, users were still required to pay using Microsoft Points. In May 2013, reports indicated that Microsoft Points would be discontinued entirely in favor of unified gift cards with currency that would work across Xbox, Windows Store, and Windows Phone Store. Microsoft's plans to discontinue Points were confirmed during its E3 2013 media event focusing on the Xbox One, and took effect with the roll-out of an Xbox 360 software update on August 26, 2013.

The PR&A; and PR&WC; had originally been part of the Central of Georgia Railroad but the South Carolina Legislature had forced the railroad to give up the subsidiary lines. The Atlantic Coast Line Railroad (ACL) took over the C&WC; in 1897 but operated it as a subsidiary until 1959 when the ACL fully absorbed it. Much of the original system is still in use by ACL successor CSX Transportation. Origins When the Charleston & Western Carolina Railway was created in 1896, it combined two existing railroads, the Port Royal and Augusta Railway and the Port Royal and Western Carolina Railway into a single entity. The oldest portion of the line, the PR&A;, ran from Port Royal to Augusta, a distance of following its completion in 1873. It was financed by the Georgia Railroad of Augusta, which sought to extend its own network and gain access to a port on the east coast. Fearing its port at Savannah would be compromised by any expansion of the facilities at Port Royal, the Central of Georgia Railway took control of the Port Royal & Augusta in 1881. The Central of Georgia sought to expand into the western portion of South Carolina in order to funnel traffic through their lines out of Augusta. In order to accomplish this goal, the Central leased the Augusta and Knoxville Railroad in 1883, which owned a line from Augusta to Greenwood. Shortly thereafter, the Central financed construction of three new lines; the first was an extension from Greenwood to Spartanburg, completed in 1885, the second a branch from McCormick to Anderson, , and a final branch from Laurens to Greenville, . In 1886, all of these branches including the Augusta & Knoxville were merged to create the Port Royal and Western Carolina Railway. Financial trouble in 1894 caused the Central of Georgia to lose control of both companies. Finally, in 1896, the Charleston & Western Carolina Railway was organized to consolidate both railroads into a single entity. The result was a railroad network covering most of western South Carolina. In 1897, the Atlantic Coast Line took control of the C&WC; and operated the railroad as an independent company. The C&WC; operated passenger train service between Augusta and Port Royal, with a major transfer stop at Yemassee, South Carolina. At the Yemassee passengers could transfer to ACL trains to Savannah and to Charleston. Passenger service ended between 1954 and 1957. The ACL formally absorbed the C&WC; in 1959. From there, the trackage of the former C&WC; moved through the merger tree, first to the Seaboard Coast Line in 1967, followed by the Seaboard System in 1983, and finally CSX Transportation in 1986. Most of the original C&WC; system survives under CSX Transportation, while the remains of the former Laurens to Greenville branch survives as the Carolina Piedmont Railroad.

Her love of Shakespeare, Toni Morrison, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Zora Neale Hurston, Louise Meriwether, Vladimir Nabokov, Chinua Achebe, Claude Brown, Richard Wright, Gustav Flaubert, and Greek playwrights Sophocles, Aeschylus, Euripides, and Aristophanes would inform and influence much of her work.

The service allows users to download or purchase video games (including both Xbox Live Arcade games and full Xbox One and Xbox 360 titles), add-ons for existing games, game demos along with other miscellaneous content such as gamer pictures and Dashboard themes. The service also previously offered sections for downloading video content, such as films and television episodes; as of late 2012, this functionality was superseded by Xbox Music and Xbox Video (now known as Groove Music and Microsoft Movies & TV respectively). In late 2017, Xbox Store was replaced on Xbox One by Microsoft Store, as the standard digital storefront for all Windows 10 devices. Services=Xbox Live Arcade The Xbox Live Arcade (XBLA) branding encompasses digital-only games that can be purchased from Xbox Games Store on the Xbox 360, including ports of classic games and new original titles. Games on Demand The Games on Demand section of Xbox Games Store allows users to purchase downloadable versions of Xbox 360 titles, along with games released for the original Xbox. Most of all, some of the delisted downloadable contents of the respective Xbox 360 games are also included in this edition. Xbox Live Indie Games As part of the \\"New Xbox Experience\\" update launched on November 19, 2008, Microsoft launched Xbox Live Community Games, and later renamed to \\"Xbox Live Indie Games\\", a service similar to Xbox Live Arcade (XBLA), with smaller and less expensive games created by independent developers and small studios. Such games are added to the service after successfully passing through a peer review system that prevents inappropriate content from appearing in games and ensures that games meet certain technical standards and do not misrepresent their content.  Former  Initial content partners included Paramount Pictures, CBS, TBS, MTV Networks, UFC, NBC, and Warner Bros. Home Entertainment. Other movie studios have since supported the service including Lionsgate Films and Walt Disney Pictures as announced at E3 2007. At CES 2008, MGM, ABC, the Disney Channel and Toon Disney announced their support for the service. Various films and TV shows were available for purchase in the Video Store, including both past and present series, such as Star Trek and CSI: Crime Scene Investigation. Initially, while TV shows could be downloaded and saved, films could only be rented‚Äîexpiring 24 hours after initial viewing or 14 days after purchase. At launch, the Video Store encountered widespread problems such as lengthy download times, duplicate billing for the same content, and downloads that could not complete, or for which users would have had to repay to complete. On March 6, 2007, the South Park episode \\"Good Times with Weapons\\" was available for free download; however, this episode was free only for the HDTV version until April 3, 2007. Starting on March 13, 2007, all episodes from South Park's 11th season were offered uncensored. Also, starting on July 26, 2007, the pilot episode of Jericho was available for download free of charge for both the Standard and HD versions. In late 2009, the Video Marketplace was replaced by the Zune Video Marketplace, and later accompanied by a Zune Music Marketplace. Both Zune Marketplaces were replaced by the new Xbox Music and Xbox Video services in late 2012. Criticism Most complaints and criticisms leveled at the Xbox Live service concerned the Xbox Live Marketplace: Problems with replacement consoles Per Marketplace design, the digital rights management license for downloaded content is tied to both a specific user and to a specific console. This means that to access the content, the user either needs to be signed on to Xbox Live using their Gamertag, or be playing on the original console the content was purchased on. As a result, users with replacement consoles cannot use previously downloaded content without being connected to Xbox Live. This has the effect of restricting usage of purchased content when no Internet connection is available. An additional wrinkle is added when there are multiple accounts on one console. In this case, all accounts can normally share content when it was downloaded on that system. However, if the system is replaced, then only the actual Xbox Live account to which the content is tied can make use of it (a workaround exists whereby the non-purchasing gamertag can use the content, but only if the original purchasing gamertag is signed into Xbox Live as a secondary profile). Microsoft's original attempts to resolve these issues were limited to transferring licenses to consoles replaced under warranty. This required contacting Microsoft support, and the console must have been replaced through Microsoft itself or a warranty from the retailer where it was originally purchased. License transfers could not be performed in the case of a voluntary upgrade (e.g., if the user purchased a newer Xbox 360 replace their old console). As of June 2008, Microsoft has released an online tool that allows users to transfer licenses from the console where they were originally purchased to another. This is done in a two-step process, where all licenses are first migrated on the server side, and then downloaded onto the new console. To prevent abuse, this process can only be performed every four months. Licenses remain bound to the Gamertag regardless, so users who store their profiles on portable memory units can continue to use purchased content on any console when signed into the service. Pricing Price consistency and whether some content should be available free of charge has also been a source of criticism related to the Xbox Live Marketplace. A notable incident was Microsoft charging for a Gears of War map pack that developer Epic desired to provide at no cost (although it was made free four months later in September 2007). Exacerbating the controversy, Game Informer made claims that Microsoft forced companies to charge for content the company itself wanted to distribute free. In this case, Microsoft Publishing was responsible for setting the price, with this not actually being a policy of the Xbox team or Xbox Live Marketplace as was implied. Free content is indeed possible, but much of the free content is promotional in nature, such as the titles Yaris and Dash of Destruction.. The Microsoft Points system previously required to purchase content was criticized for being deceptive in terms of actual real- world cost, as well as for users often having to purchase more points at once than are immediately needed (in North America, users could only purchase points in increments of 400, costing around $5). In June 2013, Microsoft announced the discontinuation of points in favor of credit using local currencies, which took effect in an Xbox 360 software update released on August 26, 2013.  Regional lockouts  After the Spring 2007 dashboard update, Microsoft increased the security on the regional content restrictions. This made obtaining entertainment content for international markets impossible, while the US market has a substantial offering in comparison. Even some free content, such as downloadable extras for retail games, is impossible to obtain in certain regions, despite there being no legal or censorship problems (an example of this would be the second Gears of War map pack; while the first pack was initially available free worldwide, the Spring 2007 update made both unavailable to many Xbox 360 owners). In the case of New Zealand, all child accounts were banned from downloading any marketplace content in mid-June. these are still locked from downloading anything apart from software updates and user-created content, no matter what the rating.

The name comes from the fact that the people listed are essentially blacklisted. The term can refer either to such a list officially maintained by a particular gaming control board or to the Griffin Book, whose information is shared among subscribing casinos. According to technologist Jeff Jonas, \\"casinos face legal and financial risk if they let the wrong people play. People with gambling addictions can place themselves on exclusionary lists, and can actually sue casinos if they are allowed to place bets.\\" In the case of gaming control boards, people listed are generally suspected of having, or known to have, ties to organized crime. Casinos are obliged by regulations to exclude all such people from entry and can be subject to sanctions for failure to do so. In the Griffin Book, published by Griffin Investigations, listed individuals are generally suspected of being, or known to be, either advantage players or outright cheaters at the casino games themselves. Thus, casinos find it in their own economic best interest to exclude such individuals. Those listed may be anyone perceived as a threat to the casino's profits, whether through legal means, such as card counters, or through illegal means, such as people who mark cards or those who try to cheat slot machines. Included also are those considered a threat to the casino, such as players the casinos simply believe are winning either too much or too often, even if their exact methodology is unknown. The book keeps pictures obtained either from a photo of the individual when detained or simply questioned and released, or from surveillance photos. At least one successful defamation lawsuit has been brought as a result of the Griffin Book.

It can also be an Anglicization, chiefly in North America, of a similar-sounding German surname. Origin of the name The surname Cotter has several different origins. The English surname is a status name. This name is made up of the Old English elements 'cot' \\"cottage\\", \\"hut\\" and the suffix er. In the feudal system a cotter held a cottage by service (rather than by rent). Reaney gives the surname deriving from the Old French cotier \\"cottager\\" (see: villein). Early bearers of the English surname are Robert le Robert le Cotier in 1198; and William le Coter(e) in 1270 and 1297. The Irish name is a reduced anglicised form of the Gaelic Mac Oitir. The personal name Oitir is the Gaelic form of the Old Norse √ìttarr. The Old Norse name is made up of the elements √≥tti \\"fear\\", \\"dread\\" and herr \\"army\\". An early Irish record of the name occurs in 1142, when Mac Mic Ottir .i. Ottir (\\"the son of Mac Ottir, i.e. Ottir\\") from the Hebrides, is recorded to have assumed the Kingship of Dublin. See also: For the origins of the noble Irish family claiming descent from this king see: Cotter family. Although unprovable, it is possible that both he and they are descendants of the famous Ohthere of H√•logaland, a great Norwegian adventurer who appears to have gone to Ireland. He is possibly the Ottir Iarla or Earl Ottir mentioned in the Cogad G√°edel re Gallaib, or at least related to him. The surname can in some cases, mostly in the US and Canada, be an Americanization of the German surname Kotter. Similar surnames Similar, or related surnames include: Coates, Cottier, Kotter. Cotter can be rendered into the Irish language as Mac Coitir and Mac Oitir.

Cotters occupied cottages and cultivated small land lots. The word cotter is often employed to translate the recorded in the Domesday Book, a social class whose exact status has been the subject of some discussion among historians, and is still a matter of doubt. According to Domesday, the were comparatively few, numbering fewer than seven thousand people. They were scattered unevenly throughout England, located principally in the counties of Southern England. They either cultivated a small plot of land, or worked on the holdings of the . Like the , among whom they were frequently classed, their economic condition may be described as free in relation to every one except their lord. A cottar or cottier is also a term for a tenant who was renting land from a farmer or landlord. Scotland Cottars were between a third and a half of the rural population of the Scottish Lowlands for the 17th and most of the 18th century. They held small amounts of land from lease-holding farming tenants of the traditional fermetouns. They provided labour, especially at the peak times of ploughing and harvest, in lieu of monetary rent. Many were also engaged in trades, such as weaving, or blacksmithing. The agricultural improvement that transformed the rural economy of the Lowlands in the 18th century, created larger farms with fewer tenants. From the 1770s onwards, this left no place for the cottar: many migrated to the nearby developing industrial towns, others became farm servants or day labourers for the new larger farms. Highland Cottars (including on the islands, such as Mull) were affected by the Industrial Revolution. Landowners realized that they could make more money from sheep, whose wool was spun and processed into textiles for export, than crops. The landowners raised rents to unaffordable prices, or evicted entire villages in what became known as the Highland Clearances. This resulted in the mass exodus of peasants and cotters, leading to an influx of former cotters into industrial centers, such as a burgeoning Glasgow. Cottars were often idealised in Scottish pastoral poetry of the 18th century, such as \\"The Cotter's Saturday Night\\" by Robert Burns and \\"The Farmer's Ingle\\" by Robert Fergusson. A cotter house () near Solingen, Germany, used as a vacation home today Germany The home (Kotten) of a Koss√§ten in Wuthenow in eastern Germany. A K√∂(t)ter, K√∂t(h)ner, K√§tner, singular and plural forms are identical, or Kotsasse(n [pl.]), and especially in Prussia and Mecklenburg also Kossat(h)e(n [pl.]), Kossater (sg./pl.) or Koss√§te(n [pl.]), was a villager in medieval Europe who lived in a simple dwelling known as a Kate(n [pl.]) or Kotten (sg./pl.) (\\"cottage\\"). The term K√∂tter is recorded in Germany from the 14th century. The term Koss√§te is derived from Low German and translates \\"who sits in a cottage\\".Werner Buchholz, Pommern, Siedler, 1999, pp.66-70, Joachim Herrmann, Die Slawen in Deutschland, Akademie-Verlag Berlin, 1985, pp.421ff Cotter houses (Kate or Kotten) were detached houses near German villages, used as homes and workshops. Many of these Kotten/Cotter houses still remain. The farmsteads of K√∂tter were generally sited on the edge of a village or were sub-divisions of an old farm. Because the return on their land was frequently insufficient to sustain their livelihood, they usually supplemented their income with a craft or trade, or by working as day labourers (Tagel√∂hner) on bigger farms or at manor houses. They usually had a plot of land of between an eighth and a half an oxgang (Hufe); they had few cattle and no more than one horse. In most cases the cottage or Kate had a small vegetable garten that also provided a secondary source of income. Most K√§tner had another main occupation. They were e. g. teachers, craftsmen or, if their land was sufficient, farmers. Their land was beyond the fields (Flur) allocated to the full-time farmers or Hufnern. The K√∂tter usually had a small share in the common land. In the social agricultural hierarchyc.f. e.g. August Haxthausen and Alexander Padberg: Die l√§ndliche Verfassung in den Provinzen Ost- und Westpreu√üen. 1st vol., K√∂nigsberg, 1839, pp. 337 ff. (online). a K√∂tter ranked below the full-time farmer or Vollbauer, but above the B√ºdner, who just owned a house and garden and earned his living as a tradesman, and above the various categories of day labourer (the Inste and the Tagel√∂hner). Around the middle of the 15th century, encouraged by a form of primogeniture known as the Anerbenrecht and by the rapid population growth, the K√∂tter were divided into Erbk√∂tter and Markk√∂tter. The former, who normally arose as a result of the division of land, always had a house and garden within the village, or within a farming community, something which was considered essential for reasons of protection and mutual assistance. Now, land that could be farmed, no matter how poor, was cleared elsewhere in the parish; often miles away from the village or nearest settlement, and in its middle a so-called Markkotten was built which was allocated to the Markk√∂tter where he had to live. The Markk√∂tter was not really given an inheritance proper and he ranked below the Erbk√∂tter. Unlike the heirs or old farmers (Altbauern), none of this group inherited the family farm. Both groups of K√∂tter - the Erbk√∂tter and Markk√∂tter - were still higher in the social hierarchy than the Heuerling, who were, legally and economically, more dependent on the owners of their cottages. Poland The Polish equivalent of the cotter (at least to the 19th century) was the Pachciarz kr√≥w. The term translates as \\"Cow tenant\\". One of the functions of the Pachciarz kr√≥w was to supply the landowner with milk and other bovine produce. Ireland One definition of cottier in Ireland (c.1700‚Äì1850) was a person who rented a simple cabin and between one and one and a half acres of land upon which to grow potatoes, oats, and possibly flax.Cottiers and Conacre in pre‚Äêfamine Ireland, Journal of Peasant Studies, Michael Beames, pages 352-354, Volume 2, 1975 The ground was held on a year- to-year basis and rent was often paid in labour. Usually, the land available to the cottier class was land that the owners considered unprofitable for any other use. The cottier existed at subsistence level because of high rents and the competition for land and labour. The more prosperous cottier worked for his landlord and received cash after rent and other expenses were deducted. There was no incentive to improve a land holding, as any such improvement usually prompted a rent increase. During the early decades of the nineteenth century, the situation for cottiers worsened considerably as the population continued to expand. This way of life was brought abruptly to a close by the effects of the potato blight, which resulted in death by starvation and disease of many peasants, with consequent depopulation, of the Great Famine of 1845‚Äì49. After the Famine, the cottier class almost completely disappeared.A Dictionary of Irish History, D.J.Hickey & J.E.Doherty, Gill and Macmillan, Dublin, 1980. Pp. 98-99.

History = Formation to Built By Blood (2003 - 2005)  Keith Thompson had left Baltimore for Los Angeles a year earlier to follow his musical career. A month into 2003, Brandon Thomas left Baltimore too after speaking with Keith. Bleed the Dream had been formed by spring of that year. They went to LA. For the next year, the band polished their sound and piled in a van, touring their way from city to city. They garnered them a spot on the Warped Tour without even an album under their belts. They were asked back to join Warped Tour officially in 2004 and 2005. In 2004, Bleed the Dreams's guitarist, Dave Aguilera, created his own label, Maphia Records. It subsequently released of the band's 2 EPs: the rock-driven \\"Awake\\" on Noize Pollution and the unplugged and acoustic \\"Asleep\\". They followed with a DVD \\"No Apologies\\" reminiscent of the CKY videos. The DVD was edited by Scott Gottlieb from pieces of tour footage and behind the scene fan cameras. Their success and rapid-growing fan base was noted by Warped Tour creator, Kevin Lyman. Realizing that Bleed the Dream was onto something, Lyman created his own label, WARCON Enterprises LLC, signed the band, and released their first full-length album, \\"Built By Blood\\" in May 2005. Spring of 2005 landed Bleed the Dream on the Taste of Chaos tour featuring The Used and My Chemical Romance. Unfortunately, as their star was rising, Scott became sick and weak, unable to handle the rough life on the road. A year earlier, he fell down during a performance while on a national tour. The band cut their set short to rush him to the hospital. Scott was diagnosed as having leukemia. He lost his short battle with cancer on April 10, 2005, only two weeks before the band released \\"Built by Blood\\". Their CD release party at The Ottobar in Baltimore, Maryland on April 23, was tearful and triumphant in the same breath. Friends and family came out to pay their respects to Scott and support the band in the next phase of their life without him.  Killer Inside (2006)  Bleed the Dream finished out 2005 by joining Taste of Chaos Europe with headliners The Used and Story of the Year. In December, the band took some time off to write and audition new drummers, ultimately hiring Tom Breyfogle to fill the position. Brandon Thomas was soon let go from the band and replaced by Mark Holmes, former lead singer of the now-defunct band Like Yesterday. In July 2006, the band recorded a new album in Canada with producers Garth Richardson and Ben Kaplan. The 13 new tracks recorded became the highly anticipated second record, \\"Killer Inside.\\" In late 2006, the band finished filming a music video for the song \\"Closer,\\" the first single off their new album, \\"Killer Inside\\". The video shows band members playing grim reaper type stalkers to the lead singer, and finishes with the band playing paramedics to their bloody lead singer. The album also features tracks \\"It Takes A Fall,\\" \\"Tell Someone Who Cares,\\" and \\"Vampires Don't Kill For the Money.\\"  Band break-up (2007)  On September 24, 2007, Bleed the Dream posted the following bulletin on MySpace regarding their break-up > \\"Hi Dave from Bleed the Dream here, After many years of ups and downs were > calling it quits...\\"  Reformation (2008 - present)  In 2015, the band officially announced that it would reunite to record a brand new EP, adding long-time guitar and bass tech, Fatally Yours guitarist Christian Rivera as a permanent member on rhythm guitar. In 2017, Bleed the Dream began work on the new EP, with Periphery's Matt Halpern filling in on drums.  Other information = Notable appearances  The band has appeared on such tours as the Taste of Chaos Tour and the Van's Warped Tour. They are also featured in a Warped Tour documentary, Wake Up Screaming. Their song, \\"Streets of Baltimore,\\" was played for a national audience during a FOX broadcast of a Baltimore Ravens' football game on November 19, 2006. Recently, they appeared on Japanese rock band Dir En Grey's INWARD SCREAM TOUR 07, which kicked off on February 1, 2007, in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.  Line-up changes  In January 2006, Tom Breyfogle, originally from Ohio, joined the band as their new drummer. His first two tours with the band took place in select cities stateside and in Canada with Hawthorne Heights for the first part and Funeral for a Friend for the second half. After which, they returned to Canada for their own headlining tour. Breyfogle then accompanied the band to the U.K in April 2006, supporting their Taste of Chaos friends Story of the Year alongside hardcore punk band Stretch Arm Strong. They then joined bands Never Heard of It, Army of Freshmen, and Crowned King on tour in Japan. On May 24, 2006, the band released an official press statement announcing that Brandon Thomas would no longer continue singing for the group. Mark Holmes was announced as the new vocalist, and would sing for the band from 2006 to 2007. In 2014, Thomas resumed frontman duties once more.

The seemingly contradictory phrase simultaneously announces the death of the previous monarch and assures the public of continuity by saluting the new monarch. In modern times, this phrase has become a popular phrasal template. Given the memorable nature of the phrase (owing to epanalepsis), as well as its historic significance, the phrase crops up regularly as a headline for articles, editorials, or advertisements on themes of succession or replacement. Robert Cecil, one of the architects of the League of Nations, famously concluded his speech at the final session of the League of Nations with the phrase: \\"The League is dead. Long live the United Nations.\\"  Origin  Charles VII. The original phrase was translated from the , which was first declared upon the accession to the French throne of Charles VII after the death of his father Charles VI in 1422. In France, the declaration was traditionally made by the duc d'Uz√®s, a senior peer of France, as soon as the coffin containing the remains of the previous king descended into the vault of Saint Denis Basilica. The phrase arose from the law of --that the transfer of sovereignty occurs instantaneously upon the moment of death of the previous monarch. \\"The King is dead\\" is the announcement of a monarch who has just died. \\"Long live The King!\\" refers to the heir who immediately succeeds to a throne upon the death of the preceding monarch. At the time, French was the primary language of the nobility in England, and the proclamation was quickly taken up as ideally representing the same tradition-- which in England dates back to 1272, when Henry III died while his son, Edward I, was fighting in the Crusades. To avoid any chance of a civil war erupting over the order of succession, the Royal Council proclaimed: \\"The throne shall never be empty; the country shall never be without a monarch.\\" Thus, Edward was declared king immediately, and he reigned in absentia until news of his father's death reached him and he returned to England. Another example is among the French royalty. In France, Louis XV was the predecessor of Louis XVI. Upon Louis XV's death at around 11:00 pm on 10 May 1774, heir-apparent Louis-Auguste, le Dauphin, immediately became King Louis XVI of France. This quick transition of sovereignty was made within the phrase \\"the king is dead, long live the king!\\"  Usage  In Denmark, the prime minister makes a similar proclamation upon the death of a monarch‚ÄîKongen leve, kongen er d√∏d (hail the king, the king is dead)‚Äîfrom the balcony of Christiansborg Palace (the Danish Parliament building).Kongen leve, kongen er d√∏d. Den Store Danske. This declaration is official and marks the ascension of a new monarch immediately after the death of the old. This is because Frederick III abolished the coronation ceremony with the introduction of the hereditary and absolute monarchy in 1660. The king was now supreme and accountable only to God, so the crown became a birthright, and not something to be bestowed only after the father's death with the nobles and the church's approval. With the introduction of constitutional monarchy in 1849, the monarch's power over the State was again limited, but his claim to the throne remained undisputed and absolute. In some monarchies, such as the United Kingdom, an interregnum is usually avoided by using the idea of immediate transferral of power behind the phrase (i.e., the heir to the throne becomes a new monarch immediately on his predecessor's death). This famous phrase signifies the continuity of sovereignty, attached to a personal form of power named Auctoritas. This is not so in other monarchies where the new monarch's reign begins only with coronation or some other formal or traditional event. In the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth for instance, kings were elected, which often led to relatively long interregna. During that time it was the Polish primate who served as an interrex (ruler between kings). Ernst Kantorowicz's famous theory of the king's two bodies (1957) showed how auctoritas (Kantorowicz used the synonym term‚Äîhere‚Äîof dignitas) was transferred from the defunct sovereign to the new one. In the United Kingdom and other realms which permit female succession to the throne, the phrase can be altered to accommodate succession between monarchs of different sexes, e.g. \\"The King is dead, long live The Queen!\\", as happened in 1952, when King George VI died and was succeeded by his daughter, Queen Elizabeth II, or \\"The Queen is dead, long live The King!\\" as happened in 1901, when Queen Victoria was succeeded by her son, King Edward VII. \\"The King is dead, long live The King!\\" was last properly used in the United Kingdom in January 1936 when King George V was succeeded by his son King Edward VIII, who later abdicated, or \\"The Queen is dead, long live The Queen!\\" as happened in 1558, when Queen Mary I was succeeded by her half-sister, Queen Elizabeth I. In the Kingdom of Thailand, to conclude the national televised address on October 13, 2016 regarding the passing of His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej, the Prime Minister proclaimed \\"His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej, Rama IX, has passed away.

History and proposed loops In 1956, federal and regional transportation planners proposed an Inner Loop Expressway composed of three circumferential beltways for the District of Columbia.Levey, Bob and Levey, Jane Freundel. \\"End of The Roads.\\" The Washington Post.

The majority of the innermost loop would have been a minimum of six lanes, with the portions used by I-95 having a minimum of eight lanes. The final design for the innermost loop made heavy use of cut-and-cover tunnels in order to minimize impacts to the city; one notable example that was built is the tunnel under the National Mall, between C Street SW and D Street NW, used by Interstate 395. The innermost beltway would have formed a flattened oval centered on the Kennedy Center/Watergate complex in the west, running southeast along what is currently Ohio Drive SW until it linked with the Southwest Freeway portion of I-395, north along I-395 to L Street NW, and then west along a tunnel beneath K Street NW to join near the western nexus with the Whitehurst Freeway and Interstate 66‚Äîcompleting the loop. The middle beltway would have formed an arc along the northern portion of the city, running from the proposed Barney Circle Freeway (whose terminus would have been near Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium) through Anacostia Park, cut northeast through the Trinidad neighborhood along Mt. Olivet Road NE, followed the Amtrak rail line north to Missouri Avenue NW, along Missouri Avenue NW to Military Road NW, along Military Road NW across Rock Creek Park to Nebraska Avenue NW, down Nebraska Avenue NW to New Mexico Avenue NW, down New Mexico Avenue NW and across Glover-Archbold Park until it terminated near 37th Street NW at the north end of Georgetown. The outermost route, the Capital Beltway, would encircle the city of Washington. D.C. residents strongly opposed both inner loops, upset that the freeways would have required the demolition of large numbers of houses and greatly affected city neighborhoods. As a result, all portions of the network that were not yet started were completely canceled in 1977. This left some portions of the innermost loop incomplete, and the northern arc completely unbuilt.

The riots started as peaceful demonstrations against the British colonial government's decision to increase the fare of Star Ferry foot-passenger harbour crossing by 25 percent. One person died in the riots, dozens were injured, and over 1,800 people were arrested during the turmoil.  Origins =Direct cause Petition form created by Elsie Elliot against the Star Ferry fare increase The Star Ferry was an important link between the Kowloon Peninsula and Hong Kong Island before the Cross-Harbour Tunnel was built in 1972. In October 1965, the Government revealed that the Star Ferry had applied to it for fare increases of between 50% and 100%. Star Ferry, which considered this a secret, expressed dismay that the application had been made public. It was further revealed that Star Ferry had solicited the views of the Hongkong and Yaumati Ferry on the increase sought. This sparked public fears that if the increase in fares were approved, other forms of public transport would also raise their prices.Expos√©: Star Ferry applies for fare increase, Wen Wei Po, 29 October 1965 When the Transport Advisory Committee (TAC) approved Star Ferry's fare increase in March 1966, Elsie Elliot, an Urban Councillor and dissenting member of the TAC, created a petition against the fare increase and collected the signatures of 20,000 citizens. A peaceful and rational protest was conducted by two participants. However, it was severely suppressed by the Hong Kong Government.Official record of proceedings, James To, member of the Legislative Council, 17 October 1996 The public was outraged. Underlying cause The 1960s was a period of mounting dissatisfaction over British colonial rule. Living and working conditions of the general population were poor, and corruption in officialdom was prevalent. Citizens were distrustful of the rampantly corrupt police, and the inequity of policing. As with the subsequent Hong Kong 1967 riots, social unrest was reaching a boiling point.  Protests =Demonstrations ;4 April 1966 So's back, showing writing on the jacketIn the morning of 4 April, So Sau-chung (), a 27-year-old young man who worked as a translator, began a hunger strike protest at the Star Ferry Terminal in Central District. So wore a black jacket upon which he had hand-written the words \\"Hail Elsie\\", \\"Join hunger strike to block fare increase\\". He caught the public mood and quickly drew a crowd of supporters. ;5 April 1966 Another young man, Lo Kei (), joined So in the hunger strike. At 16:10, the Hong Kong Police arrested So Sau-chung on the charges of obstruction of passageway. A group of young \\"sympathisers\\" went to Government House to petition the Governor, David Trench. That evening, over 1,000 people gathered in Tsim Sha Tsui, demonstrating against So's arrest and the government's support for the Star Ferry company's fare increase. Demonstrators marched to Mong Kok, and back again to Tsim Sha Tsui.\\"Star Ferry fare increases provoke riots\\", Hong Kong Commercial Daily, 4 April 2005 Escalation ;6 April 1966 So was put on trial in the Western Magistrates' Court, and was sentenced to two months' imprisonment. Crowds started gathering at around 8 pm, and violence broke out among the protesters in Kowloon about two hours later. On the busy thoroughfare Nathan Road, mobs threw stones at buses and set vehicles on fire. The Yau Ma Tei Police Station was also attacked by a crowd of over 300 people. Riot police fired tear gas in response, but people continued to gather in Nathan Road, with the mob almost doubling in size once Hong Kong's cinemas closed at midnight. The rioters looted shops, and attacked and set fire to public facilities including fire stations and power stations. Riot police continued to fire tear gas into the crowds and in some cases fired their carbines at looters. During that night, 772 tear gas canisters, 62 wooden shells and 62 carbine rounds were fired. The British Army was also called into action. Soldiers with bayonets fixed patrolled the streets in Kowloon enforcing a curfew that was imposed after around 1.30 am. ;7 April 1966 The next day the government announced that the curfew would start earlier, at 7 pm, and warned that any rioters risked being shot. But that night rioters still gathered on Nathan Road near Mong Kok. Again, vehicles were set on fire and shops looted. Hundreds of people attempted, unsuccessfully, to set fire to the Yau Ma Tei and Mong Kok Police stations. During the course of the evening, 280 rounds of teargas and 218 baton rounds were used. One protester was killed, four injured, and 215 arrests were made. ;8 April 1966 The next day the government announced that the curfew would start early at 7 pm, and warned that any rioters risked being shot. There were huge queues for public transport when workers went home early, and the city was like a ghost town one hour before the curfew. Some 3,500 police were out patrolling the streets. There were some incidents of stone-throwing in Chungking Mansions and Nam Cheong Street in Sham Shui Po. Raids by plain-clothes police culminated in the arrest of 669 'agitators'.  Aftermath  Some 300 people were brought before the courts, and 258 people received sentences of up to two years' imprisonment. The riots began to die down, and by 10 April the curfew was lifted. The fare increase was approved on 26 April. Damage caused was estimated to be no less than HK$20 million. After the riot, the colonial government of David Trench set up the Kowloon Disturbances Commission of Inquiry, presided over by Justice Michael Hogan, aimed at identifying the cause, in particular, the social elements that underlay the outbreak of violence. The inquiry report cited one of the main reasons was the general lack of a sense of belonging to society of young people, general insecurity and distrust of the government among grass-roots; all of this was exacerbated by economic recession, unemployment and a housing shortage. The inquiry recommended the Trench government to create the function of district officers () to improve governance by facilitating communication between the government and the local public. The findings were however derided as \\"a farce\\" by Elsie Elliot.Is there justice for all?, South China Morning Post, 15 December 1974 Lo Kei was arrested after the event, allegedly for theft. In January 1967, he was found hanged in an apartment in Ngau Tau Kok. Officially, his death was recorded as a suicide, but Elliot and So challenged the verdict. So, and a few others, staged a protest in Mong Kok until April when So was arrested and sentenced to Castle Peak Psychiatric Hospital for 14 days. Implications The 1966 riots marked the birth of civic activism in Hong Kong. It is the first large-scale social movement in Hong Kong with huge number of young people participation. It also reflected widespread social discontent that eventually led to the territory-wide leftist riots in 1967. The Edinburgh Place Star Ferry pier, where the riots originated, was included in the controversial Central waterfront redevelopment project in 2007. Many protester linked their demonstration against the demolition of the pier with So's action.

Levy about a school of killer piranhas descending upon the bustling Lost River Lake Resort. Executive produced by Roger Corman for the Showtime network, the film is a remake of the 1978 film of the same name and part of the Piranha film series. The film features Mila Kunis in her debut role. Plot During the night, Barbara (Lorissa McComas) and her boyfriend David (Richard Israel) sneak into a closed down army test site, and discovered a pool. They go swimming, but are attacked and killed by an unseen force in the pool. The next day, J. R. Randolph (Monte Markham) the uncle of Barbara, hires private investigator Maggie McNamara (Alexandra Paul), to investigate the incident, believing her to be a runaway. Maggie searches the area for any possible witnesses, eventually stopping by local homeowner Paul Grogan (William Katt), asking for any knowledge of the girl's disappearance. He claims to have not seen her, but leads her to the army test site where they discover the pool. They enter to look for any clues, until Maggie thinks they should drain the pool. As she starts the draining. a scientist named Dr. Leticia Baines (Darleen Carr), encounters them and attacks Maggie and Paul to stop the draining, but is too late to do so. They investigate the bottom of the pool and discover a skeleton, which they believe is that of a dog. Baines steals the jeep, but crashes after losing consciousness. Later that night, she wakes up and informs them that a school of piranha lived in the pool that they had drained, and are assumed to be headed to the river. Paul, knowing his daughter Susie (Mila Kunis) was at a scout camp just downstream of the river joins Maggie and Paul to visit Randolph and try to convince him to shut down a grand opening of a resort just downstream. They fail, and have to make many twists and turns to try and save people downstream. On the way to warn people of the piranha, Maggie and Paul are arrested after Randolph had claimed that they lied about the piranha, dismissing it as \\"nonsense\\". They eventually escape from custody to warn the people of Lost River. The piranha first make their way to the camp, attacking the kids. Susie takes a raft and saves her friend Darlene. Darlene tries to save Laura (Soleil Moon Frye) but she falls in and the piranha kills her. Maggie and Paul make it to the camp. Paul grabs a canoe and saves his daughter and the kids. Maggie calls the resort to warn them of the danger but is ignored. She and Paul drive to the resort themselves but arrive too late; the school of piranha having killed most of the swimmers. Randolph now sees and realizes his mistake. Maggie and Paul take a speedboat to the latter's old workplace, to open the valve containing toxins and spread them into the lake, in attempts to kill the piranha. Upon arrival, the control room is flooded, and Paul must swim under to it and release the valve while Maggie stays in the boat counting to 200 before pulling him out. The piranha attacks Paul but he successfully releases the valve, spreading the toxins. Maggie starts the boat's engines, pulling Paul away from the piranha school. As Maggie pulls out the rope, she discovers that it was cut loose, making her think that Paul did not make it. A badly wounded but alive Paul surfaces from the water. J. R. Randolph then commits suicide after he discovers that he will face legal action. After the horrific incident, the Mayor of Lost River announcing that the piranha somehow are all dead, but then at the ocean the trilling sounds of the piranha are heard, and it turns out that half of the piranha have survived and made their way to the ocean.

A national governing body was formed in 2007 under the name Svenska Australisk Fotbollsf√∂rbundet or AFL Sweden. History Australian rules football began in Sweden in late 1993 with the creation of the Helsingborg Saints for play in the Danish Australian Football League. They continued as the only Australian rules club in Sweden (excepting the short- lived Lund Bulldogs in 1995) until 2002, when the DAFL was restructured and the Saints were divided into three new clubs, the Port Malm√∂ Maulers, Helsingborg West Raptors and Lund Magpies. After 2005, the three Scania teams became feeders for the South Sweden Saints (changed name back to Helsingborg Saints in 2008), who competed in the DAFL Premier League and reached the 2005 Grand Final. In 2003 a new club was formed, the G√∂teborg Berserkers, followed by the Stockholm Dynamite in 2004. The three centres for footy in Sweden continued to operate largely independently of each other, with the Dynamite creating its own three team local league, the Stockholm region Australian Football Federation. A loose federation calling itself the Swedish Australian Football Association was created, but no real governing body was created until late 2007. The announcement of the creation of the Swedish Australian Football League in 2006 comprises the Scania and Gothenburg clubs, the Stockholm teams remaining separate in the SAFF. AFLSweden is the official governing body of Australian rules football in Sweden. 2015 Elitserien With AFL Sweden working towards being recognised as a sport in Sweden and inclusion into the Swedish 'Riksidrottsf√∂rbundet' in 2017, plans were made to expand footy within the country. Part of those plans was the creation of a national competition or the 'Elitserien'. In 2015 the first Elitserien tournament was held over 6 rounds with 4 competing teams: Port Malm√∂ Maulers, Helsingborg Saints, S√∂dermalm Blues and Stockholm Dynamite (Dynamite team composed of players from Solna, √Örsta, Bromma and Norrt√§lje). Each team hosted a double header round as well as a regional derby match. S√∂dermalm Blues, the team with the best record after 6 rounds, were crowned champions. E4 Cup The Stockholm Dynamite has competed against the South Sweden Saints (aka Scania Griffins) at least once a year to date since 2004. The Southerners won the first cup in 2004 (surprisingly considering they were thrashed in a practice game earlier in the year) and defended it successfully in 2005. The E4 Cup is named for the E4 motorway connecting the capital with the country's south. This cup has now been replaced by the SAFL regional league. National teams Sweden lining up for the national anthem at the 2008 International Cup in Melbourne The Swedish men's national team is nicknamed the Elks, drawn from teams across Sweden. The team wears the national colours of Sweden (represented on the Flag of Sweden). The Elks have worn two different jumpers in international competition, their first being a yellow jumper with a blue V featuring three gold crowns and the Swedish name for Sweden (Sverige) on the belly, and their second being a blue jumper with a yellow Scandinavian cross and Elk logo. The first appearance of a Swedish national team was in 1997, when the Elks were defeated by Denmark's Vikings in Helsingborg. The next Elks match was in 2004, when the Elks defeated the touring North London Lions by 11 points at Malm√∂. In 2005, the first test match between Sweden and Denmark is some time was held at Farum, Denmark, with the game played out as a draw. This match consisted of an all-Danish Vikings side, although the Sweden side contained a number of Australians. At the 2007 EU Cup in Hamburg, Sweden performed very well, eventually winning the tournament. The Elks thrashed Austria by over 100 points in their first group match, then beat France by 41 points to top Pool C. In the Quarter-Finals, Sweden defeated Pool B runners up the Czech Republic by 31 points. In the Semi Finals, they met Pool B champions England. The Swedes ran out 26 point winners, moving onto the final where they would play hosts Germany. In the Final, Sweden won 14.9.93 to Germany 8.5.53. Sweden's Cameron Crooks was Best on Ground.EU Cup 2008 Strong growth in Sweden has seen the Elks compete at numerous International cups in Australia. In 2008 Sweden was grouped with Canada, Finland and eventual quarter finalists Ireland. The team finished 12th after losing a playoff match against Denmark. In 2011 games were split between two round in Sydney and Melbourne. In round 1 Sweden was grouped together with India and New Zealand. With one loss and one win the Elks were in round 2 placed in a group together with Denmark and eventual winners Ireland. Sweden were not able to win any further group matches but finished strongly against Japan in the 11th/12th playoff game improving their ranking by one place from 2008. 2014 brought about another change in tournament structure. Teams were to play 3 seeding matches before being placed in a division for finals. Sweden lost to New Zealand in their opening match but returned strongly in game 2 to put Finland to the sword. The third seeding game against Canada resulted in defeat placing Sweden in division 2 for the remainder of the tournament. Sweden played off against China and Japan to secure the title as division 2 champions. The Elks did not participate in the 2017 International Cup. The Swedish women's national team is nicknamed the Ravens. Clubs=National Regional League The Swedish Regional League began in 2007, featuring three sides representing the most established regions for Australian rules in Sweden, the Gothenburg Berserkers, Scania Griffins and Stockholm Dynamite. Gothenburg The G√∂teborg Berserkers are currently the only Australian rules team in Gothenburg. The Berserkers started training in 2003 and had their first seven-a-side game in late 2003. In 2006, the Berserkers started playing against the Landskrona Bulldozers and Port Malm√∂ Maulers in the Southern Sweden Regional League. The Berserkers wear a black and white striped long sleeve jumper (same as Collingwood Magpies) or a black- red sleeveless jumper. As of 2007, they are competing against Stockholm and Scania in the national regional series. Scania Scania currently has two teams in the Danish Australian Football League (DAFL) , the Port Malm√∂ Maulers from Malm√∂ and Helsingborg Saints based in Helsingborg. Feeding into these sides is the four-team Scania League (Sk√•neligan), featuring the GV Rebels and Malm√∂ Red Eyes in Malm√∂, Helsingborg West Raptors in Helsingborg and Landskrona Bulldozers representing Landskrona and Lund. The Lund Magpies also competed in the Scania League from 2003‚Äì06, former players joining the Bulldozers after the Magpies folded. The regional representative side is nicknamed the Griffins. Scania was home to the first Australian football club ever formed in Sweden, the Helsingborg Saints. The club was founded in 1993 by Ingmar 'Terry' Lundquist and Joacim Aulin. The club was almost to be called the Ravens, but the nickname and playing strip of Australian Football League (AFL) club the St Kilda Saints eventually were adopted. From 1994 onwards the Saints competed in the DAFL, and were briefly called South Sweden Saints from 2003‚Äì2007. There was also a short-lived club in Lund, nicknamed the Bulldogs, 1995. For the years 2003 and 2004, the Helsingborg Saints split their squad into three teams for the DAFL's new Scania Conference, these being the Helsingborg West Raptors, Lund Magpies and the Port Malm√∂ Maulers. During this period, the Saints played as Scania in the DAFL's regional league, being a representative team made up of the best players from the three Scanian clubs. In the 2005 structure for the DAFL the Saints returned, now called the South Sweden Saints and playing in the DAFL Premier League. This season saw the Saints reach the DAFL Grand Final for the second time, again they were soundly defeated by the Farum Cats. The Port Malm√∂ Maulers were formed in 2003, to play in the Scania Conference of the DAFL. As of the 2005 DAFL restructure, the Maulers are a feeder team for the South Sweden Saints (now called Helsingborg Saints again), who play in the DAFL Premier League. In 2006, with the creation of the Swedish Australian Football League, the Maulers competed in the Southern Sweden regional league, against the Landskrona Bulldozers and the G√∂teborg Berserkers, and also field two sides in the new Scania league, the Malm√∂ Red Eyes and the GV Malm√∂ Rebels (named for their partner league the Goulburn Valley Football League in Australia. As of 2007, the Port Malm√∂ Maulers compete in the DAFL Premier League. In 2009, they became the first team from outside the Copenhagen area to win the DAFL premiership. Stockholm Logo of the Stockholm Dynamite Australian rules football in the Stockholm region is governed by the Stockholm region Australian Football Federation (SAFF). The SAFF runs a five-team suburban competition featuring the Bromma Vikings, Solna Axemen, S√∂dermalm Blues, Norrt√§lje Dockers and √Örsta Swans, with a representative team known as the Stockholm Dynamite. The Falun Diggers participated in the 2011 competition but sat out 2012. Players from the SAFF are also eligible for selection to the Swedish national team. After earlier attempts to start the game of Australian Rules in Stockholm, the first meeting of what was to become the SAFF was held on the December 19, 2003. Early in April 2004 the Stockholm Dynamite (the new representative side for the SAFF) traveled to Malm√∂ and won a resounding victory in their premier game against a rather depleted South Sweden Saints side. Six weeks later the Dynamite accepted an invitation to play a full-strength team in Helsingborg for the inaugural E4 Cup (named after the major freeway between Stockholm and the south). The match resulted in a four-point win to South Sweden. In Stockholm a three-team league was established, teams being North, South and Central. After each team completed nine home-and-away games, North defeated Central in the 2004 Grand Final. The Dynamite also travelled to Denmark for the Sheep Station Cup and played an International Rules game against a local Gaelic football club. In 2005, the Stockholm Australian Football Federation completed its second year. The senior competition again maintained the same three-team, nine-a-side competition, the sides now named the Northern Axemen, Central Royals and Southern Sharks. The Sharks defeated the Axemen for the premiership. In the eighteen-a-side version of the game, 2005 was a learning curve for the Stockholm Dynamite. The West London Wildcats toured Stockholm in early April, defeating the locals by a good margin. In the E4 Cup, the South Sweden Saints made the long trek to Stockholm. The Saints proved too strong and controlled the game from the outset. Again there were many encouraging signs with the local players making up 40% of the Stockholm Team. The Dynamite again ventured to Denmark for the Sheep Station Cup, finishing fourth. With the completion of the 2005 senior competition in September, the SAFF turned its focus to junior development. The SAFF hired a professionally accredited physical education teacher and primary school teacher to co-ordinate Australian Rules Clinics at a number of Swedish schools. The sessions were aimed at children aged 10‚Äì16 and were based primarily upon the Auskick program. In all, four schools were involved over 38 hours of clinics and 350 children got the opportunity to kick the Sherrin. The game of Australian rules football has grown steadily in Stockholm over the past few years with a marked increase in local Swedish players. Middle Sweden 2007 saw the formation of three new clubs in middle Sweden, based in the cities of Karlstad, Uppsala and Falun. Participation The AFL International Census in 2007 reported a total of 393 players in Sweden, of which 257 were senior, 58 junior and around 78 participants registered in the Viking footy Auskick like program.AFL International Census 2007 International Competition=International Cup *2002: Did not compete *2005: Did not compete *2008: 12th *2011: 11th *2014: 1st in Division 2 *2017: Did not compete European Championships *2010: 3rd *2013: 4th ReferencesExternal links *Svenska Australiensiska fotbollsf√∂rbundet *Solna Axemen *√Örsta Swans *S√∂dermlalm Blues *G√∂teborg Berserkers *Port Malm√∂ Maulers *Karlstad Dragons *Helsingborg Saints *Stockholm region Australian Football Federation *Video - Sweden vs Denmark Swe Category:Sport in Sweden by sport Swe ","title":"Australian rules football in Sweden"},{"id":"3767093","title":"Yellowstone Public Radio"},{"id":"3767096","text":"Two ships of the have been named HMS Ameer. * , a sent to the British Royal Navy under Lend-Lease. * The original designation for , a .

It is the unofficial motto of Switzerland. A French version, Un pour tous, tous pour un, was made famous by Alexandre Dumas in the 1844 novel The Three Musketeers. Early uses In 1594, William Shakespeare uses it in his poem The Rape of Lucrece to characterize people who take massive risks, including the poem's villainous rapist king, Tarquin the Proud: : The aim of all is but to nurse the life : With honour, wealth, and ease, in waning age; : And in this aim there is such thwarting strife, : That one for all, or all for one we gage; : As life for honour in fell battle's rage; : Honour for wealth; and oft that wealth doth cost : The death of all, and all together lost. Many of Shakespeare's contemporaries recognized him not for plays like Hamlet and Macbeth, but poems like Lucrece and Venus and Adonis. Thus, his use of it could have contributed to more widespread usage, since these poems were commercial successes in his time. In a meeting in 1618 between leaders of the Bohemian, Catholic and Protestant communities, which resulted in the third defenestration of Prague, a representative of the Protestants read a letter affirming, \\"As they also absolutely intended to proceed with the execution against us, we came to an unanimous agreement among ourselves that, regardless of any loss of life and limb, honor and property, we would stand firm, with all for one and one for all... nor would we be subservient, but rather we would loyally help and protect each other to the utmost, against all difficulties.\\" Three Musketeers Un pour tous, tous pour un (One for all, and all for one; also inverted to All for one, and one for all) is a motto traditionally associated with the titular heroes of the novel The Three Musketeers written by Alexandre Dumas p√®re, first published in 1844. In the novel, it was the motto of a group of French musketeers named Athos, Porthos, Aramis and d'Artagnan who stayed loyal to each other through thick and thin., ch. 9: \\"'And now, gentlemen,' said d'Artagnan, without stopping to explain his conduct to Porthos, 'All for one, one for all--that is our motto, is it not?'\\", ch. 9: \\"Et maintenant, messieurs, dit d'Artagnan sans se donner la peine d'expliquer sa conduite √† Porthos, tous pour un, un pour tous, c'est notre devise, n'est-ce pas?\\" On November 30, 2002, in an elaborate but solemn procession, six Republican Guards carried the coffin of Dumas from its original interment site in the Cimeti√®re de Villers-Cotter√™ts in Aisne to the Panth√©on. The coffin was draped in a blue velvet cloth inscribed with the motto.Dumas au Panth√©on (in French) Traditional motto of Switzerland Memorial sheet to mark the revision of the Swiss federal constitution on April 19, 1874 by E. Conrad, ca. 1874 Switzerland has no official motto defined in its constitution or legislative documents. The traditional motto \\"one for all, all for one\\" has no constitutional or legal foundation.\\" URL last accessed January 18, 2006. The phrase, in its German (Einer f√ºr alle, alle f√ºr einen), French (un pour tous, tous pour un), Italian (Uno per tutti, tutti per uno) and Romansh (In per tuts, tuts per in) versions, came into widespread use in the 19th century. After autumn storms had caused widespread floods in the Swiss Alps in late September and early October 1868, officials launched an aid campaign under that slogan, deliberately using it to evoke a sense of duty and solidarity and national unity in the population of the young nation. Switzerland had become a federal state only 20 years earlier, and the last civil war among the cantons, the Sonderbundskrieg, had been in 1847. Newspaper ads that used the motto to call for donations were run in all parts of the country. The phrase was increasingly associated with the founding myths of Switzerland, which often also have solidarity as a central theme, to such a degree that \\"Unus pro omnibus, omnes pro uno\\" was even written in the cupola of the Federal Palace of Switzerland in 1902.The Federal Assembly - The Swiss Parliament: Architecture, on the official website of the Swiss Parliament.

History MOWAG Dumitank MOWAG Furgeon PTT MOWAG fire engine Mowag 3M1 'Pirat 18 The MOWAG GmbH (Motor Car Factory), originally MOWAG Motorwagenfabrik AG, was founded in 1950 as a privately owned company by engineer, Walter Ruf. During the past 50 years Mowag has concentrated on the development and production of specialised vehicles. Its initial success was the development and production of more than 1,600 troop carriers (Mowag T1 4√ó4) for the Swiss Army. Contracts for Germany followed, with 750 Mowag MR 8 series armoured wheeled vehicles produced for the German Bundesgrenzschutz (Federal Border Guard) (also later used by Spain), and built under licence in Germany. Further high-powered wheeled and tracked vehicle series were developed and manufactured for the world markets. MOWAG has built many different types of vehicles, such as ambulances, fire trucks (like the Mowag W300), dummy tanks, electric vehicles, scooters or tracked tanks. In the civilian sector, MOWAG has been particularly active in the construction of fire-fighting vehicles where several generations of emergency vehicles have been built on the Dodge pickups. Many models were based on factory designed firefighting trucks. In Germany, Mowag was well known for developing a four-wheel drive armoured car, that was built under licence from Thyssen and Bussing/Henschel. In 1963, vehicles for the Federal Border Guard (Bundesgrenzschutz = BGS), MOWAG's production ran for decades. MOWAG had from the beginning to the end of the 1960s, built addition military vehicles and civilian trucks. Among them were the heavy trucks, MOWAG M5-16F with four seats, front steering cabin and 16 tons total weight, tow hitch for a double axle trailer and a 149kW engine in the underfloor. The engine was mounted under the bed between the front and the rear axles. This allowed a compact design and low centre of gravity in the middle of the vehicle.Armee Museum Full AG Switzerland. In 1950, MOWAG produced 214 local official cars for the Swiss Post, the chassis of this small compact vehicle had sliding doors on each side. The truck for Swiss Post (PTT) MOWAG Einsatzfourgon of which 556 units were built from 1953 to 1988, had also an underfloor engine. The Furgeon were initially fitted with a V8 petrol engine, which was originally developed for a MOWAG tank. Later, diesel engines were installed. The yellow and silver vans had a door in the front of the vehicle on the passenger side, which made it possible to exit from the front if the trucks were parked very close together. On the driver's side was a conventional door. It was possible to get from the cabin into the cargo hold. Taking advantage of this fact, some people rebuilt the decommissioned Furgeons into campers. The Furgeons were equipped with a trailer hitch for 4 wheel trailers. MOWAG had developed a replacement vehicle for the Furgeon, but it remained only a pre- series of 22Ruedi Baumann: ‚ÄûAlles‚Äú was MOWAG schon bewegt hat ‚Äì Auf Umwegen zum Welterfolg. SwissMoto. Bildpress Zuerich BPZ Trucks, all used by the Swiss Post, as the Swiss Post bought foreign mass-produced series of vehicles. Besides regular trucks, MOWAG has built several generations of long iron transport trucks. A 8√ó4-driven four-axle truck with M8TK diesel engine with eight cylinders, 10.8 litres and 373kW and Allison automatic five-speed transmission, these are characterised by a very narrow central cab, with two seats. They were able to carry the load on the entire length of the vehicle using the space on the left and right side of the driver's cabin. The drivers compartment had a front entering door. Between 1965 and 1975, MOWAG built 170 electric trollies for the Swiss Post. In the 1980s, the products range had been increased by the development and construction of three-wheel and four- wheel electric vehicles. The hospitals, airports, municipalities, industrial companies and the post office came for a variety of their transportation tasks. Many more prototypes of electric cars were built, but none of these vehicles made it to market. For the Mirage IIIS and RS fighter aircraft of the Swiss Air Force, MOWAG and AEG worked together and built the aircraft tractor MOWAG-AEG. In the 1980s, MOWAG built vibratory rollers for road construction. Handheld double vibratory rollers were from 900kg to 1,300 kg, tandem Vibratory rollers from 2,000 kg to 3,000 kg and 4 \\"wheeled\\" rollers from 4.5t to 18t. For several decades MOWAG was the sole importer to Switzerland of the Dodge Ram Wagon, these were converted to four-wheel drive fire brigade vehicles, and occasionally police vehicles and ambulances. They were all given the MOWAG Insignia on the front. Private individuals were not allowed to purchase new vehicles, however MOWAG did sell spare parts to privately owned Dodge Ram Wagons. Lately, Mowag has been specializing in armoured vehicles for military use, because it is financially more attractive. The main product today is the Piranha. In addition, other armored vehicles are being produced based on the American HMMWV/MOWAG Eagle, and the Duro. These vehicles comes from the acquired business of Bucher-Guyer. Also Mowag is responsible for spare parts for the Bucher FS 10 Flugzeugschlepper 78/aircraft tugs who are in use by the Swiss Air Force, Pilatus Aircraft and JuAir. Since January 2004, Mowag has been a company within the General Dynamics European Land Systems group and at present employs around 750 highly skilled personnel at the facility in Kreuzlingen, Switzerland. MOWAG continues to operate as a Swiss company, and is organised and incorporated under Swiss law. General Dynamics European Land Systems is part of General Dynamics Corporation (GD). From 1 April 2010, the company is known as General Dynamics European Land Systems ‚Äì MOWAG GmbH. Current products=MOWAG Piranha Piranhas are available in 4√ó4, 6√ó6, 8√ó8, and 10√ó10 wheel versions. There are several variants within these versions, giving different degrees of armour protection and several kinds of turret, for use in a variety of roles. Piranha derivatives have been assigned roles as troop transports, command vehicles, fire support vehicles, tank trainers, and police vehicles. Piranhas are used by the Swiss Army. Swiss-built Piranha derivatives have been exported to Sweden, Denmark, Ireland, Romania, Spain, and Belgium. The Romanian and Belgian Armies have selected the Piranha IIIC 8√ó8. Belgium converted to an all-wheeled force, and replaced all their M113s, AIFVs and Leopard 1s with 268 Piranha IIIC in 7 variants MOWAG Eagle MOWAG Eagle The MOWAG Eagle is a lightly-armoured, light tactical vehicle similar, to the American HMMWV. It is designed to fulfill roles such as command, reconnaissance, logistics, and military police. It can have seating for up to six soldiers while still retaining an in-depth communications system and equipment to fit mission requirements. A total of 365 Eagle 4x4 reconnaissance vehicles and 120 Eagle 4x4 artillery forward observation vehicles have been built in the past eight years and are in service with the Swiss and Danish Forces. The newly developed Eagle IV, based on the DURO, is suitable for reconnaissance, communications and observation, as well as for UN missions and border patrol. The Mowag development on the basis of the proven DURO chassis is distinguished through a very high payload versus a low gross vehicle weight (GVW), with a high ballistic and mine protection level as well as exceptional mobility both on and off-road. Due to the commonality with the DURO family of vehicles, the maintenance and training costs can be kept low in a fleet mission. A new version of the Eagle was launched by General Dynamics European Land Systems - MOWAG GmbH at EUROSATORY 2010 on 14 June 2010. MOWAG DURO MOWAG DURO Swiss Army The MOWAG DURO is a highly mobile, off-road tactical transport vehicle based on the DURO family of vehicles. DURO stands for DUrable and RObust. Initially developed for Switzerland by Bucher-Guyer AG in Niederweningen, Switzerland, who started production of all-wheel-drive trucks in 1976. An initial 3,000 vehicles order for the Swiss Armed Forces came through in 1994. Over 4,000 DURO 4x4 and 6x6 vehicles are now in service worldwide. Main customers are Switzerland, Germany, Venezuela, Great Britain, and Malaysia. In addition to these, the vehicle is used in many other countries for special purposes. The latest versions are the DURO II and DURO III. Germany has ordered the DURO IIIP 6x6 ballistic and mine protected version. *Rheinmetall YAK The YAK is an armoured and mine-protected transport vehicle produced by the German company Rheinmetall Landsysteme AG based on the DURO IIIP chassis.

The athletes have the option to board through the schools Residential Program.  Residential Program  Sun Valley Community School‚Äôs Residential Program began in 2011 with eight students, who lived in what had been the Bald Mountain Inn. In January 2017 a new 25,000 square foot dormitory, Rufus M. Brown Hall, opened its doors. Rufus M Brown Hall includes the 3,200 square foot Julia Argyros Training Center which, in the fall of 2017, was designated a \\"High Performance Center\\" by U.S. Ski and Snowboard. Rufus M. Brown Hall currently houses more than 24 students, as well as Residential Advisors (RAs). Boarding students are fully integrated into the life of the school, and participate on teams, in clubs, and in theater performances.  Outdoor Program and Outdoor Leadership Academy  Sun Valley Community School's Outdoor Program is a three or four- year program that develops the skills, experience, and certifications students need to lead outdoor trips, and fosters general leadership skills. Students complete core requirements in addition to one skill-based section in Mountain and Rock, River, Backcountry Winter Travel, or Wilderness Travel.

He commanded the Polish detachment in South Podlasie and northern Lesser Poland, defeating the Russians in many skirmishes. He was captured eventually in April 1865, sentenced to death by the Russians and hanged publicly in Soko≈Ç√≥w Podlaski in the presence of a crowd of 10,000 people. Stanislaw was the son of Marceli Brzoska and Karolina n√©e Enskajt. He was born into South Podlasie branch of an ancient Mazovian noble family, which came from the Land of R√≥≈ºan. His coat of arms was the Nowina. At the age of seventeen, Brzoska entered Kiev University, where he studied for three years. Brzoska then moved to Jan√≥w Podlaski, joining the local Roman ‚Äì Catholic seminar. On July 25, 1858, he officially became a priest, and soon afterwards, was named a vicar in Sokolow Podlaski, where he remained for three years. In early 1861, Brzoska was transferred to ≈Åuk√≥w, where on March 10, 1861, he was arrested by Tsarist authorities for patriotic, pro-Polish sermons. The young priest was sentenced by Russian military court for two years at Zamo≈õƒá Fortress, but was eventually released after three months. In January 1863, the January Uprising began in Congress Poland and other territories of former Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth. Brzoska was appointed leader of the anti-Russian rebellion in ≈Åuk√≥w County, and on January 23, he formed a unit which attacked Russian garrison at ≈Åuk√≥w. After this raid, the priest was named military chaplain of the uprising, and promoted to the rank of general. Brzoska participated in several skirmishes and battles: at Siemiatycze, Woskrzenice, Grezowka, W≈Çodawa, Slawatycze and Fajslawice. In the spring of 1864 he organized a 40-men strong mounted unit, which operated in the region until late December. In early 1865, Brzoska, together with his adiutant Franciszek Wilczynski, hid in the house of Ksawery Bielinski, soltys of the village of Krasnodeby-Sypytki, near Sokolow Podlaski. The Russians found out about this from Antonina Konarzewska, a courier of the Polish National Government, who had been captured and tortured by them. In April 1865, the village was surrounded by the Russians. During an exchange of fire, Brzoska and Wilczynski were wounded and captured. The priest was sentenced to death, and the sentence was approved by Count Friedrich Wilhelm Rembert von Berg, the Namestnik of the Kingdom of Poland. The public execution took place on May 23, 1865 in the Sokolow Podlaski market square.  Commemoration  On May 23, 1925, Brzoska's monument was unveiled in Sokolow Podlaski. A monument with a commemorative plaque is also located in the village of Krasnodeby-Sypytki; furthermore, another monument stands in a forest near the village of Dabrowka, ≈Åuk√≥w County, where Brzoska hid for some time. On May 23, 2008, Brzoska was posthumously awarded the Order of the White Eagle, by President Lech Kaczy≈Ñski.

The film is about a boy (Thomas) who must come to terms with his potential stepfather (Chase), a well meaning lawyer who is unknowingly the subject of a manhunt by relatives of a man he helped land in prison. It was shot in Los Angeles, California and Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Plot Five year old Ben Archer watches silently as his father starts up his car and drives away with his secretary, and they both offer only a wave out the window in parting. His mother, Sandy (Farrah Fawcett), can only watch heartbroken from the window of their house as her ex husband leaves them. Ben‚Äôs father promised to visit him, yet never comes back. They are both upset, but they decide to have a fresh start, so they move into a loft apartment in downtown Seattle to begin a new life with just the two of them. Sandy makes creative efforts to turn it into a home for them. They gradually overcome his father leaving and foster a very close bond with important rituals and routines, including making a collage with beach debris. Sandy develops an interest in dating, but her suitors never fit well and do not last long, which allows Ben‚Äôs ideal relationship with his mother to resume. Five years later, however, Sandy decides she is ready for marriage again, and begins seriously dating U.S. Federal Prosecutor, Attorney Jack Sturges (Chevy Chase). In Federal Court, Jack successfully prosecutes mobster Frank Renda for drug trafficking. Before being sentenced to fifty years in federal prison at Sheridan, the elderly Frank makes a veiled threat of revenge towards Jack. After court is adjourned, Frank‚Äôs son Joey (Richard Portnow) rephrases the threat in a more intimidating manner, but Jack does not back down and then dismisses him entirely. Sandy and Jack discuss his moving in, of which eleven year old Ben (Jonathan Taylor Thomas) does not approve despite his mother‚Äôs reassurance that it is only a trial period. Jack is confident he can win him over, telling Sandy he has read every book on step parenting he could find. The transition does not go smoothly for Ben, as he resentfully feels he is the one suffering all of the adjustments and that his mother is making the same mistake she made with his father, so he resorts to ensuring Jack is as uncomfortable and unwelcome as possible. Jack tries taking the subterfuge in stride, not realizing it is deliberate, but his efforts to connect with the boy are met with irritation as he only succeeds in disrupting Ben‚Äôs customary lifestyle. After meeting a boy named Norman Bronski (Zachary Browne) at school, Ben feigns interest in joining the Indian Guides ‚Äì a YMCA father son program ‚Äì with Jack to secretly drive a wedge between them and get rid of him. Despite reluctance, Jack goes along with it at Sandy‚Äôs insistence, and he and Ben join Norman's \\"tribe,\\" the Minotauks. Neither of them like the club, but Ben manages to effectively humiliate Jack at meetings. Once it starts interfering with his job, Jack tells Sandy he can no longer be part of it. Ben fakes distress by this and compares it to his father leaving to turn Sandy against her boyfriend. Jack goes to apologize, and instead overhears Ben bragging about everything over the phone to his best friend Monroe. Although he is disheartened by this revelation, Jack does not tell Sandy about it and instead seeks advice from Indian Guides chief and fellow stepfather Chet Bronski (George Wendt). Chet tells Jack, the reason why Ben is doing this because he is afraid Jack will take his mother away from him. Chet was like Jack himself, Norman and Chet never got along, but the Indian Guides help them have a great relationship. That is what Jack will do. He then redoubles his efforts to bond with Ben by improving the Indian Guides. Meanwhile, Ben starts to connect with Norman and they become close friends after a sleepover. Just as Jack starts to strengthen his relationship with Ben, Joey‚Äôs threat catches up with him: the brakes on his Ford Explorer are cut, but Jack manages to avoid a more serious crash and ends up in Puget Sound. This causes him to miss an important canoe trip he promised to attend. Ben, having finally opened up, is genuinely hurt by this perceived betrayal to the point of tears, as it brings up bad memories of his father‚Äôs broken promises. Ben returns home at the same time Jack does, he tells Ben that he had car trouble and was unable to get to the canoe trip on time and that he's sorry, but then Jack tells Ben that Chet had planned a camping trip for the Indian Guides on the 4th of July and that Jack promises Ben that they will go on the trip no matter what happens. Jack conceals the truth and refuses his boss Bob‚Äôs (Ron Canada) order to transfer to Portland, Oregon so he can redeem himself to go camping. His initial attempts are unsuccessful, and he feels the situation is hopeless. Joey and his two goons, Murray and Tony, are then discovered in the woods with rifles by Ben planning to kill Jack, and Jack confesses the truth behind his \\"car trouble\\" which garners Ben's forgiveness and understanding as he now knows Jack did not intentionally betray his trust like his father. Jack sends the rest of the Indian Guides to the ranger station while he and Ben (who returned to help him) improvise to distract the criminals. The pair is eventually cornered in front of an abandoned mine shaft entrance rigged with dynamite, until they are rescued by the Minotauks and the crooks are disabled. Ben is impressed and finally gives his approval of Jack and consents to Jack proposing to Sandy. The two complete the beach collage, which symbolizes that the three of them are finally whole as a family. Jack and Sandy marry, with the Minotauks in attendance at the wedding, and despite nothing being perfect, all are happy.

They are widely distributed in fresh and brackish water in South and Southeast Asia, ranging from India to the Philippines and Greater Sundas. They are all viviparous, producing small clutches of up to 30 fry that closely resemble the adults, except they are much smaller, around in length. Adults are typically around in length, with females being slightly larger than males. Males tend to be more brightly coloured and are well known for being aggressive towards one another. The wrestling halfbeak, D. pusilla, is widely used in Asia as fighting animals upon which wagers are placed (see Siamese fighting fish). Both sexes have lower jaws (mandibles) that are much longer than the upper ones, and from this comes the \\"halfbeak\\" name. Dermogenys feed extensively on small insects, either in the form of aquatic larvae or as flying insects that have fallen onto the surface of the water. They are important predators on insects such as mosquitoes, so play a role in controlling malaria. Reproduction A three- week-old Dermogenys fry. Dermogenys are live-bearing fish that practise internal fertilisation. The male is equipped with a gonopodium-like anal fin known as an andropodium that delivers sperm into the female. The gestation period is about one month. The exact mode of reproduction ranges from ovoviviparity through to viviparity (see section on reproduction in the Zenarchopteridae article). About ten embryos are developed at any one time, but at birth, these are fairly large (around ) compared with other fish of this size. Dermogenys adults are around in length, depending on the species. Species There are currently 12 recognized species in this genus: * Dermogenys bispina A. D. Meisner & Collette, 1998 * Dermogenys brachynotopterus (Bleeker, 1853) * Dermogenys bruneiensis A. D. Meisner, 2001 * Dermogenys burmanica Mukerji, 1935 * Dermogenys collettei A. D.

It is a clinical diagnostic method to determine a patient's haemorrhagic tendency. It assesses fragility of capillary walls and is used to identify thrombocytopenia (a reduced platelet count). The test is part of the WHO algorithm for diagnosis of dengue fever. A blood pressure cuff is applied and inflated to the midpoint between the systolic and diastolic blood pressures for five minutes. The test is positive if there are more than 10 to 20 petechiae per square inch.  Limitations  Some studies have shown that the tourniquet test may not have high specificity. Interfering factors with this test are women who are premenstrual, postmenstrual and not taking hormones, or those with sun damaged skin, since all will have increased capillary fragility.Pagana, & Pagana, 1998; Tsai, 2000 However many other studies have shown that the tourniquet test has good specificity but a low sensitivity. Therefore, its use as a diagnostic test for dengue is questioned as people who have a negative test may still have dengue. It is no longer used as a classification test for dengue haemorraghic fever in the latest WHO guidance.
