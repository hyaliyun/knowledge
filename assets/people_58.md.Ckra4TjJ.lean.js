Leaves usually have 3 leaflets but sometimes 5 or only 1, and are deciduous. The plant is dioeocious, with male and female plants on separate plants, also unusual for the genus. As with other Rubus, the canes are typically vegetative the first year, and reproductive in the second. Flowers are white with narrower petals than most related species, and have a fragrance.Ecoplexity.org: Rubus ursinus; description + images.

When mature/established, the plant is effective in stabilizing creek banks and edges of bioswales. To set large fruit, the plant needs consistent amounts of moisture. Otherwise it is moderately drought tolerant when established. Seed size seems to be related to fruit \\"cell\\" size, and the smallest (1 cm) fully formed berries are most highly prized. These are sometimes called \\"little wild blackberries.\\" ;Cultivars A cultivar of this species named the 'Aughinbaugh' blackberry was a parent of the loganberry. Rubus ursinus is also a second generation parent of the boysenberry and the marionberry, or 'Marion' blackberry. 'Wild Treasure' has the fruit size and flavor of the wild species, but without prickles, and the berries are machine harvestable. It was released by the USDA-ARS in 2010, and is a hybrid between a selection of Rubus ursinus and 'Waldo' (another cultivar that is a second generation descendant of the marionberry that has no prickles).

The town of Namsos lies about to the north, on the other side of the river Namsen. History S√¶vik had a church and was for many years the seat of a sub-parish (sokn). In the 16th century, S√¶vig was recorded as a part of Fosnes prestegjeld (parish). From 1820, it was part of the prestegjeld of Overhalla (not the same as Overhalla municipality). There were churches in S√¶vik, Vemundvik (from 1844), and in Namsos (from 1859). In 1859, Namsos became a parish of its own. The parish of S√¶vik was split in 1859, so that the northern part (Vemundvik) remained with Overhalla, and S√¶vik became a parish of its own. In 1866, a new church was built in the village of Klinga, about south of S√¶vik and the old church was torn down.

Career Sunesson was born in Gothenburg, Sweden, into a golfing family. At age 15, she played golf at amateur standard. In 1986, Sunesson and her mother Stina won the Swedish Mother and Daughter Championship, played as 36-hole foursome stroke-play. The same year she decided to get an insight on the tour. At the European Tour tournament Scandinavian Enterprise Open in Stockholm in July, she tried to be a volunteer caddie and was asked to stand in a line with all other candidates. When all male volunteer caddies finally had been chosen by the tournament professionals, three teen-age girls were left without a bag yet. The names of the three girls were Sunesson, Annika S√∂renstam and Charlotta S√∂renstam. Finally by persuading tour player Jaime Gonzalez, Brazil, he let her caddie for him. She soon began caddying for Howard Clark during the 1980s before Nick Faldo asked her to join up with him at the end of 1989. Faldo, who had recently undergone major swing surgery with coach David Leadbetter, would win four majors together with Sunesson over a nine-year period. Sunesson decided to part from Faldo in 1999 to caddie for Sergio Garc√≠a in what was a short-lived stint of just eight tournaments before being sacked after a run of poor form culminated in Garc√≠a missing the cut in The Players Championship. Present day Sunesson then had stints with Fred Funk and Notah Begay III before being rehired by Nick Faldo. It was a coincidence that Sunesson and Faldo both married their respective partners on the same date in July 2001. She serves as a mental coach for Martin Kaymer. Sunesson retired in 2012 to coach and advise full-time. In 2018, Sunesson came out of retirement to serve as Australian golfer Adam Scott's caddie for The Open Championship at Carnoustie and she caddied for fellow Swede Henrik Stenson at the 2019 Masters Tournament.

Life Ebeling was born on 6 July 1912 in Steglitz, Berlin, where he attended the gymnasium and began his university study. Ebeling was later a student of Rudolf Bultmann and Wilhelm Maurer in Marburg and of Emil Brunner at the University of Z√ºrich, Switzerland. The years of his study in Berlin, Marburg, and Z√ºrich fell in the period of Nazism in Germany, and his contact with Dietrich Bonhoeffer as well as his work in the Confessing Church had an enduring influence on his thought. He completed his Doctor of Theology degree in 1938 at the University of Z√ºrich under the supervision of ; his dissertation was entitled Evangelical Interpretation of the Gospels: An Investigation of Luther's Hermeneutic. Already in this early work, Ebeling's interest in systematic as well as historical questions was very apparent. At the end of the Second World War, he completed in 1947 his habilitation at the University of T√ºbingen, Germany and assumed the chair for ecclesiastical history in T√ºbingen. In 1954 Ebeling changed his focus of study from ecclesiastical history to systematic theology and became Professor of Systematic Theology in T√ºbingen. Two years later, he was called to the University of Z√ºrich in systematic. With the exception of the period from 1965 to 1968, when he was once again in T√ºbingen, Ebeling remained in Z√ºrich, where he was the founder and, until his retirement in 1979, the director of the Institute for Hermeneutics. From 1950 Ebeling was the chief editor of the publication ', and for several decades he presided over the Commission for the Publication of the Works of Martin Luther. Gerhard Ebeling held honorary doctorates from the universities of Bonn (1952), Uppsala (1970), St. Louis (1971), Edinburgh (1981), Neuch√¢tel (1993), and T√ºbingen (1997). Ebeling's primary academic interests lay in the area of hermeneutics and the theology of Martin Luther, and both of these areas were combined in his focus on the proclamation of the gospel in the Christian Church. In connection with hermeneutics and the New Testament, he came in close contact with Ernst Fuchs, with whom he shared his interest in proclamation; in the early 1960s, Ebeling and Fuchs were guest lecturers at Claremont in Southern California where they presented their vision of a new hermeneutic (see James M. Robinson and John B. Cobb, Jr., eds., The New Hermeneutic, 1964). Both Ebeling and Fuchs stressed the character and power of language, the role of the Bible in the pulpit (Wesley O. Allen, Determining the Form, Structures for Preaching, 2008). From a systematic perspective, Ebeling's thought focused on the relationship between law and gospel, and one of his most original contributions was to interpret this relationship within the context of a relational ontology based on the situation of human beings and . In researching Luther's interpretation of the Psalms, Ebeling discovered the central role of the and developed the idea in the context of an ontology. He died on 30 September 2001.

The first ship to be named Auk by the Navy, Minesweeper No. 38 was laid down on 20 June 1918 at New York City by the Todd Shipyard Corp.; launched on 28 September 1918; sponsored by Miss Nan McArthur Beattie daughter of a Todd Shipyard foremen, and commissioned at the New York Navy Yard on 31 January 1919, Lt. Gregory Cullen in command. Between World War I and World War II, Auk was converted into a survey ship for the Coast and Geodetic Survey, and was renamed USS Discoverer (ARS-3) as well as USC&GS; Discoverer.  World War I-related service  Upon completion of her initial fitting out and dock trials, Auk proceeded to Tompkinsville, Staten Island, on the afternoon of 24 February reporting to Minesweeping Division, 3d Naval District. On 2 March, Auk sailed for Newport, Rhode Island, in company with (Minesweeper No. 8) and arrived there the next morning. Returning to the Mine Sweeping Base at New York on the morning of the 6th, Auk left New York waters the following afternoon, bound for Boston, Massachusetts.  Surviving a savage North Atlantic storm  The minesweeper, rolling and pitching heavily as the winds and seas rose, was proceeding on her coastwise voyage when, in the predawn darkness of the 0000-0400 watch on 8 March, men in the crews' compartment detected water entering their space at an alarming rate. While some of the crew bailed doggedly, others rigged a \\"handy billy\\", and, later, a wrecking pump, in an effort to cope with the flooding. With water coming on board faster than it could be removed the ship sought refuge. Auk accordingly altered course at 0905 and plunged through the rough seas and a veritable curtain of fog, while her foghorn blared its warning. She anchored that afternoon, but waves breaking over the after deck foiled attempts to rig the heavy-duty wrecking pumps into the after hold (into which the water was coming, through the rudder stock) since it was impossible to remove the hatch without allowing more water to get below in the process. Then just as the fog began to lift to the northward and the ship prepared to weigh anchor and get underway, the anchor engine jammed. Quick repairs enabled Auk's men to begin the process of hoisting up the hook, and the minesweeper got underway and eventually reached safe haven in the lee of Montauk Point. She reached the Boston Navy Yard at 1115 on the 11th and moored alongside sister ship (Minesweeper No. 7). Auk remained there for over a month, undergoing repairs and fitting out for her pending duty sweeping the North Sea Mine Barrage. During this time, paravanes (\\"Burney Gear\\") were installed in the ship and she underwent necessary upkeep. She departed the yard late on the afternoon of 14 April, standing out of President Roads to anchor for the night off Provincetown, Massachusetts. On the morning of 15 April, after calibrating her compasses Auk got underway for the Orkney Islands, joining three of her sister ships: (Minesweeper No. 10), (Minesweeper No. 37), and Oriole. All went well until two days from their destination, when steering gear problems briefly disabled first Heron, and then Auk; each time Oriole's took them under tow. Ultimately, the four minesweepers reached Kirkwall, Orkney Islands, on 29 April 1919, shortly after the Minesweeping Detachment flagship, the destroyer tender (Destroyer Tender No. 9), had arrived to establish headquarters there for the ensuing operations.  Mine clearance  Among the last of the minesweepers to reach the Orkney Islands Auk missed the first, experimental, mine clearance (29 April to 2 May). However, Auk suffered the first fatality of the operation on 3 May, Boatswain's Mate 1st Class William McHaskell, was fatally crushed while unreeling sweep wire from the drum of the anchor engine. A Naval Board of Inquiry which met to ascertain the particulars of the death of the boatswain's mate recommended that safety guards be installed on that equipment in all sweepers to prevent similar accidents. Over the next five months, Auk and her sister ships - together with a group of 110-foot subchasers ((SC's)) supported by an Allied flotilla of British and American logistics and repair ships and loaned British Admiralty naval trawlers - carried out the dangerous task of sweeping some 55,000 mines sown in 1918 between the coasts of Scotland and Norway to contain the German U-boats in the North Sea. Auk spent over 95 days on the minefields in the often \\"dirty\\" weather associated with the North Sea as they carried out their unprecedented mission of clearing the sea lanes to permit a resumption of civilian commerce in the wake of World War I.  Tow wire wraps around Auks prop  Underway from Kirkwall at 0600 on 10 May, Auk took SC-46 in tow and proceeded to the minefields in company with Oriole, Heron, and Sanderling, each in turn towing a chaser. While she was passing sweep wire to Oriole, the line snagged in Auk's propeller. Oriole took her sister ship in tow, but soon turned over the towing to (Minesweeper No. 3), which took Auk to Lerwick, in the Shetland Islands. There, British divers from the tender Edna removed the sweep wire on 13 May.  Continued minesweeping after repairs  Auk returned to the minefields and teamed with Oriole to conduct a sweep on the afternoon of the 14th. During her first pass she cut loose three mines, one fouling the \\"kite\\" astern and the other two fouling the line itself. Over the next few days, Auk carried out the repetitious task of sweeping, again in company with Oriole. Auk had a near miss on the 15th when a mine exploded nearby. The minesweeper varied her daily routine in the minefields - which lasted into late May by escorting SC-356 to Lerwick and back on 17 and 18 May. During the latter half of the month, Auk teamed with, on different occasions, Oriole, (Minesweeper No. 34), or (Minesweeper No. 25). Returning to Kirkwall on 29 May, Auk refueled there from the British tanker Aspenleaf.  Damaged in third barrage clearance operation  During June, Auk participated in the third clearance operation on the barrage, getting underway from Kirkwall for the minefields on 5 June and returning to port on the 27th. She broke up the routine with brief visits to Kirkwall and Otterswick (9 and 12 June, respectively), but spent most of the month on the barrage. This time around, her sweeping partners included the familiar Oriole, Robin, and (Minesweeper No. 4). On 21 June. a mine exploded 50 yards astern tripped the generators (plunging the engine and fire rooms into darkness) and knocked down part of the brick walls in her two boilers. but she resumed sweeping operations the next day.  Auk serves as flagship  During the next two minesweeping operations that followed Auk served as the flagship for the detachment commander, Capt. Roscoe C. Bulmer, a highly regarded man, revered by the men he commanded. Capt. Bulmer embarked for the first time at Kirkwall on 7 July 1919 when he broke his broad pennant in Auk shortly before she proceeded to sea. That day, she teamed with Oriole in sweeping a portion of the field that had been laid on 13 October of the previous year and, on the following day, swept in company with (Minesweeper No. 17).  Mine damage to several ships  A chronicler of the North Sea Mine Barrage clearance wrote about 9 July: \\"...misfortune did not rain; it poured\\". Mines damaged three minesweepers, the tug, , and a subchaser. Again sweeping in company with Eider, Auk hit a mine at 0925 that detonated another mine off her starboard bow in a chain reaction; there was also a third explosion (probably caused by the second) 30 yards astern, carrying away the sweep and resulting in the loss of a \\"kite\\" and of wire.  Auk tries to rescue Pelican, damaged by mines  At 1000, an upper level mine exploded beneath (Minesweeper No. 27), which in turn triggered five simultaneous countermines around her. Pelican heavily hit, battered, and holed, assumed a list before beginning to settle. Auk, with Capt. Bulmer directing the rescue operations, immediately altered course to close with her sister ship. Passing a line at 1008, within 10 minutes of the explosions, she drew alongside Pelican. After one hose line parted, Auk passed another to aid Pelican in pumping out the rapidly rising water below-decks. However, the rough seas repeatedly slammed the ships together, damaging lines and hoses and forcing their replacement. At 1054, (Minesweeper No. 23) passed a towline and began moving ahead with the crippled Pelican, in turn tethered to Auk, astern. Eider fell in with the group as it labored ahead, securing to Pelican's starboard side, Eider and Auk acting much in the fashion of waterwings, keeping their sister ship afloat between them. Difficulties soon arose, however, as the ships struggled toward the Orkneys. A head sea sprang up, tossing the minecraft about and straining moorings and hose lines. Pump lines were carried away and Pelican began to settle further by the bow. The pressure of the water in the flooded forward compartments in the damaged ship now buckled and distorted the forward fireroom bulkhead, the only barrier that could save Pelican from sinking. At 2300, Capt. Bulmer ordered most of Pelicans crew transferred to Eider. A dozen volunteers chosen from the crew remained on board Pelican. Gradually, however, the pumps of Auk and Eider, working full capacity after the lines had been repaired and again placed in operation, succeeded in lowering Pelicans waterline. The battle to keep Pelican afloat continued on into the night and into the predawn darkness, men standing by with axes to chop through the mooring lines should Pelican give any indication of imminent sinking. Finally, on the morning of 10 July, the valiant little flotilla limped into Tresness Bay where Auk's pumps continued to help lower her sister ship's waterline even further. Underway to return to Kirkwall at 1726, Auk reached her destination a little over four hours later and Capt. Bulmer (whose seamanship many credited with having saved Pelican) disembarked. The next day Auk took Rear Admiral Elliott Strauss, Commander, Mine Force, from Kirkwall to Inverness, Scotland, before she returned to Kirkwall, ready to resume operations.  Captain Bulmer killed in an auto accident  Shortly after midnight on 22 July, Capt. Bulmer transferred his command pennant from Black Hawk to Auk and wore it in the ship as she teamed with Oriole during the detachment's fifth mine clearance operation. Capt. Bulmer disembarked for the last time at 0017 on 1 August and, tragically, just three days later suffered severe injuries in an automobile accident. He died on 5 August, and his loss was felt tremendously throughout the detachment, since his intrepid personality had stamped itself on the force and inspired it during his time in command.  Auk loses another boatswain's mate to the sea  Auk subsequently took part in two additional minesweeping operations that lasted through late September, drawing her participation in this epic venture to a close when she anchored at Kirkwall on 26 September 1919. During the first of these missions (mid-to-late August), Auk ranged as far as the coast of Norway, touching at the ports of Stavenger and Hangeand, and Bommel Fjord. During this operation, Auk suffered her second fatality: at 0715 on 31 August a kite wire, jumping out of a chock, knocked Boatswain's Mate 1st Class Lee A. Singleton over the side. Auk immediately commenced maneuvering to pick him up, cutting the sweep wire, throwing over a life buoy, and hoisting the man overboard signal, but a one-hour search failed to find the missing man.  Repaired at Invergordon from mine damage  Drydocked at Invergordon on 2 and 3 September to repair damage suffered when mines exploded close aboard on 30 August, Auk performed local tug and towing duties at Kirkwall in mid-September before resuming operations in the minefields later that month.  European tour after completion of North Sea work  After completing her work in the North Sea, Auk, her sister ships, and the support craft that had serviced them headed for home. Underway from Kirkwall on 1 October, Auk reached Plymouth, England, on the 5th, and underwent voyage repairs there until the 16th, when she left the British Isles and headed for the coast of France reaching Brest on the morning of the 17th. After steaming from there to Lisbon, Portugal, for a brief period of upkeep alongside Black Hawk, Auk began her homeward voyage on the afternoon of 24 October. Auk refueling at sea from Black Hawk while approaching Bermuda on 11 November, an event necessitated by the discovery two days before that the after peak tank had leaked salt water, thus contaminating the oil. Reducing speed to conserve fuel, Auk was taken in tow by Swallow later that day, the former hoisting sail to help in keeping on course. On the morning of the 10th, Auk went alongside Black Hawk in an attempt at underway replenishment, only to have the fuel hose carry away and foul the minesweeper's propeller. Black Hawk then towed Auk throughout the night. In another attempt at refueling between 0925 and 1115 the next morning, Auk took on board 20 tons of oil and reached Grassy Bay, Bermuda, six hours later.  The Secretary of the Navy welcomes minesweeps back to the States  Auk reached Tompkinsville, Staten Island, on 19 November. Anchoring in the North River on 21 November, near her old sweeping partner, Oriole, Auk lay in that waterway when Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels reviewed the assembled mine force sweepers, chasers, and tenders. On the 24th, from the deck of (Destroyer No. 165). Daniels reported: \\"Upon their return to the United States they [the ships of the Minesweeping Detachment] were given a welcome as genuine as when our dreadnoughts returned from service abroad\\" and \\"voiced the country's appreciation of the magnificent and successful completion of that most hazardous and strenuous operation.\\"  Between the wars activity and inactivity  The Minesweeping Detachment was demobilized, and its ships scattered throughout the fleet. Auk departed Tompkinsville on the morning of 27 November and, with (Minesweeper No. 15), proceeded up the eastern seaboard, reaching Portsmouth, New Hampshire, on the afternoon of the 28th. During a year in which she remained inactive at Portsmouth, Auk was given the alphanumeric hull designation AM 38 on 17 July 1920. She was placed \\"in ordinary,\\" with no crew on board, on 28 December 1920. Although still inactive, Auk was assigned to Division 1 Minesweeping Squadron, on 8 January 1921.  United States Coast and Geodetic Survey career  While Auk lay in reserve, the Coast and Geodetic Survey found itself in urgent need of ships to replace those which, for reasons of age or unsuitability for the work to be performed, had been disposed of. Under the terms of the Executive Order of 12 October 1921, Auk and - renamed USC&GS; Discoverer and USC&GS; Pioneer, respectively - were taken to the Boston Navy Yard and transferred to the Coast and Geodetic Survey on 7 April 1922. Discoverer served in the Coast and Geodetic Survey as a survey ship until the summer of 1941, primarily in the waters of the Territory of Alaska.  World War II operations  With the expansion of the American Navy during this time between the outbreak of war in Europe and the entry of the United States in the conflict (1939 to 1941), that service cast about for auxiliary vessels to support the growing number of combatant ships. Executive Order of 19 June 1941 authorized the Navy to take USC&GS; Discoverer over for service as a salvage ship. The ship concluded her last operations with the Coast and Geodetic Survey in the summer of 1941 having worked out of Dutch Harbor, Cold Bay, Women's Bay, and Kodiak since the previous spring‚Äîand departed Ketchikan on 22 July 1941, bound for Seattle and turnover to the Navy. Arriving at Seattle on 25 July, Discoverer‚Äîthe retention of her name by the Navy approved on 5 August 1941. On the afternoon of 26 August Lt. Comdr. E. Froberg accepted custody of the ship. Assigned to the Lake Union plant, at Seattle, in October 1941 for degaussing and conversion, Discoverer was classified as ARS, the work was still in progress when the Japanese attacked the U.S. Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941. Delivered to salvage firm of Merritt, Chapman and Scott, Inc., who were to operate the vessel under a contract let by the Bureau of Ships, on 16 February 1942, Discoverer was based in familiar waters throughout hostilities with Japan, her ports of call including Kodiak, Dutch Harbor, Cold Bay, Nome, and Women's Bay. Discoverer assisted the U.S. Coast Guard-manned transport which had run aground while rescuing survivors from the wrecked which had previously run aground herself at Amchitka on 12 January 1943. After bearing an almost charmed life while in the Coast Survey, operating in the tricky waters of the Alaska coastline, Discoverer sustained serious bottom damage when she grounded off the coast of Prince Rupert Island on 20 November 1943 and required assistance from the Navy tug .  Post-World War II activity  Following repairs, Discoverer remained with Merritt, Chapman, and Scott into 1946. After it had been recommended on 18 November 1946 that the ship be struck from the Navy list and turned over to the Maritime Commission for \\"disposal as a usable vessel,\\" indicating that to some, the venerable minesweeper/survey ship/salvage vessel still had some years left - Discoverer was withdrawn from service the day after Christmas of 1946 and her name was struck from the Navy list on 28 January 1947. Auk was sold to the government of Venezuela on 9 June 1947 and renamed Felipe Larrazabal (R-11). The ship was decommissioned in 1962 and eventually abandoned at Puerto Cabello, Venezuela where the hulk is visible as of 2015.

It carries the Kennet and Avon Canal over the Semington Brook. History The Kennet and Avon Canal was the realisation of a plan to link the River Avon to the River Thames and hence Bristol to London, which had first been suggested in the late 1500s, during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I. The canal was surveyed by John Rennie and following a change of route, which resulted in the canal passing through Devizes and hence Semington, rather than Marlborough and Calne, an Act of Parliament was obtained in 1794 to authorise the plan and work began. The eastern section opened first, with the line from Newbury and the River Kennet to Hungerford opening in 1798, and from there to Great Bedwyn opening the following year. The western section through Semington was partially complete by this time, and was finished by 1804, but there were two gaps to be filled. These were the locks at Bath which connected the canal to the River Avon, and those at Devizes, which overcame a difference in level of , both of which were completed in 1810, enabling the canal to open throughout on 28 December. Rennie's route passed to the north of Seend. To the west of the village, the Semington Brook flows northwards and then turns to the west, to join the Avon at Whaddon. The canal sweeps to the south to join the valley, and runs along its north bank to reach Semington. For the canal to head towards Trowbridge, a smaller bend was needed to cross the valley, with an aqueduct to carry it over the brook.Ordnance Survey, 1:25,000 map The contract for the construction of the aqueduct was won by James McIlquham and James Porteous. Both had worked together on the Leeds and Liverpool Canal and Porteus had been asked by Rennie to quote for the aqueduct over the River Lune on the Lancaster Canal, but had failed to secure the contract. The contract for the Semington aqueduct also included construction of the aqueduct at Avoncliff, to the west of Bradford-on-Avon, and both were completed successfully, as the two men went on to win the contract for the Dundas Aqueduct at Limpley Stoke. Design The aqueduct consists of a single stilted segmental arch, mainly constructed of limestone ashlar masonry, although some repairs have been made with engineering bricks. On both sides of the structure there is a rectangular moulded panel, but no evidence that it ever carried an inscription. It has been a grade II listed structure since 1988.

The sound has been described as a hybrid of gothic rock, industrial rock and new wave - a combination that was described by Nyte as \\"dark future rock.\\" The Awakening has released eight studio albums, several singles, EPs and two greatest hits compilations. As of 2008 The Awakening has been based in the United States. The Awakening is credited in the press as \\"South Africa's most successful gothic rock act and one of the top bands in the far broader alternative scene.\\" The Awakening has had top charting radio singles and club rotation throughout South Africa, Europe, and the USA, and became the first gothic rock band to ever headline major national festivals throughout South Africa, including Oppikoppi and RAMfest, and has performed to crowds of 30,000+. History=Early years ‚Äì Risen Guitarist-vocalist Ashton Nyte began his musical career as front man for the South African rock band Martyr's Image, formed in early 1994. In 1995, Nyte asked Martyr's Image bassist Jenni Hazell and guitarist Philip Booyens to join him in his new project, which was tentatively titled \\"Children of the Torch\\" but later changed to \\"The Awakening\\" just prior to their first show in February 1996. Immediately following The Awakening's first performance, Nyte began production of his first studio album, Risen. The album was recorded at Mega Music Studios in Johannesburg with producer Leon Erasmus. More concerts followed, and amidst a steady schedule of shows Nyte returned to the studio to record his cover of the Simon and Garfunkel song \\"The Sounds of Silence.\\" The single went to No. 1 on South Africa's rock charts and became a cult classic for South African rock. The Awakening became both immediately famous throughout South Africa and the focal point of much controversy due to the dark stylings and sound. Request The Awakening's second album, Request, embraced the electronic and industrial sounds of 1980s new romantic movement. The Awakening began to achieve even more notice in the mainstream radio and media with the singles \\"Maree\\", \\"Rain\\" and \\"Before I Leap.\\" Maree as a single sold over 5,000 copies in its first year without major label support, and also went to #1 on the South African rock charts. The Awakening's first music video was shot for \\"Rain\\" by director Katinka Harrod. The video was shot in the middle of winter, which posed a unique and potentially dangerous challenge for Nyte who performed under icy water during filming, was painted black in body paint, and hosed clean for other scenes. The video brought more public exposure and was aired on several music shows throughout Africa. In November 1998 Ashton Nyte launched his own independent record label, Intervention Arts, and reissued the two previous Awakening albums as remastered editions with bonus tracks and new layouts. The albums were picked up by US and German distributors, and as a result The Awakening quickly built an international fan base. The hit single Rain was picked up in the USA and featured on various radio stations and cd compilations. Ethereal Menace With a new five member live line up, Nyte created The Awakening's third album, Ethereal Menace, which utilizes elements of industrial music. This style was later dubbed as \\"dark future rock\\". Ethereal Menace was released in July 1999, and achieved an enthusiastic reception: the single \\"The March\\" was successful and another music video was produced by South African Music Awards winner, director Eban Olivier's Concrete Productions, and the video was placed in rotation on MTV Europe. The Fourth Seal of Zeen In December 1999, Nyte took a break from The Awakening to concentrate on releasing his first solo album, The Slender Nudes. Nyte returned to The Awakening in September 2000, when he released The Fourth Seal of Zeen. The album displays a range of sounds between darkwave and classic gothic rock. The song \\"The Dark Romantics\\" became a gothic club dance floor anthem throughout the world, and remains one of the band‚Äôs most well- known singles to date. In the year 2001, the EP The Fountain was released, which echoed the atmosphere and style of Zeen. The Fountain single went to No. 4 on the South African rock charts, and charted in the top 10 for nine weeks. Nyte also released his second solo album, Dirt Sense, in 2002, which spent 17 weeks in South Africa's charts topping out at No. 2. Roadside Heretics In June 2002 Nyte recorded The Awakening's most aggressive, guitar-driven album to date, Roadside Heretics. Garrick van der Tuin replaced Glenn Welman as a live drummer which influenced the harsher sounds heard on the album. Thematically, Roadside Heretics deals with a discriminated-against and isolated people ‚Äì a subject well known to South Africa. According to Nyte, Roadside Heretics marked a new era for The Awakening, as he focused on capturing the trademark live performance intensity within the album‚Äôs sound. One of the album's singles, The Maker spent two weeks at No. 1 on the South African rock charts. In the same year, the compilation album Sacrificial Etchings was released, featuring singles from 1997 to 2002 and a few previously unreleased songs including the hit single \\"Vampyre Girl.\\" Sacrificial Etchings ranked as the 18th top album of 2003 in South Africa. Darker Than Silence Nyte released his third solo album, Sinister Swing, in 2003. A year later Nyte began to work on The Awakening‚Äôs most ambitious album by far, Darker Than Silence, with lyrical themes about devastation and medication. Songs such as \\"One More Crucifixion\\", \\"Angelyn\\", and \\"The Needle and the Gun\\" achieved a positive reception world-wide and notable success on South African and German charts. The success brought The Awakening to tour the United States for the first time in 2004. In July 2005, Nyte released his fourth solo album, Headspace with his solo band Ashton Nyte and the Accused. Razor Burn In 2006 Nyte signed a management deal with German based MCM Music, and later signed a record deal with German label Massacre Records. The Awakening then released a seventh studio album, Razor Burn. With the European distribution and marketing of Massacre Records, the album received more notice than previous albums as well as positive reviews from alternative music press. Intervention Arts distributed the album to South African and US markets. A second US tour followed. In late 2007, Nyte relocated to the US following a third US tour. The Awakening performed one of its first 2008 US shows as a headliner of HM Magazine‚Äôs stage at Cornerstone Festival 2008. Nyte‚Äôs fifth solo album, The Valley, was released in South Africa in October 2008 and in the USA in June 2010. The Awakening live in the US, 2009 Tales of Absolution and Obsoletion In 2009, The Awakening completed another US tour in promotion of the eighth studio album, Tales of Absolution and Obsoletion released June 2009. The live tour lineup included gothic fashion designer Rose Mortem on piano and keyboards, who married Nyte the same year. The album was described as the \\"most theatrical and dramatic yet.\\" Anthology XV On February 15, 2013, Nyte announced on The Awakening's official website that there would be a release of a new anthology compilation titled Anthology XV, featuring two new songs as well as remixes, reworkings, and updated versions of The Awakening's most well known songs. Anthology XV was released in April 2013 and a multi-date South African tour is scheduled for March‚ÄìApril 2014. A new studio album was also planned for release in 2017. Music The Awakening's music has evolved since its early years. While Risen strongly emphasizes an older school of guitar-driven gothic rock, Request embraced electronics and the 1980s new romantic movement. \\"Ethereal Menace\\" started the age of \\"dark-future-rock\\"‚Äîwhich is, as Nyte describes, \\"a hybrid of hard electronics and chunky guitars, with a strong dance floor undercurrent.\\" Nyte himself states David Bowie and Kate Bush as his \\"personal heroes\\" yet points out that his musical taste is \\"very broad\\". Like many other artists who prefer to create under a band name, The Awakening is \\"the creative brainchild of Ashton Nyte.\\" Since its inception, the band has had a different live lineup for each tour but no permanent band members. Unless otherwise indicated, all album instrumentation, vocals and lyrics are written and performed by Nyte, who describes his goals of live performance as \\"a ritual - type experience based on theatrical on-stage appearance and performance.\\" He further describes the \\"elements of passion, beauty, poetry and theatrics\\" as the cornerstones of live shows.

She was honored by the World Wildlife Fund and the Explorers Club for her pioneering work in wildlife ecology in the United States and Guatemala. LaBastille also took many wildlife photographs, many of which were published in nature publications.  Early life and marriage  LaBastille was born in Montclair, New Jersey, the only child of Ferdinand LaBastille, a professor, and Irma Goebel, a concert pianist, stage actress and musician. Her full name was Mariette Anne LaBastille, though she never used her first name. While her date of birth is often listed as Nov 20, 1935, her true date of birth was November 20, 1933, which Valerie J.

She became a licensed New York State Guide in the 1970s and offered guide services for backpacking and canoe trips into the Adirondacks. She gave wilderness workshops and lectures for over forty years, joined several New York Adirondack Mountains conservation organizations, and was on the Adirondack Park Agency Board of Commissioners for 17 years. She traveled around the world and worked with many non-profit organizations to study and alleviate the destructive effects of acid rain and pollution on lakes and wildlife. The Woodswoman series LaBastille's most popular books, the Woodswoman series, were a set of four memoirs spanning four decades of her life in the Adirondack Mountains and chronicled her relationship with the wilderness. Inspired by Henry David Thoreau's Walden, LaBastille purchased land on the edge of a mountain lake in the Adirondacks, where she built a log cabin in 1964. At the beginning of her first book, Woodswoman (1976), she documented the process of obtaining materials and building the cabin with the help of a pair of local carpenters. To avoid cutting old growth forest on the property, she purchased pre-cut logs from a local sawmill and used store-bought lumber to build the floor joists, roof, door frames, and window frames. The remainder of Woodswoman records her adventures living in this log cabin without comforts such as electricity or running water, as well as her explorations into the wilderness of the Adirondacks. In her second book, Beyond Black Bear Lake (1987), she described how she built her smaller second cabin, Thoreau II, on a more remote area of her property in order to obtain a more Walden-like experience. Both the first and second books explored her friendships, romances, her previous marriage, her close bonds to her German Shepherd dogs, the ebb and flow of nature, and her conservation efforts. She conducted research on the endangered, and eventually extinct, giant pied-bill grebe bird. The final two books of the series, Woodswoman III (1997) and Woodswoman IV (2003), were published by LaBastille's publishing company, \\"West of the Wind Publications, Inc\\". In both volumes, LaBastille included stories illustrating the increasing difficulty of juggling a multifaceted career consisting of freelance writing, academic teaching, and conservation consulting work, with her ever-present desire to retreat into the wilderness. In Woodswoman III, she also discussed how pollutants were contaminating her remote lake; her only source of drinking water. Because of this, she purchased a farmstead near the hamlet of Wadhams in the Town of Westport near the western shore of Lake Champlain. The farmstead had modern conveniences such as phone and electricity, but was within the boundaries of the Adirondack Park. She writes in Woodswoman IV how her adamant stance against the development of the Adirondack Park had created contention and enemies. She received death threats, her remote cabin was broken into and a barn on her Westport property was burned down. She began working on Woodswoman V shortly after Woodswoman IV was published. She stated how self-publishing was more lucrative, but took away valuable time she needed for writing. She never finished Woodswoman V. Documerica Project LaBastille was part of the Documerica Project developed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). From 1971-77, the EPA hired freelance photographers to photograph areas with environmental problems, EPA activities, and the outdoors.

In Woodswoman IV and in an interview with the Cornell Alumni Magazine, LaBastille noted that rising global temperatures had transformed her lakeside property from a year-round home into a seasonal retreat. Throughout the 1960s and early 1970s, a thick sheet of ice formed on the lake, thus allowing snowshoeing across its surface from late November through late April. But in subsequent years warmer winter temperatures and February rain showers led to thinner lake ice, making trips across the lake treacherous and unpredictable. Without year-round neighbors or a phone in cases of emergency, LaBastille elected to stop spending winters at the cabin. She instead spent more time at her farmstead near Lake Champlain. Nevertheless, she wrote that she kept her mountain retreat as her place for \\"refuge, quiet, as a peaceful place to write and contemplate...\\".Woodswoman IV LaBastille, A.

David R White (born David Godfrey) is an American heavy metal lead vocalist who is best known for singing in the thrash metal band Heathen. Having stints in underground thrash bands Blind Illusion and Laughing Dead, he joined Heathen in 1985. He was ousted from the band in 1989, replaced by Paul Baloff, but returned that same year, performing on their next four albums, Breaking the Silence, Victims of Deception, The Evolution of Chaos and Empire of the Blind. White immediately stood out from the thrash metal crowd with his operatic, high pitched singing style. In 1992 White performed harmony backing vocals on thrash metal band Defiance's track \\"Inside Looking Out\\" from their Beyond Recognition album. Following the departure of Defiance vocalist Steev Esquivel and the dissolution of Heathen, White joined Defiance, which later evolved into Inner Threshold. In 2001 he returned to a reunited Heathen, and also played in a classic rock/metal cover band Fat Freddie's Cat with former Defiance members Doug Harrington, Jim Adams, and Mike Kaufmann.

She was drowned in AD 59, when an unsuccessful attempt was made at the same time to drown Agrippina. She may have been the daughter of Gnaeus Acerronius Proculus, consul in AD 37. Tacitus' account indicates that Agrippina the Younger had set sail on a cruise on which Nero had secreted conspirators intent on killing her. Agrippina and Acerronia, along with the steersman Crepereius Gallus, were underneath a canopy on deck which had been secretly weighted with lead. At a given signal, the canopy fell, killing the steersman, but missing Agrippina and Acerronia because of the high-backed couch they had been sitting on.Tacitus, Annals xiv. 4 There had been a mechanism designed to scuttle the ship, although it malfunctioned, and the conspirators failed in their further efforts to sink the craft. Meanwhile, Agrippina and Acerronia entered the water. Acerronia called out, claiming that she was Agrippina. The conspirators struck her with poles and oars until she had either been bludgeoned to death or drowned. Agrippina, wounded in the shoulder, managed to swim to a passing fishing boat. The account of Cassius Dio is fundamentally the same, although he does indicate that the boat was in fact scuttled, and that Acerronia drowned. He also mentions nothing about Agrippina being rescued by a passing boat, and instead claims she swam all the way to shore on her own.Cassius Dio, lxi. 13 References Polla Category:59 deaths Category:1st-century Roman women Category:Year of birth unknown ","title":"Acerronia Polla"},{"id":"13408741","text":"Flocarline (foaled 1900) was an American thoroughbred racehorse.

The film stars Mike Vogel and Christina Cole. The story centers on an American man living in Britain, Ian Stone (Vogel), who is killed each day by mysterious beings. He then enters a new existence, unaware of his prior lives. When he begins to remember past existences, he is once again in danger of being killed, with each death more gruesome than the last. Plot Ian Stone is an average man. He loves ice hockey but lives for his girlfriend, Jenny Walker. Late one night while driving home from a painful loss on the ice, Ian thinks he sees a dead body near the railroad tracks. Investigating the grisly discovery, Ian is attacked by the \\"corpse\\", forced onto the tracks and run over by a train. He wakes up in an office cubicle. He is older and living with a beautiful woman named Medea. Jenny is not his girlfriend, just a co-worker, and one of a number of apparently familiar faces. Ian meets a strange old man who tells him he is in danger. The old man tells him that he is being hunted by the Harvesters, a group of mind-controlling characters who cannot be killed and feed off human fear. He explains that every day, at different times and different places, the clocks stop and they come after him to kill him. The only problem is that Ian won't stay dead. He wakes in a new life, a new place, only for the cycle to repeat itself. Suddenly one of the Harvesters attacks the old man and Ian runs. They chase Ian back to his apartment where Medea, who is clearly one of them, is waiting. Once again, Ian is killed. He wakes to find he is a junkie in a rundown apartment, with Jenny living a few doors down. He implores her to remember him, desperately reaching out and searching for someone to help him make sense of what's going on. When the Harvesters come again Jenny and Ian have no choice but to run. As they seek refuge on a subway train heading out of town, Jenny confesses to her memories of Ian's former lives. Later on, the old man meets Ian in the train again while Jenny sleeps. It is then that the old man reveals that he is one of the Harvesters, and hints at Ian's involvement with them. When they disembark they are again confronted by a group of Harvesters, each a mass of pulsating veins, pitch-black muscles and flesh. Some of the barely human faces are recognizable from Ian's previous lives, including Medea who reveals a shocking truth: Ian was one of these monsters until he rebelled against the colony and managed to kill one other Harvester, and Medea used to be his \\"mate\\". Medea tries to force Ian to feed again and return to the \\"fold\\", but Ian resists. Medea and the Harvesters attack once more, and she explains that his rebellion came after his first encounter with Jenny. So moved was he by the girl that he wished to live a mortal life with her. Before Medea can harm Jenny, however, a final change comes over Ian with the help of Gray, the old Harvester who had helped him before. Apparently Ian found a sustenance that was far superior to fear or pain, and so did the old man: love. Making this connection to a human being changes the specific nature of a Harvester, which allowed the old man (and now Ian) to kill the members of their kind. Gray had urged Ian to protect Jenny out of experience; having lost his love to the Harvesters, he could only feed on fear again and he spent what remained of his life slowly starving himself and trying to find love again. Gray implores Ian to feed from him and tap into those emotions of affection and kinship; Gray dies while restoring Ian. Ian regains his true power: his Harvester-self is finally born out of his human flesh, uniquely exuding goodness rather than malevolence. He now has the capacity to turn the tables on these creatures and to feed on their fear and to give life. He then rescues Jenny, who is being stalked by the clan. Ian creates a new life for himself and Jenny, in which he is a successful professional hockey player with her at his side. Jenny has no recollection of their harrowing adventure; but Ian, having realized his abilities, will begin to take the fight to the Harvesters.

Although the construction of new canals is no longer common practice in England, new aqueducts such as this are sometimes built in relation to new roads or road widening schemes. Details The new aqueduct was built under the provisions of The Wiltshire County Council (Semington Aqueduct) Scheme 2000, later confirmed on 17 July 2002, as Statutory Instrument No. 1868. It was part of a road-building scheme to provide a bypass for the villages of Semington, to the west of the new structure, and Berryfield to the north of the canal, ending on the southern edge of Melksham. In order to provide the necessary headroom of , the road was built in a cutting at this point. The new structure is on the line of the original canal. In order to allow it to be built without closing the canal for the duration of the project, the canal was temporarily diverted to the south of its existing route, from the head of Semington Top Lock to a point to the east. Since the towpath is on the north bank of the canal at this point, temporary foot bridges were built over the canal, so that the towpath could follow the diversion, and avoid the work site. The road was planned as a dual carriageway, with the structure resting on piers at both ends protected by wing walls and a pier built on the central reservation protected by safety barriers, but only one carriageway was built and there is no central pier. The area where the second carriageway would have been is grassed.Google street view The aqueduct has two channels, separated by an central spine. Each of the channels is wide by deep, providing a navigable width of , since rubberised fenders are fitted to both sides to protect the concrete structure from abrasion by boats. There is another wall at the edge of the channel, and the towpath on the north side is separated from it by a environment corridor. A similar arrangement has been provided on the south side, for maintenance purposes. The concrete structure incorporates 529 tonnes of steel reinforcement, and the cost of the bypass scheme was ¬£12 million. The aqueduct was opened on 3 March 2004 by Fleur de Rh√©-Philipe, representing Wiltshire County Council. The structure was designed by Ove Arup and Partners, and built by the civil engineering contractor Alfred McAlpine.

Based on C.D. Payne's epistolary novel of the same name, the film stars Michael Cera and Portia Doubleday, with Justin Long, Ray Liotta, and Steve Buscemi in supporting roles. The film follows shy and lonely teenager Nick (Cera) desperate to lose his virginity. While on a trailer park holiday with his mother and her boyfriend, he meets an attractive girl (Doubleday) and is immediately smitten. When the two are separated Nick must learn how to rebel in order to be with the girl he loves. Plot Shy, socially inept teenager Nick Twisp lives with his mother, Estelle, and her boyfriend, Jerry, in Oakland, California. After selling a faulty car to a group of sailors, Jerry takes Estelle and Nick to a trailer park in Clearlake where Nick meets Sheeni Saunders, a bright young woman his age, with an interest in French culture and who shares Nick's musical taste. Despite Sheeni's boyfriend, Trent Preston, they become romantically involved. Nick purchases a dog for Sheeni named Albert (after Albert Camus), but the dog rips up the family's property and Sheeni's parents ban it from the house. Jerry needs to return to Oakland and takes Estelle and Nick with him. Sheeni promises to arrange a job in Ukiah for Nick's father, George, while Nick will get his mother to kick him out so he can return to Sheeni. Back at home, Nick creates an alter-ego named Fran√ßois Dillinger, a suave, rebellious troublemaker. Immediately after Nick makes the decision, Jerry dies of a heart attack. Under Fran√ßois' influence, Nick mouths off to his mom and her new boyfriend, police officer Lance Wescock. Nick takes Jerry's Lincoln, and crashes into a restaurant, which starts a fire. Lance agrees to lie and report the car stolen. In return, Nick must live with his father. In Ukiah, Nick phones Sheeni Weenie and tells her he had to blow up \\"half of Berkeley\\" to return. Sheeni's parents overhear this and ship her to a French boarding school in Santa Cruz, forbidding Nick ever to see her again. In his new high school, Nick befriends Vijay Joshi, and they take Vijay's grandmother's car to visit Sheeni. After sneaking into Sheeni's room, Nick goes to the restroom and meets Bernice Lynch, Sheeni's neighbor, and claims Trent said terrible things about her. Bernice brings the matron to Sheeni's room and the boys flee. On the way home, the car dies and Nick calls Mr. Ferguson, his father's idealist neighbor, to come pick them up; he tells Ferguson that Vijay is an illegal immigrant whom Nick is trying to \\"free from persecution\\". When he returns home, Nick meets Sheeni's older brother, Paul, who tells him that she will be returning home on Thanksgiving and invites him for dinner. Nick begins to send Bernice letters asking her to slip sedatives into Sheeni's drinks to make her fall asleep in class, thereby getting Sheeni expelled. Nick finds Lacey, George's 25-year-old girlfriend, Paul, and Ferguson, lounging in his living room, high on mushrooms, which Nick also ingests. George finds them and punches Ferguson, which results in Paul punching George. Lacey leaves the house to live with Paul. On Thanksgiving Day, Nick receives a call from his mother explaining Lance left and will not cover for Nick anymore. Nick goes to Thanksgiving at Sheeni's. Trent unexpectedly arrives and explains Nick's letters to Bernice; Sheeni is horrified and Nick leaves. Nick steals his father's car to escape the police. He then removes his clothes and drives the car into a shallow lake in front of the police station. He buys a wig and a dress and impersonates one of Sheeni's \\"friends\\". He fools Mr. and Mrs. Saunders and goes up to Sheeni's room. Upstairs, Nick tells Sheeni that he understands what loneliness is like, and that everything he has done, including burning down Berkeley, destroying his parents' cars and having her sedated were all so that they wouldn't have to be alone anymore. Sheeni forgives Nick, and the two have sex, finally achieving Nick's dream of losing his virginity. Trent barges in, telling Nick he's brought the police with him. Nick beats up Trent and asks Sheeni to wait for him; Sheeni reassures him that he will only be in juvenile detention for three months. The animated closing credits show Nick in jail with Fran√ßois helping him. When Nick is released, Sheeni shows up in a car and they drive away into the sky towards the Paris skyline, as various characters appear to make amends with the two and give them their blessing.

He was well trusted by Emperor Gaozong and Empress Wu late in Emperor Gaozong's reign, but drew Empress Wu's ire after he advised her, then empress dowager, to end her regency and return power to Emperor Ruizong. In 684, she accused him of treason and executed him.  Background  Pei Yan was from Jiang Prefecture (Áµ≥Â∑û, part of modern Yuncheng, Shanxi), and it is not known when he was born. When he was young, he became a student at the imperial university, and it was said that during vacations, the other students would often go out to travel, but Pei kept studying. After he studied at the university for more than a year, he was due to be recommended for an official post, but he declined the recommendation on the basis that he felt that his studies were not done, and he ended up studying for more than 10 years at the university, particularly gaining expertise in the Zuo Zhuan and the Book of Han.  During Emperor Gaozong's reign  At some point, Pei Yan passed the imperial examination, and he was made the food storage officer at Pu Prefecture (ÊøÆÂ∑û, roughly modern Heze, Shandong). He eventually served successively as assistant imperial censor, imperial archivist, deputy minister of defense, and eventually Huangmen Shilang (ÈªÉÈñÄ‰æçÈÉé): deputy head of the examination bureau of government (ÈñÄ‰∏ãÁúÅ, Menxia Sheng). In 680, he was given the designation of Tong Zhongshu Menxia Sanpin (Âêå‰∏≠Êõ∏ÈñÄ‰∏ã‰∏âÂìÅ), making him a chancellor de facto. Later that year, when Emperor Gaozong's crown prince Li Xian was accused of treason, Emperor Gaozong had him, Xue Yuanchao, and Gao Zhizhou investigate. Eventually, Li Xi√°n was deposed and replaced by his brother Li Zhe. In 681, Pei Yan became Shizhong (‰æç‰∏≠), the head of the examination bureau and a post considered one for a chancellor. Later that year, he was involved in a dispute with the general Pei Xingjian (Ë£¥Ë°åÂÑâ), as Pei Xingjian had earlier that year defeated the Tujue chief Ashina Fu'nian (ÈòøÂè≤ÈÇ£‰ºèÂøµ) and induced Ashina Fu'nian to first capture his confederate Ashide Wenbo (ÈòøÂè≤Âæ∑Ê∫´Âçö) and then surrender, promising Ashina Fu'nian that he would be spared if he did so. However, Pei Yan was said to be jealous of Pei Xingjian, and he reported that Ashina Fu'nian was only forced to surrender due to military pressure by Pei Xingjian's deputies Zhang Qianxu (ÂºµËôîÂãó) and Cheng Wuting (Á®ãÂãôÊå∫), advocating that Ashina Fu'nian should be put to death. Emperor Gaozong agreed and executed Ashina Fu'nian, causing Pei Xingjian to be distressed, and Pei Xingjian retired, claiming illness. In 682, due to a famine in the Guanzhong region (i.e., the region around the capital Chang'an), Emperor Gaozong left Chang'an and took up residence at the eastern capital Luoyang, leaving Li Zhe in charge at Chang'an, assisted by Pei Yan and his fellow chancellors Liu Rengui and Xue Yuanchao. In 683, when Emperor Gaozong became ill, he summoned Li Zhe to Luoyang, accompanied by Pei, and when Emperor Gaozong's illness became even more serious, he formally put Li Zhe in charge of important state matters, assisted by Pei, Liu Jingxian, and Guo Zhengyi. Around the new year 684, Emperor Gaozong died, and formally on Pei's suggestion, Emperor Gaozong's powerful wife Empress Wu (later known as Wu Zetian), At that time For almost two decades, before the emperor's death, she was actively involved in running the government, now empress dowager, took regent powers until a formal enthronement of Li Zhe (as Emperor Zhongzong). She made Pei Zhongshu Ling (‰∏≠Êõ∏‰ª§), the head of the legislative bureau of government (‰∏≠Êõ∏ÁúÅ, Zhongshu Sheng). (The office of the chancellors, Zhengshi Tang (Êîø‰∫ãÂ†Ç), was prior to this event located in the examination bureau. When Pei became Zhongshu Ling, he moved it to the legislative bureau, where it would remain from that point on.)  During Empress Dowager Wu's regency  In spring 684, Emperor Zhongzong, despite Empress Dowager Wu's regency, attempted to assert some key personnel decisions of his own‚Äîtrying to make his father- in-law Wei Xuanzhen (ÈüãÁéÑË≤û, the father of his wife Empress Wei) Shizhong, and also trying to give an office of the fifth rank (within the nine-rank Tang governmental structure) to his wet nurse's son. Pei opposed both commissions, and Emperor Zhongzong, in frustration, stated, \\"What would be wrong even if I give the empire to Wei Xuanzhen? Why do you care that he is made Shizhong?\\" Concerned, Pei reported this to Empress Dowager Wu. She, in response, ordered Pei and fellow chancellor Liu Yizhi, as well as the generals Cheng Wuting and Zhang Qianxu, lead troops into the palace, and then issued an edict deposing Emperor Zhongzong and demoting him to the title of Prince of Luling, replacing him with his younger brother Li Dan the Prince of Yu (as Emperor Ruizong). She, however, held onto all imperial power as regent, and Emperor Ruizong had no real power. For his contributions in this matter, Pei was given a noble title.The Old Book of Tang gave his title as Marquess of Hedong, while the New Book of Tang gave his title as Baron of Yongqing. Compare Old Book of Tang, vol. 87 with New Book of Tang, vol. 117. However, Pei would soon begin to run afoul of Empress Dowager Wu. Later in 684, pursuant to suggestions by her nephew Wu Chengsi, Empress Dowager Wu planned to posthumously honor her ancestors princes, and also build seven ancestral temples for them‚Äîa highly sensitive move, in that regulations allowed only the emperor to build seven ancestral temples, while any noble family, no matter how honored, was restricted to no more than five temples. Pei argued against the move, specifically comparing Empress Dowager Wu's actions to those of Emperor Gao of Han's wife Empress L√º Zhi (whose clan was powerful in her lifetime as empress dowager but was slaughtered after her death), to no avail, and she began to view him negatively from that point on. Their conflict became worsened later that year, as Empress Dowager Wu, listening to Wu Chengsi's advice, began considering seizing the throne herself with the title of \\"emperor.\\" She, Wu Chengsi, and another powerful nephew Wu Sansi were all concerned about the high esteem the people held for Emperor Ruizong's granduncles Li Yuanjia (ÊùéÂÖÉÂòâ) the Prince of Han and Li Lingkui (ÊùéÈùàÂ§î) the Prince of Lu, and Wu Chengsi suggested that she find excuses to have them executed. When Empress Dowager Wu consulted the chancellors, both Liu Yizhi and Wei Siqian were fearful and therefore did not dare to speak, but Pei strenuously objected, making her even more angry at him. Also late in 684, Li Jingye the Duke of Ying (the grandson of the great general Li Shiji) rebelled, citing as his agenda his desire to restore power to Emperor Ruizong. One of Li Jingye's key coconspirators was Pei's nephew Xue Zhongzhang (Ëñõ‰ª≤Áíã), which drew Empress Dowager Wu's suspicion. Meanwhile, Pei, in order to try to show that the rebellion was nothing to worry about, was intentionally slow in dispatching troops to suppress the rebellion. He further told Empress Dowager Wu that if she returned authorities to Emperor Ruizong, the rebellion would, for the lack of a good point of propaganda, collapse on its own. Empress Dowager Wu became more suspicious, and when the official Cui Cha (Â¥îË©ß) heard this, he submitted a petition accusing Pei of treason. Empress Dowager Wu had Pei arrested and had him interrogated by the imperial censors Qian Weidao (È®´Âë≥ÈÅì) and Yu Chengye (È≠öÊâøÊõÑ). Pei, even while under interrogation, did not humble himself before his interrogators, and when someone encouraged him to be humbler, he responded, \\"Once a chancellor is arrested, how can he still survive?\\" Meanwhile, a number of Pei's colleagues were trying to save him. In particular, Liu Jingxian and another high-level official, Hu Yuanfan (ËÉ°ÂÖÉÁØÑ) particularly tried to guarantee that Pei was not treasonous. She did not listen, and Pei was executed later that year. (As a result, for their attempts to save Pei, Hu was exiled and died at his place of exile; Liu Jingxian was also exiled and eventually executed; Cheng Wuting was also executed; and Guo Daiju was demoted.) It was said that when Pei was due to be executed, he looked at his brothers, who were due to be exiled themselves, and sighed, \\"My brothers, you all became officials out of your own merit, not because I helped you. Alas, now on my account you are being exiled to the boundaries of the empire.\\" When Pei's assets were due to be seized, it was discovered that he had no savings at all. Eventually, only after Empress Dowager Wu's death in 705 (after she had, indeed, taking \\"emperor\\" title in 690) and after Emperor Ruizong again became emperor in 710 was Pei posthumously honored and given the posthumous name of Zhong (Âø†, \\"faithful\\").

Jairus (, Iaeiros, from the Hebrew name Yair), a patron or ruler of a Galilee synagogue, had asked Jesus to heal his 12-year-old daughter. As they were traveling to Jairus' house, a sick woman in the crowd touched Jesus' cloak and was healed of her sickness. Jesus turned round to the woman and said \\"Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace.\\" (see ) (Christ healing the bleeding woman). In Mark's and Luke's version, a messenger arrived with the news that Jairus' daughter had died, and he was advised not to trouble Jesus any further. However, Jesus responded: Event Jesus continued to the house, where Jesus \\"saw a commotion, people weeping and wailing loudly\\" (). He informed all those present that the girl was not dead but asleep. He then went upstairs and restored the girl to life. In Mark's account, the Aramaic phrase \\"Talitha kum\\" (transliterated into Greek as œÑŒ±ŒªŒπŒ∏Œ± Œ∫ŒøœÖŒº and meaning, \\"Little girl, I say to you, get up!\\") is attributed to Jesus. The combined stories have been used as an example of intercalation, where one incident is inserted within another, linked in this case by the connection between the 12-year ailment and the 12-year-old girl.James R. Edwards, ‚ÄúMarkan Sandwiches: The Significance of Interpolations in Markan Narratives,‚Äù Novum Testamentum 31 no. 3 (1989): 193-216; Tom Shepherd, ‚ÄúThe Narrative Function of Markan Intercalation,‚Äù New Testament Studies 41 (1995): 522-40; James L.

Interpretations  John Donahue and Daniel Harrington state that this episode shows that \\"faith, especially as embodied by the bleeding woman, can exist in seemingly hopeless situations\\". Michael Keene states that there is a link between Jairus and the woman: \\"The link between them is faith since both Jairus and the bleeding woman showed great faith in Jesus\\". John Walvoord and Roy Zuck state that: \\"What appeared to be a disastrous delay in the healing of the woman actually assured the restoration of Jairus' daughter. It was providentially ordered to test and strengthen Jairus' faith.\\" Johann Lange also states that: \\"This delay would serve both to try and to strengthen the faith of Jairus.\\" See also * Life of Jesus in the New Testament * Ministry of Jesus * Miracles of Jesus * Parables of Jesus * Luke 8 References=CitationsSources  * Category:Miracles of Jesus Category:Resurrection ","title":"Raising of Jairus' daughter"},{"id":"13408979","text":"The Qu√©b√©cois nation motion was a parliamentary motion tabled by Prime Minister of Canada Stephen Harper on Wednesday, November 22, 2006 and approved by the House of Commons of Canada on Monday, November 27, 2006. The English motion read: :\\"That this House recognize that the Qu√©b√©cois form a nation within a united Canada.\\"Hansard; 39th Parliament, 1st Session; No. 087; November 27, 2006 and, in French, read: :\\"\\"Hansard; 39th Parliament, 1st Session; No. 087; November 27, 2006 (French)  Historical background  The debate about Qu√©b√©cois nationhood centres on the question of the status of the province of Quebec and its primarily French-speaking population. During the Quiet Revolution of the 1960s, the term Qu√©b√©cois largely replaced French Canadian as an expression of cultural and nationalist identity as French Canadians asserted themselves culturally. The modern Qu√©b√©cois identity is secular and based on a social democratic ideal of the Quebec State promoting Quebec French culture and language in the arts, education, and business within the province. Politically, this resulted in a movement towards more provincial autonomy. Quebec federalists in the Liberal Party of Quebec argued for more autonomy within Canada, while Quebec sovereigntists, mostly within the Parti Qu√©b√©cois, argued for outright independence from Canada. Quebec nationalists increasingly referred to provincial institutions as being \\"national\\", unofficially changing the name of the provincial \\"Legislative Assembly\\" to the \\"National Assembly of Quebec\\" in 1968, for example. In response, the Liberal Party of Canada under Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau advocated an increased role for French-speaking Canadians in the federal government through a policy of Official Bilingualism, a federal presence in social programs that sought to create a unified Canadian identity that resisted demands for more provincial autonomy, and a new constitution based on individual rights that would sever the remaining colonial ties to Britain. This alienated many Quebec nationalists who demanded legal, constitutional recognition of the collective cultural identity in Quebec. The conflict culminated in the Parti Qu√©b√©cois government of Ren√© L√©vesque holding a province-wide referendum on Sovereignty- Association in 1980 that proposed that Quebec would assume all federal powers while maintaining economic links to Canada; it was rejected by 60% of Quebecers. Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau subsequently pushed through the amendment of the constitution with the Canada Act 1982. This was done with the approval of the other provincial governments, but not the government of Quebec. In 1987, the Progressive Conservative government of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney negotiated the Meech Lake Accord with the federalist government of Robert Bourassa. It recognized Quebec as a \\"distinct society\\" within Canada. All provinces originally agreed, but Manitoba and Newfoundland failed to ratify the accord, amid vocal criticism of the accord from Pierre Trudeau. In April 1988, Manitoba voters elected a Conservative minority government, but the leader holding the 'balance of power' in the minority government, Liberal leader Sharon Carstairs, stood opposed to the Accord. In April 1989, Newfoundland voters elected a Liberal majority government, led by Premier Clyde Wells, who held a second vote in the legislature that rescinded Newfoundland's support for the agreement in April 1990. In June 1990, the Manitoba government was unable to even vote on the accord, due to a procedural vote (requiring unanimity) that was brought down by one Aboriginal New Democratic Party MLA, Elijah Harper. First Nation groups and the populist Reform Party in Western Canada also opposed the accord, arguing that their cultural and regional grievances were being ignored. The failure of the Meech Lake Accord generated a backlash in Quebec. Support for sovereignty soared to above 60%, and the sovereigntist Bloc Qu√©b√©cois formed under disaffected Progressive Conservative Cabinet Minister Lucien Bouchard. The Bloc represented the majority of Quebec in the federal Parliament between the 1993 federal election and the Canadian federal election of 2011. However, the federal Liberal Party of Jean Chr√©tien won power in 1993 by sweeping Ontario and picking up votes in all provinces. They advocated the status-quo on constitutional issues. The conservative Reform Party under Preston Manning displaced the Progressive Conservatives in the Western provinces, and advocated a constitutional reform that would recognize all provinces as equal, opposing special legal status for Quebec. The Progressive Conservative were reduced to two seats. A Parti Qu√©b√©cois government held another referendum on sovereignty and a \\"partnership\\" with Canada in 1995 and lost by only a few thousand votes. A major theme of popular sovereigntist leader Lucien Bouchard the referendum was that English Canada did not recognize the Quebec people in the constitution, depicting it as an English Canadian humiliation of French Quebec. Following the referendum, support for Quebec sovereignty decreased. The Parti Qu√©b√©cois government renewed the push for recognition as a nation through symbolic motions that gained the support of all parties in the National Assembly. They affirmed the right to determine the independent status of Quebec. They also renamed the area around Quebec City the Capitale nationale (national capital) region and renamed provincial parks Parcs nationaux (national parks). In opposition in October 2003, a Parti Qu√©b√©cois motion was unanimously adopted in the National Assembly of Quebec in 2003 that recognized the Quebec people as \\"forming a nation\\".  Evolution of motion  Debate over federal government recognition of a Quebec nation was triggered during the leadership race for the Liberal Party of Canada during a September 10, 2006 leadership debate in Quebec City. Leading candidate and political scientist Michael Ignatieff mused that Quebec should be recognized as a nation in the Canadian constitution. When the Quebec wing of the federal Liberals adopted a similar resolution on October 21, 2006, many Liberals began questioning Ignatieff's judgement. In his 1992 book Blood and Belonging, Ignatieff had championed the cause of civic nationalism based on \\"a community of equal, rights-bearing citizens, united in patriotic attachment to a shared set of political practices and values.\\" Now he was endorsing \\"a nation, with a language, history, culture and territory that marks them out as a separate people\\", which sounded to many like ethnic nationalism. Justin Trudeau, son of former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, criticized Ignatieff for lacking political judgement. Sensing political division in his political opposition, Bloc Qu√©b√©cois leader Gilles Duceppe scheduled a motion in the House of Commons for November 23, 2006‚Äîsimilar to the 2003 Parti Qu√©b√©cois resolution passed unanimously by the National Assembly in Quebec‚Äîthat it also recognize \\"Quebeckers as a nation\\". He knew that the motion would probably be rejected, but argued he could use this to show that Canadians once again did not recognize the identity of Quebecers. If the motion did pass, he could use it to make claims on Quebec sovereignty. Liberal leadership candidate (and eventual winner) St√©phane Dion moved to reconcile positions within the Liberal party, circulating a draft of a resolution that would change the wording of the resolution. On November 22, 2006, the Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper tabled the Qu√©b√©cois nation motion the day before the Bloc Qu√©b√©cois resolution came to a vote. The English version changed the word Quebecer to Qu√©b√©cois and added \\"within a united Canada\\" at the end of the Bloc motion. Harper further elaborated, stating that the motion's definition of Qu√©b√©cois relies on personal decisions to self-identify as Qu√©b√©cois, and therefore is a personal choice. Dion said that this resolution was similar to the one he had circulated several days earlier. The Bloc Qu√©b√©cois members originally rejected this motion as overly partisan and federalist, but supported the motion the following day.  Vote in the House of Commons  The House of Commons voted overwhelmingly to pass the motion. The motion passed by a margin of 265 (yeas) to 16 (nays).Hansard, Journals, No. 87; November 27, 2006. Retrieved 13 Feb 2011. At that time, there were 308 seats in the House of Commons, but two were not filled. Of the rest, 283 MPs voted on the motion, 20 were absent for various reasons, three chose to abstain and two had pre- arranged to be paired with absent voters (not counting their votes). MPs then voted down the Bloc Qu√©b√©cois motion.Hansard; 39th Parliament, 1st Session; No. 087; November 27, 2006 Conservative members were ordered by the Prime Minister not to oppose the motion or be expelled from the caucus. Many of his MPs had deep reservations about the motion, but only six members of his caucus were absent, all from Western Canada. Harper's Intergovernmental Affairs minister Michael Chong resigned from his position and abstained from voting, arguing that this motion was too ambiguous and had the potential of recognizing ethnic nationalism in Canada. Members of the New Democratic Party and Bloc Qu√©b√©cois all voted for the motion. Liberals were the most divided on the issue and comprised 15 of the 16 votes against the motion. Liberal MP Ken Dryden summarized the view of many of these dissenters, maintaining that it was a game of semantics that cheapened issues of national identity.  Popular support  A survey of 1,500 Canadians by Leger Marketing for the Association of Canadian studies in November 2006 showed that Canadians were deeply divided on this issue, though polls used wording that did not directly reflect the motion. When asked if \\"Quebecers\\" are a nation, only 48 per cent of Canadians agreed, 47 per cent disagreed, with 33 per cent strongly disagreeing; 78 per cent of French-speaking Quebecers agreed that \\"Quebecers\\" are a nation, next to 38 per cent of English-speakers. As well, 78 per cent of 1,000 Quebecers polled thought that \\"Quebecers\\" should be recognized as a nation.

J. Adams, also known as Bob Shannon (September 20, 1942 - January 26, 2015), was a Canadian-American film and television actor, acting coach, screen writer, film producer, documentary producer and radio personality. Beginnings Adams was born in St. Catharines, Ontario, where he spent his early childhood, until his family headed across the border to Niagara Falls, New York. Known to his friends as Bob Adams, the aspiring actor/radio DJ spent just a couple of years attending Bishop Duffy High School before dropping out and moving to New York City at the age of 17 to study acting. Upon his arrival on the west coast, he landed a job as a page at NBC Burbank which led to a radio job in Phoenix and ultimately a twenty-five-year career in broadcasting as Bob Shannon. His on-air career included radio stations in markets such as Buffalo, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, St. Louis, Seattle, Minneapolis/St. Paul, San Diego and Los Angeles. It was while working at KFI (AM) in the mid-1970s that Adams turned his attention back to film acting. Radio career Adams began his 30-year radio career as Bob Shannon at KXIV Phoenix, Arizona until going full-time, thanks to the efforts of play-by-play announcer Al McCoy, who got him his first full-time on-air job at KBLU Yuma, Arizona. From there it was on to KUTY Palmdale, California before making the leap to KDWB St. Paul, Minnesota by the end of the year. It wasn't until Shannon arrived in Phoenix that he garnered his first major success at KRUX by rapidly climbing to number one in the market by beating all competitors by twenty plus points, utilizing a variety of crazy characters and outlandish antics such as the invasion of his show by the television rock group, The Monkees. The episode aired as the finale of the group's first season. Following his departure from Phoenix, Shannon held air shifts at WKBW Buffalo, New York and WKYC Cleveland, Ohio until landing the coveted early evening slot at KXOK St. Louis, Missouri where he again rose to the number one show in the market, beating his nearest rival by over twenty ratings points. BS in the morning Following St. Louis, Shannon joined a couple of famous stations, including KJR Seattle, Washington, WIXY Cleveland, Ohio and KDKA, before returning to KDWB Mpls/St.Paul as \\"BS\\" in the morning. It was here that he gained instant popularity by a myriad of stunts such as broadcasting live from the streets of the Twin Cities while distributing cans of beans during the gas shortage of the mid-1970s which he promoted as a \\"natural gas substitute\\". His name recognition eventually brought him to the attention of KFI Los Angeles in 1975, where he enjoyed several successful years doing afternoons as \\"BS in Drive\\". In 1976 Shannon with the help of his vast audience, as well as the national media, succeeded in persuading NOA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to adopt male hurricane names in an effort to bring equal hurricane rights to men. Up until that time hurricanes had only been named for women. His successful campaign brought about the naming of Hurricane David,http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/general/lib/lib1/nhclib/reviews/1979.pdf 1979 Monthly Weather Review the name of Shannon's son. From KFI, he went on to KHJ (AM) and KLAC, Los Angeles before retiring from radio in the mid-1980s to devote his attention to film acting. In 2000 Adams returned to the airwaves once again as Bob Shannon, this time joining the air staff of KRTH 101 in Los Angeles. He is not to be confused with a radio personality of the same name who is midday host on New York City's most popular radio station, classic-hits WCBS-FM. In 2003 he ventured into talk radio as host of Back Stage Live, a film and television call-in program specifically geared toward aspiring and professional actors on \\"Smart Talk\\" KRLA. In 2011, Adams played a serial- killing priest in a dark suspense thriller. Film and television acting From 1975 to 1978, Adams studied under acting coach Charles E. Conrad. He was cast in a variety of shows, including Hotel, The Practice, Archie Bunker's Place, General Hospital, Kojak and Hill Street Blues. From the 1980s to the 2000s, Adams appeared in dozens of film and television projects including Rocky IV, The Execution, Falling Through, and Murder, She Wrote, and was a series regular on Riptide. He starred in four feature films for which he wrote the screenplay: Abeo Pharisee, The Studio Club, Chasing Jose, and The Christmas Quilt.https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0011276/ Film and television acting coach Shortly after leaving the Charles E. Conrad Studio in 1978, Adams began teaching a handful of actors from the local community college. That led to a 35-year coaching career at The Actors Workshop. His former students include Kristy Swanson, Brian Krause, Sarah Lancaster. Vicellous Reon Shannon, Schae Harrison, Garro Ellis, and Annet Mahendru. Adams appeared as a panelist for the Screen Actors Guild Foundation and conducted SAG-AFTRA acting workshops in Los Angeles and San Diego. Documentary producer In 1976, Adams founded Shannon & Company, which served Orange County and Los Angeles as a full service advertising agency until the company converted to a broadcast and film production company in the 1980s, focusing primarily on historical documentary projects and docudramas. The company rolled out a number of films, including Ruins of the Reich, The Missions of California, Order Castles of the Third Reich and The Final Journey. Ownership of Shannon & Company changed when R.J. Adams' son, Rob Adams, took control of the company in the spring of 2000 and steered the company toward the production of feature films and episodic television. Personal life Adams and his wife, Diane, were married for 47 years. His son, actor Rob Adams, is an acting coach at The Actors Workshop.

Ramamurti (20 September 1908 ‚Äì 15 December 1987) was an Indian politician and a politburo member of the Communist Party of India (Marxist). Ramamurti was born in Chennai to Panchapakesan, a Sanskrit scholar. He obtained his education from Hindu High School, Presidency College, Madras and the Banaras Hindu University. He joined the Congress Socialist Party (CSP) during the Indian independence movement. In 1927, he was involved in the protests against the Simon Commission. Like many other members of the CSP in South India he then joined the Communist Party of India, and was one of the founding members of the party in Tamil Nadu. He became the Secretary of CSP in Tamil Nadu and was a member of the All India Congress Committee.Sud, S. P. Singh, and Ajit Singh Sud. Indian Elections and Legislators. Ludhiana: All India Publications, 1953. p. 215 In 1936 he began organising trade unions. Ramamurti was elected to the Madras Legislative Assembly in 1952 from the Madurai North Constituency. At the time he was in jail. In total P. Ramamurti spent eight years in jail and five years underground. Ramamurti was affectionately referred to as PR within the party and the larger Indian Left. He was the first Leader of the Opposition of the Madras State in 1952 in a House of 375. This was before the First States Re-organisation in 1956, which led to the creation of Tamil Nadu and Kerala. This election returned a fractured mandate, without any party gaining a simple majority. The Communist-led coalition formed the largest block and staked claim to form the government. But C. Rajagopalachari, India's first Governor General after Independence who was also from Madras, came out of retirement and convinced the then Madras Governor Sri Prakasa to invite him to form a Congress government in the state. The decision was highly criticized and was viewed as the Indian National Congress' machinations to defeat a popular government led by Communists. Rajagopalachari was not an elected member of the assembly as he had not participated in the polls.[6][7][8][9] Rajagopalachari requested Prakasa to nominate him to the assembly thereby foregoing the usual process of election by the members of the assembly. Ramamurti opposed this by way of a petition in the Madras High Court seeking to annul Rajagoplachari's nomination. Ramamurti's daughter R. Vaigai writes about this during the end of a year-long celebration of his birth centenary in 2008 in The Hindu. In 1953, at the 3rd CPI party congress, he was elected to the Central Committee and the politburo of the party. In 1964 he was part of the faction in the party leadership that formed the CPI(M).

It is located at 124 Abercorn Street, on the northeast corner of Oglethorpe Square. The Owens‚ÄìThomas House was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1976, as one of the nation's finest examples of English Regency architecture. and Renovations in the 1990s uncovered and restored one of the oldest and best preserved urban slave quarters in the American South. Architectural style and house history The side veranda featuring acanthus scroll supports. General Lafayette addressed the citizens of Savannah on his visit in 1825 from this veranda. This most important and architecturally significant house was begun in 1816 and completed in 1819. Designed by the English architect William Jay of Bath, the house plans were drawn while Jay was still in England. He sent architectural elevations to local workers before his arrival in Savannah sometime after foundations were laid. According to Jay's letters, the house was to be aesthetically compatible to Bath, England. This is evident in the Bath stone of the house's construction as well as its sophisticated architectural detail. It was a gentrifying physical ornament to the newly successful Southern port. The Richardson House, as it was originally known after its first owner and builder, is North America's preeminent example of period English Regency architecture. The mansion was purchased in 1830 by local attorney and politician George Welshman Owens for $10,000. The family maintained it for several decades until Owens' granddaughter, Margaret Thomas, bequeathed the house to the Telfair Academy of Arts and Sciences (established in 1885) as the South's oldest art museum, in 1951. The house is notable for its early cast iron side veranda with elaborate acanthus scroll supports on which the Marquis de Lafayette addressed the citizens of Savannah on his visit in 1825. William Jay was architect to other Savannah landmarks such as the Scarborough house, the Telfair House as mentioned above, and an attribution to the Gordon-Low House.  Slave quarters  Slave quarters A focus of tours of the site is the carriage house and the history of the enslaved workers who lived there, including the nanny, cook and butler. During a renovation of the carriage house in the 1990s, the owners of the site discovered one of the oldest and best preserved urban slave quarters in the American South. The history has been uncovered via their Slavery and Freedom Project, and via symposiums in 2008 and 2020 (planned). The ceiling of the slave quarters is painted haint blue, which was customarily used in Gullah culture to deter ghosts or other malevolent spirits. It is notable as the largest swath of haint blue paint in North America. The restoration includes the pantry and other elements of the Gullah cooking, and the cellar where meals and laundry were prepared. Museum The Owens‚ÄìThomas House collection contains furnishings and decorative arts from the English Regency period; containing effects of the Owens family, most pieces dating from the years 1790 to 1840.http://www.telfair.org/buildings/ot_house_collec.asp Collection Collections include English Georgian and American Federal period furniture, early Savannah textiles, silver, Chinese Export porcelain, and 18th- and 19th- century art. The slave quarters feature slave artifacts of the period. The courtyard features a small parterre garden that was redesigned in 1954 by Savannah landscape architect Clermont Huger Lee. Lee designed the formal garden in 1820 English-American style and supervised maintenance of garden for fourteen years.

It is assigned to the 476th Fighter Group and stationed at Moody Air Force Base, Georgia. The squadron is equipped with the Fairchild Republic A-10C Thunderbolt II attack fighter. During World War II, the 76th Fighter Squadron was one of the three original squadrons (74th, 75th, 76th) of the 23d Fighter Group. History=World War II The history of the 76th dates to the earliest days of World War II. During the summer of 1941, Claire Lee Chennault formed a small group of American pilots into three fighter squadrons, the American Volunteer Group, of the Chinese Air Force. The unit immediately garnered international attention for their combat successes while defending China and Burma, and they became known as the \\"Flying Tigers.\\" Some members of the AVG joined or rejoined the United States Air Force after the AVG was disbanded. The 76th squadron remained in combat in the China-Burma-India (CBI) Theater from 18 July 1942 to 11 August 1945, earning a Distinguished Unit Citation for missions in China in June 1944. Cold War 76th Fighter- Interceptor Squadron Convair F-102A 56-1345 at Westover AFB in October 1962 After World War II, the squadron performed air defense intercept operations in Guam, 1946‚Äì1949, in Panama, 1949, and at various bases in the eastern United States, 1955-1963. By 1960 the squadron was stationed at McCoy Air Force Base, Florida. In 1960, \\"in order to position its diminishing interceptor force as nearly astride enemy approaches as possible\\", Air Defense Command received approval to move the squadron from McCoy to Westover Air Force Base in Massachusetts. It disposed of its Northrop F-89 Scorpions by the end of 1960. Between February and April 1961, the squadron had re-equipped with Convair F-102 Delta Daggers.McMullen, pp. 2-3 Following the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Air Force decided to station a full squadron of interceptors at Homestead Air Force Base, Florida. This squadron was to be equipped with F-104A Starfighters, but the Air Force had transferred all its F-104 interceptors to the Air National Guard. F-104s were withdrawn from the 159th Fighter- Interceptor Squadron of the South Carolina Air National Guard and sent to Homestead. In turn, the F-102s at Westover were used to re-equip the 159th and the 76th was inactivated.McMullen, pp. 17, 42 76th Tac Fighter Squadron A-7 Corsair II dropping Mark 82 bombs The squadron trained in and conducted close air support operations, 1972-1992. A portion of the squadron deployed to Saudi Arabia in 1990 and took part in operations against Iraq in early 1991. Space Operations era Lessons from Desert Storm on space power convinced Air Force leaders to reactivate the squadron as the 76th Space Operations Squadron in December 1995. The squadron was activated at the National Test Facility at Falcon Air Force Base, Colorado as a component of the 14th Air Force on 1 December 1995.Space Tactics Bulletin, Vol 3, Issue 1, Winter 1995 The mission of the 76th SOPS was to assist air component commanders in understanding and applying space systems in support of air operations. The unit's aim was to ensure that command and control, communications, weather, navigation, and other space assets were used to most effectively multiply US and allied combat forces capabilities against an adversary. The 76th deployed Air Force Space Support Teams to bring \\"space expertise\\" to expeditionary air forces and air operations centers around the world. Over their tenure, the 76th Space Operations Squadron deployed to make significant contributions during Operation Joint Endeavor, Operation Deny Flight, Operation Desert Fox, Operation Desert Thunder, and Operation Allied Force.

She graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in liberal arts in May 1910, with concentrations in Latin, English, French, German, political science, pedagogy, history, and chemistry. Career and civic life After graduation, Terry became chairman of English and History at Gloucester High School in Capahosie, Virginia. During World War I, she returned to Washington to work at the Bureau of Engraving and Printing.McNealey 2006, op. cit., p. 57. After the war, Terry started teaching English at Alabama Agricultural & Mechanical College, devoted to creating new educators. (It is now Alabama A&M; University). She stayed with the university for more than 35 years, inspiring generations. In addition to teaching at the main campus, Terry trained public school teachers through Alabama A&M; extension courses in Athens, Alabama and Limestone, Alabama. Creating new teachers was critical. A study in 1900 noted that twice as many African-American teachers were needed to reach prospective students and achieve parity with white teachers.James D. Anderson, Black Education in the South, 1860-1935. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1988, pp.244-245 Terry became a member of the National Women's Clubs, and also served with professional groups. She was a charter member of Chapel of the Holy Cross Episcopal Church in Normal, Alabama. During these years, Terry continued to be involved with Alpha Kappa Alpha. In 1949, she established the Epsilon Gamma Omega alumnae chapter in Normal, Alabama, and led it as president. In 1959, Terry retired from teaching after having worked at Alabama A&M; University for nearly 40 years. She returned to Washington, D.C., and joined the Xi Omega chapter of ŒëŒöŒë. Terry enjoyed discussions about literature, other good conversation, books, and movies with students and friends. She died on August 15, 1967.

It consists of four blue and three white diagonal stripes; in the white stripes are a total of seven red pompebl√™den, leaves of the yellow water-lily, that may remind one of hearts, but according to the official instructions \\"should not be heart-shaped\\". The jerseys of the football club SC Heerenveen and the are modeled after this flag.  Symbolism  The seven red seeblatts (or pompebl√™den, as they are called in West Frisian) are a reference to the Frisian \\"sea countries\\" in the Middle Ages: independent regions along the coast from Alkmaar to the Weser who were allied against the Vikings. There were never precisely seven distinct regions, but the number seven probably has the connotation \\"many.\\" Some sources hold, however, that there have been seven Frisian lands: West Friesland, Westergoa, Eastergoa, Hunsingo, Fivelingo, Emsingo, and Jeverland. The pompebl√™den are used in other related flags such as the flag of the Ommelanden in neighbouring Groningen Province, a historically Frisian area, and for a proposed pan-Frisia flag put forth by the Groep fan Auwerk.  History  Flag of Friesland on a pole In the 13th century, a flag with pompebl√™dden is described in an epic poem. Evidence for this lies within verses of the Gudrunlied. Round 1200 Scandinavian coats of arms reveal many traces of water-lilies and hearts, found often in combination with images of lions. 15th century books on heraldry show that two armorial bearings were derived from the early ones: a coat of arms showing lions and seven pompebl√™dden (water lilies) transformed into billets, the other being the arms with the seven now known lilies on stripes.

The eldest son of John Ryan, a native of Kilconly, and Bridget Mullahy, of Seephin, in the parish of Kilcommon, County Mayo. There were eight children, with three of the four boys, (Michael & Paddy) including Mark becoming doctors. John Ryan had farms in three different parts of Kilconly, one which was held from a landlord known as \\"French of Tirowen,\\" which is near Gort. Mark was three or four, when the family were evicted, which took place during the famine years. This became one of his earliest memories, though he says he did not realise the full tragedy of this at the time.Ryan, pg. 7 The second farm was in Umane, land held by a landlord by the name of Dominick Jennings. The family lived here for five or six years, till the landlord died and they were again evicted. They were given shelter for a time from Mark's uncle, Michael Ryan at Bailenagittach. After some time John obtained another holding from Richard Jennings, brother of Dominick in Ironpool. The family lived here for only a few years, until they were \\"once more thrown on the roadside,\\" according to Ryan. After this, John Ryan took his family and emigrated to England. Education His early education was not very satisfactory. In Umane he attended school held in a barn by a teacher named Brannick. The teaching was very poor, spelling being the only subject. The instruction was given entirely in English, a strap being used to punish the boys every time Irish was spoken. The second school he attended was in Kilconly, and was held in the chapel, with the parish priests Father James Gibbons permission. The instruction here was much better and consisted of reading, writing and arithmetic, again entirely in English. The teacher was a one armed man named Mark Roche, who afterwards Ryan believed became a National School teacher.Ryan, M pg.8-9 Mark would go on to attend schools at Lisaleen, the teacher being a man named Courtney, and Tubberoe were the teacher was Harry Sweeney. As with the previous schools instruction was entirely in English, though according to Ryan every child in the parish knew Irish. The National School system at the time was strongly opposed by the Catholic Archbishop MacHale which he regarded as a proselytising agency. This view was given credence by a statement made by the first Commissioner appointed to serve on the National Board, the Protestant Archbishop of Dublin Dr. Whately who said \\"the education supplied by the National Board was gradually undermining the vast fabric of the Irish Roman Catholic Church.\\" Ryan was to comment that it was \\"National\\" only in name.Ryan, M pg.10 Irish Republican Brotherhood Ryan was recruited to the Irish Republican Brotherhood by Michael Davitt in 1865.Ryan, pg.13 He joined the Supreme Council of the IRB, was leader of the Irish National Alliance (1895) and was a founder-member of the Irish Literary Society.

History Early Nunamiut lived by hunting caribou instead of the marine mammals and fish hunted by coastal I√±upiat. After 1850 the interior became depopulated because of diseases, the decline of the caribou and the migration to the coast (including the Mackenzie Delta area in Canada, where they are called Uummarmiut) where whaling and fox trapping provided a temporarily promising alternative.Stephen Adolphe Wurm, Peter M√ºhlh√§usler, and Darrell T. Tyron (1996), Atlas of Languages of Intercultural Communication in the Pacific, Asia, and the Americas Historically, the Nunamiut hunted caribou. When caribou numbers dwindled in the 19th century, some Nunamiut migrated towards the Mackenzie River delta. Around 1910, with caribou continuing to be insufficient to sustain the native hunting, Nunatamiut migrated further into the Siglit area. They were spurred by increased demand for furs by the Hudson's Bay Company and the possibility of jobs within the whaling industry. The Inuvialuit of the Siglit area were unhappy with the arrival of the Nunatamiut, afraid that the Nunatamuit would deplete the Inuvialuit's Bluenose caribou herd. But the Nunatamiut, inland hunters of the I√±upiat region, were in high demand by the American whalers. Eventually, the Nunatamiut who settled in the Siglit area became known as the Uummarmiut (people of the green trees) and intermarried with the local Inuvialuit. In 1938, several Nunamiut families returned to the Brooks Range, around Chandler Lake and the Killik River. In 1949, the Chandler Lake Nunamiuts moved to Anaktuvuk Pass; later, the Killik River group moved there also. Anaktuvuk Pass is the only Nunamiut settlement. A federally-recognized Alaskan village is located Anaktuvuk‚Äîthe Village of Anaktuvuk Pass, the Naqsragmiut Tribal Council. Recording of culture and history The Nunamiut were visited after World War II by Norwegian explorer and author Helge Ingstad. He stayed for a period in the Brooks Range in northern Alaska among the Nunamiut, and afterwards wrote Nunamiut - blant Alaskas innlandseskimoer (translation: \\"Nunamiut - Inland Eskimos of Alaska\\"). During the last few years of his life, he worked on categorizing and annotating the large quantity of photos and audio recordings (141 songs) he had made while living with the Nunamiut in 1950. The effort resulted in a booklet, Songs of the Nunamiut, with an accompanying CD containing the audio material. This is an extremely valuable contribution to the preservation of the Nunamiut culture, because it turned out that much of what he had gathered in the mid-20th century was now lost locally and was only preserved in his recordings. Culture According to archaeologist Lewis Binford, the Nunamiut depend on meat more so than any other living hunter-gatherer group. The annual cycle of Nunamiut life revolves around the annual migrations of caribou. Spring: The main caribou migrations happen in March and April, when caribou move north through Anaktuvuk Pass to feed on the plains. Summer: The plains thaw and become a marshland swarming with blackflies and mosquitoes. Autumn: The caribou hunting cycle repeats in September and October when caribou retreat south again. Winter: There are about 72 days of total winter darkness starting around November 15. Language The native language of the Nunamiut is a dialect of I√±upiaq. In the late 1960s, the University of California, Berkeley sent undergraduate linguistics student (now Arctic explorer) Dennis Schmitt to the Nunamiut to study their dialect. There are few native speakers today. The Nunamiut speak English. Their culture is contrasted by strong collectivist and individualist tendencies, both of which are reflected in their \\"uncertainty language game\\". This involves one of five statements as part of a response: \\"I don't know\\", \\"maybe\\", \\"probably\\", \\"I guess\\", and \\"might be\\". Choosing the neutral \\"maybe\\" over \\"yes\\" or \\"no\\" reflects the cultural importance of a collectivist community. It also reflects behavior avoidance of an individual making a false statement. NotesFurther reading * Binford, Lewis Roberts. Nunamiut Ethnoarchaeology.

His father is former rider and current speedway promoter Len Silver.Oakes, P & Rising, P (1986). 1986 Speedway Yearbook. Andrew Silver took his first rides in 1983 at father Len's Rye House circuit, making rapid progress from reserve to heat leader in three years. When Len, decided to sell his interest in the Rockets, son Andrew was widely expected to make the move into top flight British League racing - so it was a shock when he moved across to the Arena Essex Hammers for a reported ¬£9,000. Andrew, the hottest property in British Speedway at this time, was an instant sensation during his two years with the club, setting numerous records wherever he rode. He was capped by England at senior level, qualified for successive British Finals and set numerous track records wherever he rode. He has a Hammers career average of 10.52. Silver also enjoyed considerable individual success during his tenure with the Hammers, winning the prestigious end-of-season National League Riders' Championship in 1987 at Coventry to add to the Grand Slam title he won earlier that year at Oxford. In 1988 Andrew moved into top flight racing, signing for British League Swindon. His career stuttered from this point on and - despite four seasons in Robins' colours - failed to live up to expectations. He moved to Eastbourne in 1992 - and was joined by his father in 1993 - before calling it a day at the start of the 1994 season. Despite reported attempts to lure him out of the saddle - Andrew caused a sensation by almost winning an individual meeting at Arena Essex during a one-off appearance in 1997 - Silver's leathers remained on the hook. He retired from speedway early to take up a post in his father's ski holiday company. After a long break from the sport, Silver made a successful comeback as a member of the 2009 Rye House Rockets team in the Premier League and scored a six-ride maximum for the Rockets in their victory over Stoke on 2 September 2009. At the end of the 2009 season, Silver retired once again.

History Leibler Yavneh College was founded in 1961 as Yavneh College, and began at 81 Balaclava Road, Caulfield North with 53 students ranging from Kindergarten to Year 1. It was established with the objective of attaining high standards in Jewish and General Studies. The College saw its first Year 6 graduates in 1974 and for the next 13 years operated solely as a primary school. In 1979 a secondary school was opened on a site in Mercer Road, , and six years later Leibler Yavneh College presented its first VCE graduates. The college has regularly achieved excellent VCE results that put it within the top 10 schools in Victoria. By 1989 the College expanded at such a rate that larger premises were required. This led to the acquisition of the present Slezak Campus in Elsternwick, which today accommodates more than 700 students from Prep to Year 12. The remaining junior and senior kindergarten students (totalling almost 100) are accommodated at the Abeles-Liberman Pre- school on Balaclava Road, Caulfield. From its beginning it was intended to be a Zionist school, with the establishment of The State of Israel central to its identity. In 2007 former principal Roy Steinman announced that the College will undergo a $10 million expansion at both the Early Learning Centre, as well as the main school. The project was due for completion by late 2009/early 2010. The expansions included a new auditorium, cafeteria and library. In mid-2010, the new section for the high school was opened. Curriculum The secondary school curriculum includes English, Halacha / Mishnah / Gemara, Hebrew, French, Mathematics, Health and Physical education, Dance, Science, History, Tanakh, IT/Multimedia and Robotics, and The Arts including Music, Artistic/Jewellery and Technology design, and Drama. Year 12 curriculum The College offers an extensive range of subjects available to all students participating in years 11 and 12. These include English, English Literature, Chemistry, Physics, Biology, Psychology, Further Mathematics, Maths Methods, Specialist Mathematics, Legal Studies, Accounting, Hebrew, History, Business Management, Drama, Music, Art, Health and Physical Education, Texts and Traditions, Visual Communication and Design, Multimedia, and Information Technology. Community service A core principle to Judaism is Torah, Avodah and Gemilut Hasadim. These principles are intertwined in the core beliefs of the college. Therefore, a compulsory extra curricular activity for students in Years 7‚Äì10 is the commitment to community service. All students are expected to give a minimum of 20 hours per year to a range of organisations or individuals. Some take part in cross-age tutoring (working with younger children to assist teachers in class), others are involved in fundraisers. Some visit the elderly on a regular basis while others help to form a minyan at one of the homes for the care of the elderly. The activities are varied and students have an opportunity to give their own time to causes that are linked to the Jewish community in Australia and Israel, as well as the broader Australian community. As the concept of giving becomes part of their lives most students continue their community service in Years 11 and 12 and beyond, on a voluntary basis. Victorian Certificate of Education (VCE) Yavneh has consistently performed well over the years, as with some other Jewish schools and has been ranked amongst the highest achieving Victorian schools. In 2007, thirty percent of the College's graduating students received ATAR scores of 95 or above. Past alumni Racheli Rosenblum (2000), Gali Kolt (2004) and Nadav Ellinson (2007), have each attained the highest ATAR of 99.95, placing in the top 32 students in the state. Leibler Yavneh College ranks highly amongst Victorian schools for VCE results. Recently ‚Äì in 2003 (1st), 2004 (3rd), 2007 (5th), 2008 (5th), 2010 (7th) and 2012 (10th) ‚Äì Yavneh placed within the top 10 schools in the state.

Hunt. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, she was designated for U.S. Navy use and assigned the name Comfort in June 1942. Comfort was renamed Tryon on 13 August 1942, acquired by the U.S. Navy on 29 September 1942, and commissioned on 30 September 1942, with Comdr. Alfred J. Byrholdt in command. World War II Tryon, an Evacuation Transport, got underway for San Diego on 9 October 1942 and departed from there on the 21st, bound for New Caledonia. On 7 November, she arrived at Noumea; joined the Service Squadron, South Pacific; and remained with that organization for the next 15 months, evacuating combat casualties from the Solomons to Suva, Noumea, Wellington, Auckland, and Brisbane. On her return trips to the forward areas, she carried priority cargo and troops for forces fighting the Japanese. Tryons first combat duty came in the Marianas during the summer of 1944. On 16 July, she joined Task Force 51 at Lunga Point and sortied for the invasion of Tinian. The hospital transport arrived off the beaches on the 24th, combat loaded with troops and equipment. After unloading, she embarked casualties for a week and then got underway for the Marshalls. The ship called at Eniwetok, New Caledonia, Espiritu Santo, and the Russell Islands before anchoring off Guadalcanal on 27 August 1944. Tryon embarked 1,323 Marines of the 1st Marine Division and sortied on 8 September 1944, with Transport Division 6 of Task Force 32, for the assault on the Palaus. She was off the beaches of Peleliu on the morning of the 15th and disembarked elements of the assault wave. Then, serving as a hospital evacuation ship, she embarked 812 combat casualties and, on the 20th, stood out for Manus. She disembarked the patients at Seeadler Harbor four days later and headed back to Peleliu the next morning. The ship remained off the beaches from 28 September to 4 October and then joined a convoy bound for the Solomons. USS Tryon (APH-1) at sea during World War II When Tryon arrived at Tulagi on 11 October, she was assigned to the 7th Fleet to participate in the Leyte campaign. She called at Hollandia and Humboldt Bay en route and reached Leyte on the 30th. The ship completed unloading the next day and began the return voyage to the South Pacific. The transport loaded troops and cargo at Langemak Bay from 13 through 27 December and headed for Manus on 28 December 1944. On 2 January 1945, Tryon stood out of Manus with Task Group 77.9, the reinforcement group, for the invasion of Luzon on the beaches of the Lingayen Gulf. She arrived off San Fabian on the morning of the 11th and began unloading troops and supplies. From 13 to 27 January, she received casualties on board and headed to Leyte Gulf where they were transferred to and . On 2 February, she joined a convoy and departed for the Solomons. On 22 February, the evacuation hospital ship got underway and proceeded via Pearl Harbor to the United States for an overhaul. She arrived at San Francisco on 11 March and remained in the navy yard until 20 May. After refresher training in San Diego, she sailed for Hawaii on 3 June and arrived at Pearl Harbor the following week. The transport then called at Eniwetok, Guam, and San Francisco before returning to Hawaii on 2 August. The next day, she headed for Guam and arrived there on the 15th to hear that hostilities with Japan had ceased. Tryon was routed to the Philippines, embarked occupation troops at Leyte, and joined a convoy for Japan on 1 September. The transport disembarked the troops at Yokohama and received liberated Allied prisoners of war en board for transportation to the Philippines. She disembarked them at Manila on the 18th.  Post-war operations  On 1 October, Tryon was assigned to the \\"Magic Carpet\\" fleet which was established at the end of the war to return troops to the United States. She served with it through the end of the year. In mid-January 1946, the ship was slated for inactivation. She was decommissioned at Seattle on 20 March 1946, returned to the War Shipping Administration in April, and struck from the Navy list on 17 April 1946. Tryon was turned over to the United States Army on 17 July 1946 and converted into a troop transport by the Todd Shipyard, Seattle, Washington. She emerged from the yard on 25 August 1947 and was placed in service as USAT Sgt. Charles E. Mower. The Secretary of Defense, by a directive dated 2 August 1949, established a unified sea transportation service; and, on 1 March 1950, the ship was transferred back to the Navy Department, assigned to the Military Sea Transportation Service, and designated T-AP-186. USNS Sgt. Charles E. Mower operated as a dependent transport shuttling between San Francisco and Pearl Harbor until she was inactivated in 1954. Sgt. Charles E. Mower was placed out of service, in reserve, on 16 June 1954; transferred to the reserve fleet at Suisun Bay; and struck from the Navy list on 1 July 1960.

Fringed by the hills of the Aravalli Range, this was a man-made embankment. Owing to unchecked mining in neighbouring areas, the lake began drying up two decades back and is now totally dried up. There are functional Haryana Tourism Corporation restaurants in the vicinity. A flower show is held every spring here. Its name is most probably derived from the Persian word beydakhal, which means free from interference. Close to Badkhal Lake is the Peacock Lake. It is a biodiversity area within the Northern Aravalli leopard wildlife corridor stretching from Sariska Tiger Reserve to Delhi. Historical places around the lake include the 10th century ancient Surajkund reservoir (15 km north) and Anangpur Dam (16 km north), the similarly dried up Damdama Lake, Tughlaqabad Fort, Adilabad ruins and the Chhatarpur Temple.ASOLA BHATTI WILD LIFE SANCTUARY , Department of Forest, Delhi Government There are several dozen lakes formed in the abandoned open pit mines in and around the sanctuary.

History The lake was built soon after the country got Independence in 1947 to facilitate water supply to the nearby farms. It was built by constructing a bund between two low-lying Aravalli hills, to trap run-off for irrigation. In 1972, the Government of Haryana built a 30-room resort off the lake, which was a major tourist attraction during the '70s through to the '90s, with boating and other activities. Migratory birds also used to visit the lake. Construction boom in the National Capital Region drove quarrying and mining in the area at a large scale. As illegal mining and quarrying mushroomed, the downward water flow to the lake was not just obstructed, but aquifers were also damaged. In addition, deforestation and rampant borewell digging in the area owing to urbanisation worsened the situation, leaving the lake high and dry. A number of mineral water companies have also illegally sourced water from the lake. Since 2009, the lake has been observed as completely dried up, leaving only grassy terrain. Unusually low rainfall in the area has also been cited. In January 2010, the lake and the nearby Surajkund was filled up with water in conjunction with 2010 Commonwealth Games. But in March 2014, in a survey report released by the Delhi Parks and Gardens Society (DPGS), under the Government of Delhi's department of environment, the lake was completely dry and completely dependent on rains for water. The report also revealed 190 of 611 water bodies in Delhi had also gone dry. Renewal Efforts The initial renewal efforts were entrusted with the state irrigation department. In 2017, they tried to replenish the lake bed by supplying water from the Okhla canal, but it was found to be an unviable option. The state government then approached Manav Rachna University in 2018, which prepared a report suggesting that Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) water may be used for the same. Afterwards, experts from Indian Institute of Technology-Roorkee were roped in to collect soil samples and conduct infiltration tests on the lake bed. They carried out a geo- technical survey of the lake under the Smart Cities Mission and submitted its report a year later. A lake revival project worth Rs 79 crore was also taken up in 2018. This included the STP project which aims to fill up the lake with regular discharge from the plant to a level of 6 metre in 300 days. Worth Rs 30 crore, the project was sanctioned by the state government in November that year. But it was reported in October, 2019 that a delay in formal clearances by the Forest Department and the Pollution Control Board had halted all work. As of 2019, various other measures are being discussed at the government level to restore the lake, but damaged aquifers, low groundwater level and disturbance of water catchment pathways cast aspersions. Environmental experts have called the governments plans a simple renovation, but not a full renewal.

Within those worlds, users can communicate with high-fidelity, immersive audio, share live desktop applications and documents and conduct real business. Open Wonderland is completely extensible; developers and graphic artists can extend its functionality to create entirely new worlds and add new features to existing worlds. The vision for Open Wonderland is to provide an environment that is robust enough in terms of security, scalability, reliability, and functionality that organizations can rely on it as a place to conduct real business. Organizations should be able to use Open Wonderland to create a virtual presence to better communicate with customers, partners, and employees. Individuals should be able to do their real work within a virtual world, eliminating the need for a separate collaboration tool when they wish to work together with others. Individuals should also be able to tailor portions of the world to adapt to their work needs and to express their personal style. The types of collaborations that can happen within the space include audio communication, live desktop applications of all kinds, and eventually collaborative creation of world content (both graphical and procedural). Project Wonderland had been funded by Sun Microsystems since its early development. On January 27, 2010, Sun Microsystems was acquired by Oracle who decided to cease funding. Project Wonderland is now continuing as an independent community-supported open-source project named \\"Open Wonderland\\".  Goals  One important goal of the project is for the environment to be completely extensible. Developers and graphic artists can extend the functionality to create entire new worlds, new features in existing worlds, or new behaviors for objects and avatars. The art path for Wonderland is also open. The eventual goal is to support content creation within the world, but in the shorter term, the goal is to support importing art from open source 3D content creation tools as well as professional 3D modeling and animation applications. Open Wonderland aims to provide a secure world in which organizations may do business, or allow employees to collaborate online. It is eventually intended to allow edits to be made to a virtual world with XML files instead of having to make changes to the source code and to add an in-world method of creating content. At present, all content is made with external tools, such as Blender or Google SketchUp.  Technical overview  The Open Wonderland toolkit's client/server architecture supports the creation of a wide range of interactive, dynamic virtual worlds. This is made possible by a flexible module system. This scheme allows developers to extend not only the Wonderland client and server, but also to package up artwork and complete worlds as easy-to-install modules. Modules can also be written to connect Wonderland with an unlimited number of external services. Security and federation are two other key features provided by the Wonderland toolkit. Open Wonderland worlds can be secured behind a corporate firewall if desired, and they can integrate with an enterprise's existing authentication and identity management infrastructure. By default, a module is provided to connect to LDAP authentication systems. For fine-grained security, any object within an Open Wonderland world can be associated with an access control list to govern which users can see, interact with, or edit the object. These access controls are hierarchical, so access can be applied to a single object in a space or to all objects within a room, building or other enclosing 3D structure. Security is a server-side function. This means that objects are never sent to a client that does not have permission to view the object, making it more difficult to defeat the security system. Federation enables users of Open Wonderland worlds to navigate from one world to another through a number of different user interface mechanisms. These worlds can be dramatically different from one another in terms of content, code, and the organization that runs the server. For example, a user might start in a corporation's virtual lecture hall and walk through a portal to a university's submarine simulation. The lecture hall might have modules installed for virtual microphones, slide show presentations, and business intelligence analysis, while the submarine simulation may include a fluid dynamics module, a working submarine console, and integration with telemetry data from a real submarine. While much of the code to run the Open Wonderland worlds is shared, the specialized 2D and 3D programs that run in these worlds are not shared. Wonderland's federation scheme, which takes full advantage of the Java Programming Language's ability to dynamically load code, means that when a user moves from one world to another, the necessary missing code is downloaded on an as-needed basis. Additionally, users' avatar information is stored on their local system so that their avatar goes with them from one world to the next.  Immersive audio and telephony  Open Wonderland features tight integration of immersive, high-fidelity stereo audio. Using the open source voice bridge, 'jVoiceBridge', not only do you hear recorded audio in stereo at CD-quality, but you also can hear other live people at this quality. jVoiceBridge adapts to allow remote users with lower bandwidth connections to use lower audio fidelities, including telephone-quality. If you are having a conversation, the high-fidelity audio allows you to hear people's voices coming from the appropriate directions, as you would in the real world. Since voices or other sounds become softer as you move away from them, Open Wonderland easily supports multiple, simultaneous conversations within the same virtual space. A wide range of audio-related modules can be created using jVoiceBridge. For example, an in-world virtual telephone allows users without access to a computer to dial in to meeting in an Open Wonderland world. Virtual microphones, audio recorders, and a cone-of-silence for private voice chat are other examples of audio-related modules. In addition, recorded audio can be associated with objects in the world, including simulated characters. This allows virtual world developers to create a rich audio experience for visitors.  Shared applications  Wonderland supports three types of shared applications. The first is direct support for 2D X applications (just about any application that will run natively on a Linux system). With this type of shared application, one user can take control and edit a document in the world while others in proximity can watch. It is easy to pass control from one user to another. These applications, which were designed for single users, are handy for troubleshooting together in a terminal window, or working together on standard desktop applications like Open Office, or collaborative web browsing. The second type of shared applications are multi-user 2D Java applications. Wonderland provides a framework for creating these applications to help developers build true collaboration-aware tools - ones designed from the outset with multiple users in mind. One example of a collaboration-aware application is the slide show viewer in which every person gets a copy of the slides. Users can then either synchronize with the presenter or navigate through the slides independently. Another example is the shared whiteboard. This allows multiple users to draw on the board at the same time. These applications not only have the advantage of being multi-user, but they also perform better because the code for each application runs on the client computer and only minimal amounts of data are shared through the server to synchronize the state. With most types of 2D applications, developers can enable drag-and-drop of content from the user's desktop into the Open Wonderland window. For example, users can drop any .png or .jpg image into Wonderland and see it displayed with an image viewer application. Users can also drag-and-drop web pages into the world and continue browsing in a multi- user context. Any .svg documents dropped into the world will automatically instantiate an in-world whiteboard for collaborative editing of the document. After editing, the whiteboard documents can be dragged back out onto the desktop for e-mailing to others or for editing with a different application. The last type of shared applications are multi-user 3D Java applications. Packaged as modules, these applications can contain any combination of artwork and code. An example is the audio recorder mentioned above. This small application includes code for capturing, storing, and playing back audio. It also includes artwork for the recorder, complete with reels that spin when the recorder is on and 3D buttons for Record, Play, and Stop. Applications can be as small as the audio recorder, as large as a whole world, or somewhere in between. For example, the 'Glasshouse world' from Green Phosphor includes dynamically generated, interactive 3D graphs created from data stored in external corporate data warehouses, databases, or spreadsheets. While collaborating, users can highlight rows, columns or cells, and they can drill down into the data by generating sub-graphs. The ability to mix and match these three types of applications within a Wonderland world enables developers to create rich, interactive collaborative experiences for distributed groups of users.

The film was directed by Mark Robson and starred Gary Cooper, Barry Jones and Roberta Haynes. It was based on a short story, \\"Mr. Morgan\\", by James Michener in his 1951 short story collection Return to Paradise, his sequel to his 1947 novel Tales of the South Pacific. It was filmed on location in Matautu, Western Samoa (present-day Samoa). Plot During the 1920s, itinerant American beachcomber Mr. Morgan (Gary Cooper) is deposited on the island of Matareva in the South Pacific. When he decides to stay he is confronted by Pastor Cobbett (Barry Jones), who lost both his father and his wife as a young missionary on the island. Cobbett rules Matareva as a Puritanical despot, using local bullies as \\"wardens\\" to enforce his rules. \\"Morgan Tane\\" stays on Matareva by winning the support of the natives after he defeats the wardens with the aid of an empty shotgun. Morgan has an illegitimate child, Turia (Moira Walker), by island girl Maeva (Roberta Haynes). After Maeva's death in childbirth, the distraught Morgan departs the island, leaving Turia behind with her grandmother. Morgan returns to Matareva during World War II, where he reconciles with Cobbett, who has become a friend and teacher to the islanders, and meets Turia. She falls in love with an American Air Force pilot, Harry Faber, after he crash-lands his cargo plane in the lagoon. An interesting irony is that when Morgan first arrived, Cobbett tried to force him to leave the island lest he get an island girl pregnant. Now he faces the same thing when Faber tries to seduce his daughter, Turia, as a diversion while awaiting pickup by the Navy. Morgan intervenes and makes Faber leave and his crew leave, using the same empty shotgun as an inducement. When Turia forgives him, Morgan decides to remain with her on Matareva.

Eliel, Samuel H. Wilen Le Bel-van't Hoff rule states that the number of stereoisomers of an organic compound is 2n, where n represents the number of asymmetric carbon atoms (unless there is an internal plane of symmetry); a corollary of Le Bel and van't Hoff's simultaneously announced conclusions, in 1874, that the most probable orientation of the bonds of a carbon atom linked to four groups or atoms is toward the apexes of a tetrahedron, and that this accounted for all then-known phenomena of molecular asymmetry (which involved a carbon atom bearing four different atoms or groups). Knowing the number of asymmetric carbon atoms, one can calculate the maximum possible number of stereoisomers for any given molecule as follows: : If n is the number of asymmetric carbon atoms then the maximum number of isomers = 2n (Le Bel-van't Hoff rule) As an example, malic acid has 4 carbon atoms but just one of them is asymmetric. The asymmetric carbon atom is the one attached to two carbon atoms, an oxygen atom, and a hydrogen atom. One may initially be inclined to think this atom is not asymmetric because it is attached to two carbon atoms, but because those two carbon atoms are not attached to exactly the same things, there are two different groups of atoms that the carbon atom in question is attached to, therefore making it an asymmetric carbon atom: :example of an asymmetric carbon A tetrose with 2 asymmetric carbon atoms has 22 = 4 stereoisomers: :2 asymmetric carbon atoms in a tetrose An aldopentose with 3 asymmetric carbon atoms has 23 = 8 stereoisomers: :3 asymmetric carbon atoms in an aldopentose An aldohexose with 4 asymmetric carbon atoms has 24 = 16 stereoisomers: :4 asymmetric carbon atoms in an aldohexose The four groups of atoms attached to the carbon atom can be arranged in space in two different ways that are mirror images of each other, and which lead to so-called left-handed and right-handed versions of the same molecule. Molecules that cannot be superimposed on their own mirror image are said to be chiral like mirror image.

The ships never received any names, being known only as Numbers 13‚Äì16. They were intended to reinforce Japan's \\"eight-eight fleet\\" of eight battleships and eight battlecruisers after the United States announced a major naval construction program in 1919. The Number 13 class was designed to be superior to all other existing battleships, planned or building. After the signing of the Washington Naval Treaty in 1922, they were cancelled in November 1923 before construction could begin. Design and background By 1918, the Navy had gained approval for an \\"eight-six\\" fleet, all ships under eight years old. However, having four large battleships and four battlecruisers on order put an enormous financial strain on Japan, which was spending about a third of its national budget on the Navy.Gardiner & Gray, p. 224 Despite this, the IJN gained approval of the \\"eight-eight-eight\\" plan in 1920 after American President Woodrow Wilson announced plans in 1919 to re-initiate the 1916 plan for ten additional battleships and six battlecruisers. The Japanese response required the construction of eight additional fast battleships in the Kii and the Number 13 classes.Evans & Peattie, p. 174 When designing the latter class, the Japanese followed the doctrine that they had used since the First Sino- Japanese War of 1894‚Äì1895 of compensating for quantitative inferiority with qualitative superiority.Evans & Peattie, p. 59 In the words of naval historian Siegfried Breyer, \\"had [the ships] been completed, they would have been the world's largest and most powerful battleships. Their gun calibre alone would have caused a new and more intensive naval arms race. From an engineering aspect they were more than ten years ahead of their time because they anticipated the characteristics of the fully developed, fast battleship.\\" Naval architects William Garzke and Robert Dulin concur saying, \\"These ships would have completely outclassed any European battleship\\".Garzke & Dulin, p. 10 The Number 13 class was designed by Captain Yuzuru Hiraga, the naval architect responsible for most of the previous Japanese capital ships. The ships were based on his previous Kii-class battleship and designs, enlarged to take guns.Gardiner & Gray, p. 235 Description The ships had a length of between perpendiculars and overall. They had a beam of and a draft of . The normal displacement of the battleships was .Breyer, p. 329 The class was intended to be equipped with four Gijutsu-Hombu geared steam turbines, each of which drove one propeller shaft.

Construction After the end of World War I, the United Kingdom, the United States and the Empire of Japan all announced large capital ship building programs, incorporating design lessons from the war. These ships would have been much larger and more expensive than earlier vessels and President Warren G. Harding called a conference at Washington, D. C. in late 1921 to forestall a very expensive arms race. The attendees at the conference agreed to limit capital ship construction for the next decade and scrapped large numbers of existing ships as well as many ships still under construction. Japan suspended the Number 13 class while the conference was in progress before any ship was laid down and formally cancelled them on 19 November 1923.

The Turpan water system or Turfan water system (locally called karez, , USY: –∫–∞—Ä–∏–∑) in Turpan, located in the Turpan Depression, Xinjiang, China, is a vertical tunnel system adapted by the Turpan people. The word karez means \\"well\\" in the local Uyghur language. Turpan has the Turpan Water Museum (a Protected Area of the People's Republic of China) dedicated to demonstrating its karez water system, as well as exhibiting other historical artifacts. Turpan's well system was crucial in Turpan's development as an important oasis stopover on the ancient Silk Road skirting the barren and hostile Taklamakan Desert. Turpan owes its prosperity to the water provided by its karez well system. Description The karez water system is made up of a network of interconnected qanats. Karez gallery near Turpan, Xinjiang, China Turpan's karez water system is made up of a horizontal series of vertically dug wells that are then linked by underground water canals to collect water from the watershed surface runoff from the base of the Tian Shan Mountains and the nearby Flaming Mountains. The canals channel the water to the surface, taking advantage of the current provided by the gravity of the downward slope of the Turpan Depression. The canals are mostly underground to reduce water evaporation and to make the slope long enough to reach far distances being only gravity fed. The system has wells, dams and underground canals built to store the water and control the amount of water flow. Vertical wells are dug at various points to tap into the groundwater flowing down sloping land from the source, the mountain runoff. The water is then channeled through underground canals dug from the bottom of one well to the next well and then to the desired destination, Turpan's irrigation system. This irrigation system of special connected wells has been claimed to originate in Iran (e.g., the qanat system), to have originated indigenously, or to have been invented in other parts of China . Both historical and archaeological research convincingly point to the origins of this technology as arriving from more western regions along with indigenous innovations. In Xinjiang, the greatest number of karez wells are in the Turpan Depression, where today there remain over 1100 karez wells and channels having a total length of over . The local geography makes karez wells practical for agricultural irrigation and other uses. Turpan is located in the second deepest geographical depression in the world, with over of land below sea level and with soil that forms a sturdy basin. Water naturally flows down from the nearby mountains during the rainy season in an underground current to the low depression basin under the desert. The Turpan summer is very hot and dry with periods of wind and blowing sand. Importance Map showing location of Turpan (upper right) on the Silk Road Ample water was crucial to Turpan, so that the oasis city could service the many caravans on the Silk Route resting there near a route skirting the Taklamakan Desert. The caravans included merchant traders and missionaries with their armed escorts, animals including camels, sometimes numbering into the thousands, along with camel drivers, agents and other personnel, all of whom might stay for a week or more. The caravans needed pastures for their animals, resting facilities, trading bazaars for conducting business, and replenishment of food and water.  Threatened by global warming  There are 20,000 glaciers in Xinjiang ‚Äì nearly half of all the glaciers in China. The water from the glaciers via the underground channels has provided a stable water source year round, independent of season, for thousands of years. But since the 1950s, Xinjiang's glaciers have retreated by between 21 percent to 27 percent due to global warming, threatening the agricultural productivity of the region.

Biography Forrester was born on September 22, 1956 in Tucker, Georgia. His mother was a ballroom dance instructor. He started to develop his trademark voice in high school, at The Sanford Naval Academy, when he began taking vocal lessons. After graduation, he moved to South Carolina where he began playing in local bands. In the late 1970s, Forrester joined forces with two former members of Illinois act Roller, guitarist Russ Shirley and bassist/vocalist Kevin Lee, and drummer Jim Schroeder, to form Hitman. The band stayed together for about a year, playing around the Georgia State area. Forrester's big break came while he was with a New York cover band named Rachel, when he successfully auditioned to replace the departing Guy Speranza in Riot. He would make his studio debut on 1982's Restless Breed album which the band supported by touring with headliners Rainbow on their Straight Between the Eyes tour, sharing the bill at different times with Saxon, Scorpions, and UFO. Keeping up their momentum, the Riot Live EP was released later that same year. After losing their major label deal with Elektra, Riot signed with Canadian indie label Quality Records for the 1983 release of Born In America, Forrester's second and last studio album with the band. In early 1984, Riot played dates on the Kiss - Lick It Up tour alongside Vandenberg, but saddled with managerial problems, they decided to split up shortly thereafter. Rhett Forrester at the Breaking Sound Festival (France), August 1984. Photograph by Joseph Carlucci. After the demise of Riot, Forrester teamed with former Virgin Steele guitarist Jack Starr and appeared on his 1984 solo album, Out of the Darkness, which featured The Rods rhythm section of Carl Canedy and Gary Bordonaro. This was also the line-up that traveled to France in the summer of 1984 for an appearance at the 2-day Breaking Sound Festival in Le Bourget, near Paris, on August 30. Erroneously billed as Virgin Steele in advance of the festival, they played just below headliners Dio and Blue √ñyster Cult. Forrester would part ways with Starr after the ill-fated gig and ended up stranded in France for a period of time. He wound up utilizing the months of September and October to record his first solo album, Gone with the Wind, including a cover of The Rolling Stones' \\"Live with Me\\", at Studio Max Waldberg in Paris. Released by French indie label Bernett Records, it featured New York guitarist/co-writer Paul Kayen, aka Paul Kane, who had guested on Starr's Out of the Darkness, and was also a member of Aldo Nova's group at the time appearing on his 1985 Twitch album. Gone with the Wind would see a belated American release in 1986 via Shattered Records. In 1985, Forrester took part in the Combat Records initiated Thrasher project, featuring an all-star cast of mostly New York based musicians, including members of The Rods, Talas, Bible Black, and Dust, contributing vocals to the song \\"Bad Boys\\" on the Burning At the Speed of Light album. Forrester briefly joined an aborted West Coast version of Riot, consisting of guitarist Mark Reale, bassist Van Stavern, and drummer Sandy Slavin, performing live with the band at The Roxy in West Hollywood, CA on April 16 & 18, 1986. Bootleg recordings of both gigs are available for download on numerous sites online. Still with Paul Kayen as his guitarist/co-writer, Forrester signed a new record deal with Rhino Records subsidiary Rampage and released Even the Score in 1988. The album was recorded at Backdoor Studios in Huntington Station, NY, produced by Chris Pati and engineered by John Tabacco. It was subsequently remixed in Los Angeles. It contained a re-make of \\"Assume the Position\\", accompanied by an explicit video, as well as a cover of Mott the Hoople and Bad Company's \\"Ready for Love.\\" After splitting with Kayen, Forrester briefly worked with guitarist Alex Masi and in 1991 recorded demos with former Keel members, guitarist Bryan Jay and drummer Dwain Miller, and bassist Rob Thiessen under the name Dogbone. These recordings were released on CD after Forrester's death in 1996. Dogbone's song \\"Dog Fight Alley\\", re-titled \\"Streets of Rock & Roll\\", was released by Keel as the title track to their 2010 comeback album, Streets of Rock & Roll, albeit without any credit given to Forrester or Dogbone. In the early 1990s, Forrester became the frontman for Calgary, Alberta-based band, The Black Symphony, featuring guitarist Rick Plester, bassist RJ Killinger, and drummer Tim Waterson. They recorded a 3-song demo in 1992 containing the songs \\"The End of Time\\", \\"Redemption\\", and \\"In the Beginning.\\" Forrester also got involved with another Calgary act, Dr. Dirty, a union which produced a pair of 4-song demos. The group dissolved on the verge of signing a major label record deal. Forrester's last project prior to his death was Dirty Water with San Antonio, TX guitarist/co-writer Jonathan Grell, formerly of Winterkat. He was killed shortly after completing a 4-song demo. Rare material, including five songs from the Mr. Dirty project, featuring Forrester, ex-Steel Lily guitarist Rob Robbins (now found in Moxy), bassist/songwriter Scot Gains, and drummer Ray Mehlbaum, was released in 1996 on the Hell or Highwater memorial CD. The album also contains 3 songs from the Dirty Water sessions, recorded with Grell, drummer Dwain Miller (Keel, Outlaw Blood, Dogbone), and bassist Robert Cooper. Hell or Highwater received an official digital release in November 2014. In November 2013, an expanded 30-year anniversary edition of Jack Starr and Rhett Forrester's Out of the Darkness, including rare pictures and liner notes, was issued by Germany's Limb Music label. Death Forrester was shot and killed at the Northwest Atlanta intersection of Lovejoy Street (now Centennial Lane) and Merritts Avenue, one block west of Techwood Drive (now Centennial Olympic Park Drive), after he refused to give up his vehicle in an attempted carjacking; he was 37 years old. The crime remained unsolved for some time. He was survived by his mother Lafortune Forrester, his brother, guitarist Lucky Forrester, his ex, Windi Grace, daughter, Jade Grace, and his fiance, Lori Plester, whom he was living with at the time. One person (who apparently pulled the trigger) was killed and another was arrested for other crimes, finally admitting to being at the scene of Forrester's death, among other murders.Jeremy Simmonds, The Encyclopedia of Dead Rock Stars, Chicago Review Press, 2008, , pag. 312 Posthumous honor Forrester was inducted into Atlanta's Hard Rock Cafe in 1996.

Enrollment The last enrollment for the school stood at 450. The school experienced its largest growth spurt during the 2007-2008 school year after another local Christian school in Hueytown, Alabama, Garywood Christian School, suspended operations while its parent church moves to a new location. Curriculum Flint Hill Christian School used a combination of the A Beka curriculum, Bob Jones Math, and various other publishers. A Beka Book is a publisher affiliated with Pensacola Christian College based in Pensacola, Florida.

The film took almost two years to complete and was the last film Gable starred in before he enlisted in the United States Army Air Forces for World War II. His next film was the post-war Adventure (1945). Plot In October 1941, war correspondents and brothers \\"Jonny\\" (Clark Gable) and Kirk Davis (Robert Sterling) return to the still-neutral United States after being kicked out of Germany. Jonny's boss, isolationist New York Daily Chronicle publisher George L. Stafford (Charles Dingle), refuses to print his story about Japan and Germany's plans for the world, but Jonny tricks him into doing so, and gets fired for his trouble. When Jonny goes to reclaim his old room from friends and landlords \\"Evie\\" (Lee Patrick) and Willie Manning (Reginald Owen), he is annoyed (despite having been away for years) to find they have rented it out to Paula Lane (Lana Turner), an aspiring reporter who wants to work as a foreign correspondent. Ladies man Jonny is very interested in the beautiful blonde, but then finds that his brother already has a relationship with her. A romantic triangle ensues. Despite being in love with her himself, Jonny tries to arrange it so that Paula chooses Kirk. Eventually, they are all reunited in Manila ... on Sunday, December 7, the day of the attack on Pearl Harbor, which brings America into the war. Jonny insists that the other two leave on a ship for Australia, while he remains behind to report for the Chronicle, but they sneak back on the pilot boat after he sees them off. Kirk enlists, while Paula joins the Red Cross. When the Japanese invade the Philippines, Jonny encounters his brother by chance; Kirk is part of a detachment under the command of Lieutenant Wade Hall (Van Johnson) that is assigned to repel a Japanese amphibious landing. Kirk and most of the other defenders die in the fierce fighting. Jonny believes that Paula was also killed, when the hospital where she was working was wiped out, but it turns out she was out escorting a party of wounded there. When they find each other, Jonny sets her at a typewriter and starts dictating the rest of his newspaper story.

Production The film was designed as another vehicle for the immensely popular Gable/Turner pairing. Following their success in 1941's Honky Tonk, MGM was looking to capitalize on this new team, hoping to reproduce the box office appeal Gable had when he was paired with actresses Joan Crawford (8 films), Jean Harlow (6 films), and Myrna Loy (7 films) in the 1930s. Once filming began, Gable and Turner continued their friendly working relationship. Filming was suspended for a month after Gable's wife, actress Carole Lombard, was killed in a plane crash. Gable was permitted to take leave from filming for a period of bereavement, and the studio almost scrapped the film. It was retitled Red Light but changed back to Somewhere I'll Find You before its release. It was the last film made by Gable prior to his military service during World War II; he did not make another film until 1945. The film was, like the Gable/Turner pairing in Honky Tonk (1941), a box office success. The pair later made two more films together, Homecoming (1948) and Betrayed (1954). Both those movies, like \\"Somewhere I'll Find You,\\" had Gable and Turner serving as comrades and lovers in World War II. Reception According to MGM records the film earned $2,885,000 in the US and Canada and $1,129,000 elsewhere, making the studio a profit of $1,749,000.\\"101 Pix Gross in Millions\\" Variety 6 Jan 1943 p 58 ReferencesExternal links  * Category:1942 films Category:1942 romantic drama films Category:American films Category:American romantic drama films Category:American black-and-white films Category:English-language films Category:Films about war correspondents Category:Films directed by Wesley Ruggles Category:Films scored by Bronis≈Çaw Kaper Category:Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer films Category:Pacific War films Category:World War II films made in wartime Category:Films set in the Philippines Category:1942 drama films ","title":"Somewhere I'll Find You"},{"id":"13409961","text":"Los Haticos is a village and corregimiento in the municipality of Valledupar within the Colombian Department of Cesar.

He is also known as a memoirist, theater, art and film critic, book publisher and translator. Chimet, who was an opponent of totalitarianism in general and of the Communist regime in particular, was persecuted by the latter as a dissident, and lived much of his life in obscurity. His experience as an employee of the cooperative society Centrocoop also made him one of the first professional copywriters in his country. The poems, fantasy works and fairy tales he authored, although largely ignored locally upon being published, have since drawn acclaim for their accomplished style, and are considered by many unique in Romanian literature. They explored the themes of innocence and melancholy, and have themselves been seen as a venue for a discreet advocacy of disobedience. Chimet was also the author of critical essays on Latin American studies and Western or popular culture, and a publisher of anthologies on some of the major themes in Romanian society. In addition, he collected and published material on the life and legacy of playwright Mihail Sebastian, as well as on the history of the Romanian avant- garde. Iordan Chimet had a lifelong friendship with Gheorghe Ursu, a dissident who was killed by the Securitate secret police in 1985, and with science fiction author Camil Baciu. He was also a friend of the German writer Michael Ende and the Greek poet Odysseas Elytis, with whom he kept in touch in spite of the difficulties posed by their living on different sides of the Iron Curtain. Biography Born in Gala≈£i, Chimet belonged to a family of middle- class intellectuals. His first works of poetry were published by the magazine Vremea when he was still in high school. Monica Ghe»õ, \\"Evocare. ¬´Ultimul Don Quijote¬ª\\" , in Tribuna, Vol. V, Nr. 91, June 2006, p. 13. Politically active while still a teenager during World War II, he was part of an anti-fascist group in his native city. Andrei Ursu, \\"DespƒÉr≈£ire de Iordan Chimet\\" , in Revista 22, Nr. 849, June 2006 The cell, which opposed Ion Antonescu's rule and Romania's alliance to the Axis Powers (see Romania during World War II), also included Ursu and Baciu. The Romanian Kingdom's secret police, Siguran≈£a Statului, had Chimet under surveillance from 1943 until the King Michael Coup of 1944. Chimet, unlike his friends, was not drawn into collaboration with the Romanian Communist Party, being apprehensive of communism in general and of Soviet influence in particular. He was a graduate of the Philology and Philosophy Department (1948), and of the Law Department (1957) of the University of Bucharest. Following the start of Soviet occupation, he was active in supporting writers proscribed by the new authorities and joined a clandestine society to offer them help‚Äîknown as the Eminescu Association, after Romania's famous 19th century poet Mihai Eminescu, it sought assistance from the Western Allies. Paul Cernat, \\"Scrisori din ≈¢ara Minunilor\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 25, August 2000 Alex. ≈ûtefƒÉnescu, Cicerone Ioni»õoiu, \\"Constant Tonegaru - de≈£inut politic\\" , in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 3/2002 Other people involved in this project were the authors Pavel Chihaia, Vladimir Streinu, and Constant Tonegaru (aided by the French Roman Catholic cleric Marie-Alype Barral). Ovidiu ≈ûimonca, \\"Anul 2005 vƒÉzut prin interviurile Observatorului cultural\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 300-301, December 2005-January 2006 According to Chihaia: \\"We realized, from the very beginning, what the new ideology imposed on us, as an adversary to the traditional culture, to the freedom of thought, attempting to compromise the values in which we believed and which we professed, really meant.\\" In the years leading up to the Communist regime's establishment, Iordan Chimet published poems with anti-communist undertones (ExiL, \\"ExiLe\\") in Revista Funda≈£iilor Regale and Revista Rom√¢no-AmericanƒÉ. Paul Cernat, \\"√éntoarcerea pe≈üti≈üorului Baltazar\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 59, April 2001Constantin StƒÉnescu, \\"Un scutier al iluziei\\", in Rom√¢nia LiberƒÉ, May 25, 2006 At the time, he met the art and literary critic Petru Comarnescu, who helped him publicize his works. Reportedly, Comarnescu proposed his poems for an award, but this was never granted. Refusing to adapt his style to Socialist realism, Chimet was himself considered a suspect, and lived in extreme poverty during the 1950s. Literary critic Paul Cernat indicated that Chimet was able to evade arrest only because Tonegaru, who had been arrested, did not give in to violent interrogation. Ursu and Baciu were themselves disillusioned with communism after 1949-1950, and broke with the Communist Party around that time. Chimet was subject to an inquiry for \\"anti-people activities\\", and sentenced to work as a lathe operator for a worker cooperative. Soon after, he was moved to what was considered a lower position, that of copy-editor for Centrocoop commercials, an office whose equivalent in capitalist countries was that of copywriter (Chimet was thus one of Romania's first persons to have this job description after World War II). It was in this field that he gained first-hand experience in marketing, which was to prove an important theme in some of his essays. Florin Dumitrescu, \\"40 de zile fƒÉrƒÉ Iordan Chimet\\", in Dilema Veche, Vol. III, Nr. 129, July 2006 He was allowed to publish beginning in the late 1960s, with the liberalization coinciding with the early years of Nicolae Ceau≈üescu's leadership. Micha√´l Finkenthal, \\"A murit Iordan Chimet\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 323, June 2006 At the time, Chimet also found employment as a lecturer at the \\"Friends of Film\\" club at the Cinemateca film archive, where he kept company with film critics such as Paul BarbƒÉneagrƒÉ, Tudor Caranfil, Eugen Schileru and D. I. Suchianu.G. BrƒÉtescu, Ce-a fost sƒÉ fie. Nota»õii autobiografice, Humanitas, Bucharest, 2003, p.307. His works of criticism touched aspects of Western culture that he intended to popularize in Romania: two of them were dedicated, respectively, to the American-born Western genre (Western. Filmele Vestului √ÆndepƒÉrtat‚Äî\\"Western. The Films of the Far West\\") and to the American cinema in general (Eroi, fantome, »ôoricei‚Äî\\"Heroes, Ghosts, Little Mice\\"); other works dealt with the visual arts in South America, with Latin American art and Latin American studies. This focus, together with the praise to innocence he provided in his fairy tales and fantasy works, as well as in his 1972 Editura Ion CreangƒÉ anthology (Cele 12 luni ale visului. O antologie a inocen»õei, \\"The 12 Months of Dreaming. An Anthology of Innocence\\"), have themselves been seen as signs of resistance through culture. Marina Debattista, \\"Subversiunea inocen≈£ei\\" , in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 22/2007 While his work was ignored at home, it brought Chimet a measure of success abroad. His essays on American culture were generally not distributed in Romania, but were translated in other Eastern bloc countries, where they became appreciated for their subversive undertones. In parallel, his works of children's literature were translated into several languages, and became known in America, as well as in Western and Central Europe, on both sides of the Iron Curtain. He was selected to be part of the jury for the University of Oklahoma's Neustadt International Prize for Literature (the only Romanian to enjoy this appointment), but the communist authorities' hostility prevented him from honoring the request. Iordan Chimet did not cease his contacts with Western writers, and generally appealed to clandestine mail in order to have his messages sent across. In 1977, he began corresponding with Michael Ende, who was living in West Germany. The two shared a rejection for normative control over literature: while Chimet centered his criticism on the cultural guidelines imposed by Ceau»ôescu (see April Theses), Ende depicted in negative terms the impact of Neorealism and the Marxist aesthetics popularized by Bertold Brecht. The writers never met face to face. Later in life, Chimet was to preface the first Romanian edition of The Neverending Story. He also befriended the celebrated poet Odysseas Elytis, as well as prominent critics of the Communist regime (historian Katherine Verdery and exiled writer Norman Manea) and artists from South and Central American countries. Chimet edited and published Elytis' work in Romania‚Äîthe resulting volume of collected poetry was deemed by Elytis \\"the most beautiful book dedicated to my work to have ever been published anywhere in the world.\\" According to one theory, Gheorghe Ursu's 1985 killing, which was the result of repeated beatings in custody, was the result of Securitate pressures to have him expose some of his writer friends‚ÄîChimet's name was cited, alongside those of poets Nina Cassian and Geo Bogza. Gabriela Blebea Nicolae, \\"Les d√©fis de l'identit√©: √âtude sur la probl√©matique de l'identit√© dans la p√©riode post-communiste en Roumanie\\", in Ethnologies, Vol. 25, Nr. 1/2003 (hosted by √ârudit.org) The same year, Chimet braved ongoing Securitate surveillance and attended Ursu's funeral. After the Romanian Revolution of 1989, Iordan Chimet centered his efforts on educating the Romanian public in respect to democratic values. In collaboration with the Cluj-Napoca-based publishing company Editura Dacia, he issued a collection of volumes, published under the collective title Ie»ôirea din labirint (\\"Exiting The Labyrinth\\"). It was as part of this that, in 1992-1993, he printed a four- volume dictionary on Romanian identity, Dreptul la memorie (\\"The Right to a Memory\\"), and the 1996 anthology called Momentul adevƒÉrului (\\"The Moment of Truth\\"). The two texts earned Ursu the Gheorghe Ursu Foundation Award for 1997. A member of the Romanian Writers' Union, he was the recipient of its special prize in 2003. Premiile USR pentru anul editorial 2003 at the Romanian Writers' Union site; retrieved November 27, 2007 In 2004, he published a volume of essays, titled Cele douƒÉ Europe, cele douƒÉ Rom√¢nii (\\"The Two Europes, The Two Romanias\\"). For most of his life, Chimet attempted to remain a freelancer, and, despite financial constraints, refused state employment for all but five years of his life. During his final years, despite usually refusing to comment on his incidental career in marketing, Chimet agreed to give lectures on selling technique for a private university‚Äîit was one of the first courses of its kind in Romania. He died in the small apartment he owned, located in the Titan area of Bucharest. His last work, a second volume of collected correspondence, was published posthumously. Literary contributions=Style and literary credo Inspired by Surrealism, Iordan Chimet was a representative of the World War II generation in Romanian literature, and his anti-totalitarianism was placed in connection with his upbringing in a multicultural city. Paul Cernat proposed that Chimet was in may ways similar to members of the Oniric trend‚Äîwho also mixed subversive messages with imagery inspired by Surrealism‚Äîand especially to its representatives Leonid Dimov and Emil Brumaru. Like his friend Gheorghe Ursu, Iordan Chimet cultivated the avant-garde, and was interested in the writings of his predecessors Urmuz, Gherasim Luca and Tristan Tzara, as well as in those of his Surrealist contemporary Gellu Naum. In 1999, he edited one of the first compilations of the Romanian avant-garde, with its title borrowed from Urmuz: CicƒÉ ni»ôte cronicari, duceau lipsƒÉ de »ôalvari (\\"It Seems It Did Happen Once, Some Chroniclers Lacked Baggy Pants\\"). Paul Cernat, \\"Recuperarea lui Ionathan X. Uranus\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 299, December 2005 He attempted to replicate the experience of interwar authors, who, as he himself argued, practiced \\"art as an exercise in admiration, as a statement of love, as a manifestation of the artist's solidarity with beings forgotten by history.\\" In parallel, his active and determined involvement in cultural resistance has led several authors to liken him to Don Quixote, the hidalgo character crafted by Miguel de Cervantes (see Quixotism). Seen as withdrawn and original, he doubled his political criticism with a vivid interest in topics related to fantasy, including mythology, magic, alchemy and demonology‚Äîpart of his work as a literary critic involved tracing the influences these had on popular culture and na√Øve art, as well as in science fiction and other areas of paraliterature. According to his friend, essayist Monica Ghe»õ, Chimet's style was the equivalent of \\"a mirror held in front of the local art's subconscious in times of need\\", while his stance was \\"pure and combative\\". In a 1980 book of literary and art criticism, Romanian author and Orthodox hermit Nicolae Steinhardt voiced admiration for Chimet's interpretation of Romanian folklore, both rural and urban, as noted in Chimet's 1976 travel writing volume BaladƒÉ pentru vechiul drum (\\"A Ballad to the Old Road\\"). Steinhardt sees Chimet's \\"entire effort\\" and lifelong message concentrated and explained by the book's title, together with that of Chimet's fairy tale novel √énchide ochii »ôi vei vedea Ora»ôul (which translates as \\"Close Your Eyes and You Will See The Town\\"). In his interpretation: \\"Vechiul drum is the road to reality, to nature, to the awareness of people and their age-old, eternal, culture, acute and responsible in the present as well. [‚Ä¶] Close your eyes in front of the superficial, in front of retail merchandise, in front of the \\"in other news\\" columns and in front of all gadgets which may tempt you, delude you, entice you and fool you, in front of all dissimulation, hasty lies and noisy or shiny glass beads of the county fairs, and you will see the true reality, poetic and perennial, of your space and the people who inhabit it‚Äîthe underlying structures, the columns, the crowns.\\"Steinhardt, p.73 Steinhardt argues that his fellow writer had helped the public make comparisons between the tenets of Surrealism and the natural tendencies in folk art: \\"The conclusion, I do believe, is unavoidable: surreality exists, only people call it reality. By vesting the most modest of realities with the prestige and the charm of fairy tales and poetry, Chimet invites (and compels) us to admit them as situated at an energetic and incantational level by no means inferior to the most delicate fantasies and the least bound reveries of Surrealism.\\"Steinhardt, p.74 He adds: \\"The world reveals itself [to Chimet] in its entirety, in its rich coloring, in the unending complexity of its textures, in the steady and calm rhythm of various activities and contemplations synchronized with the individual's psychosomatic foundations. Nature [‚Ä¶], the inanimate world [‚Ä¶], even costumes or musical instruments [‚Ä¶] evoke in him human activities, while the energies of matter are interpreted in a human sense and joined up with aspirations and sorrows found the human soul.\\"Steinhardt, p.74-75 The critic also proposed that such images in Vechiul drum were superior to a separate chapter on film history \\"from Fant√¥mas to Fellini and Hatari\\": \\"No matter how much Iordan Chimet is enchanted by the screen, no matter how contagious his cinemaphile passion may be, it is not in this area that he is truly at ease and worthy of being called a discoverer and unveiler of poetry. He earns these qualifiers mostly when he takes hold [‚Ä¶] of a traveler's cane, setting off to the country's villages, workshops, establishments and hidden corners in order to set before our eyes [‚Ä¶] the treasures of a reality on whose shoulders time sets itself with old age [Steinhardt's italics], but who has lost neither courage, nor warm wisdom or a charm renewed with each fresh gaze.\\"Steinhardt, p.76 Political views As a political essayist, in addition to his critique of totalitarian systems both left- and right-wing, Chimet was noted for his rejection of all forms of racism, and for being an outspoken critic of antisemitism. According to Andrei Ursu, Gheorghe Ursu's son, this led nationalist voices to accuse Chimet, an ethnic Romanian who defended members of the Jewish community, of having become a jidovit (\\"Jew-turned\\"). Literary critic Constantin StƒÉnescu linked his political views to the spirit of his works of fiction, defining him as \\"a Surrealist recoverer of innocence and a Utopian militant for purity, with a stubborn and inflexible faith [‚Ä¶] in the victory of tolerance and communion against racial or class intolerance, as well as against the outbursts of the aggressive primeval spirit during the long century into which he was given to be born.\\" Writing in 2006, Ghe»õ argued that his anthologies were drawing up \\"the map of spiritual freedom and its impartation along unsuspected Euro- Atlantic lines, long before the political-strategic ¬´axes¬ª presently reclaimed.\\" His activity in support of civil society has drawn comparisons with that of literary historian Adrian Marino, a leading member of the Romanian Civic Alliance, while Marino himself referred to Chimet, Alexandru George, Alexandru Paleologu and members of the Group for Social Dialogue as the sole \\"defenders of centrist cultural values\\" in post-1989 letters.Adrian Marino, Pentru Europa. Integrarea Rom√¢niei: Aspecte ideologice »ôi culturale, Polirom, Ia»ôi, 2005, p.183. According to essayist Micha√´l Finkenthal, Chimet \\"spent the last years of his life in a ceaseless battle to retrieve a past that some have forgotten and others have preferred, for various reasons, to neglect.\\" Finkenthal also defined Chimet's message as: \\"before incriminating, before accusing, research the facts carefully. When man is in chains, when speaking is replaced by yelling, [man] is weak and can be easily tempted by the devil.\\" Chimet himself argued: \\"All I could do was to defend, in the books I managed to publish, as well as in the everyday life that emerges and disappears, the ideas of friendship, loyalty and human solidarity which the world of my childhood was presenting to us as the foundations of existence.\\" He was self-effacing when it came to his legacy: \\"the new taste of the times shall be viewing these [goals] from the stratosphere, [they] shall be viewed as a concise moral, perhaps worthy of children in a church choir, a Boy Scout mentality, a Red Cross program, a street concert for the Salvation Army. The comparisons are unflattering, any plea in favor of these simple values seems compromised from the get-go. I must accept this handicap.\\" ExiL His ExiL poems, some of which were first published in the West during the 1940s, have drawn comparisons with the imagery of original modern artists such as Joan Mir√≥ and Paul Klee. The title is a wordplay on exil (the Romanian-language word for \\"exile\\") and el (\\"him\\"), and the lyrics are addressed to a Jewish friend who had been deported during the Ion Antonescu dictatorship (see Holocaust in Romania). Decades later, Chimet indicated: \\"It was for the first time that the issue of exile showed up in Romania's post-war environment. At the time, it was, shall we say, a premiere. But it was not many years after that the Red Army turned this theme into a banal poetic motif.\\" The poems build on a repertoire of diverse traditions, which combines, in Paul Cernat words, \\"myths, symbols and ancient spiritual traditions, evoking the miraculous bestiary of humanity's childhood\\", assuming a shape similar to \\"troubadour ballads, blues and Negro spiritual songs, with choirs and invocations addressed to a minute universe\\" and \\"peopled by creatures and inanimate objects suffering from a silent, nameless pain.\\" Among these writings was the 1947 C√¢ntec spiritual negru (\\"Negro Spiritual Song\\"), which centered on the imaginary figure of a Saint Benjamin. Also according to Cernat, aside from Surrealism, some of the ExiL poems recalled Imagism, while others were close to Lucian Blaga's Expressionism and the original style developed by Constant Tonegaru, or borrowed themes from the Biblical Ecclesiastes and the traditional stories of the Eastern world. A series of \\"laments\\", the pieces develop themes which Iordan Chimet would reuse in later works, such as the images of his native Gala≈£i as \\"the Old City\\" and an exiled monarch who would become \\"Baltazar the Little Fish\\". In one of the ExiL free verse pieces, titled Lamento cu o pƒÉlƒÉrie galbenƒÉ (\\"Lament with a Yellow Hat\\"), Chimet wrote of himself and the landscape of the Old City: Fantasy writings His fantasy works partly built on the Surrealist-Oniric legacy. Ghe»õ proposed that such writings have been \\"mistakenly\\" placed in the field of children's literature‚Äîshe preferred to define them as \\"transfers, evasions from the new mythical-totalitarian reality where all the Romanian sagacity had become stranded.\\" In Paul Cernat's view, they form part of the fantasy genre to be read by adults, similar to the writings of Edward Lear, Antoine de Saint Exup√©ry, J. R. R. Tolkien, Peter Beagle, and Lewis Carroll. Cernat argued: \\"Condescending prejudice has sought to exile [Chimet] into a shelf of curiosities merely frequented by a closed circle of connoisseurs: Chimet‚Äîthe children's author, Chimet‚Äîthe author of anthologies-manifestos for the innocence of adults, for the freedom of imagination and for the right to memory‚Ä¶\\" Also set in the Old City, his Lamento pentru pe»ôti»ôorul Baltazar (\\"Lament for Baltazar the Little Fish\\") was authored during the 1940s, but, due to political constraints, was only published in 1968 (when it reportedly failed to be chronicled by any literary magazine). The story, divided into independent chapters which function as discourses, comprises several distinct poems: it opens with a \\"Song to the Sea\\", and comprises one in Chimet's series of \\"Laments\\". Baltazar, who was defined by Cernat as \\"the messenger of innocence\\", is subjected to a trial and has to leave the Old City. In his adventures, the little fish is confronted with a various composite beings, whose identities are imprecise: Noi to»õi, which translates as \\"All of us\\", Mierea PƒÉm√¢ntului‚Äî\\"The Honey of the Earth\\", Vreo Doi (Vreo Doi era un »ôarpe de apƒÉ)‚Äî\\"Twosome (Twosome was a water snake)\\", CƒÉpitanul de trei co»õi lungime, de trei co»õi lƒÉ»õime‚Äî\\"The three-cubit-long three-cubit-wide captain\\", Prin»õesa de Satin‚Äî\\"The Satin Princess\\" etc. Cernat paralleled these elements to the Absurdist plays of Eug√®ne Ionesco, as well as to the tradition of nonsense verse in English literature. He likened the wordplays and intricate calligraphy associated with the characters and plot to the Lettrist experiments, and the themes they alluded to with those present in some later works by Romanian poet Marin Sorescu. Thus, he proposed that an episode marking the mythological age of Chimet's sea realm, where a character named Arghir asks a whale to swallow him, reminded one of Sorescu's poem Iona (with both of them being reinterpretations of the Old Testament story of Jonah). Cernat also noted that the playful atmosphere was doubled by \\"the diffuse sentiment of absence, estrangement and universal extinguishment\\". To illustrate this, he quoted one of Baltazar's lines, accompanied by the narrator's voice: \\"¬´To wake up at the earliest hour, with the flowers. To hear their suave virgin-like voices. To see if my hungry and thirsty fish [‚Ä¶] have been properly fed. And if all things are as they should, in orchards and in waters, as they should be for ever and ever.¬ª But his fish were gone, as was the good fairy, as was the pond of the water of life, of the water of death. And all of them had gone out of sight. He could hear them neighing and clattering at the gates, far away.\\" One of the most influential works in this series was √énchide ochii »ôi vei vedea Ora»ôul. Cernat called it: \\"a refined musical poem, apparently na√Øve, unveiling unexpected depths to the reader, through the means of shared asides\\" and \\"an open game of fantasy filled with love for all that exists, where reality fades into the genuine fantastic of an eternal childhood's unreality, hardly shadowed by melancholy.\\" The story centers on a cosmopolitan city (based on Chimet's vision of Gala»õi), which is disputed between the orange-colored dwarfs who live in the \\"labyrinth forest\\" and the shapeshifting ogre Gagafu, who is assisted by an evil cat named Sultan. The latter two twice kidnap Eli, a girl who serves as protector of the city and is introduced as the narrator's daughter: she is ultimately rescued by the dwarfs, who transport her to their forest; Elli pines for her home, and the dwarfs ultimately decide to let her return. Melancholy, sad musings, and reflections about the fragility of existence are present throughout the book; at one point toward the end of the story, Chimet's narrator confesses: \\"And then I withdrew, tiptoeing, to my canopy in the garden and I asked myself, sitting alone, what the sense of all these events was. And it seemed to me that I discovered it. And I flinched. And I perked up my ears, believing that I heard unheard footsteps outside or the flapping of wings in the sky. But there was no such thing.\\" In Cele 12 luni..., an anthology for the benefit of young readers, Chimet honored fellow children's writer and avant-garde fantasy authors; the authors quoted include Carroll, Ionesco, Saint Exup√©ry, Hans Christian Andersen, Tudor Arghezi, Ion CreangƒÉ, Alfred Jarry, Henri Michaux, Mihail Sadoveanu, Mark Twain, Tristan Tzara, Urmuz, Tiberiu Utan etc. Chimet's own piece was Lamento cu o mare baaaaalenƒÉ (\\"Lament with One Big Whaaaaale\\") seen by critic Marina Debattista as a sample of Chimet's mix of \\"the hero narrative\\" and \\"tiny Surrealist poems\\" into a single original format. The book was richly illustrated, mostly with samples of Surrealist art, from Paul Klee to Max Ernst. It also hosted unusual collages of literary contributions by Christian Pineau and drawings by Arghezi, Mateiu Caragiale, Franz Kafka or Federico Garc√≠a Lorca. Commenting on the anthology's subversive content, Marina Debattista noted: \\"The reader is discreetly engaged into practicing a form of Surrealism, which temporarily frees him from the clutches of reality. The latter effect is significant for the context in which 'The Anthology of Innocence' saw print: in 1970s Romania, the wooden language, like some acid, insidious sea, eroded spirits and clamped down on their natural opening for the miraculous.\\" Legacy For long after the Romanian Revolution, Chimet's work remained unknown to the local public. Paul Cernat noted that, when the Democratic Convention governments allowed private publishing houses to issue school textbooks of Romanian literature, Iordan Chimet's were made more available to schoolchildren. He also recorded that, since the new educational approaches favored familiarizing students with works of universal and modern literature at the detriment of local classics, Chimet was the subject of attacks in the nationalist press (who listed Chimet, alongside authors such as Ende, Edward Lear, Lewis Carroll, Jorge Luis Borges and Mircea Horia Simionescu, not worthy of inclusion in the textbooks). In 2000, Lamento pentru pe»ôti»ôorul Baltazar was reprinted in a Romanian-German bilingual edition, with assistance from the Goethe-Institut. The volume was illustrated with drawings made for this purpose by some of Chimet's friends: the writers Ionesco, Claude Aveline, Richard Bach, Emilio Breda, Odysseas Elytis, and the Mexican visual artists Juan Soriano and Jos√© Garcia Ocejo. It is believed that √énchide ochii »ôi vei vedea Ora»ôul inspired various aspects of Michael Ende's The Neverending Story and that, in Ende's Das Gauklerm√§rchen (\\"The Juggler's Tale\\"), Chimet's Elli became Eli, a simple and poor girl who believes herself a princess. The Chimet-Ende correspondence was published as a book in 1999. In 2006-2007, Chimet also published two volumes of the letters he exchanged with various other authors, including Ursu and Camil Baciu, under the title Cartea prietenilor mei (\\"My Friends' Book\\"). Following a Romanian Writers' Union initiative, a memorial plaque was placed at his apartment bloc in Titan. Ini≈£iativƒÉ importantƒÉ a U.S.R.

He collected fiddle and fife tunes in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia from 1928 to 1963. He is known for his interest in the melodies of traditional music at a time when often only the texts were collected. He introduced the concept of \\"melodic families\\", which are groups of tunes that appears to be structurally related. He traced the origins of many traditional American fiddle tunes back to the British Isles. In addition to his work on fiddle tunes, he was the expert on the use of the fife in traditional American music. He is fondly remembered by former students for his large collection of snuffboxes, which he used regularly. He established the folklore program at Pennsylvania State University, and taught there from 1945 to 1973 He was a fellow of the American Folklore Society, and its president from 1965 to 1966.

It lies about north-west of Pitmedden, and south of Tarves. The castle was built by William Forbes, 7th Laird of Tolquhon, between 1584 and 1589 as an extension to the earlier tower house known as Preston's Tower. Although ruined, the castle has been described as \\"the most characteristic ch√¢teau of the Scots Renaissance\\". It is in the care of Historic Scotland and is open to the public. History Preston's Tower was constructed in the early 15th century, either by Sir Henry Preston or by his son-in-law Sir William Forbes, who inherited part of the Preston lands in 1420, following Sir Henry's death. His descendant William Forbes, 7th Laird of Tolquhon (died 1596), began work on a new castle in 1584, retaining the Preston Tower but adding new, more comfortable accommodation. He also improved the gardens and parkland around the house. King James VI was entertained at Tolquhon in July 1589.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 117. The new buildings were arranged around a courtyard, and included an elaborate gatehouse, and a first-floor gallery. An inscription on the gatehouse records that \\"AL THIS WARKE EXCEP THE AULD TOWR WAS BEGUN BE WILLIAM FORBES 15 APRIL 1584 AND ENDIT BE HIM 20 OCTOBER 1589\\". The home of a \\"Renaissance man\\", Tolquhon was designed for show rather than defence, and was the work of the mason-architect Thomas Leper or Leiper. Leper's distinctive triple shot-holes flank the main entrance, and are also found at nearby Arnage Castle and Dean Castle in Ayrshire. Also unusual is the stone tilework in the main hall. After William Forbes' death his descendants continued to occupy Tolquhon until 1718, when they were forced to move out due to debts incurred by the failure of the Darien scheme. The castle subsequently decayed and is now a ruin. It is in the guardianship of Historic Scotland and is open to the public. Tolquhon is also a scheduled monument. Description The main entrance is on the north range of the castle, with the Preston Tower forming the north-east corner.

The 188th is equipped with the MQ-9 Reaper. If activated to federal service, the Wing is gained by the United States Air Force Air Combat Command. Overview The 188th Wing is a Remotely Piloted Aircraft (MQ-9 Reaper), Space Focused Targeting, and Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Unit based in Fort Smith, Ark. The men and women of the 188th are able to rapidly deploy and support ground forces all over the world. Units The 188th Wing consists of the following 4 groups, each of which has multiple squadrons, flights and sections assigned: * 188th Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Group * 188th Operations Group **184th Attack Squadron - (MQ-9 Reaper) * 188th Mission Support Group * 188th Medical Group History On 22 August 1962, the Arkansas Air National Guard 184th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron was authorized to expand to a group level, and the 188th Tactical Reconnaissance Group was established by the National Guard Bureau. The 184th TRS becoming the group's flying squadron. Other squadrons assigned into the group were the 188th Headquarters, 188th Material Squadron (Maintenance), 188th Combat Support Squadron, and the 188th USAF Dispensary. The 184th TRS was equipped with the RF-84F Thunderstreak. In 1970 with the winding-down of the Vietnam War, the 184th began receiving McDonnell RF-101C Voodoos, replacing the RF-84Fs the unit had been flying for over a decade. The USAF had, however, planned for the RF-101C to be gradually phased out of USAF service in favor of the McDonnell RF-4C Phantom II and the aircraft remained with the 184th TRS for only a brief period of time, and in 1970 was retired. Tactical Fighter Gunsmoke '85\\" exercise on 6 October 1985. F-16Cs Arkansas ANG at Ft Smith 2002 The 188th Fighter Wing in Fort Smith, Ark., welcomed its transition from F-16s to A-10s 14 April. Federal, state and local elected officials along joined unit members to say farwell to the F-16 (foreground) and hello to the A-10 (background). Both pictured planes were flying off the wing of a 189th Airlift Wing C-130 before they returned to their base for an aerial demonstration. F-16 84-1285 Following their withdrawal from the Vietnam War, numerous USAF F-100D Super Sabres were turned over to the Air National Guard. Tactical Air Command realigned the 188th into a Tactical Fighter Group in 1972, and equipping the unit with Vietnam Veteran F-100D and twin-seat F-100F Trainers. In 1979, the Super Sabre was being retired and the 184th TFS began receiving F-4C Phantom IIs to be used in an air defense role. In 1988, as part of the retirement of the Phantom II, the squadron began receiving Block 15 F-16A Fighting Falcons. The first F-16 delivery to the squadron was on 1 July 1988 and the formal acceptance of the F-16 happened on 15 October. On 15 March 1992 the 184th dropped the Tactical name from the squadron as the parent 184th converted to the USAF Objective organization. In early 2001 the 184th FS began to retire its F-16A/B block 15s to AMARC in exchange for F-16C block 32s. They never received any D-models. Because the squadron flew the rarely seen block 32, the squadron became a source for spare F-16s for the USAF Thunderbirds flight demonstration team. In the end the 184th FS never had to give up any of their aircraft as the Thunderbirds took needed aircraft from home based Nellis 57th Fighter Wing. Deployed to Prince Sultan AB, Saudi Arabia (24 October 2002 to December 2002) in support of Operation Southern Watch. In 2005, the 188th deployed nearly 300 Airmen and multiple F-16C Fighting Falcons to Balad Air Base, Iraq, in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. BRAC 2005 BRAC 2005 initially decided to inactivate the 188th Fighter Wing and close Fort Smith ANGB. With a great deal of effort by Arkansas' leaders caused the BRAC panel to change its decision on the 184th FS and give it a new mission. The squadron would still lose its F-16s but in their place would get a total of eighteen A-10 Thunderbolt II ground attack aircraft. One of the deciding factors was Fort Smiths location near Fort Chaffee, a former National Guard training post. On 18 October 2006 the 184th FS began giving up F-16s when two departed for the 194th Fighter Squadron located at Fresno Air National Guard Base, California. By April 2007 the 184th FS had already begun to receive the A-10 from the Massachusetts ANG 104th Fighter Wing and pilots had already commenced cross training in October. On 14 April 2007 the 184th FS marked the day with a celebration 'Viper Out/Warthog In' day. The 184th FS took the opportunity to display their new A-10 paint scheme and to still fly the F-16 but the 184th FS at this point was officially an A-10 unit. Current status Between late March and early July 2012, the Wing deployed 375 Airmen and 10 aircraft to Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. They were assigned to the 455th Air Expeditionary Wing, Bagram Airfield, near Kabul. This was the second AEF deployment for the 188th as a unit since receiving A-10 Thunderbolt II \\"Warthogs\\" 14 April 2007. The 188th's last AEF deployment transpired in 2010 when the unit deployed about 300 Airmen and 12 A-10Cs to the 451st Air Expeditionary Wing at Kandahar Airfield. The Guardsmen remained in Afghanistan until October, flying close-air support in response to ground troops who may be in contact with the enemy, or to escort convoys in particularly hostile areas. When not supporting ground troops, A-10s patrol designated sectors and provided aerial reconnaissance on locations of interest to ground commanders. In three months, Arkansas ANG A-10s delivered more than 60,000 30mm cannon rounds and more than 250 precision munitions on enemy targets. In early 2013 the Air Force planned to realign the 188th Fighter Wing and replace its 20 A-10 aircraft, converting the 184th FS to operate the General Atomics [MQ-9 Reaper] remotely piloted aircraft (RPA). On 7 June 2014, the last A-10 aircraft departed the 188th Fighter Wing. At the same time, the 184th Fighter Squadron was re-designated the 184th Attack Squadron. In late 2014 the 188th Fire Department which supported the fighter wing operations, but also covered the regional airport, was disbanded after over two decades of full-time service.

The Hutchinson Letters Affair was an incident that increased tensions between the colonists of the Province of Massachusetts Bay and the British government prior to the American Revolution. In June 1773, letters written several years earlier by Thomas Hutchinson and Andrew Oliver, who were governor and lieutenant governor of the province at the time of their publication, were published in a Boston newspaper. The content of the letters was propagandistically claimed by Massachusetts radical politicians to call for the abridgement of colonial rights, and a duel was fought in England over the matter. The affair served to inflame tensions in Massachusetts, where the implementation of the 1773 Tea Act was met with resistance that culminated in the Boston Tea Party in December 1773. The response of the British government to the publication of the letters served to turn Benjamin Franklin, one of the principal figures in the affair, into a committed Patriot. Background Governor of the Province of Massachusetts Bay Thomas Hutchinson, author of some of the inflammatory letters During the 1760s, relations between Great Britain and some of its North American colonies became strained by a series of Parliamentary laws (including the 1765 Stamp Act and the 1767 Townshend Acts) that were intended to raise revenue for the crown and to assert Parliament's authority to pass such legislation despite the lack of colonial representation.Knollenberg, p. 54 The laws had sparked strong protests in the Thirteen Colonies. In particular, the Province of Massachusetts Bay saw significant unrest and direct action against crown officials.Danver, pp. 127‚Äì132 The introduction of British Army troops into Boston in 1768 further raised the tensions that escalated to the Boston Massacre in 1770.Danver, pp. 151‚Äì154 In the years after the enactment of the Townshend Acts, Massachusetts Lieutenant Governor Thomas Hutchinson and his colonial secretary and brother- in-law, Andrew Oliver, wrote a series of letters concerning the acts, the protests against them, and suggestions on how to respond to Thomas Whately, an assistant to British Prime Minister George Grenville.Penegar, p. 23 Whately died in 1772, and his papers were turned over to his brother William. Whately, at one point, gave access to his brother's papers to John Temple, another colonial official who sought to recover letters of his own from those papers.Penegar, p. 24 Hutchinson was appointed governor of Massachusetts in 1770 after the critical publication by opposition politicians of letters written by his predecessor, Francis Bernard.Galvin, pp. 178, 180‚Äì182 Over the next two years, Hutchinson engaged in an extended and rancorous written debate with the provincial assembly and the governor's council, both of which were dominated by the radical leadership hostile to Parliamentary authority. The debate centered on the arbitrariness of executive prerogative and the role of Parliament in colonial governance and greatly deepened divisions in the province.Bailyn, pp. 171‚Äì173, 211 Benjamin Franklin, portrait by David Martin, 1767 The Massachusetts debate reached a pitch in England when the colonial secretary, Lord Dartmouth, insisted for Benjamin Franklin, who was acting as agent for Massachusetts in London, to demand for the Massachusetts assembly to retract its response to a speech the governor had given early in 1772 as part of the ongoing debate.Penegar, p. 27 Franklin had acquired a packet of about twenty letters that had been written to Whately.Penegar, p. 27. Penegar notes that there are varying interpretations on how many letters constitute the set at issue. Upon reading them, Franklin concluded that Hutchinson and Oliver had mischaracterized the situation in the colonies and thus had misled Parliament. He felt that wider knowledge of the letters would then focus colonial anger away from Parliament and towards those who had written the misleading letters.Bailyn, p. 236 Franklin sent the letters to Thomas Cushing, the speaker of the Massachusetts assembly, in December 1772.Morgan, p. 187 He insisted to Cushing that they not be published or widely circulated. Franklin specifically wrote that they should be seen only by a few people and that Cushing was not \\"at liberty to make the letters public.\\"Wright, p. 225 The letters arrived in Massachusetts in March 1773, and came into the hands of Samuel Adams, who was serving as the clerk of the Massachusetts assembly.Alexander, p. 150 By Franklin's instructions, only a select few people, including the Massachusetts Committee of Correspondence, were to see the letters.Bailyn, p. 239 Alarmed at what they read, Cushing wrote Franklin to ask if the restrictions on their circulation could be eased. In a response received by Cushing in early June, Franklin reiterated that they were not to be copied or published but that they could be shown to anyone. Publication A longtime opponent of Hutchinson's, Samuel Adams narrowly followed Franklin's request, but managed to orchestrate a propaganda campaign against Hutchinson without immediately disclosing the letters. He informed the assembly of the existence of the letters, after which it designated a committee to analyze them. Strategic leaks suggestive of their content made their way into the press and political discussions, causing Hutchinson much discomfort. The assembly eventually concluded, according to John Hancock, that in the letters Hutchinson sought to \\"overthrow the Constitution of this Government, and to introduce arbitrary Power into the Province\\", and called for the removal of Hutchinson and Oliver.Alexander, p. 151 Hutchinson complained that Adams and the opposition were misrepresenting what he had written, and that nothing he had written in them on the subject of Parliamentary supremacy went beyond other statements he had made.Alexander, p. 152 The letters were finally published in the Boston Gazette in mid-June 1773,Bailyn, p. 240 causing a political firestorm in Massachusetts and raising significant questions in England. Content Andrew Oliver, portrait by John Singleton Copley, c. 1758 The letters were written primarily in 1768 and 1769, principally by Hutchinson and Oliver, but the published letters also included some written by Charles Paxton, a customs official and Hutchinson supporter, and Hutchinson's nephew Nathaniel Rogers.Bailyn, p. 226 The letters written by Oliver (who became lieutenant governor when Hutchinson became governor) proposed a significant revamping of the Massachusetts government to strengthen the executive, and those of Hutchinson were ruminations on the difficult state of affairs in the province. The historian Bernard Bailyn confirms Hutchinson's own assertion that much of the content of his letters expressed relatively little that had not already been publicly stated.Bailyn, pp. 227‚Äì228 According to Bailyn, Hutchinson's ruminations included the observation that it was impossible for colonists have the full rights they would have in the home country, essentially requiring an \\"abridgement of what are called English liberties\\".Bailyn, p. 227 Hutchinson, unlike Oliver, made no specific proposals on how the colonial government should be reformed and wrote in a letter that was not among those published, \\"I can think of nothing but what will produce as great an evil as that which it may remove or will be of a very uncertain event.\\"Bailyn, p. 228 Oliver's letters, in contrast, specifically proposed for the governor's council, whose members were then elected by the assembly with the governor's consent, to be changed to one whose members were appointed by the crown.Penegar, p. 32 Consequences 19th century engraving depicting Benjamin Franklin's appearance before the Privy Council In England, speculation ran rampant over the source of the leak. William Whately accused John Temple of taking the letters, which Temple denied, challenging Whately to a duel. Whately was wounded in the encounter in early December 1773, but neither participant was satisfied, and a second duel was planned.Penegar, pp. 22‚Äì23, 34 In order to forestall that event, Franklin on Christmas Day published a letter admitting that he was responsible for the acquisition and transmission of the letters, to prevent \\"further mischief\\".Penegar, p. 34 He justified his actions by pointing out that the letters had been written between public officials for the purpose of influencing public policy.Penegar, p. 35 When Hutchinson's opponents in Massachusetts read the letters, they seized on key phrases (including the \\"abridgement\\" phrase) to argue that Hutchinson was in fact lobbying the London government to make changes that would effect such an abridgement. Combined with Oliver's explicit recommendations for reform, they presented this as a clear indication that the provincial leaders were working against the interests of the people and not for them.Bailyn, p. 243 Bostonians were outraged at the content of the published letters, burning Hutchinson and Oliver in effigy on Boston Common.Penegar, p. 29 The letters were widely reprinted throughout the British North American colonies, and acts of protest took place as far away as Philadelphia. The Massachusetts assembly and governor's council petitioned the Board of Trade for Hutchinson's removal. In the Privy Council hearing concerning Hutchinson's fate, in which the aftermath of the Boston Tea Party was also discussed, Franklin stood silently while he was lambasted by Solicitor General Alexander Wedderburn for his role in the affair. He was accused of thievery and dishonor, and called the prime mover in England on behalf of Boston's radical Committee of Correspondence. The Board of Trade dismissed Franklin from his post as colonial Postmaster General, and dismissed the petition for Hutchinson's removal as \\"groundless\\" and \\"vexatious\\".Penegar, pp. 83‚Äì97 Parliament then passed the so-called \\"Coercive Acts\\", a package of measures designed to punish Massachusetts for the tea party.Penegar, p. 18 Hutchinson was recalled, and the Massachusetts governorship was given to the commander of British forces in North America, Lieutenant General Thomas Gage. Hutchinson left Massachusetts in May 1774, never to return.Hosmer, pp. 314‚Äì315 Andrew Oliver suffered a stroke and died in March 1774.Bell, p. 516 Thomas Pownall, who may have given Franklin the letters Gage's implementation of the Coercive Acts further raised tensions that led to the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War in April 1775.Fischer, pp. 41ff Franklin, who had been politically neutral with respect to the colonial radicals prior to his appearance before the Board of Trade, returned to America in early 1775, committed to independence.Isaacson, pp. 284‚Äì291 He went on to serve in the Second Continental Congress and became a leading figure in the American Revolution.Isaacson, pp. 291ff Franklin's source A number of candidates have been proposed as the means by which Franklin obtained the letters. John Temple, despite his political differences with Hutchinson, apparently managed convince the latter in 1774 that he was not involved in their acquisition. He, however, claimed to know who was involved but refused to name him because that would \\"prove the ruin of the guilty party.\\"Penegar, p. 173 Several historians (including Bernard Bailyn and Bernard Knollenberg) have concluded that Thomas Pownall was the probable source of the letters. Pownall was Massachusetts governor before Francis Bernard, had similar views to Franklin on colonial matters and had access to centers of colonial administration through his brother John, the colonial secretary.Penegar, p. 174 Other individuals have also been suggested, but all appear to have an only tenuous connection to Franklin or to the situation. The historian Kenneth Penegar believes the question will remain unanswerable unless new documents emerge to shed light on the episode.Penegar, pp. 176‚Äì178 ReferencesSources     * Further reading * 1774 London printing of documents of the affair, including the letters of Hutchinson and Oliver, the Massachusetts petitions, Franklin's admission he sent the letters, and Alexander Wedderburn's speech against Franklin.

Origins He was the son and heir of Sir William Carew (died 1538) of Mohuns Ottery near Luppitt in Devon by his wife Joane Courtenay, second daughter of Sir William I Courtenay (died 1485) of Powderham, Sheriff of Devon in 1488.Vivian, Heralds' Visitation of Devon, 1895, p.135, pedigree of Carew; p.246, pedigree of Courtenay The exact date of George Carew's birth is unknown, but it is thought to have been between 1497 and 1504. Childhood George and his brother Peter Carew were sent to be educated in the household of their mother's (distant) cousin Henry Courtenay, 1st Marquess of Exeter. There they learned from adventurous relatives like their uncle Gawen Carew and kinsman Nicholas Carew, the latter of whom was later arrested and executed for treason. Youth Carew trained in the law, but swiftly became bored and in 1526 was in Blois, France, seeking service with Louise of Savoy, the French Regent. This attempt to serve a foreign power came to nothing, and was pardoned by King Henry VIII in November of the same year. The King also overlooked his youthful indiscretions with the followers of Elizabeth Barton and encouraged responsible behaviour in the young man. Career Carew became interested in politics in the early 1530s and briefly sat in 1529 as a Member of Parliament for DevonHistory of Parliament biography and later served as High Sheriff of Devon (for 1536 and 1542), during which period he was knighted. Carew was also married for the first time during the 1530s, to Thomasine Pollard, daughter of Sir Lewis Pollard (c. 1465 ‚Äì 1540), Justice of the Common Pleas.Carew, Sir George, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, J. P. D. Cooper, Retrieved 10 November 2007 In 1537, Carew was given his first sea commission, serving in the English Channel under Sir John Dudley during operations against pirates. In the following year 1538 he inherited his father's estates and returned to Devon to serve as Justice of the Peace. In 1539 Carew's wife Thomasine Pollard died and he again entered the King's service, taking over the strategically vital fort of Rysbank in the Calais Pale. The fort's previous commander and Carew's kinsman Nicholas Carew had paid with his life for his machinations against the King. George Carew was disgusted with the poor state of readiness and repair in which he found the fort and set about effecting repairs and became involved in the administration of Calais under its Deputy Arthur Plantagenet, 1st Viscount Lisle. Government service Carew took pains during this period to distance himself from the Roman Catholic upbringing he had in the household of the Marquess of Exeter and openly supported Protestant groups who had fled to Calais after persecution elsewhere in Europe. His stance on this issue brought admiration from several contemporaries, including John Foxe. Carew was with the deputation which met Anne of Cleves in December 1539 and the following year he was briefly arrested and questioned in relation to a plan to hand Rysbank over to the French, a plot in which Lisle was implicated but Carew apparently was not. In the late autumn of 1540 Carew remarried, to Mary Norris, daughter of the courtier Sir Henry Norreys of Berkshire, and the couple settled at Polsloe Priory near Exeter. Carew had taken his position seriously, and was rewarded with a second term as sheriff in 1542 and was appointed Steward of the possessions of the Marquis of Exeter, a role with annual salary of ¬£30. Two years later in 1544 he was made lieutenant of the Gentlemen Pensioners and was awarded the large salary of ¬£365 a year. Apparently bored with Rysbank and political life, in the summer of 1543 Carew applied to join the army of Sir John Wallop in Flanders as a lieutenant general of horse. Although Carew was an accomplished jouster, he was tactically inexperienced and learned the military arts through his position on Wallop's army council. With his brother Peter, George Carew saw action in skirmishes outside the French-held towns of Th√©rouanne and Landrecies during Wallop's campaigns against those towns. At Landrecis, Carew twice came close to disaster, almost being killed by a sniper's bullet during the summer and in November actually being captured after pursuing a fleeing band of French cavalry too far and finding himself isolated. He was soon freed however at the express request of King Henry VIII and was returned to the English army. In 1544 Carew raised twenty soldiers to join Wallop's campaign against Boulogne and was also given a subordinate naval command under Dudley in the English Channel. Drowning in the Mary Rose Battle of the Solent, at which Carew lost his life. \\"Cowdray engraving\\" c. 1545 In July 1545, with a French invasion expected, Carew was summoned to King Henry VIII's council of war aboard his flagship Great Harry in Portsmouth. There Carew was appointed Vice-Admiral in charge of the fleet in Portsmouth and presented with a golden whistle as symbol of office. The French fleet landed on the Isle of Wight the same day and shortly afterwards sailed for Portsmouth. The French force greatly outnumbered the English, comprising 175 ships including 25 great galleys. Carew, as captain of the Mary Rose, the vice-flagship of the English carrack fleet, sailed to confront them and met with disaster. Though it may never be known exactly why the Mary Rose sank in the entrance to Portsmouth harbour on 19 July 1545, it is believed that water entered open gunports after firing a broadside and the ship went down in minutes. The report that Carew's last words called out to his uncle Gawen Carew aboard an accompanying ship, that \\"I have the sort of knaves I cannot rule\\", may indicate command and discipline problems. Carew had only taken command of the ship that same day and his authority was far from established. The dangerous combination of winds, tides and shallows makes the Solent a particularly hazardous body of water. Modern studies have also indicated that the aging 700-ton warship was dangerously overloaded, with heavy bronze cannon that she was not designed to carry, and nearly 500 men aboard, many dressed in full armour. Forensic examination of the crew's skulls, has revealed that the majority of the men aboard 'Mary Rose' the day she foundered were probably from Southern Europe, maybe mercenaries or prisoners of war. Henry VIII watched from Southsea Castle as the Mary Rose heeled over and sank shortly after joining the battle, and heard the screams of her drowning crew, most of whom were trapped beneath a heavy anti-boarding net stretched across her weather deck. Of the 500 men aboard less than 25 survived and Carew was not among them. His body was never recovered. Despite the disaster, the French fleet failed to engage effectively with the English and turned away to perform minor raids elsewhere on the coast and returned to France in August. Carew's widow was given a job in the royal household as a lady in waiting to the King's daughters princesses Mary and Elizabeth. She later married Sir Arthur Champernowne, and died in 1570. When the Mary Rose was raised nearly 450 years later, pewter plates stamped with \\"G.C.\\", Carew's initials, were among the artifacts recovered from the wreck. Marriages George Carew married twice, but left no children: *Firstly to Thomasine Pollard (died 1539), daughter of Sir Lewis Pollard (c. 1465 ‚Äì 21 October 1526), Justice of the Common Pleas. *Secondly, in late autumn of 1540, to Mary Norris (died 1570), daughter of the courtier Sir Henry Norreys of Berkshire. She later married Sir Arthur Champernowne. Sources * Further reading *Kirk, L.M. & Hawkyard A.D.K., biography of Sir George Carew published in History of Parliament: House of Commons 1509-1558, ed.

SVC offers volunteering opportunities to both students and community members in and around the city of Cardiff working with the elderly, young, disadvantaged, and vulnerable. The mission of SVC is to enhance the lives of disadvantaged and vulnerable members of the local community. The charity is based on Museum Place in central Cardiff. There are a team of six staff and a Board of Trustees made up of students who study in the city of Cardiff and community members.  History  Student volunteering in Cardiff can be traced back to 1969 when students at Cardiff University became volunteers at Ely Hospital, a hospital for people who had learning disabilities. In 1971, a branch of Student Community Action (SCA) was formed by students of Cardiff University. Students provided support that enabled the people to develop both social and practical skills and gain confidence, and in 1974 went on to start Cardiff University Social Services (CUSS), now Innovate Trust, who set up the first Supported House for people with learning disabilities in the country. CUSS continued to work closely with SCA, who focused its areas of work on disadvantaged adults and children living in Cardiff. In 2001, the opportunity arose for the formation of a partnership between Innovate Trust and SCA. Supported by the University Union and Innovate Trust, and funded by several organisations, the formation of Student Volunteering Cardiff (SVC) allowed the vision of the original students of both organisations to be carried forward to benefit further generations of Cardiff people. In 2015 SVC moved premises from the Cardiff University Students‚Äô Union, where they were previously based, to 5-7 Museum Place. At this time, SVC also opened up their volunteering opportunities to members of the Cardiff community, as well as students from other universities across Cardiff, in addition to Cardiff University.

Located in Downtown San Jose, it was designed by Pritzker Prize- winning architect Richard Meier in a Postmodern style. It consists of an 18-story tower, an iconic glass rotunda, and a city council chamber wing, laid out within a two-block-long public square known as San Jos√© Civic Plaza. The tower rises above the plaza, making it the second tallest building in San Jose. San Jose has had six seats of government in its history. City officials met in Downtown San Jose from before the city's incorporation in 1850 until the 1950s, when a modern City Hall was built at Civic Center to the north. The current City Hall's construction capped a period of rapid growth for the city during the dot-com bubble. Its opening in 2005 marked the municipal government's return downtown after half a century in an office park setting.  Architecture  A closeup of the rotunda City Hall was designed by Richard Meier, who also designed the Getty Center in Los Angeles, the Barcelona Museum of Contemporary Art in Barcelona, The Hague City Hall, and numerous other buildings around the world. San Jose‚Äìbased Steinberg Architects was the associate architect. Meier's Postmodern design is most influenced by that of Le Corbusier and contrasts with the Beaux-Arts city halls in San Francisco and Oakland. City Hall consists of three wings totaling within a Civic Plaza complex: * An 18-story secretariat tower houses various city offices. At , it was the tallest building in San Jose until Tower 88 surpassed it by in 2008. The tower has a thin footprint of . The mayor's office is located on the top floor of the tower. * The freestanding rotunda rises above the center of the plaza, resembling a planetarium. It has a diameter of , slightly wider than the United States Capitol rotunda. The entire exterior is a glass curtain wall, supported by tension cables and structural steel beams. Mayor Ron Gonzales and other city officials insisted on a rotunda to evoke classical civic buildings. It was originally conceived as a public entrance to symbolize open government. However, by 2015, the space had become a ceremonial entrance, usually closed off to the public but rented out for city and private events about 150 times a year. * The three-story west wing or council wing contains the San Jose City Council chamber, public meeting rooms, and the western field office of the United States Patent and Trademark Office. The council chamber seats 330. Unlike the previous city hall's council chamber, which featured a raised dais, the current chamber is shaped like a lecture hall, with audience seating rising above the dais. A grand staircase leads to the chambers and an elevated walkway that connects the west wing with the rotunda and tower. Like the rotunda, the grand staircase is no longer a public entrance; instead, the public enters from beneath the staircase, and an elevator provides access to the council chambers. The brise soleil on the tower's western fa√ßade City Hall has received LEED Platinum certification for its environmentally friendly design. It is the largest LEED-certified municipal building in San Jose. The tower employs daylighting techniques, including high ceilings, a thin floor plan, and side elevator shafts, to take advantage of an average 300 days of sun annually and reduce artificial lighting costs. A brise soleil on the tower's west side provide shade during the summer, reducing cooling costs. City Hall's tall, thin tower is designed to withstand significant shaking from nearby faults, which include the Silver Creek, Calaveras, Hayward, and San Andreas faults. The building is stabilized by full-height, concrete shear walls on the north and south sides of the building, which are likened to bookends. They are connected to a steel moment-resisting frame across the west and east sides.  History  The current city hall is San Jose's sixth government headquarters building, reflecting San Jose's rise from a small farming town to one of the largest cities in the country.  Early seats of government  The Alcantara Building that was built on the site of the 1797 The City of San Jos√©'s predecessor, , was headquartered at a , a single-story adobe structure built in 1785 near the . Similar to a rural American courthouse, it served as the main administrative building, with an assembly, court, and jail, and offices for the and . Today, the pueblo's original site is marked by a California Historical Landmark marker, part of the Juan Bautista de Anza National Historic Trail, in the Civic Center complex north of downtown. Around 1797, the (settlers) of San Jos√© moved south to higher ground to avoid flooding from the river. A new was built the next year in the middle of the present-day intersection of South Market and Post streets. San Jos√© had by this time become the political center of . On July 14, 1846, during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, Captain Thomas Fallon's men took over the and raised the American flag over San Jos√© for the first time at this location. The event is now commemorated by a statue in Pellier Park. In early 1947, the pueblo's first American school held classes at the in full view of prisoners. San Jose City Hall in 1854 San Jose was incorporated as one of California's first cities on March 27, 1850. Mayor Josiah Belden convened the city council for the first time on April 13 at the , a short distance from the where the first California State Legislature was in session. The was sold and torn down that July. For the next few years, the city government operated out of rented buildings, including the former state capitol in the plaza. Some of the 's adobe walls may have been incorporated into the Alcantara Building that now stands at the site. Additionally, some of the bricks were used in the construction of San Jose's first post office, now part of the San Jose Museum of Art. On August 14, 1854, a city committee called for proposals to build a permanent city hall. On October 16, voters approved a $20,000 budget for the new building (equivalent to $ in ). The city purchased a site on North Market Street. Levi Goodrich, husband of Sarah Knox-Goodrich, designed the two-story building, which measured . The Common Council (as the city council was then called) met there for the first time on April 16, 1855. Originally, the building had a Gothic fa√ßade and parapet. Around 1870, it was rebuilt with a Greek exterior. The Santa Clara County superior court rented the second floor from September 1, 1860, until a new courthouse was built at St. James Square. The building was destroyed in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. The San Jose Fire Department's Torrent Engine Company #2 was stationed at this site from 1869 to 1951, when the Central Fire Station opened.  Market Plaza city hall  San Jose City Hall around 1896 After the Chinatown at Market Plaza burnt to the ground in 1887, voters approved a new city hall building to be built in the center of the plaza. W. J. Wolcott oversaw construction of the building, which cost $139,482 (equivalent to $ in ). At the height of anti-Chinese sentiment, the city council prohibited the use of Chinese labor, even though the building was located across from the Market Street Chinatown. The city hall was dedicated by Mayor Samuel Boring on April 17, 1889. The brick and terracotta building was designed by San Jose‚Äìbased, self-taught architect Theodore Lenzen based on German, Italianate, and Victorian designs with French Empire detailing. The American Institute of Architects has been critical of the design, which has been called \\"bastard baroque\\" and likened to a \\"gingerbread house\\". The San Jos√© Public Library was located on the second floor. The city jail, with a drive-through entrance and drunk tank, occupied the basement. The building was heavily damaged in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. In 1931, the city commissioned the urban planner Harland Bartholomew to design a City Beautiful civic center within St. James Park modeled on Daniel Burnham's Civic Center in San Francisco. Bartholomew presented his plan on August 6, 1931, calling for new city and county administration buildings, a post office, museums, and a civic auditorium. However, the city failed to raise the necessary funds, while the county, post office, and library opted for their own plans. St. James Park became infamous internationally for the 1933 lynching of two men accused of kidnapping and murdering Brooke Hart. Bartholomew's plans for the park were scrapped, as were subsequent civic center plans in the 1940s and 1950s.  Civic Center city hall  The former City Hall at Civic Center pictured in 2016, after its sale to Santa Clara County During the postwar construction boom, City Manager Dutch Hamann and the business community, led by the San Jose Mercury and News, attempted four times to convince voters to approve a new city hall that would improve San Jose's image as a major city, finally succeeding in 1952. The new city hall would sit on of donated land about north of the downtown area. It would be colocated with federal, state, and county facilities at the Civic Center at North First and Mission streets, near the site of the original pueblo. A $ bond measure (equivalent to $ in ) was approved in 1955 to finance the new building. Donald Francis Haines designed a curved, four-story-tall building with influences from Modern architecture and the International Style. It was one of thousands of Modern buildings built in the city between 1950 and 1970. Construction began in 1956. As the city outgrew the old building, the San Jose Police Department moved into temporary offices. The new , building was dedicated on March 27, 1958. The building was built by Carl N. Swenson Company at a cost of just over $ ($ in ). It was one of the first curtain wall buildings erected on the West Coast during the Modern period. Moving thousands of city employees out of the downtown area exacerbated the urban decay that resulted in part from Hamann's aggressive program of suburban development. Beginning in 1956, city leaders attempted to revitalize the urban core by clearing older buildings for redevelopment. Despite pleas by historian Clyde Arbuckle, the previous city hall in Plaza Park was demolished in June 1958, a move now widely regretted by city officials. The building's cornerstone was placed in the ground about from its original location. Though the park remained in the center of Market Street, the surrounding blocks downtown largely sat vacant for decades. Over the next few decades, the city and Santa Clara County continued developing the Civic Center complex. In 1961, the county opened a seven-story Government Center building adjacent to City Hall, followed by a ten-story, rust-colored east wing in 1974 and the county's Main Jail in 1989. A six-story, annex, designed by Norman \\"Bud\\" Curtis, was added to the City Hall building in the 1970s. The overall building housed 1,100 city employees. In 1987, the Civic Center light rail station opened on North First Street adjacent to City Hall, providing rail access to the downtown area. The building is now considered seismically unsound, and it is contaminated by asbestos. Renovating it would cost $.  Current city hall  The interior of the rotunda In the 1990s, taking advantage of growth from the dot-com boom, the city began planning a return downtown. A new city hall would bolster the urban renewal program that had finally begun turning the vast expanse of downtown parking lots into a retail and entertainment district. It would also consolidate city offices. The city had been spending about $ annually to lease office space downtown, but City Hall's location at Civic Center had become a major inconvenience. City employees had to drive several miles between meetings, and the City Hall parking lot on Mission Street could only accommodate senior staff. On November 5, 1996, voters passed Measure I by more than 60% to authorize the relocation. In August 1998, an urban design study by Sasaki Associates recommended a site along East Santa Clara Street near San Jose State University, with the intention of expanding the downtown core eastward. Later that year, Richard Meier was selected as the new building's architect. Initially, he suggested incorporating a venue for the San Jose Symphony to keep the complex vibrant during weekends. In 1999, Mayor Ron Gonzales and the city council rejected all of Meier's first round of proposals, which called for a low-rise office block, and insisted on a more iconic structure that featured a rotunda. Construction was originally estimated to cost $, and a 1998 budget allocated $ to the project (equivalent to $ in ). However, former mayor Albert J. Ruffo successfully sued the city to stop it from using redevelopment agency funds for the project. A 2002 suit also tried unsuccessfully to keep the city from demolishing the 1894 Fox- Markovits Building to make way for one of the two planned parking garages. The resulting delays in land acquisition, combined with design changes required by city officials, caused the price to jump to $ by 2002 ($ in ), even as the city faced a budget shortfall of over $ after the collapse of the dot-com bubble. The cost overrun prompted the city council to explore leasing the Sobrato Office Tower, which was under construction and awaiting a tenant. Nevertheless, the project broke ground later that year. USPTO satellite office Employees began moving into the new City Hall in August 2005, two years later than originally planned. The building officially opened on October 15, 2005. The project ultimately cost $ ($ in ), possibly more than any other city hall in the country, with the rotunda alone costing $ ($ in ). Due in part to controversies over its construction cost, the building was initially exempted from City Council's 2001 policy of requiring all municipal buildings larger than to receive LEED Silver or higher certification. It eventually received LEED Platinum for Existing Buildings certification in March 2009, becoming the first city hall in the country to receive this certification. In 2011, the city sold the former Civic Center city hall to Santa Clara County for $ to settle a $ county lawsuit against the city for unpaid bills. Starbucks planned to open a caf√© at the complex but pulled out in 2014 amid debate over whether the city should enforce living wage rules at the location. In 2015, the United States Patent and Trademark Office opened a Silicon Valley satellite office in a part of the west wing building of City Hall that had until then been vacant. The office includes patent examiners and Patent Trial and Appeal Board judges.  Artwork  \\"Waterscape\\" The front plaza facing East Santa Clara Street features \\"Waterscape\\", a 2005 water sculpture by Anna Valentina Murch and Douglas Hollis. It consists of a cascading fountain made of granite slabs, boulders that provide seating, and poles that spray mist onto the plaza from above to simulate fog and cool the plaza. The boulders also serve as bollards to protect the plaza against a vehicle attack. The rear courtyard at the end of South 5th Street originally featured a black bamboo grove. A 2005 series of 16 art installations by Andrew Leicester, titled \\"Parade of Floats\\", adorns various sidewalks in the neighborhood immediately surrounding city hall. Each float represents an element of San Jose's cultural and historical diversity. The floor of the westbound City Hall bus rapid transit stop features a collage that illustrates the patent filing process. A , statue of Christopher Columbus was installed in the lobby of the Civic Center facility in 1958 to celebrate the local Italian-American community. In the 2000s, the city moved it to the lobby of the current city hall. On March 10, 2018, the statue was removed from city hall and relocated to the Italian American Heritage Foundation following a petition by the Brown Berets.  Events  2017 San Jose Women's March The front plaza facing East Santa Clara Street was designed as a public square. It regularly attracts political demonstrations. In 2007 and 2008, it was the site of protests and a hunger strike by regarding city council's initial refusal to name the city's main Vietnamese business district Little Saigon. Local versions of national rallies have been held at City Hall, including an immigration reform protest in 2006; Occupy San Jos√© in 2011; Not My Presidents Day, the Tax March, the March for Science, and the Women's March in 2017; March for Our Lives and Families Belong Together in 2018; and the George Floyd protest in 2020. The previous city hall also attracted political demonstrations, including marches following the police shooting deaths of John Henry Smith in 1971 and Bich Cau Thi Tran in 2003. Civic Plaza attracts relatively little foot traffic apart from organized events, owing in part to heat reflecting off City Hall and a lack of shade. However, temporary art installations occasionally attract crowds from the busier parts of downtown. A light art installation titled \\"Sonic Runway\\" was located in the front plaza from November 3, 2017, to March 9, 2018, as part of the Playa to the Paseo partnership between the city and the Burning Man project. An automated lighting system was installed in the rotunda in June 2017, enabling the tower and rotunda to be colorfully lit to mark special occasions.  Fauna  The City Hall tower is home to a peregrine falcon named Clara, and her current tiercel, named \\"Esteban Colbert\\" after Stephen Colbert, of whom Mayor Chuck Reed was said to be a fan. The original falcons, named Jose and Clara after the city and Santa Clara County, produced three offspring, named Spirit, Hiko, and Esperanza. In 2008, Clara and her then-mate Carlos had three chicks, Cielo and Meyye, both girls, and Mercury, a boy.  Neighborhood  The neighborhood around City Hall Civic Plaza is located on the eastern edge of the downtown San Jose retail area. It is bounded by East Santa Clara Street to the north, South 4th Street to the west, South 6th Street to the east, and a dead end of South 5th Street to the south. The Rotary Club of San Jose maintains a summit center adjacent to City Hall. San Jose State University's main campus and the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Library are located one block to the south across East San Fernando Street. A Lee's Sandwiches store is located across South 6th Street, at the site where the chain began in 1983. The First Presbyterian Church of San Jose is located directly across East Santa Clara Street, and Our Lady of La Vang Parish is located two blocks to the east.  Transportation  The Civic Plaza complex includes an underground parking garage for city officials, as well as a city-owned public parking garage one block to the north. Unlike the Civic Center city hall, the current city hall lacks direct access to freeways. The Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority's Santa Clara light rail station is located two blocks to the west. In 2000, Santa Clara County voters approved Measure A to fund a package of public transportation projects, including a Downtown/East Valley light rail line along East Santa Clara Street that would have stopped at City Hall. However, subsequent budget cuts forced the project to be scaled back to an extension of an existing light rail line that does not serve City Hall. Instead, an Alum Rock‚ÄìSanta Clara bus rapid transit line was built along the street, with a City Hall stop at 6th Street. A Civic Plaza/San Jos√© State University station was also planned as part of the Silicon Valley BART extension. It would have been located underneath East Santa Clara Street between 4th and 7th streets, with station entrances in the vicinity of City Hall. In May 2007, the proposed station was consolidated with the Plaza de C√©sar Ch√°vez station into a single Downtown San Jos√© station between 2nd and San Pedro streets, in order to reduce costs and more directly connect to VTA light rail lines.  In film and television  The City Hall rotunda appears in the 2009 Bollywood film Love Aaj Kal as the corporate headquarters of the fictional architectural firm Golden Gate Engineering. It also appeared in an August 2013 episode of the CBS television series Unforgettable as a New York City auditorium.

Local Security Authority Subsystem Service writes events to the log. The Security Log is one of the primary tools used by Administrators to detect and investigate attempted and successful unauthorized activity and to troubleshoot problems; Microsoft describes it as \\"Your Best and Last Defense\\".The NT Security Log - Your Best and Last Defense, Randy Franklin Smith The log and the audit policies that govern it are also favorite targets of hackers and rogue system administrators seeking to cover their tracks before and after committing unauthorized activity.Protecting the NT Security Log, Randy Franklin Smith, Windows IT Pro, July 2000.

Depending on the version of Windows and the method of login, the IP address may or may not be recorded. Windows 2000 Web Server, for instance, does not log IP addresses for successful logins, but Windows Server 2003 includes this capability.Capturing IP Addresses for Web Server Logon Events, Randy Franklin Smith, Windows IT Pro, October 2003. The categories of events that can be logged are:Auditing Policy, Microsoft. *Account logon events *Account management *Directory service access *Logon events *Object access *Policy change *Privilege use *Process tracking *System events The sheer number of loggable events means that security log analysis can be a time-consuming task.‚ÄúFive Mistakes of Security Log Analysis‚Äù, Anton Chuvakin, Ph.D., GCIA, GCIH. Third-party utilities have been developed to help identify suspicious trends. It is also possible to filter the log using customized criteria. Attacks and countermeasures Administrators are allowed to view and clear the log (there is no way to separate the rights to view and clear the log).Access Denied: Letting Users View Security Logs, Randy Franklin Smith, July 2004 -- intermittently broken link as of 2007-9-27. In addition, an Administrator can use Winzapper to delete specific events from the log. For this reason, once the Administrator account has been compromised, the event history as contained in the Security Log is unreliable.Winzapper FAQ, NTSecurity. A defense against this is to set up a remote log server with all services shut off, allowing only console access.Know Your Enemy: II, Honeynet Project. As the log approaches its maximum size, it can either overwrite old events or stop logging new events. This makes it susceptible to attacks in which an intruder can flood the log by generating a large number of new events. A partial defense against this is to increase the maximum log size so that a greater number of events will be required to flood the log. It is possible to set the log to not overwrite old events, but as Chris Benton notes, \\"the only problem is that NT has a really bad habit of crashing when its logs become full\\".Auditing Windows NT, Chris Benton. Randy Franklin Smith's Ultimate Windows Security points out that given the ability of administrators to manipulate the Security Log to cover unauthorized activity, separation of duty between operations and security-monitoring IT staff, combined with frequent backups of the log to a server accessible only to the latter, can improve security.Ultimate Windows Security, Randy Franklin Smith. Another way to defeat the Security Log would be for a user to log in as Administrator and change the auditing policies to stop logging the unauthorized activity he intends to carry out. The policy change itself could be logged, depending on the \\"audit policy change\\" setting, but this event could be deleted from the log using Winzapper; and from that point onward, the activity would not generate a trail in the Security Log. Microsoft notes, \\"It is possible to detect attempts to elude a security monitoring solution with such techniques, but it is challenging to do so because many of the same events that can occur during an attempt to cover the tracks of intrusive activity are events that occur regularly on any typical business network\\".Security Monitoring and Attack Detection, Microsoft, Aug. 29, 2006. As Benton points out, one way of preventing successful attacks is security through obscurity. Keeping the IT department's security systems and practices confidential helps prevent users from formulating ways to cover their tracks. If users are aware that the log is copied over to the remote log server at :00 of every hour, for instance, they may take measures to defeat that system by attacking at :10 and then deleting the relevant log events before the top of the next hour. Log manipulation is not needed for all attacks. Simply being aware of how the Security Log works can be enough to take precautions against detection. For instance, a user wanting to log into a fellow employee's account on a corporate network might wait until after hours to gain unobserved physical access to the computer in their cubicle; surreptitiously use a hardware keylogger to obtain their password; and later log into that user's account through Terminal Services from a Wi-Fi hotspot whose IP address cannot be traced back to the intruder. After the log is cleared through Event Viewer, one log entry is immediately created in the freshly cleared log noting the time it was cleared and the admin who cleared it. This information can be a starting point in the investigation of the suspicious activity. In addition to the Windows Security Log, administrators can check the Internet Connection Firewall security log for clues. Writing false events to the log It is theoretically possible to write false events to the log. Microsoft notes, \\"To be able to write to the Security log, SeAuditPrivilege is required. By default, only Local System and Network Service accounts have such privilege\\".Auditing Security Events, Microsoft. Microsoft Windows Internals states, \\"Processes that call audit system services . . . must have the SeAuditPrivilege privilege to successfully generate an audit record\\". Microsoft Windows Internals, Microsoft. The Winzapper FAQ notes that it is \\"possible to add your own 'made up' event records to the log\\" but this feature was not added because it was considered \\"too nasty,\\" a reference to the fact that someone with Administrator access could use such functionality to shift the blame for unauthorized activity to an innocent party. Server 2003 added some API calls so that applications could register with the security event logs and write security audit entries. Specifically, the AuthzInstallSecurityEventSource function installs the specified source as a security event source.AuthzInstallSecurityEventSource Function, Microsoft.

He was named to the position on September 25, 2007 by new Pirates President Frank Coonelly.The Official Site of Major League Baseball: News: Pirates hire Huntington as new GM He was relieved of his duties on October 28, 2019. Background A native of Amherst, New Hampshire, Huntington is a graduate of Milford Area Senior High and Amherst College, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree with a major in psychology in 1991. At Amherst, Huntington played baseball for four years; he was named a Division III second-team All-American first baseman and first-team All New England first baseman after his senior season. He earned a Master's Degree in sport management from the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Career=Montreal and Cleveland Huntington spent 16 seasons in professional baseball prior to joining the Pirates. He became Assistant Director of Player Development with the Montreal Expos in 1995. He later moved to the Cleveland Indians, by whom he was employed for 10 seasons, serving first as the Assistant Director of Minor League Operations before becoming Director of Player Development (in 1998), Assistant General Manager (2002‚Äì2004), and finally Special Assistant to the General Manager (2006‚Äì2007).Baseball America: Executive Database Pittsburgh2007 Within two weeks of assuming the Pirates GM position, Huntington made several decisive moves on October 5, 2007: field manager Jim Tracy was fired; the remaining coaching staff was given notice that their contracts would likely not be renewed; and the Senior Director of Player Development, the scouting director, and the Director of Baseball Operations were also let go.http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=3050460.The Official Site of The Pittsburgh Pirates: News: Pirates cut ties with manager Tracy These moves cleared the decks to introduce a wholly fresh approach to scouting, player development, and field management in the Pirates organization. On November 2, 2007, Huntington made clear that he was going to utilize some sabermetric techniques of player evaluation: > We are going to utilize several objective measures of player performance to > evaluate and develop players. We'll rely on the more traditional objective > evaluations: OPS (on-base percentage plus slugging percentage), WHIP (walks > and hits per inning pitched), Runs Created, ERC (Component ERA), GB/FB > (ground ball to fly ball ratio), K/9 (strikeouts per nine innings), K/BB > (strikeouts to walks ratio), BB%, etc., but we'll also look to rely on some > of the more recent variations: VORP (value over replacement player), > Relative Performance, EqAve (equivalent average), EqOBP (equivalent on-base > percentage), EqSLG (equivalent slugging percentage), BIP% (balls put into > play percentage), wOBA (weighted on base average), Range Factor, PMR > (probabilistic model of range) and Zone Rating.As if to back up this > emphasis, in mid-April 2008 the Pirates hired sabermetrician Dan Fox, who as > a writer for The Hardball Times and Baseball Prospectus had earned a > reputation for his careful analyses of team defense, baserunning, and > pitching.

Succinctly stated, we believe that a combination of quality > objective and subjective analysis will allow us to maximize our probability > of success and to make the best possible decisions.The Official Site of > Major League Baseball: News: Q&A with Neal Huntington A few days later, on November 5, he named John Russell as the new field manager of the Pittsburgh Pirates. On November 7 he announced Greg Smith as the new scouting director, Kyle Stark as director of player development, and Bryan Minniti as director of baseball operations.The Official Site of The Pittsburgh Pirates: News: Huntington fills out front-office staff The new management team did not move quickly to make personnel changes at the player level, however. One month before the opening of Spring training in 2008, all but seven of the players on their 40-man roster had been in the Pirates organization in 2007. Three major factors appear to have led to this situation. First, Huntington felt that so many players had not performed up to their potential in 2007 that the Pirates were likely to win more games in 2008 if the same players only improved on their 2007 performances. Second, the marketability of many of these players had been hampered in the off-season because of their 2007 performance, and Huntington did not want to trade players at a price that was lower than what he considered their true value. Third, although Huntington did seek an immediate improvement of the team's competitiveness, he did not want to give up players who could contribute to the team's performance over the next three or four years simply to achieve a one-year increase in wins.John Perrotto, \\"Every Given Sunday: Reconstruction in Slow Motion\\", BaseballProspectus.com, January 20, 2008. 2008 During his first season, Huntington made two major trades leading up to the July 31 trade deadline. The first deal sent Xavier Nady and D√°maso Marte to the New York Yankees in exchange for minor leaguers Jos√© T√°bata, Jeff Karstens, Ross Ohlendorf, and Dan McCutchen. In the second deal, Huntington shipped Jason Bay to the Boston Red Sox in exchange for Brandon Moss, Andy LaRoche, Craig Hansen, and minor leaguer Bryan Morris. 2009 Huntington continued the rebuilding during the 2009 season by trading all-star gold glove winning center fielder Nate McLouth to the Atlanta Braves on June 3 for outfielder Gorkys Hern√°ndez, and pitchers Jeff Locke and Charlie Morton. Another big trade came on June 30, when Huntington acquired enigmatic, yet talented outfielder Lastings Milledge and pitcher Joel Hanrahan from the Washington Nationals in exchange for outfielder Nyjer Morgan and pitcher Sean Burnett. Huntington made yet another move on July 22 by trading starting first baseman Adam LaRoche to the Red Sox for minor leaguers Argenis Diaz and Hunter Strickland. On July 29, Huntington swung a seven player deal with the Seattle Mariners that sent shortstop Jack Wilson, the Pirates' most tenured player, and pitcher Ian Snell to the Mariners for first baseman Jeff Clement, shortstop Ronny Cede√±o and three minor league pitching prospects. Later that day, Huntington sent all-star second baseman Freddy Sanchez to the San Francisco Giants for highly regarded pitching prospect Tim Alderson]. After the season ended, Huntington acquired second baseman Akinori Iwamura from the Tampa Bay Rays in exchange for pitcher Jesse Chavez. 2010 The 2010 season saw Pedro Alvarez, the club's top prospect and Huntington's 2008 first round draft pick, make his MLB debut, along with the emergence of other young talents, including Jos√© T√°bata, Neil Walker, and Evan Meek. On July 31, Huntington continued to reshape the Pirates roster by acquiring catcher Chris Snyder and shortstop prospect Pedro Ciriaco from the Diamondbacks in exchange for back-up veterans Ryan Church, Bobby Crosby, and reliever D. J. Carrasco. Even more young players were added to the Pirates system, also on July 31, when Huntington shipped veteran reliever Javier L√≥pez to the Giants for outfielder John Bowker and pitcher Joe Martinez, and closer Octavio Dotel to Dodgers for pitcher James McDonald and outfielder Andrew Lambo. Following the 105-loss season, Huntington hired Clint Hurdle as the new field manager of the Pirates. 2011 Although the Pirates finished below .500 for another consecutive year, the team started the season strong and was in first place in the National League Central by the All-Star break. This was the first time the Pirates had finished above .500 at the All-Star Break since 1992. Much of the success was attributed to good starting pitching performances by Huntington acquirees Jeff Karstens, Charlie Morton, James McDonald, and the newly signed Kevin Correia. In the bullpen, Joel Hanrahan established himself as one of the top closers in the game. Though the offense struggled for most of the year, Andrew McCutchen emerged as one of the game's most exciting and promising young hitters, as well as the Pirates' best hitter. In July, Correia, Hanrahan, and McCutchen were all selected to play for the National League in the 2011 All Star Game. On June 8, the Pirates drafted UCLA pitcher Gerrit Cole with the first overall pick in 2011 Major League Baseball draft. On July 26, the Pirates suffered a heart breaking 19-inning loss against the Atlanta Braves, ending on a controversial call where home plate umpire Jerry Meals called runner Julio Lugo safe at home, although the replay showed that catcher Michael McKenry had clearly tagged him out. Meals admitted that the call may have been incorrect after watching the replay again. This loss appeared to be a turning point in the season, as the Pirates lost 15 of their next 18 games from July 27 to August 14, and at one point, lost 10 games in a row. The Pirates finished the season in 4th Place in the National League Central, with a record of 72-90. In August, the team acquired veteran journeyman Jason Grilli from the Philadelphia Phillies. Grilli made a quick impression, pitching well in high leverage situations and earned manager Clint Hurdle's trust, prompting him to become the team's setup man next year. 2012 The Pirates were more aggressive in the offseason, signing veteran players such as Rod Barajas, Clint Barmes, and starting pitcher √ârik B√©dard. On February 18, the Pirates acquired starting pitcher A. J. Burnett from the New York Yankees for 2 minor leaguers. The Pirates started the 2012 season strong, led by a strong starting rotation, which ranked as one of the best in the majors through the first half of the season. James McDonald, had an All Star caliber start to the season, holding a 9-3 record with an e.r.a. of 2.37 at the All Star Break in July. On the offense, Andrew McCutchen continued his solid hitting as the #3 hitter, driving in 96 runs, and slugging .553 with an on- base percentage of .400. Following a disappointing 2011 campaign, third- basemen Pedro √Ålvarez had a breakout season, belting 30 home runs and had a slugging percentage of .467 in his first full season in the major leagues. The Pirates made a slew of moves to improve the team at the 2012 trade deadline. The Pirates trade former prospect Brad Lincoln to the Toronto Blue Jays for outfielder Travis Snider. On the same day, the Pirates acquired struggling 1st Basemen Gaby S√°nchez from the Miami Marlins for outfielder Gorkys Hern√°ndez and a compensatory 1st round pick in the 2013 MLB draft. On July 31, the Pirates acquired pitcher Wandy Rodr√≠guez from the Houston Astros, for prospects pitcher Rudy Owens, outfielder Robby Grossman, and pitcher Colton Cain. On August 7, with the Pirates were 62-46 and in the thick of the playoff race. However, in a stunning twist of fate, the team lost 37 of its final 54 games, leaving the Pirates with a 79-83 record, and a record 20th consecutive losing season. While no single reason could be attributed to the disappointing finish, many writers highlighted inconsistent starting pitching and an injury to Neil Walker as the main reasons for the collapse. After a brilliant start to the first half of 2012, James McDonald struggled with his command, going 3-5 with an era of 7.08 in 12 second half starts. He was eventually moved to the bullpen and replaced in the rotation by prospects Jeff Locke and Kyle McPherson. The 2012 Pirates garnered the dubious distinction of being the first professional baseball team to finish a season with a record below .500 despite being 16 games over .500 through 2/3 of the MLB season. On a bright note, Andrew McCutchen finished in 3rd place in the voting for the NL's Most Valuable Player Award and won his first ever Gold Glove and Silver Slugger Awards as a center fielder. 2013 With a record of 337-474 and no winning seasons or playoff appearances, Neal Huntington entered his 5th season as Pirates General Manager determined to be aggressive in free agency and hopefully, to add players and veteran leadership that would stave off another Pittsburgh Pirates playoff collapse in 2013. In the offseason, the team agreed with veteran catcher Russell Martin on a two-year, $17 million deal. Martin, while providing decent offensive numbers, was considered to be a major defensive upgrade over the previous year's platoon of Rod Barajas and Michael McKenry. In 2012, Barajas and McKenry had combined to throw out 19 of 173 baserunners, for a caught stealing percentage of 11%, while Russell Martin held a career caught stealing percentage of 30.25% entering the 2013 season. On December 26, the Pirates traded established closer Joel Hanrahan and infielder Brock Holt to the Boston Red Sox for reliever Mark Melancon, and prospects Jerry Sands, Ivan Dejesus, and Stolmy Pimentel. With this move, the Pirates resigned setup man Jason Grilli to a two-year deal worth $4.5 million, to become the new Pirates closer. Melancon, who was under-valued after a miserable injury-riddled 2012 season, replaced Grilli as the Pirates setup man. On February 8, the Pirates finalized a two-year, $12.75 deal with starting pitcher Francisco Liriano.http://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2013/02/pirates-to-sign-francisco- liriano.html The deal had been delayed two months because Liriano had broke his non-throwing arm in December 2012, and had refused to take a physical. On September 9, 2013, the Pirates won their 82nd game to clinch their first winning season since 1992. They finished the season 94-68 securing the 1st wild card spot in the National League. 2014 Huntington received a 3-year contract extension on Saturday April 5, 2014 which will keep him through the 2017 season. The Pirates finished the season 88-74 and for the 2nd year in a row securing the 1st wild card spot 2015 The Pirates finished the season 98-64 and were again the first Wild Card team. However, they lost the wild card game for the second year in a row. 2016 The Pirates finished below the .500 mark in 2016 at 78-83 and subsequently missed the playoffs for the first time since 2012. 2017 The Pirates failed to reach the playoffs for the second consecutive year. However, the Pirates gave him a four year contract extension. 2018 Before the 2018 season, Huntington traded Gerrit Cole to the Houston Astros for four players.https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/22085338/pittsburgh-pirates-trade- rhp-gerrit-cole-houston-astros This trade was widely viewed at the time as a negative for the Pirates,https://blogs.fangraphs.com/the-gerrit-cole-trade- has-a-perception-problem/ and has only looked worse as Cole emerged as one of the best pitchers in baseball. In the two seasons since the trade, Gerrit Cole has accumulated 12.1 Wins Above Replacement, while the players the Pirates received have combined for 2.9 WARhttps://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/27774413/wish-were-here-non-playoff- teams-most-ex-players-making-noise-october During the season, the Pirates made a major trade with the Tampa Bay Rays, giving up Tyler Glasnow, Austin Meadows, and Shane Baz for veteran pitcher Chris Archer. At the time this was viewed as a relatively even trade,https://blogs.fangraphs.com/the-pirates- made-the-deadlines-biggest-move/ but since then the Pirates are widely seen as having lost the trade, including it being called a \\"fleecing\\".https://www.theringer.com/mlb/2019/7/31/20748255/chris-archer- trade-one-year-later-austin-meadows-tyler-glasnow-mlb-trade-deadline By one measure having given up 5 times as much value as the Rays, and the players the Pirates gave up have combined for 6.4 WAR compared to Archer's 0.7 WAR. David Schoenfield, a columnist for ESPN, wrote \\"Those two epic trade failures have crushed the Pirates' immediate future.\\" The Pirates finished the season with a winning record at 82-79; however they finished fourth in the National League Central and 7.5 games behind the last wild card spot. 2019 Despite making win-now moves like the trade for Archer and Keone Kela the summer before, the Pirates had a quiet offseason in 2019, spending only $7 million on major league free agents.https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2019/03/offseason-in- review-pittsburgh-pirates-10.html The Pirates were nonetheless expected to be contenders in a tight National League Central Division. After jumping out to a 12-6 start, the Pirates spent much of the first half of the season around .500, but went into the All-Star break only 2.5 games out of first place.https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/?year=2019&month;=07&day;=07 Despite an underwhelming rotation, the team's offense was powered by a breakout season from Josh Bell and impressive play from Bryan Reynolds (baseball), who was acquired by Huntington in the McCutchen trade of 2018.https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2018/01/15/andrew-mccutchen- trade-giants-pirates-mlb-rumors-offseason/stories/201801150124 The Pirates fell apart in the second half of the season, going 25-48. In addition to their on-field struggles, the team suffered from problems off the field as well, including brawls,https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/27303252/reds-pirates- brawl-results-40-games-bans fights between players in the clubhouse,https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2019/09/pirates-kyle-crick-injured- in-fight-with-felipe-vazquez.html and the arrest of closer Felipe Vazquez.https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2019/09/felipe-vazquez-arrested- charged-in-florida.html The Pirates finished with a 69-93 record, the team's worst since 2010. Clint Hurdle was fired before the final game of the season, and Huntington initially led efforts to find his replacement. Huntington was relieved of his duties on October 28, a few days after Travis Williams had been named the new team president.

It was developed by Arne Vidstrom as a proof-of-concept tool, demonstrating that once the Administrator account has been compromised, event logs are no longer reliable.Winzapper FAQ, NTSecurity. According to Hacking Exposed: Windows Server 2003, Winzapper works with Windows NT/2000/2003. Prior to Winzapper's creation, Administrators already had the ability to clear the Security log either through the Event Viewer or through third-party tools such as Clearlogs. However, Windows lacked any built-in method of selectively deleting events from the Security Log. An unexpected clearing of the log would likely be a red flag to system administrators that an intrusion had occurred. Winzapper would allow a hacker to hide the intrusion by deleting only those log events relevant to the attack. Winzapper, as publicly released, lacked the ability to be run remotely without the use of a tool such as Terminal Services. However, according to Arne Vidstrom, it could easily be modified for remote operation. There is also an unrelated trojan horse by the same name. Countermeasures Winzapper creates a backup security log, \\"dummy.dat,\\" at %systemroot%\\\\system32\\\\config. This file may be undeleted after an attack to recover the original log. Conceivably, however, a savvy user might copy a sufficiently large file over the dummy.dat file and thus irretrievably overwrite it. Winzapper causes the Event Viewer to become unusable until after a reboot, so an unexpected reboot may be a clue that Winzapper has recently been used. Another potential clue to a Winzapper-based attempt would be corruption of the Security Log (requiring it to be cleared), since there is always a small risk that Winzapper will do this. According to WindowsNetworking.com, \\"One way to prevent rogue admins from using this tool on your servers is to implement a Software Restriction Policy using Group Policy that prevents the WinZapper executable from running\\".

If activated to federal service in the United States Air Force, the 187 FW is operationally-gained by the Air Combat Command (ACC). Mission To provide the nation with a superior F-16C+ Block 30 Aviation Package, RC-26B Intelligence, Surveillance, and Recoinnassance platform, and Expeditionary Combat Support functions organized, trained, and equipped for rapid world-wide deployment, domestic relief and law enforcement operations. Units The 187th Fighter Wing consists of the following units: * 187th Operations Group : 100th Fighter Squadron * 187th Maintenance Group * 187th Mission Support Group * 187th Medical Group History On 15 October 1962, the Alabama Air National Guard's 160th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron was authorized to expand to a group level, and the 187th Tactical Reconnaissance Group was established by the National Guard Bureau. The 160th TRS becoming the group's flying squadron. Other squadrons assigned into the group were the 187th Headquarters, 187th Material Squadron, 187th Combat Support Squadron, and the 187th USAF Dispensary. The unit was flying the RF-84F Thunderstreak. In 1971, the RF-4C Phantom II photo-reconnaissance aircraft was being withdrawn from Southeast Asia, and the 160th began to receive these Vietnam War veteran aircraft. The RF-84Fs were retired and during the 1970s the squadron flew the Phantoms in its aerial reconnaissance mission. Tactical Fighter 160th Tactical Fighter Squadron - McDonnell F-4D-30-MC Phantom, AF Ser. No. 66-7591 In 1983, the 187th was realigned from its photo-reconnaissance mission and converted to a tactical fighter mission, transferring its RF-4Cs and receiving Vietnam Veteran F-4D Phantom IIs. The F-4D Phantoms were part of a batch equipped to use the AVQ-23 Pave Spike laser designation pod and the AGM-65 Maverick ASM in the 1970s. By 1988 the Phantoms were being withdrawn from the Air National Guard inventory, and the 160th began to receive early F-16A/B Block 10 Fighting Falcons and later equipped with Block 30 F-16C/D Fighting Falcons to use in the tactical fighter mission. During the 1990s, the 187th has undertaken an ambitious and successful regimen of participation in many Total Force deployments. These deployments have taken the men and women of the 187th to exercises in South Korea, Norway, Guam, Hawaii, Alaska, and many other stateside locations. By far the most significant deployments have been for contingency operations enforcing United Nations sanctions against Iraq. In 1995, the unit deployed for a 30-day rotation to Incirlik AB, Turkey for Operation Provide Comfort II. The following year, the Wing deployed to Al Jaber AB, Kuwait for Operation Southern Watch. Then in 1997, the Wing returned to Incirlik for Operation Northern Watch. These operations were to enforce the respective northern and southern no-fly zones over Iraq. Global War on Terrorism 160th Expeditionary Fighter Squadron F-16C 87-0336 at Al Udeid AB, Qatar during Operation Iraqi Freedom, 2004. More than 150 US Air National Guardsmen from the 187th Fighter Wing, the Alabama Air National Guard unit at Dannelly Field ANGB in Montgomery, deployed to Romania in August to participate in Dacian Viper 2012, a three-week joint exercise with the Romanian Air Force. After the 9/11 attacks, the 187th performed Combat Air Patrol flights as part of Operation Noble Eagle in the United States. The unit sustained this effort for Operation Noble Eagle for one year following the events of 11 September. The 187th was again called to active duty in January 2003 until April 2003 as part of the largest military mobilization since the 1991 Gulf War. This marked the largest unit activation in the unit's 50-year history with over 500 personnel being deployed along with aircraft and equipment for Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF). The 187th, as an integral part of the Total Force, deployed to Prince Hassan Air Base (H-5) and Shahid Muafaq Al-Salti Air Base, Jordan, as the lead unit, commanding a mixture of Air National Guard, Air Force Reserve Command, Active Air Force and British Royal Air Force units comprising the 410th Air Expeditionary Wing. This marked the largest integration of coalition Air and Special Forces Operations in history with over 3,500 personnel operating out of this location. The 410th's mission was to prevent Iraqi missile launches against coalition forces and neighboring countries. In September 2004, the unit again deployed over 300 personnel with aircraft and equipment to Al Udeid AB, Qatar for Operation Iraqi Freedom. This deployment also marked a significant first for the unit and the U.S. Military. The 187th was the first unit to ever use the GBU-38 Joint Direct Attack Munition in combat. The GBU-38 is a 500 lb global positioning system (GPS) guided bomb which, while being very effective, minimizes collateral damage. The GBU-38 is a precision guided munition commonly referred to as a \\"Smart Bomb\\". This weapon was effectively employed by the 187th in the Battle of Fallujah. In 2006, the 160th Expeditionary Fighter Squadron deployed to Balad AB, Iraq for 90 days and became part of the 322d Expeditionary Fighter Squadron in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF). In 2007, the Alabama legislature requested the National Guard Bureau to allow the Alabama Air National Guard's 160th Fighter Squadron to be re-designated as the 100th Fighter Squadron so the state could honor the legacy of the World War II Tuskegee Airmen. This authorization was obtained from the Air Force and on 12 September 2009, the 100th Flying Training Squadron of the Air Education and Training Command was inactivated. The designation was transferred to the National Guard Bureau by the Air Force and it was allotted to the Alabama ANG. As a result, the 160th Fighter Squadron was inactivated and the new 100th Fighter Squadron assumed its personnel, equipment and aircraft. The 160th Fighter Squadron stood down in a ceremony at Montgomery Air National Guard Base, on 13 September 2007, with the 100th Fighter Squadron standing up and being bequeathed the history, lineage, and honors of the World War II 100th Fighter Squadron and its successor units. In August 2009, the 100th Expeditionary Fighter Squadron deployed 240 airmen and aircraft to Balad AB, Iraq as part of the 332d Expeditionary Fighter Squadron supporting Operation Iraq Freedom. This was the first deployment of the 100th FS to the middle east and over 2,000 hours were flown and Precision Guided Munitions were employed. The unit returned to Montgomery in November 2009. The squadron deployed to Romania in August 2012 to participate in Dacian Viper 2012, a three-week joint exercise with the Romanian Air Force. The Alabama ANG contingent, which included nearly twenty fighter pilots and eight F-16s, exercised with approximately 200 Romanian soldiers, technical staff, and pilots flying six MiG-21 \\"Fishbed\\" fighters at 71st Air Base, located near the town of C√¢mpia Turzii in the northwestern part of Romania. In December 2017, the Air Force announced that the 187th was one of two Air National Guard wings selected for equipping with the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II. The conversion to the fifth-generation jet fighter is scheduled for 2023.

He exhibited his painting on a vintage Mercedes Benz car as a description of beauty of the nature, ‚ÄúEarthly Paradise,‚Äù at Los Angeles Municipal Art Gallery. This piece was named by the art critic Sam Hunter. Glen Ginsberg wrote a description of the car as ‚ÄúHiro Yamagata‚Äôs spirit, the automobile of the 20th century‚Äù for the exhibition. (You can also see the process of making the Earthly Paradise on a movie director, Jonas Mekas's HP.) In this year, \\"Hiro Yamagata‚Äôs all prints collection\\" was published. The Earthly Paradise exhibition was held in Hakone, Venice, Monte Carlo, Montecatini, and Tirino in 1995, Stockholm in 1996, Vienna in 1997 and Rome in 1998.

His piece in this exhibition was held indoors and made by laser reflection of innumerable cubes hanging from the ceiling of two huge cubic structures which was surrounded by holograms. Visitors at this exhibition put polarizing lenses on to see the piece. However, the exhibition was ended sooner that it should have been because of the number of visitors did not increase as much as expected. It was to say that people thought they would see Hiro Yamagata's print works in the exhibition; the description of this exhibition was not appropriate so that they were disappointed. Later on, Yamagata held a laser installation exhibition, ‚ÄúSuper Nova 3‚Äù at COSI Columbus Science Museum in Ohio. Also, he participated in an event, the ‚Äú300th anniversary of Sankt-Peterburg municipal government, a Night of Sound and light,‚Äù to show his laser installation.

In this exhibition, the laser which was coming from a disk shaped object set upon a hill aside the museum reflected and lightened up two cubic buildings‚Äô walls surrounded by holograms which were set outside of the museum. Starting from the exhibition in Yokohama, Yamagata's world of laser installation began to expand in scale. In 2005, Yamagata proposed a large-scale holographic recreation of the destroyed statue of the Buddha at the Archaeological Remains of the Bamiyan Valley, Afghanistan. The proposal included using solar energy saved during the day to power a laser installation after sunset, and was projected to cost $60,000,000. In this year, he showed his laser installation at a gala party which held at Geffen contemporary museum in L.A. Also, Yamagata participated in a collaboration event of laser installation and electrical music, ‚ÄúMETTRIPPIN‚Äù and presented his work, ‚ÄúTheory Six.‚Äù He also participated in the ‚ÄúEarth, Water, Fire and Air Festival‚Äù in the Castle in Cape Town, South Africa where he experimented in a pentagonal shaped castle, installed nearly 200 mirrors and reflected laser all around the building and the city.

It is a deciduous large shrub or small tree growing to tall. The leaves are oval, long and broad, oblique at the base, acute or rounded at the apex, with a wavy-toothed or shallowly lobed margin, and a short petiole 6‚Äì10 mm long; they are dark green and thinly hairy above, and grey beneath with dense grey hairs. The Latin term means \\"soft\\", and refers to the felted leaves, which turn yellow in autumn. The flowers are yellow, often with a red base, with four ribbon-shaped petals long and four short stamens, and grow in clusters; flowering is in late winter to early spring on the bare branches. The fruit is a hard woody capsule long, which splits explosively at the apex at maturity one year after pollination, ejecting the two shiny black seeds from the parent plant. Cultivation and uses Flowers. H. mollis is widely grown as an ornamental plant, valued for the strongly-scented flowers appearing in winter when little else is growing. Numerous cultivars have been selected, for variation in flower colour and size, and in shrub size and habit.Huxley, A., ed. (1992). New RHS Dictionary of Gardening. Macmillan .

If activated to federal service, the wing is gained by the United States Air Force Air Combat Command. Overview A non-flying wing, the 183d Wing is tasked with augmenting Component Numbered Air Force (C-NAF) in both the Air and Space Operations Centers (AOC) and the Air Force Forces staff (AFFOR), A1 to A9. The mission of the 183d Wing consists of supporting the assigned groups and tenant units with traditional military services as well as all services for force sustainment including civil engineering, personnel, logistics, communications, medical, security, family support, and all other host services. Units The primary unit of the 183d Wing is the 183d Air Operations Group (183 AOG). The 183 AOG is capable of augmenting C-NAF staffs worldwide, therefore affording AOG personnel the opportunity to train at various locations - CONUS and OCONUS. The role of the AOG is to assist the AOC in organizing, planning, and executing the \\"air war\\" in a contingency or campaign and assist the AFFOR staff in bedding down Air Force forces in the theater. The 183rd AOG is aligned with Twelfth Air Force / AFSOUTH at Davis- Monthan AFB, Arizona. Other units of the 183 WG are: * 183d Medical Group * 183d Mission Support Group * 183d Maintenance Squadron : Operates the Centralized Repair Facility (CRF) History An 183d F-84F with other ANG fighters in the early 1970s. On 15 October 1962, the Illinois Air National Guard 170th Tactical Fighter Squadron was authorized to expand to a group level, and the 183d Tactical Fighter Group was established by the National Guard Bureau. The 170th TFS becoming the group's flying squadron. Other squadrons assigned into the group were the 183d Material Squadron, 183d Combat Support Squadron, and the 183d USAF Dispensary. The 170th Tactical Fighter Squadron was equipped with Republic F-84F Thunderstreaks. It continued to fly the aircraft throughout the 1960s. The squadron was not activated for service during the Vietnam War, although from 1968 to 1971 many of its personnel were activated and some saw service in Southeast Asia. All F-84Fs were grounded in November 1971, after a 170th pilot was killed when his plane lost a wing during exercises at the Hardwood Gunnery Range in Findley, Wisconsin. The accident was caused by the \\"milkbone\\" joining bolt in the main wing which had been weakened by years of flying and failed in-flight. All RF-84F aircraft were immediately grounded after inspections of other F-84Fs in the Air National Guard found the same issue affected many other aircraft. The problem was deemed too widespread to justify the economic repair of the aircraft, and it was decided to retire the ANG's fleet of F-84Fs and replace them with more modern aircraft. In 1972 the 170th F-84s were given a 2G ferry flight permit to the Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Center at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, the 170th having the distinction of flying the F-84F longer than any other USAF/ANG squadron. In January, 1972, the 183d Fighter Group was the first Air National Guard unit to receive the McDonnell F-4C Phantom II, with its aircraft being Vietnam War aircraft that were returning from Southeast Asia. Along with the F-4C, a flight of RF-4C Phantom II reconnaissance aircraft were received. In 1981, the F-4Cs were exchanged for the F-4D Phantom II. Post Cold War era F-16C block 30 #86-0371 adorned with the USAF/ANG 50th anniversary markings in 1997 The 170th saw its first General Dynamics F-16A Fighting Falcon on 7 June 1989 when two landed at Capital Airport to replace the aging F-4D Phantom II. By 5 May 1990, the 170th TFS was operational with the F-16A. Its mission at the time was fighter attack and was provided the Block 15 for this job. On 15 March 1992 the squadron changed designation from the 170th Tactical Fighter Squadron to the 170th Fighter Squadron when its parent 183d Fighter Group adopted the new Air Force Objective organization plan. During early 1994 the 170th FS started to exchange their Block 15 F-16A/B for Block 30 F-16C/D Fighting Falcon with the big inlet design. Most of the Block 15s were retired straight to AMARC. During the 1990s, the unit conducted numerous overseas deployments, including six to Southwest Asia, two to Denmark, one to Panama, one to Cura√ßao, and one to Thailand. Global War on Terrorism 170th Expeditionary Fighter Squadron F-16C 87-0294 at Balad AB, Iraq, takes off on an Operation Iraqi Freedom mission on 21 July 2006 After the 11 September 2001, attack, the 170th FS increased its capability by obtaining AN/AAQ-28(V) LITENING targeting pods in October 2001. Training with the new pod started immediately and included some internal personnel as some were trained on use of the pod as well as training from the Wisconsin ANG. The purpose of the training was to get ready for deployment in March 2002 for Operation Enduring Freedom. Starting in January 2002 the 170th FS deployed for two weeks to Tucson Air National Guard Base, Arizona for final training with the LITENING pod. Initially the deployment in March 2002 was to be with two other ANG units but this changed due to Operation Noble Eagle air defense commitments. As a result, the 170th FS deployed by itself as the 170th Expeditionary Fighter Squadron (170 EFS). When the 170th EFS arrived it replaced the 18th EFS which was normally based at Eielson Air Force Base in Alaska. On top of duties over Afghanistan, the 170th FS also had to perform air interdiction missions over Iraq in support of Operation Southern Watch. In the very early morning on 17 April 2002 while on deployment in Afghanistan a pilot in a two-ship formation from the 170th FS mistakenly bombed a Canadian force which was practicing live firing of its weapons near Kandahar, Afghanistan. Four soldiers were killed and eight were injured. This tragedy dogged the 170th FS for years and a trial against the pilots began in Springfield. After more than two consecutive years deployed overseas the 170th FS participated in Operation Iraqi Freedom when they deployed to the region in October 2004. BRAC 2005 The 2005 Base Realignment and Closure Commission committee report recommended the retirement of the block 30 F-16 Fighting Falcon, and the inactivation of the 170th Fighter Squadron. Despite challenges by the governor of Illinois in federal court, the aircraft began to be retired, and ultimately the US District Judge stated that there was not enough evidence to support that the region would suffer major harm by the closure of the unit. The last F-16 departed on 23 September 2008, marking the end of the flying mission for the 183d Fighter Wing. Due to the outstanding quality of work historically exhibited by the 183d Fighter Wing, the new mission outlined by the BRAC commission recommended the facilities and notable skill sets of personnel assigned be realigned into a Centralized Intermediate Repair Facility. Current status Since BRAC, the 183d has been given an additional follow-on mission. The Component Numbered Air Force, including an Air and Space Operations Center and an Air Force forces staff, is an aerospace operation planning, execution, and assessment system for the Joint Forces Air Component Commander. It is the primary tool for commanding and executing air, space and cyber power. The 183d Air Operations Group will augment Air Force headquarters staffs in planning, coordinating, allocating, tasking and controlling air, space and cyber operations in a theater of operations. On 2 November 2014, the 183d Fighter Wing welcomed Colonel John Patterson as their new Commander. Colonel Patterson replaced Colonel (now Major General) Ron Paul. On 4 March 2017, the 183d Fighter Wing was redesignated as the 183d Wing (183 WG).

From 1915-1916 during the First World War he commanded the Canadian Expeditionary Force on the Western Front, during which time it saw heavy fighting. Early life Born in 1859 in Capel St Mary, a village in Suffolk, Edwin Alderson was the son of Lieutenant-Colonel Edward Mott Alderson and his wife Catherine Harriett Swainson. He attended Ipswich School from 1873 to 1876. Early military career At 17 years of age Alderson received a commission into the Norfolk Artillery Militia, and at 19 he was transferred to the 1st Foot (later Royal Scots Regiment) on 4 December 1878. He transferred again ten days later, replacing a promoted officer, to his father's regiment, the 97th (The Earl of Ulster's) Regiment of Foot (soon to become a battalion of the Queen's Own Royal West Kent Regiment). Joining the regiment in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Alderson was soon transferred to Gibraltar and later South Africa, where he was detached to the Mounted Infantry Depot at Laing's Nek.Alderson, Sir Edwin Alfred Hervey, Dictionary of Canadian Biography article by Desmond Morton, Retrieved 5 November 2007 Mounted Infantry The Mounted Infantry Depot was a post where young officers could be stationed, forming a ready reserve of young, educated officers available as volunteers for staff or command positions in African colonial campaigns. It was whilst attached to this post that Alderson saw service in the First Boer War in 1881 in the Transvaal. The following year, Alderson served in the 1882 Anglo-Egyptian War, fighting at the battles of Kassassin and Tel-el-Kebir. Two years later, he was attached to the Mounted Camel Regiment during the failed expedition to relieve Khartoum and rescue General Gordon. During this campaign, Alderson was presented with the Bronze Medal of the Royal Humane Society after diving into the Nile to rescue a drowning soldier.Alderson, Brig-Gen Edwin Alfred Hervey, Anglo- African Who's Who and Biographical Sketchbook, 1907, Walter H. Willis, Retrieved 12 November 2007 For his service in these campaigns, Alderson was promoted to Captain and was stationed at Aldershot with the European Mounted Infantry Depot. The same year he married the daughter of the vicar of Syresham, Northamptonshire,Marriage certificate 5 May 1886, General Registration Office, district of Brackley, Northamptonshire. His father-in- law, Oswald Pattison Sergeant, became Rector of Chesterton, Oxfordshire, in 1889. a Miss Alice Mary Sergeant. The next ten years of Alderson's career were spent on staff duties and with his old regiment in England and Ireland. He also undertook training at the Staff College, Camberley, and in 1896 was sent to Mashonaland as a commander of a regiment of local troops during the Second Matabele War. Following the campaign's successful conclusion he returned to Aldershot and published his first book, \\"With the Mounted Infantry and the Mashonaland Field Force, 1896\\", an account of the war and a thesis on the tactical uses of mounted infantry. A second book on military tactics followed in 1898 called The Counter-attack. His third book, \\"Pink and scarlet\\" was published in 1900 and was another tactical treatise concerning the relationship between fox-hunting and the cavalry, and the connection that these gentlemanly and military concerns had in training young officers and developing innovations in cavalry tactics. In 1908, he released a compilation of notes made on campaign entitled Lessons from 100 notes made in peace and war. Second Boer War In 1900, shortly after the outbreak of the Second Boer War, Alderson returned to South Africa to command the Mounted Infantry against the Afrikaner forces. His experience with mounted infantry made him suitable for this role in fighting the highly mobile horsed Boer Commandos, as they moved in the latter part of the conflict to a strategy of hit and run attacks upon the British Expeditionary Force in South Africa. Alderson was instrumental in forming British counter-tactics and used his brigade to good effect against the Afrikaners, the troops under his command including two battalions of Canadian Mounted Rifles. The force was under the overall command of experienced British soldier Edward Hutton, previously General-Officer- Commanding the Canadian Militia, who became a lifelong friend of Alderson's. Among the Canadian troopers Alderson was a popular commander, being preferred to the tactless Hutton by the Commander of the 2nd Canadian Mounted Rifles, and in 1901 the then Governor General of Canada, Lord Minto, unsuccessfully petitioned the British government to have Alderson brought to Canada as G.O.C. of its Militia. He participated in the battles of Paardeberg and Driefontein as well as the relief of Kimberley and the capture of Bloemfontein and Pretoria. The result of Alderson's contribution in these campaigns was to be rewarded with confirmation as a brigadier general, appointment as a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) and to receive the ceremonial post of Aide-de- Camp to Queen Victoria (who died the same year). By 1901, Alderson's innovations had resulted in several victorious operations, and in July that year he was appointed Inspector General of Mounted infantry in the Natal District.Hart‚Ä≤s Army list, 1903 He was mentioned in despatches several times (including by Lord Roberts dated 31 March 1900, and by Lord Kitchener dated 23 June 1902), and received the Queen's South Africa Medal. After the end of the war in June 1902, Alderson stayed in South Africa another couple of months, returning home on the SS Scot in November. 1902‚Äì1914 In 1903 he was given command of the British 2nd Infantry Brigade at Aldershot, and in 1906 was promoted to the rank of major general. Two years later he was posted to India to command the 6th (Poona) Division based in Poona. In 1912 he returned to England in semi-retirement on half-pay, later becoming a Master of foxhounds in the South Shropshire Hunt, and developing an enthusiasm for yachting. First World War Photo of Alderson, c. 1915 At the outbreak of the First World War in the summer of 1914, Alderson was placed in charge of the 1st Mounted Division and all troops in the counties of Norfolk and Suffolk.Owen, C. V.. \\"Alderson, Sir Edwin Alfred Hervey (1859‚Äì1927), rev. James Lunt\\". Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (2004 ed.). Oxford University Press. . Retrieved 6 September 2016. However he was given larger duties when he was appointed by Lord Kitchener to lead the Canadian Expeditionary Force because of his experience with the Canadians in South Africa. Soon after his appointment he came into conflict with Sir Sam Hughes, Canadian Minister of Militia. Hughes had preceded his men and insisted that the Canadian contingent was not only fully trained and battle ready but also equipped with the best weaponry available. Alderson however, after reviewing the Canadian formation was concerned about its combat readiness, particularly regarding some of its commissioned officers, who appeared to owe their positions to political connections rather than through professional military qualifications, the degree of training of the troops had received, and the mechanically temperamental Ross rifle, a weapon personally approved by Hughes. During training on Salisbury Plain, Alderson made some headway in toughening the Canadian troops encamped in the wet, autumn weather, and dismissed some commissioned officers appointed at Hughes' discretion, whom he thought were incompetent. When Hughes' representative in England, Colonel John Wallace Carson, secured preferential accommodation for the Canadian soldiers at the expense of a British Army brigade, Alderson refused the barracks and in doing so, drew personal hostility from both Carson and Hughes upon himself. Carson wrote to the Canadian Prime Minister Robert Laird Borden that Alderson \\"does not treat our men with a firm iron hand covered with the velvet glove which their special temperaments require\\". Battle of 2nd Ypres The Canadian Division sailed from England and landed in France in February 1915, and was briefly initiated to trench warfare on the periphery of the Battle of Neuve Chapelle in March 1915, before being attached to the British 2nd Army, under the command of Sir Horace Smith-Dorrien, in the Belgian town of Ypres. It was in front of Ypres on 22 April 1915 that the Canadians bore the brunt of the opening by the Imperial German Army of the 2nd Battle of Ypres, presaged by the first use in history of poison gas as a military weapon. At 5.00 pm the Germans began heavily shelling the French trenches adjoining the Canadian Division's sector, and the Canadians and the French Algerian troops stationed next to them saw a fog traveling across no-mans land towards their positions, which also concealed the advance of German forces behind it wearing gas masks. The fog was chlorine gas.90 Years and Counting , Military Communications and Electronics Museum, Kingston, Ontario, Retrieved 5 November 2007 The Algerians broke and fled, suffering over 6000 casualties in a matter of minutes, and the Canadians were consequently forced to defend twice the length of the front line they had vacated.Who's Who: Sir Edwin Alderson, First World War.com, Retrieved 5 November 2007 Although the Canadian Division held on for more than two days, ground was lost to the attacking Germans, and the Canadian Division suffered over 50% casualties (nearly 6,000 troops). For Alderson the battle had been a failure. Although his troops had held the line, he had found himself out of touch with the action at times during its course, and unable to get accurate information about the situation. At one stage he had been commanding 33 battalions across several miles of front line with no central co-ordination and great confusion between his distant headquarters and the trenches. In addition the Ross rifles had proved almost useless in battle, and some of Canadian officers had performed poorly in their first battle. In particular Brigadier-General Richard Turner, commander of the 3rd Brigade, and Turner's brigade-major, Colonel Garnet Hughes, the son of Sam Hughes, caused havoc when on the second day of the battle they unilaterally withdrew the 3rd Brigade from the front line in the process opening up a 4000-yard gap in the British front, through which the Germans briefly threatened the defence of the Ypres Salient as a whole. Colonel Carson however, who reported personally to Hughes, downplayed the mishaps, and blamed the Division's heavy casualties on Alderson's leadership, indicating that it had only been saved from annihilation by the actions of Turner and Hughes. Ross rifle controversy The controversial Ross rifle The Canadian situation worsened at the Battle of Festubert in May 1915, when it failed to make any headway against the Germans despite suffering nearly 2,500 casualties. Another operation a month later, the Second Battle of Givenchy, cost 366 casualties for no appreciable gain. Despite this, Alderson was promoted to command the entire expeditionary force on the Western Front, now titled the Canadian Corps, when a second division of it arrived at the front late in 1915. However Sam Hughes increasingly opposed Alderson's position in Canadian political circles, taking particular offense at Alderson's refusal to accept promotions made by Hughes or Carson of untried Canadian officers, and instead promoting veteran British officers in their place, and Alderson's opposition to the continued use by the Canadian divisions of the Ross rifle. By early 1916 it had become clear to the troops using it that the mechanism of the Ross rifle was useless, and in some circumstances dangerous to soldiers using it in the conditions of the trenches, and its incompatibility with the British Lee‚ÄìEnfield rifle meant that the Canadian troops were continually running out of ammunition. Hughes however had invested great political capital in the weapon and refused to countenance a switch to the .303 calibre Lee-Enfield. The matter reached a head when Alderson, newly knighted as a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath, circulated a document listing ten deficiencies with the rifle and claiming 85% of Canadian soldiers no longer wished to use it. Hughes in response sent letters to 281 senior military figures backing the Ross, and attacking Alderson's character. Alderson responded by ordering all subordinate commanders to prepare reports on the efficiency of the Ross in the field. Carson, on its receipt, sent a copy of this order back to Hughes, along with a note from Turner stating that \\"action is being delayed too long as regards Alderson\\". Battle of St. Eloi craters Turner had his own reasons for wanting Alderson removed from the post of commanding the Canadian Expeditionary Force following the Actions of St Eloi Craters in March-April 1916. After British troops had taken a large crater near the ruins of the Belgian town of St Eloi, a brigade of Turner's division was ordered to hold the gain against German counter-attacks. Due to mishandling of the Canadian forces by Turner and Brigadier-General Huntly Ketchen, German units succeeded in overrunning the crater, causing 1400 Canadian casualties in the process and recapturing trenches around the crater, negating the gains made at heavy cost just a few days before. Sources are divided over who was responsible for the defeat, some retrospectively blaming Alderson as overall commander. The Dictionary of Canadian Biography however indicates that Turner and Ketchen were primarily responsible, a stance seemingly corroborated by the actions subsequently of Plumer. Sir Herbert Plumer, the commander of British 2nd Army commanding the front, demanded Ketchen's immediate dismissal, and when Turner claimed that if Ketchen was dismissed he would resign, Alderson sought his dismissal as well. Both officers were supporters of Sam Hughes, who made it clear in no uncertain terms to the British Expeditionary Force's Commander-in- Chief, General Sir Douglas Haig, that if Turner was dismissed then the British Government could no longer rely on Canadian support. Haig's solution to this diplomatic crisis was a compromise. Alderson, whom Haig had lost confidence in for the defeat at the St. Eloi craters action, was appointed to a nominal newly created post of \\"Inspector-General of Canadian Forces\\", and Sir Julian Byng was appointed in his place in command of the Canadian Corps, supported by Sir Arthur Currie, who had succeeded Alderson to the command of the 1st Canadian Division. In exchange, Haig finally got rid of the Ross rifle, all Canadian troops being issued with Lee‚ÄìEnfields in preparation for the upcoming Battle of the Somme. Alderson was not initially aware of the purely nominal nature of his new position, and with it the practical end of his field career, and when he requested a staff car for its duties he was informed that the post did not require one to be issued. In September 1916 he was withdrawn from the attachment to the Canadian Expeditionary Force and appointed to the Staff Post of Inspector of Infantry in the British Army, which he retained until 1920 when he retired from active service at the age of 61 years. Last years Alderson enjoyed an active retirement, becoming Colonel Commandant of the Royal West Kent Regiment and pursuing hunting and yachting with fervour, being an active master of foxhounds of the South Shropshire Hunt and member of the Royal Norfolk and Suffolk Yacht Club. He was also very concerned that the growing popularity of motor sports would result in the demise of these traditional pastimes and expended much energy promoting them. He lived in his final years on a houseboat moored in Oulton Broad, Death Alderson died on 14 December 1927 at the Royal Hotel, Lowestoft of a sudden heart attack at the age of 68 years. His body was buried at Chesterton, Oxfordshire. He was survived by his wife who arranged for his private papers to be given to the nation. They are currently stored at British Library, and at the National Archives of Zimbabwe.Alderson, Sir Edwin Alfred Hervey, National Register of Archives, Retrieved 5 November 2007 Reputation Alderson retained strong feelings about his treatment at the hands of Hughes and his allies, commenting to a friend that \\"Canadian politics have been too strong for all of us\\". Nonetheless, he was well liked by the men he commanded and was remembered in The Times on his death as \\"An Englishman of a fine type\\" and that \\"the affection which he inspired in all who knew him was great\\". The Dictionary of Canadian Biography recalls him as \\"A decent, honourable, unimaginative man, [who] had been more faithful to the interests of Canadian soldiers than their own minister\\". Another biographer, Tabitha Marshall, wrote (2014) that the conflict between Hughes and Alderson \\"likely affected not only his career but also his place in Canadian history.

Ideas from Mathematics have been used as inspiration for fiber arts including quilt making, knitting, cross-stitch, crochet, embroidery and weaving. A wide range of mathematical concepts have been used as inspiration including topology, graph theory, number theory and algebra. Some techniques such as counted-thread embroidery are naturally geometrical; other kinds of textile provide a ready means for the colorful physical expression of mathematical concepts. Quilting The IEEE Spectrum has organized a number of competitions on quilt block design, and several books have been published on the subject. Notable quiltmakers include Diana Venters and Elaine Ellison, who have written a book on the subject Mathematical Quilts: No Sewing Required. Examples of mathematical ideas used in the book as the basis of a quilt include the golden rectangle, conic sections, Leonardo da Vinci's Claw, the Koch curve, the Clifford torus, San Gaku, Mascheroni's cardioid, Pythagorean triples, spidrons, and the six trigonometric functions.. Knitting and crochet Cross-stitch counted-thread embroidery Knitted mathematical objects include the Platonic solids, Klein bottles and Boy's surface. The Lorenz manifold and the hyperbolic plane have been crafted using crochet.}.. Knitted and crocheted tori have also been constructed depicting toroidal embeddings of the complete graph K7 and of the Heawood graph.. The crocheting of hyperbolic planes has been popularized by the Institute For Figuring; a book by Daina Taimina on the subject, Crocheting Adventures with Hyperbolic Planes, won the 2009 Bookseller/Diagram Prize for Oddest Title of the Year..

Spinning Margaret Greig was a mathematician who articulated the mathematics of worsted spinning. Fashion design The silk scarves from DMCK Designs' 2013 collection are all based on Douglas McKenna's space-filling curve patterns. The designs are either generalized Peano curves, or based on a new space-filling construction technique. The Issey Miyake Fall-Winter 2010‚Äì2011 ready-to-wear collection featured designs from a collaboration between fashion designer Dai Fujiwara and mathematician William Thurston. The designs were inspired by Thurston's geometrization conjecture, the statement that every 3-manifold can be decomposed into pieces with one of eight different uniform geometries, a proof of which had been sketched in 2003 by Grigori Perelman as part of his proof of the Poincar√© conjecture..

Deliberately designed as an optical illusion, Pennzoil Place's appearance will vary depending on the different locations from where it is viewed. Pennzoil Place is considered significant in architectural circles for breaking the modernist glass box design made popular by followers of Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and for introducing the era of postmodernism. The buildings combined contain of leasable space. The interior offices were designed by M. Arthur Gensler Jr. & Associates, the San Francisco-based interior architecture firm.

It is situated in the southwestern part of Buda, near the Danube, and belongs to District XXII. Budafok was an independent municipality before 1950. The village was known for wine and champagne making. Name Budafok was for many years known as ‚ÄòPromontor‚Äô from the Latin Promontorium, meaning headland, but in 1886, the name was changed to its Hungarian equivalent, Budafok, meaning ‚ÄòBuda cape‚Äô. In 1950 Budafok was merged into Budapest together with Nagyt√©t√©ny and Budat√©t√©ny, forming Budapest‚Äôs district XXII. Budafok-T√©t√©ny is the official name of the district which covers 43 square kilometers and contains Budafok proper. Location The borders of Budafok are: Ringl√≥ √∫t from Horogszegi hat√°rsor - M√©h√©sz utca - railway line towards √ârd - Hossz√∫r√©ti patak - the Danube (including the islands) - H√°ros utca - V√∂r√∂sk√∫ti hat√°rsor - Horogszegi hat√°rsor. History Historically, Budafok was ideal for wine production because of the T√©t√©nyi plateau and its slopes along the Danube. Budafok was home to what used to be the most important vineyard of the greater Budapest area as well as Central Hungary. In 1880, with increasing commercial wine production underway, a union of wine producing and bottling industries created a cellar network hollowed out of the limestone beneath Budafok. The cellar system, 25 kilometers in length and the largest in all of Europe, is still extant today. As such, Budafok is commonly referred to as ‚ÄúCellar Town.‚Äù Today, there is still a huge wine-cellar system with hundred-year old casks; among them the second largest cask in Hungary. The leading historical oenological site in Budafok is the wine cellars of J√≥zsef T√∂rley & Co which can still be visited. Other wine producers still operating there are Hungarovin Rt, Promontorvin Rt and Budafokvin Kft. In 1899, Budafok was electrified by the Tisz√°nt√∫li √Åramszolg√°ltat√≥ Rt.

Moraga was second in command to Juan Bautista de Anza in the 1776 overland colonizing expedition from the region of Alta California which would become part of southern Arizona and northern Mexico, to what is now San Francisco, California. When de Anza returned south to the established base in 1777, Moraga was left in charge of efforts to build housing for the colonists and a military headquarters, the Presidio of San Francisco. Moraga founded the Pueblo of San Jos√© on orders from Antonio Mar√≠a de Bucareli y Urs√∫a, Spanish Viceroy of New Spain.

Buck. The story is about a loving interracial marriage between Gerald and Elizabeth MacLeod, their separation due to the communist uprising in China in 1949, and their separate lives in China and America. Plot summary In September 1950, Elizabeth MacLeod is living in her childhood farm home in Raleigh, Vermont, with her 17-year-old son Rennie. The mailman arrives three mornings each week, and each time Elizabeth hopes for a letter from her husband Gerald in China, where she lived with him until Rennie was twelve. They lived in Peking until the war with Japan, then escaped to Chungking. She and her husband are very much in love, but Gerald, a Eurasian, sent her and Rennie to America because the communist uprising in China made it dangerous for white people. He was half Chinese and chose to stay in his own country. Gerald rarely writes because communication with westerners is banned by the communists. Letters must be smuggled out. Today her husband writes, \\"Whatever I do now, remember that it is you I love.\\"Buck, Letter from Peking, p.12 The letter continues. She locks the letter in her desk. This is the first letter from Gerald in three months. It is mailed from Hong Kong. It is the last letter from him. Elizabeth takes care of her son and the farm. Her parents are long dead. Matt Greene helps take care of the farm. Elizabeth is aware of an American prejudice against the Chinese, and her son is one-quarter Chinese. She misses her husband very much. Over the winter she remembers their days together and the Chinese man that she loves. In the spring, after the sugaring is done, Elizabeth and Rennie go to Little Spring, Kansas, to bring Rennie's grandfather MacLeod, Baba, to live with them in Vermont. He left Peking when the Japanese invaded China. He lives in a herder's shack on Sam Blaine's farm.Buck, Letter from Peking, p.67 He wears Chinese gowns rather than western suits, reads a few old Chinese books, and he has become forgetful. Rennie is embarrassed by how Chinese his grandfather is. Baba dons western clothes for the train ride to Vermont. The local doctor, Bruce Spauldin, believes he has had strokes. Elizabeth remembers he was witty and bright when she and Gerald lived with him in Peking. \\"He is sweet and gentle and easy to live with, and he does not complain.\\"Buck, Letter from Peking, p.75 Elizabeth asks Baba about Gerald's mother, Ai-lan. Elizabeth never knew her. They were married when Baba was advisor to the Emperor. Baba liked his wife Ai-lan, the sister of his friend Han Yu-Ren - but he did not love her. After Gerald was born, Ai-lan became interested in Sun Yat-sen's ideas for revolution. Baba supported the Emperor. Ai-lan believed the races could never mingle.Buck, Letter from Peking, p.83 She moved south, became a violent revolutionist, and was killed in 1930 by the secret police of the Nationalist government.Buck, Letter from Peking, p.91 Gerald saw her infrequently but longed for her. His father would not let Ai-lan \\"contaminate\\" Gerald. The next day, the postman brought a magazine mailed from a post office box in Peking. There was a picture of Gerald's mother on the cover. The magazine was dedicated to a martyr of the revolution. In this way Elizabeth learns that Gerald knew all about his mother, though he never spoke of her. That summer Rennie falls in love. He and Elizabeth talk about Rennie's Chinese relatives. Rennie wants to be all American and forget his Chinese relatives, including his father. He's worried that being part Chinese will keep a girl from liking him.Buck, Letter from Peking, p.104 Elizabeth meets Allegra, Rennie's girlfriend, and does not think her a good match for her son. Allegra's parents leave with her when Elizabeth tells them Rennie is quarter- Chinese. Her husband and Rennie were registered with the American embassy when they were born,Buck, Letter from Peking, p.133 so they are legally Americans. But she knows they must know and they would not approve Gerald and Rennie's Chinese ancestry. Rennie is hurt and angry. She wants her son to find a love as deep as she shares with his father. Rennie leaves home to find Allegra and talk to her. Baba becomes weaker and more childish that summer.Buck, Letter from Peking, p.127 He has strokes. Bruce Spauldin comes to check him. Elizabeth notices that the unmarried Bruce \\"is even-tempered, inclined to silence and meditation, all good qualities in a husband.\\"Buck, Letter from Peking, p.144 Elizabeth realizes that she is alone and lonely, closed off from Peking, though her husband is not dead. She begins to pray. Baba has more strokes and loses all care. Rennie returns and asks, \\"Mother, why did you let me be born?\\",Buck, Letter from Peking, p.155 angered by his Chinese heritage. He goes to Sam Blaine's ranch for the rest of the summer. Before he goes, Elizabeth tells him about Gerald's mother, his grandmother, Ai-lan. Gerald's last letter to Elizabeth included a request that Elizabeth ignored.Buck, Letter from Peking, p.163 Now Elizabeth receives a letter from Mei-lan, sent through a silk shop in Singapore. Mei-lan requested that Gerald write the previous letter to Elizabeth. Mei-lan wishes to care for her husband in Elizabeth's absence and requests the support of her \\"older sister.\\" At this point in the story, Gerald's full last-letter to Elizabeth is printed in the book. He requested her support for his decision to stay in China and protect his wife and child by sending them to America. She sends a letter expressing her love for him and her full support of Mei-lan and their husband, Gerald. Baba becomes weaker, but he remembers that he did not marry Gerald's mother to get a son; he did not want a son. Elizabeth understands how loveless Gerald's childhood was. Elizabeth pulls out Gerald's letters and reads them again. At first he believes in the new government, then his letters become listless.Buck, Letter from Peking, p.177 Elizabeth realizes that Gerald is a prisoner. Baba has another stroke. Bruce treats him, then proposes to Elizabeth. She says she is married. Bruce waits. Mei-lan writes that Gerald is sad and she wants to be friends with Elizabeth. The letter was mailed in Hong Kong, for safety. Elizabeth appreciates the letter from her \\"younger sister\\" but knows that her neighbors would not understand her love for Gerald living with Mei-lan in China. Rennie writes that he is studying physics at a mid- western college and paying his way. His roommate, George Bowen, has a very intelligent and good-looking sister. Rennie promises to come home for Christmas. Mei-lan sends letters to Ellizabeth through friends in Manila and Bangkok.Buck, Letter from Peking, p.194 She tells her how Gerald is doing. Sam Blaine comes with Rennie at Christmas. Baba does not remember Sam or Rennie very well, but the Christmas gathering is happy. Rennie has grown to become a man. Elizabeth asks about George Bowen's sister.Buck, Letter from Peking, p.211 They argue about Gerald's choice to stay in China and Baba's choice to marry a Chinese woman. Elizabeth explains that love is what matters. Sam Blaine proposes to Elizabeth. Baba dies soon after. Elizabeth sees a vision of Gerald dying, then learns from Mei-lan that Gerald died and Mei-lan has a son. Rennie marries George Bowen's twin sister Mary, with Elizabeth's blessing. George and Mary are orphans and love Rennie. Bruce and Elizabeth consider marrying. Elizabeth considers Baba's loveless life a poor example for living, something she will not endorse.

Erwin Panofsky, Ernst Gombrich, and Francis Haskell were strong formative influences. Scott's earliest publications, including his first book, Images of Nepotism make this influence apparent. Later in his career, patronage and audience begin to be of concern, but social history is still his dominant methodological bias. Scott, like many art historians, is committed to the essential role of archival research and the relentless visual analysis of the image; this strength for visual analysis is especially apparent in his work.  Honors  Scott has been a fellow at the American Academy in Rome, the National Humanities Center, the Institute for Advanced Study, and the Stanford Humanities Center. He has served on the Board of Directors of the Society of Architectural Historians (1997‚Äì2000). He was also a member of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. The book, Architecture for the Shroud: Relic and Ritual in Turin was awarded the 2004 College Art Association Charles Rufus Morey Prize.

Now a recreational and historic area within the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Cataloochee was once home to a substantial Appalachian community and Cherokee hunting ground. Geology Palmer Creek in Big Cataloochee Cataloochee consists of three narrow valleys running parallel to one another, and \\"walled in\\" by the high ridges of the Balsam Mountains. To the northwest is Sterling Ridge and to the southeast is Cataloochee Divide, both of which rise above 5,000 feet for considerable stretches. To the southwest is the 6,155-foot Big Cataloochee Mountain along the Balsam crest, which runs perpendicular to Sterling Ridge and Cataloochee Divide. Two lower ridges, Noland Mountain and Big Fork Ridge, run parallel between Sterling and the Divide, and split Cataloochee into the three valleys. The northernmost of Cataloochee's three valleys is Little Cataloochee, which is situated along a stream of the same name between Sterling Ridge and Noland Mountain. Across Noland Mountain to the south is Big Cataloochee, the middle of the three valleys, which consists of fertile bottomland along Cataloochee Creek. The southernmost of the three valleys is Caldwell Fork, which is situated between Fork Ridge and the Cataloochee Divide. All three valleys lay along streams that are part of the Pigeon River watershed. History Historical marker recalling the Cataloochee Trail at the intersection of Jonathan Creek Rd. and Cove Creek Rd. near Maggie Valley The name \\"Cataloochee\\" is derived from the Cherokee term Gadalutsi, which means \\"fringe standing erect.\\" The name probably referred to the tall rows of trees along the ridges surrounding the valley.James Mooney, Myths of the Cherokee and Sacred Formulas of the Cherokee (Nashville: Charles Elder, 1972), 518. The Cherokee used the valley primarily as a hunting ground. Early settlers recalled at least one Cherokee hunting camp in the vicinity of Little Cataloochee Creek.Hattie Caldwell Davis, Cataloochee Valley: Vanished Settlements of the Great Smoky Mountains (Alexander, N.C.: Worldcomm, 1997), 57-58. The Cataloochee Trail, which stretched from the Cove Creek area to what is now Cosby, Tennessee, connected the Cherokee Middlesettlements with the Overhill towns. The modern Cove Creek Road closely parallels this trail.Vicki Rozema, Footsteps of the Cherokees (Winston-Salem: John F. Blair Publisher, 1995), 190-193. By the time the first European explorers and traders arrived, the trail had been worn a foot deep in some places. Bishop Francis Asbury used it to cross the mountains into Tennessee in 1810. The Cherokee gave up their claims to Cataloochee when they signed the Treaty of Holston in 1791. Nevertheless, they continued to hunt and fish in the valley throughout the 19th century. Hattie Caldwell Davis, a descendant of Cataloochee's first Euro- American settlers, recalled that her ancestors spoke \\"fluent Cherokee,\\" and were always on friendly terms with the natives. Davis' great-grandfather, Levi, is believed to have provided aide to Cherokees hiding in the forest during the Trail of Tears period.Hattie Caldwell Davis, Cataloochee Valley: Vanished Settlements of the Great Smoky Mountains (Alexander, N.C.: Worldcomm, 1997), 18, 31. Early settlement Cook Cabin in Little Cataloochee Since the early 19th century, settlers were using the grassy balds along the ridges surrounding Cataloochee to raise livestock. Temporary herding camps were in place by 1814, when Henry Colwell made the first land purchase.Hattie Caldwell Davis, Cataloochee Valley: Vanished Settlements of the Great Smoky Mountains (Alexander, N.C.: Worldcomm, 1997), 17. In 1834, Henry's son, James Colwell (1797‚Äì1867) moved the family to Cataloochee. The spelling of \\"Colwell\\" was eventually changed to \\"Caldwell.\\" The Caldwells were accompanied by the family of Young Bennett. Both families settled near the heart of Big Cataloochee, where their descendants would remain until the government forced them out in the 1930s. George Palmer arrived in Cataloochee in 1838 and settled at the eastern end of Big Cataloochee. Family tradition recalls that Palmer had lost a fortune drinking and gambling in Waynesville and decided to move to Cataloochee to make a fresh start.Hattie Caldwell Davis, Cataloochee Valley: Vanished Settlements of the Great Smoky Mountains (Alexander, N.C.: Worldcomm, 1997), 32. Like the Caldwells and the Bennetts, the Palmers would remain in the valley until the arrival of the national park. A notable late arrival in Big Cataloochee was Jonathan Woody (1812‚Äì1894), who arrived shortly after the Civil War. Caldwell Fork was probably named after John Caldwell, a grandson of the original settlers. John settled near the modern junction of the Caldwell Fork Trail and Big Fork Ridge Trail (the original road from Waynesville to Cataloochee passed through here), and a small community grew up around him. Prominent early settlers along Caldwell Fork include Sol Sutton, Elijah Messer (1844‚Äì1936), and Jesse McGee.Michal Strutin, History Hikes of the Smokies (Gatlinburg: Great Smoky Mountains Association, 2003), 50-54. In 1854, Jack Vess, a son-in-law of George Palmer, and Daniel Cook (1831‚Äì1908) became the first permanent settlers in Little Cataloochee, which is opposite Noland Mountain to the north of the main settlement. Cook's daughter Rachel married Will Messer (1870‚Äì1946), a son of Elijah. Will Messer would eventually become Cataloochee's wealthiest man.Hattie Caldwell Davis, Cataloochee Valley: Vanished Settlements of the Great Smoky Mountains (Alexander, N.C.: Worldcomm, 1997), 41. Other notable early settlers in Little Cataloochee included William Noland and his son-in-law, Evan Hannah (1802‚Äì1878). Pioneer life in Cataloochee Hannah Cabin in Little Cataloochee, built in the mid-1800s Along with the fertile bottomland in Cataloochee, the raising of livestock was the primary incentive that drew early settlers to the valley. The grassy balds were perfect summertime pastures for sheep and cattle, and hogs could roam and forage in the dense forests. Every year, Cataloochee's residents would drive their livestock and turkeys to markets in Waynesville or Charleston, South Carolina.Hattie Caldwell Davis, Cataloochee Valley: Vanished Settlements of the Great Smoky Mountains (Alexander, N.C.: Worldcomm, 1997), 11, 21-22. As game was plentiful in the valley, hunting and trapping provided supplemental income to Cataloochee's early residents. Furs were traded for powder, lead, salt, coffee, cloth, and indigo.Hattie Caldwell Davis, Cataloochee Valley: Vanished Settlements of the Great Smoky Mountains (Alexander, N.C.: Worldcomm, 1997), 87. A hunting camp was established where the Cataloochee Ranger Station now stands. In the late 19th century, George Palmer managed to get the state to place a bounty on wolves, which were consistently killing livestock in the valley.Hattie Caldwell Davis, Cataloochee Valley: Vanished Settlements of the Great Smoky Mountains (Alexander, N.C.: Worldcomm, 1997), 90-92. Life on the Appalachian frontier was dangerous in a number of ways. While the early residents of Cataloochee were on friendly terms with the Cherokee, renegade Cherokee bands occasionally stole livestock. Wild animals such as bears and panthers often stalked the pioneers. Hattie Caldwell Davis wrote of an incident in the 1830s involving her great-grandmother, Mary Ann Caldwell, and Allie Bennett, both home alone one night cooking dinner while panthers roamed the valley: > ...the panthers smelled the fresh pork cooking and they were hungry. They > jumped on top of the log cabins scratching and tearing at the shingles. They > were scratching and tearing at the chimney trying to tear away enough rocks > to get down into the house. Each woman stayed in her own house and kept a > big roaring fire in the fireplace to keep the panthers out.Hattie Caldwell > Davis, Cataloochee Valley: Vanished Settlements of the Great Smoky Mountains > (Alexander, N.C.: Worldcomm, 1997), 28. By 1860, Cataloochee had a population of 160 and had been recognized as a township by the state of North Carolina. The Cataloochee Turnpike was completed in the early 1860s, following closely the old Cherokee trail. It was the first wagon road in the Smokies.Hattie Caldwell Davis, Cataloochee Valley: Vanished Settlements of the Great Smoky Mountains (Alexander, N.C.: Worldcomm, 1997), 24-25, 47. The Civil War The grave of Confederate veteran Dan Cook in Little Cataloochee Unlike much of Southern Appalachia, Cataloochee was largely pro-Confederacy during the American Civil War. The sons of many prominent early settlers fought in the Confederate army, some of them losing their lives. The valley as a whole suffered extraordinary hardship as most able-bodied men left for the war effort, leaving many of the valley's fertile fields to lie fallow. Cataloochee was looted by raiders from both Union and Confederate forces, the former seeking Confederate sympathizers and the latter seeking draft dodgers.Hattie Caldwell Davis, Cataloochee Valley: Vanished Settlements of the Great Smoky Mountains (Alexander, N.C.: Worldcomm, 1997), 62-66. Among the worst of the Union raiders was a band led by Colonel George W. Kirk (1837‚Äì1905), who terrorized numerous pro-Confederate settlements in Western North Carolina. One notable incident involved a makeshift hospital the residents of Cataloochee had set up for veterans returning from the war. While on an excursion in the valley, Kirk's Raiders, the 3rd North Carolina Mounted Infantry, found this hospital and killed or wounded 15 patients recovering within.Hattie Caldwell Davis, Cataloochee Valley: Vanished Settlements of the Great Smoky Mountains (Alexander, N.C.: Worldcomm, 1997), 72. Cataloochee's remote location made it an attractive hideout for deserters and Union sympathizers, and Confederate raiders regularly made excursions into the valley to root them out. One legendary incident occurred following a raid by Confederate Captain Albert Teague in which Teague captured Union sympathizers George and Henry Grooms and Mitchell Caldwell. Teague marched the three to a remote point along Sterling Ridge, and ordered Henry Grooms to play a tune on his fiddle. Grooms chose \\"Bonaparte's Retreat.\\" After he finished, the three were executed.Hattie Caldwell Davis, Cataloochee Valley: Vanished Settlements of the Great Smoky Mountains (Alexander, N.C.: Worldcomm, 1997), 67. The end of the Civil War brought some relief, although many of the returning men were too weak to plant the year's crops. The Confederate currency that the remaining residents had saved was now worthless. The arrival of the railroads gave the economy a small boost, and helped Western North Carolina recover from the war. When the first railroads were constructed in Western North Carolina in the 1870s, many of Cataloochee's residents had never seen a train. They sent Hiram Caldwell and Steve Woody out to Old Fort to observe the new trains and report back. Many refused to believe it when Caldwell and Woody told them they were unable to outrun the train on horseback.Hattie Caldwell Davis, Cataloochee Valley: Vanished Settlements of the Great Smoky Mountains (Alexander, N.C.: Worldcomm, 1997), 83. 1900s The Beech Grove School, built in 1907 By 1900, the population of Cataloochee had grown to 764. The Cataloochee School was too small to handle the growing population, and in 1906 the township sent a delegation consisting of Hiram and George Caldwell and Steve Woody to Waynesville to demand a newer, larger school. Officials in Waynesville rejected them, however, claiming they didn't pay enough taxes. On the way home, the three drank a bottle of whiskey, and decided to burn down the schoolhouse. After removing the furniture, they set the building ablaze, and moved classes to the old Caldwell cabin. They then re-petitioned the government in Waynesville, claiming their school had burned down, and asked for a new one. Due to North Carolina's mandatory attendance laws, the government had no choice but to comply.Hattie Caldwell Davis, Cataloochee Valley: Vanished Settlements of the Great Smoky Mountains (Alexander, N.C.: Worldcomm, 1997), 126-127. Known as the Beech Grove School, the structure still stands today along Palmer Creek. Apples were Cataloochee's main cash crop in the early 20th century, as the valley's relatively cool climate was perfect for apple trees.Michal Strutin, History Hikes of the Smokies (Gatlinburg: Great Smoky Mountains Association, 2003), 50. The foundation of a large communal applehouse built by Will Messer around 1910 can still be seen today near the Cook Cabin in Little Cataloochee. Messer's own applehouse is now on display at the Mountain Farm Museum in Oconaluftee. By 1920, Cataloochee had two post office locations-- one in Little Cataloochee known as Ola, after one of Will Messer's daughters, and another in Big Cataloochee known as Nellie, after one of George Palmer's daughters.Hattie Caldwell Davis, Cataloochee Valley: Vanished Settlements of the Great Smoky Mountains (Alexander, N.C.: Worldcomm, 1997), 173-174. These two locations still occasionally appear on topographical maps of the area.See maps in this article's External links section. Caldwell House, built 1898-1903 by Hiram Caldwell In Caldwell Fork, George Lafayette Palmer's reclusive son, \\"Boogerman\\" Robert Palmer, had settled in the heavy forest north of Elijah Messer's farm. Legend has it that on Palmer's first day of school, the teacher asked him what he wanted to be when he grew up. Palmer replied \\"the Boogerman.\\" Palmer was protective of his forest. He rejected all buy-out offers from lumber companies, and even barred his neighbors from cutting wood on his property. As a result, some of the tallest trees in the valley are found along the Boogerman Trail, which follows the old road connecting Big Cataloochee with the Caldwell Fork settlements.Michal Strutin, History Hikes of the Smokies (Gatlinburg: Great Smoky Mountains Association, 2003), 38-40. In the early 20th century, moonshining was rampant throughout Southern Appalachia, and Cataloochee was no exception. Some experts estimate that 95% of households in Cataloochee made their own whiskey, although most of this was for personal use.Michal Strutin, History Hikes of the Smokies (Gatlinburg: Great Smoky Mountains Association, 2003), 41. Early settlers used whiskey as a remedy for various ailments and to help them work long hours during the summer. During Prohibition, some of Cataloochee's poorer residents and small farmers supplemented their income by selling moonshine, which was in high demand. The liquor was sold at Waynesville, and from there shipped as far away as New York City and Washington, D.C.Hattie Caldwell Davis, Cataloochee Valley: Vanished Settlements of the Great Smoky Mountains (Alexander, N.C.: Worldcomm, 1997), 166-168. Cataloochee was largely spared the logging boom that deforested much of Southern Appalachia in the early 20th century, although Suncrest Lumber and Parsons Pulp and Lumber had purchased most of the surrounding ridgeline with intent to cut it.Carlos Campbell, Birth of a National Park In the Great Smoky Mountains (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 1969), 69. Many residents of Cataloochee found employment at logging camps at Hartford, Crestmont, and Big Creek, all located along the Pigeon River to the north, and Walnut Bottom, located on the other side of Sterling Ridge.Hattie Caldwell Davis, Cataloochee Valley: Vanished Settlements of the Great Smoky Mountains (Alexander, N.C.: Worldcomm, 1997), 165-166. The arrival of the national park movement in the 1920s put an end to large-scale logging operations in the northeastern Smokies before they reached the Cataloochee lowlands. The national park The eastern entrance to Cataloochee atop Cataloochee Divide Tourists began trickling into the Smokies in the late 19th century, drawn by mineral-rich mountain springs that were thought to have health-restoring qualities. Many mountain residents built additional rooms onto their houses to accommodate lodgers, and several hotels sprang up. The Cataloochee Ranch was established in 1933 by Tom and Judy Alexander. The ranch was open April 15 through October 15, with 10 rooms at rates ranging from $2.75 to $5.00 per day. Jarvis Palmer operated an 8-person lodge and three cottages during the 1930s, with slightly lower rates.George McCoy, Guide to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park (Asheville: The Inland Press, 1935), 143. Palmer Chapel in Big Cataloochee, built in 1898. In the 1920s, the increase in tourism and the destructive effects of logging gave rise to a movement to create a national park in the Smokies. For this to happen, the residents living in the proposed park boundaries would either have to sell their land or be forced out via eminent domain. In 1928, Reverend Pat Davis broke the news to the residents of Cataloochee at Palmer's Chapel, telling them the valley was within proposed park boundaries and that they would be forced to sell. Hattie Caldwell Davis, who was at the meeting, recalled women crying and men threatening to dynamite the roads and shoot anyone who tried to enter.Hattie Caldwell Davis, Cataloochee Valley: Vanished Settlements of the Great Smoky Mountains (Alexander, N.C.: Worldcomm, 1997), 187-188. Some men had the idea of blocking Cove Creek Gap so the government representatives would have to come in from the Tennessee side, where Mount Sterling residents would surely stop them. Opposition to the park movement was eased when the Park Commission allowed residents to obtain lifetime leases and remain in their homes. While some contested their condemnation suits, most simply took what was offered, as they were skeptical of lawyers and didn't think anything would be gained by going to court. Many chose to remain on lifetime leases, but restrictions on farming and logging would force most people out of Cataloochee by 1943. Most simply moved elsewhere in Haywood County.Hattie Caldwell Davis, Cataloochee Valley: Vanished Settlements of the Great Smoky Mountains (Alexander, N.C.: Worldcomm, 1997), 191-219. In the 1970s, the Park Service made plans to develop Cataloochee as a major tourist area within the park by paving Cove Creek Road and allowing greater vehicle access. Widespread opposition and threats of litigation stalled the plan until 1982, when budget cuts forced the Park Service to abandon it.Daniel Pierce, The Great Smokies: From Natural Habitat to National Park (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2000), 200. As of 2007, Cataloochee's surviving former residents and their descendants were still holding reunions in August of each year.Kathy Ross, \\" The Mountaineer Publishing Company, 2007. Retrieved: 23 September 2007. Cataloochee today Elk grazing in Big Cataloochee Compared to other driving destinations within the park, Cataloochee remains relatively remote. While a well-maintained paved road traverses Big Cataloochee, the valley is connected to the outside world by the crude gravel Cove Creek Road, which is riddled with sharp turns as it crosses Cataloochee Divide and Sterling Ridge. Cove Creek Road is accessible from Jonathan Creek Road (I-40, Exit 20) or from the Big Creek area near Waterville, North Carolina. Cataloochee Campground lies at the junction of Caldwell Fork and Cataloochee Creek. Backcountry campsites are located along the Caldwell Fork Trail, Rough Creek Trail, and Pretty Hollow Gap Trail. In 2001, the Appalachian Highlands Science Learning Center was established at Purchase Knob (atop Cataloochee Divide) on land donated to the park by Kathryn McNeil and Voit Gilmore the previous year. The purpose of the center, part of a network of 32 such research centers throughout the national park system, is to facilitate scientific research in the Appalachian highlands and increase public awareness and understanding of this research.\\"About the Appalachian Highlands Science Learning Center at Purchase Knob.\\" Official National Park Service website. Retrieved: 20 September 2007. The center, located along the Cataloochee Divide Trail, includes laboratories and housing for visiting scientists. Elk Population Elk were reintroduced into the park in February 2001 when 25 elk from the Land Between the Lakes National Recreation Area were released in Cataloochee. Most of the original $1.1 million cost was funded by the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation, which provided $700,000.The News & Observer: North Carolina Has an Elk Herd, Too Elk once roamed the highlands of Southern Appalachia, but were eliminated by overhunting and loss of habitat. Elk herds are a common sight in Cataloochee in the Spring and Fall. After the 2011 calving season the total population of elk in the park was estimated to be just over 130.National Park Service, \\"The Return of the Elk.\\" Published by the Great Smoky Mountains Association. Historical structures in Cataloochee Little Cataloochee (Ola) Baptist Church in Little Cataloochee, built in 1889 For anthropological and historical purposes, the National Park Service has preserved several structures dating to Cataloochee's pre-park days. Unlike other historical areas of the park such as Cades Cove and the Mountain Farm Museum at Oconaluftee, many of the structures in Cataloochee have a more modern look, and are more representative of life in the early 20th century as opposed to pioneer life in Appalachia. Notable exceptions are the Cook Cabin and Hannah Cabin. The Hannah Cabin in Little Cataloochee was built by John Jackson Hannah, the son of Little Cataloochee pioneer Evan Hannah. The cabin's chimney is one of only three surviving brick chimneys in the national park.Ed Trout, Historic Buildings of the Smokies (Gatlinburg: Great Smoky Mountains Association, 1995), 24. The Cook Cabin in Little Cataloochee was built by Dan Cook in the 1850s. It was dismantled in the 1970s after being vandalized, and restored to its original site in 1999. The ruins of Cook's applehouse (built by Cook's son-in-law Will Messer) are on the opposite side of the trail. The Palmer House in Big Cataloochee was built in 1869 by George Lafayette Palmer. Originally a log cabin, a framed addition and weatherboarding were added later by Palmer's son, Jarvis. Along with the house, the site includes the Palmers' frame springhouse, smokehouse, and barn. The house now contains a self-guided museum. The Palmer Chapel in Big Cataloochee was built in 1898 on land deeded by Mary Ann Palmer. The Caldwell House in Big Cataloochee was built 1898-1903 by Hiram Caldwell. The Caldwell Barn, adjacent to the house, was built in 1923. Steve Woody House, built 1880. The Steve Woody House in Big Cataloochee was built in 1880 by Steve Woody, the son of Jonathan Woody. The house was originally built of logs. Later, paneling and extra rooms were added as lumber from sawmills became widely available. The house is located along the Rough Fork Trail, a mile from the road. Woody's springhouse is nearby. The Little Cataloochee Baptist Church (sometimes called Ola Baptist Church) in Little Cataloochee was built in 1889. Will Messer later built the belfry, which included a bell donated by William Hannah. The Messer Barn was built by Will Messer around 1905, and was originally located in Little Cataloochee. It was later moved to the ranger's residence, where it stands today. Messer's applehouse is now located at the Mountain Farm Museum in Oconaluftee. Will's cousin, John Messer, built the Messer Barn that now stands in Greenbrier, on the Tennessee side of the mountains. Along with these intact structures, a number of rockwalls, chimney falls, and cemeteries remain in the Caldwell Fork, Big Cataloochee, and Little Cataloochee valleys.

Zhang Side () (April 19, 1915 ‚Äì September 5, 1944) was a Chinese Communist soldier killed during the Second Sino-Japanese War. Life Zhang Side was born in a poor tenant-peasant family of Hanjiawan, Liuhechang, Yilong County, Sichuan Province on April 19 (the sixth day of third lunar month), 1915. Before he was one year old, his mother died. He was brought up by his aunt. When he was 12 years old, he began to feed the cattle and mow grasses for the landlord. In September 1933, the Red Army came to his hometown and established the revolutionary regime. He actively joined the Young Pioneers of China and was elected a team leader. He was conscientious in assisting the Red Army and militia in standing guard, then searching suspected people. He joined the Red Army in December 1933 and before long the Communist Youth League of China. In October 1937, he joined the Communist Party of China (CPC). In a fight against the six-side siege, his legs were injured twice but he still rushed into the enemy's position to capture two machine guns. In June 1935, the 4th Front Red Army joined force with the Central Red Army in Maogong of Sichuan and continued to march north. During the Long March, he had crossed the snow mountains and grasslands two times. After he arrived in the Northern Shaanxi, he was selected as leader of the Communication squad of the Guard Battalion of the Central Military Commission. For several years, he worked hard and outstandingly fulfilled his duties. In the early summer of 1940, the Kuomintang carried out the military \\"encirclements\\" and economic blockade in the border areas. To resolve the heating problem of the central organs in winter, he led his squad to burn charcoals in Tuhuanggou north to Yan'an. After three months of hard work, he successfully delivered 40 tons of charcoals to Yan'an. In 1941, the Anti-Japanese War came into the hardest period. In order to get over the economic difficulty of enemy's blockade, he opened up a wasteland in Nanniwan along with the guard battalion. He led the squad to overcome many difficulties during that period and complete production tasks given by the superior. Meanwhile, he also shouldered the communication work as usual, working hard at day and sending message on foot at night regardless of fatigue for the sake of fulfilling the task of communication. In the winter of 1942, he returned to Yan'an from Nanniwan. Later a leader transferred him, as head of a squad, to another squad as a common serviceman due to the change of staffing of the troops. But he served the needs of revolution without any complaint and thought of individual success and failure. In early summer of 1943, he was transferred to Zaoyuan Internal Guard Squad and worked as one of the guards for Chairman Mao Zedong. In 1944, the Party organization assigned him to burn charcoal in Ansai County. On September 5, when he was working in the kiln, the kiln suddenly collapsed and he was killed. In the afternoon of September 8, 1944, the organs directly under the CPC Central Committee held a grand funeral ceremony, at which Chairman Mao Zedong inscribed the elegiac words of \\"salute to Comrade Zhang Side who sacrifices his life for the benefit of people\\" and attended the funeral ceremony in person. At the ceremony, Mao Zedong made the important speech of Serve the People, highly praising his lofty morality of serving the people wholeheartedly that he \\"died for the benefit of people, and his death is indeed heavier than Mount Tai\\". In others books, it was written that Mao Zedong said in his eulogy \\"Serve the people\\": \\"All men must die, but death can vary in its significance. The ancient Chinese writer Szuma Ch'ien (Sima Qian) said, \\"Though death befalls all men alike, it may be weightier than Mount Tai or lighter than a feather.\\" [...] From now on, when anyone in our ranks who has done some useful work dies, be he soldier or cook, we should have a funeral ceremony and a memorial meeting in his honor. This should become the rule. And it should be introduced among the people as well. When someone dies in a village, let a memorial meeting be held. In this way we express our mourning for the dead and unite all the people\\".Mao Zedong, \\"Serve the People\\" in Mao Zedong, Selected Works of Mao Tse-tung, 5 vols, Beijing, 1967-77, vol.3, pp.177-8.

Thomas was one of the first conservative Republican state senators to call for the resignation or impeachment of Governor Mark Sanford. In August 2009, he wrote a letter to state legislative leaders saying that in his view, Sanford's use of expensive plane tickets on state business were an impeachable offense. In September 2011 USA Today ran a story on legislative pensions and how legislators abused their power to \\"pump up their pensions.\\" Thomas was the poster child for this article. USA Today found that he had taken home over $148,000 more than other South Carolina legislators. At the time of the USA Today article, Thomas had paid for thirty years of service necessary to draw legislative retirement pay instead of legislative salary which comes from the General Fund of South Carolina's State Budget. Nineteen other South Carolina senators have chosen to take the $32,390 retirement pay from the General Assembly Retirement System, which also comes from the General Fund of South Carolina's State Budget, rather than the $10,400 salary.http://www.postandcourier.com/news/2012/feb/25/first-cut-legislative- pensions/ South Carolina has one of the lowest pay scales for legislators among the fifty states.

Eugene O'Neill at Work. New York: Frederick Ungar, p. 53. O'Neill wrote the play in the fall of 1923 and revised the text only slightly for its 1924 publication.Bogard, Travis, ed. (1988) Eugene O'Neill, Complete Plays 1920-1931. New York: Library of America, p. 1079. Arguably one of his most controversial of plays, it starred Paul Robeson in the premiere, in which he portrayed the black husband of an abusive white woman, who, resenting her husband's skin color, destroys his promising career as a lawyer.

An African-American gangster who is mad at Jim for trying to use education to escape from his life. * Mickey ‚Äì Ella's childhood friend. He is a boxer who leaves Ella after she becomes pregnant with his child.  Plot summary  The play is divided into two acts that are further broken up into seven scenes and it opens up on an integrated corner in the south of New York. There are three converging streets that form at the edge of a triangular building. Though integrated, the people separate themselves by race, black on one end, white on the other except for the kids that are playing marbles between one another in the center. Scene One begins with an introduction to the main and supporting characters: Jim, Ella, Mickey, Joe and Shorty. Jim and Ella are singled out as liking each other and they bond over being called \\"Painty Face\\" and \\"Crow\\". In Scene Two, it is nine years later and takes place on the same corner with a showcases the technological advances‚Äîhorse and buggy for automobiles. The relationship between Jim and Ella has changed. Jim is pining for Ella's recognition and Shorty and Joe questions his blackness because of his desire to graduate and pass the bar exam. It seems as if he has fallen prey to Shorty's degradation of his ability and potential. It is also revealed that Ella is in a relationship with Mickey. In Scene Three, the setting is the same but five years later. The people on the streets appear even more tired. It starts out with Shorty and Ella discussing the break up with Mickey and reveals that she had a child only to lose it to diphtheria. The scene also goes on the show the somewhat mended relationship between Ella and Jim which in turn causes her to lose her relationship with her parents. When Jim enters the scene, he mentions how he failed the bar exam yet again. Jim explains that the reason behind him not passing is his feeling of inferiority to the other students and not his lack of knowledge. Ella does not appear to be upset over this and tried to encourage him by referring to him as \\"white\\". This portion ends with Jim asking her whether or not she would marry him and she replies with a yes. In Scene Four, the scene has changed and is instead in front of a church a few weeks later. Jim and Ella have married and the fear inside Ella is obvious. The two of them are headed towards the steamer to leave New York and Joe is optimistic. Act II In Scene One, it is two years later and two new characters are introduced, his mother Mrs. Harris and his sister Hattie. They live in a nice place with decoration that gives an air of wealth but are obvious cheaply made. The two start out talking about the arrival of Jim and Ella and the mother mentions Hattie's defiance to the marriage between the two. Hattie and her mother both agree on that there should be any union between the two races. They continue to talk about the place where Jim and Ella move accept the interracial marriage and they argue over whether they should stay away or come back, Hattie thinking Jim should face the prejudice head on. Enter Jim who answers the question of why Ella wasn't seen beside him and he explains she was tired of the trip. According to Jim, Ella grew lonely and afraid being in France and Jim feels that it was because of him. Hattie prods for the truth of whether Ella loves him or not. Of course, that infuriates Jim but he reveals that they indeed move back so he could face everything that he believed that was making his wife sick in addition to taking the bar exam. Next enters Ella who runs to Jim with a distaste that upset Hattie but she keeps it in and they try to reminisce and remain civil with each other. Hattie is asked about what she has accomplished and she proudly admits that she has been studying and became a teacher of a colored school. Just like she was with Jim, Ella tried to degrade her accomplishments and used the failure of her husband to make her feel better about Hattie's success. The appearance of a tribal mask shocks Ella and she stresses how Jim isn't going to take the exam. This scene ends with Hattie and Mrs. Harris leaving the apartment and giving it to Ella and Jim as a gift. In Scene Two, both Jim and Ella are still in the apartment but it is six months later. Jim is seen with law books stacked around him. Hattie enters the room with Jim and proceeds to ask him about Ella's condition, which has worsened. That leads his sister to suggest that he leave her because he is likely to get sick as well. It is revealed that she has developed mania that her skin was turning black and has sunk to calling Hattie derogatory words. Jim has in turn thrown Hattie out for trying to separate them. After Hattie is forced out Ella enters with a knife in hand and asks Jim to be Uncle Jim and for her to be the little girl. As she is almost coaxed into bed she calls Jim a nigger and the scene ends with Jim in emotional agony. In Scene Three, it is six months later and Ella appears even more sick than before and approaches the tribal mask with a deranged demeanor. Ella exposes her true feelings towards Jim taking the bar exam and black people succeeding. Enters Jim with a letter that held his results of the examination which he failed. The play ends with a revelation that Jim decided to no longer take the exam and they came full circle with Ella wanting to go back to the time where she was referred to as \\"Painty Face\\" and Jim as \\"Crow\\".  Analysis of play  O'Neill's All God's Chillun' Got Wings in which Paul Robeson kissed Mary Blair's hand and created a national uproar. The main conflict in the story is the racism of the time. Jim is seen being threatened by the white characters throughout the play. Hattie gets into fights with Ella, defending her race from Ella's attacks. Not only does the play cover the tensions between white and black, but the conflicts among those in each race. Joe gets into a fight with Jim because of Jim's drive for success. Joe sees this as Jim trying to get away from his life as an African American. Ella is berated by Shorty when he discovers that she is having a relationship with Jim. She is called a \\"Nigger-lover\\" and his tone changes from friendly to confrontational. Critics have claimed that, not unlike his other plays, O‚ÄôNeill lived for controversy and instead of creating a social commentary, he was just feeding cultural stereotypes because of his ignorance to African-American culture. The inclusion of a W. E. B. Du Bois excerpt in the play's opening playbill was a testament to Eugene O‚ÄôNeill's neutral stance on the issue of interracial relationships. Other critics have mentioned that Ella and Jim are actually a depiction of Ella and James, O‚ÄôNeill's parents. Because of the abusive relationship between Jim and Ella in the play, critics thought that it represented the relationship between his parents.  Themes and political context  As the last play of O‚ÄôNeill that casts a black lead, All God‚Äôs Chillun Got Wings discussed the intraracial and interracial issues that plagued American society in the early 20th century. O‚ÄôNeill gave glimpses of the struggle of being black in the time period and what the implications of being in a relationship with someone of the opposite race would entail. W.J. Arnold, one of the founders of the Daughters of the Confederacy said about the play at the time: > ‚ÄúThe scene where Miss Blair is called upon to kiss and fondle a Negro‚Äôs hand > is going too far, even for the stage. The play may be produced above the > Mason and Dixie [sic] line, but Mr. O‚ÄôNeill will not get the friendly > reception he had when he sent ‚ÄòEmperor Jones‚Äô his other coloured play into > the South. The play should be banned by the authorities, because it will be > impossible for it to do otherwise than stir up ill feeling between the > races.‚Äô‚Äô In the book Black Manhattan, author James Weldon Johnson stated that the New York American and The Morning Telegraph newspapers published articles about the play in an attempt to stir up a violent reaction, so that public outrage would cause the play to be censored. Towards the end of the 1910s and the beginning of the 1920s \\"random and organized acts of violence\\" were raged against the African-American community. The twenties were also a time where the Ku Klux Klan was at its height and the talk of integration clashed with a culture practicing segregation. Performances The play debuted on May 15, 1924, at the Provincetown Playhouse at 133 MacDougal Street between West 3rd and West 4th Streets in Greenwich Village in New York, closing on October 24. February 15, 1929, at Moscow Kamerny Theatre, director Alexander Tairov. Trish Van Devere played in the 1975 Broadway revival, along with James Earl Jones, Jimmy Baio, and Kathy Rich.

It provides safe shelters, a network of supportive services, advocacy, education and resource information, and coalition building. The Center is based in Brooklyn, New York and provides services in the New York City Metro area. It was formerly known as the Center for the Elimination of Violence in the Family, Inc.  History  The Center Against Domestic Violence opened the first publicly funded domestic violence shelter in New York State in 1977. The New York City-based effort was spearheaded by lawyers, civil servants, and activists who understood domestic abuse as a crime and violation of human rights, not merely a private family matter. The Center's Women's Survival Space, a place where abused women and their children could find safety, was the first of its kind in the State and is now the longest operating domestic violence shelter in New York State. Today the Center houses up to 1,000 women and children each year in three emergency domestic violence shelters. In the 1990s, the Center saw an opportunity to prevent domestic abuse by reaching out to high school students and developed the PEER curriculum (Pride Education Equality Respect). The Center built programs to offer lifesaving teen relationship prevention programs to high school and middle school students in New York City, as well as opportunities to reach out to elementary school students with tools for building healthy relationships.  Emergency shelters  The Center operates three shelters: Women's Survival Space, Women's Safe Start, and Women's Second Start. The shelters provide a safe place for survivors and their children, and offer services to assist them as they work through the trauma of domestic violence. The Center provides housing, support and a chance to build a life free of abuse for more than 1,000 women and children each year. Some services include: * Counseling * Case Management * Workshops and Support Groups * Housing Search Assistance * Daycare * Recreation, Educational, and After School Activities  School-based date violence prevention  In 1998, the Center became the first and largest provider of teen dating violence prevention services in New York City. Combined, they reach more than 30,000 students and 5,000 school staff each year through extensive teen dating violence prevention workshops, training and support for school personnel and students. The Relationship Abuse Prevention Program (RAPP) places Center Against Domestic Violence social workers in twelve New York City public high schools and intermediate schools. Each participating high school has a dedicated social worker who coordinates the program. Social workers provide counseling to students on a wide variety of subjects related to teen abuse, including: * leaving abusive relationships * helping friends who are in abusive relationships * dealing with trauma from having witnessed violence in the family * reporting crimes * obtaining orders of protection * building confidence and self esteem * preventing domestic violence in the community. The Center has also partnered with the Bank Street College of Education‚Äôs Center for Emotionally Responsive Practice to develop a preventive healthy relationship curriculum elementary school students.  Crime victims services  New York State's Crime Victims Board provides compensation to innocent victims for losses they incurred as a result of a crime. All domestic violence victims are, by definition, crime victims, and many need financial help to recover health or property destroyed by abusers.  Support and Education  Bilingual (English and Spanish) case managers coordinate services, educate the community about crime victim benefits and provide counseling to survivors of domestic violence. Services include: * English and Spanish support groups * Children's support groups * Criminal justice support and advocacy * Emergency assistance * Personal advocacy * Home or hospital visits  Events  The Center's annual Standing Up Against Domestic Violence Gala is its primary fundraising event. The Center is a recipient of the Elly Grant, awarded by the New York Women's Agenda at their annual breakfast.

It is considered a threatened species in Massachusetts while in Connecticut, Maryland, and New Hampshire it is considered endangered.Salix exigua Retrieved 24 April 2019. Description It is a deciduous shrub reaching in height, spreading by basal shoots to form dense clonal colonies. The leaves are narrow lanceolate, long and broad, green, to grayish with silky white hairs at least when young; the margin is entire or with a few irregular, widely spaced small teeth. The flowers are produced in catkins in late spring, after the leaves appear. It is dioecious, with staminate and pistillate catkins on separate plants, the male catkins up to long, the female catkins up to long. The fruit is a cluster of capsules, each containing numerous minute seeds embedded in shiny white silk.Northern Prairie Wildlife Research Center: Salix exigua Jepson Flora: Salix exigua Subspecies The two subspecies, which meet in the western Great Plains, are: *S. exigua subsp. exigua ‚Äì western North America, leaves grayish all summer with persistent silky hairs, seed capsules long *S. exigua subsp. interior (Rowlee) Cronq.

Marco Ricci (6 June 1676 ‚Äì 21 January 1730) was an Italian painter of the Baroque period. Early years He was born at Belluno and received his first instruction in art from his uncle, Sebastiano Ricci, likely in Milan in 1694‚Äì6.Giacometti, Margherita. In: The Glory of Venice: Art in the Eighteenth Century. Martineau, Jane; and Andrew Robinson, eds. Yale University Press: New Haven and London, 1994. He left for Venice with his uncle in 1696, but had to flee the city after killing a gondolier. He visited Rome, where he was for some time occupied in painting perspective views.Bryan, Michael; and George Stanley. A biographical and critical dictionary of painters and engravers: with a list of ciphers, monograms, and marks. G. Bell, 1878. In 1706‚Äì7, he worked with his uncle on the decoration of the Sala d'Ercole in the Palazzo Fenzi, located in Florence. Ricci's propensity for collaboration with other artists makes his early style difficult to trace, but it is generally agreed that his influences included Claude Lorrain, Gaspard Dughet, and Salvator Rosa, along with a naturalistic style of landscape painting practiced in the Veneto in the 17th and early 18th centuries.Barcham, William. \\"Townscapes & Landscapes\\". In: The Glory of Venice: Art in the Eighteenth Century. Martineau, Jane; and Andrew Robinson, eds. Yale University Press: New Haven and London, 1994. Closer in time, and known personally by Ricci, was the Genoese painter Alessandro Magnasco, whose handling of loose paint and his long, thin, wiry figures are echoed in a number of Ricci's early canvases. Stays in England Through the prompting of Charles Montagu, 4th Earl of Manchester, and British ambassador to Venice, in late 1708 Ricci traveled to England, and on his way there he stopped in the Netherlands to study Dutch landscape painting. In England, he frequently collaborated with the artist Pellegrini in the staging of Italian works at the Queen's Theatre in Haymarket.Pedrocco, Filippo. Visions of Venice: Paintings of the 18th Century. Tauris Parke Books: London and New York, 2002. The pair painted stage scenery for two Italian operas, Pyrrhus and Demetrius by Alessandro Scarlatti and Nicola Haym, and Camilla by Antonio Maria Bononcini and Silvio Stampiglia, with English libretti by Owen McSwiney. With Pellegrini, he executed six large mythological canvases for Burlington House. Ricci returned to Venice in 1711, but came back to England with his uncle Sebastiano the following year, with whom he collaborated on several commissions. During his time in England, Marco Ricci also painted several landscapes, capriccios, and the wry painting Opera Rehearsal for Charles Howard, 3rd Earl of Carlisle. His production as a landscapist can be divided into four categories: alpine views or pastorals, violent country storms, ruins, and scenes of villages or courtyards. While the medium of many of his works was oil on canvas, about half of his output, smaller in dimension, was tempera applied to goatskin. Venice Marco Ricci returned to Venice in 1716, living with his uncle there until his death. Ricci's output in the 1720s was prodigious, and his production encompassed landscapes, capriccios, gouaches on vellum, drawings of stage designs and caricatures. He collaborated with Sebastiano on monumental figurative paintings. From 1723, Marco Ricci etched several plates from his own designs, consisting of views and landscapes, with ruins and figures, including a notable set of twenty-three prints which anticipate Piranesi.Levey, Michael. \\"Introduction to 18th-Century Venetian Art.\\" In: The glory of Venice: Art in the Eighteenth Century.

Marco Ricci can be regarded as the initiator of a new Venetian landscape style, which became an immediate international success.Wittkower, Rudolf.

The main object of worship is .Nihon Rekishi Chimei Taikei It was named in a reference both to the Enryaku-ji's location atop Mount Hiei (T≈çeizan means \\"Mount Hiei of the East\\"), and also after the era during which it was erected, like Enryaku-ji (named after the Enryaku year period).Henry D. Smith, \\"One Hundred Famous Views of Edo\\", Braziller, 1986; plate 11 commentary Because it was one of the two Tokugawa bodaiji (funeral temple; the other was Z≈çj≈ç-ji) and because it was destroyed in the closing days of the war that put an end to the Tokugawa shogunate, it is inextricably linked to the Tokugawa sh≈çguns. Once a great complex, it used to occupy the entire heights north and east of Shinobazu Pond and the plains where Ueno Station now stands.Seidensticker (1991:117) It had immense wealth, power and prestige, and it once consisted of over 30 buildings. Of the 15 Tokugawa sh≈çguns, six are buried here. Many temple structures were destroyed in the great Meireki fire of 1657.Kaneiji. Columbia University. Accessed June 13, 2008. A new hall was constructed inside the enclosure of Kan'ei-ji in 1698.Titsingh, Isaac. (1834). Annales des empereurs du Japon, p. 415. The temple and its numerous annexes were almost completely destroyed during the Boshin War's Battle of Ueno and never restored. Much of the site where it once stood was confiscated and is now occupied by Ueno Park. What is today the temple's main hall was taken from Kita-in in Kawagoe (Saitama Prefecture) and transferred to the site of a former Kan'ei-ji subtemple. Kan'ei-ji's five-story pagoda (photo above) and the Ueno T≈çsh≈ç-g≈´ shrine were amongst the gems of the old temple enclosure. Both stand undisturbed by the passage of years since the end of the Tokugawa shogunate. The Shinobazu Pond itself and the Bentend≈ç Temple which stands on its island used to be an integral part of Kan'ei-ji. Tenkai, liking Lake Biwa, had Benten Island built in imitation of Chikubushima, and then the Bentend≈ç on it.Japanese Old Photographs in Bakumatsu/Meiji Period, Shinobazu Pond, accessed on November 16, 2008 At the time the island was accessible only by boat, but later a stone bridge was added on the east, making it possible to walk to it. The Bentend≈ç Temple was destroyed during World War II, and the present one is a reconstruction.  History  Tenkai wanted to create a powerful religious center and, to achieve that, he built Kan'ei-ji imitating Enryaku-ji. The temple was therefore erected north-east of Edo Castle to ward off evil spirits that were believed to come from that unlucky direction. Tenkai's project enjoyed from the beginning the shogunate support, so much so that Tokugawa Hidetada in 1622 donated the land on which it was built. At the time, on that land there were the suburban residences of three daimy≈çs, (T≈çd≈ç Takatora of the Tsu domain, Tsugaru Nobuhira of the Hirosaki domain and Hori Naoyori of the Murakami domain), but the land was expropriated and donated to Tenkai for the temple. He was also given 50 thousand silver Ry≈ç and a building as a contribution. The chief abbot's residence, the Honb≈ç, was built in 1625, which is considered the year of foundation of the temple. After that, several daimy≈çs contributed with the construction of other buildings. The main hall, called as in Enryaku-ji's case Konponch≈´d≈ç, was finished only in 1697. In 1643, after Tenkai's death, disciple K≈çkai took his place. His successor was Emperor Go-Mizunoo's third son Shuch≈çho Shinn≈ç. From then on until the end of the shogunate, Kan'ei-ji's chief abbots were chosen among the Emperor's children or favorite nephews and called with the honorific . Tokugawa and Kan'ei-ji  With the favor of the Tokugawa the temple prospered but, at least in the first years since foundation, it was just the Tokugawa family temple, while the sole funeral temple of the Tokugawa was still Z≈çj≈ç-ji, where the second shogun Hidetada rests. His successor Iemitsu sent his remains to Nikk≈ç because the Nikk≈ç T≈çsh≈ç-g≈´, mausoleum of Tokugawa Ieyasu, founder of the dynasty, was there; he however also built a mausoleum at Kan'ei'ji. After that, the fourth sh≈çgun Tokugawa Ietsuna and the fifth Tokugawa Tsunayoshi were put to rest in Ueno, and Kan'ei-ji became a Tokugawa funeral temple like Z≈çj≈ç-ji. Z≈çj≈ç-ji didn't like the change, but after the next shogun Tokugawa Ienobu's mausoleum was built on its land, the custom became to alternate the temples at each generation, and that lasted until the closing of the shogunate era. Excepted Ieyasu and Iemitsu (buried in Nikk≈ç) and last shogun Yoshinobu (also known as Keiki, buried in nearby Yanaka Cemetery), all of the Tokugawa sh≈çguns are buried either at Z≈çj≈ç-ji or Kan'ei-ji, six at one and six at the other. In what used to be the Kan'ei-ji cemetery near the Tokyo National Museum are interred Tokugawa Ietsuna, Tokugawa Tsunayoshi, Tokugawa Yoshimune, Tokugawa Ieharu, Tokugawa Ienari, Tokugawa Iesada and Iesada's wife Tensh≈ç- in.Watanabe (2005:30) Ietsuna's and Tsunayoshi's mausoleums were destroyed in 1945.

Battle of Ueno and the destruction of Kan'ei-ji Devastation of Ueno after the battle. 1868 photograph.In his book High City, Low City Japanologist Edward Seidensticker describes the last days and the destruction of Kan'ei-ji. The revolutionary forces had occupied most of Tokyo, and Edo Castle and the majority of the Tokugawa troops had already surrendered, however one band of shogunate soldiers barricaded itself in Ueno with the intention to resist.Seidensticker (1991:27) About 2000 men strong, it was composed of members of the Sh≈çgitai, a military unit of former Tokugawa retainers. They held the Kan'ei-ji's abbot in hostage, and maybe for this reason the Satsuma and Ch≈çsh≈´ revolutionaries didn't attack immediately. On July 4, 1868 (Meiji 1, 15th day of the 5th month),NengoCalc : ÊòéÊ≤ª‰∏ÄÂπ¥‰∫îÊúàÂçÅ‰∫îÊó•; n.b., the old lunar calendar date, used for example by Watanabe, was misidentified as May 15. the final attack came and from early morning artillery rounds fell from Hongo's heights on Ueno. After a fierce battle, in the late afternoon the revolutionary forces broke through the defenses in the south at the Black Gate (the Kuromon), near what is today Ueno Park's entrance. There were altogether about 300 dead, mostly defenders. Most of the artillery rounds had gone astray, causing fires in which the whole Kan'ei-ji and up to a thousand houses were destroyed. The temple's abbot fled in disguise and left the city by boat.

Irvine. The Scottish or Lowland Scottish gravestone is unique to the north of the British Isles. The study of Scottish Lowland Gravestones is essential to the overall study of British monumental inscriptions. The level of symbolism and detail on Scottish stones reached a peak during the 18th century.  Early tombs  The earliest tombs in Scotland are now lost. If Palaeolithic man ever set foot in that country, all traces have been wiped away. However, numerous Mesolithic and Neolithic tombs, cairns, chambered cairns and burial mounds have been discovered and studied. The Bronze and Iron Ages may have pioneered the concept of a modern graveyard for their remains have been found grouped together in much the same manner as today. In addition to using traditional burial methods, they would also create allotments for their dead. Iron Age burials are, however currently rare in Britain.  Early church burials  Medieval Stone Coffin on open-air display in AyrshireBritish archaeological evidence indicates that the custom of burying the dead in or around a church began as early as the 8th century. By the early 12th century, Saxons, Normans and Flemish knights were given lands throughout Scotland. The new lords built chapels and churches on their new estates. With so many servants, beneficiaries and eventually Tenants, the Church land was soon used to bury the dead of the surrounding village.  Pre- Reformation  Slab stone dated 1586. Dreghorn Old Kirkyard.Very few pre- Reformation stones exist today and those that do are often removed from their original position and given care and shelter in a local museum. Medieval stone coffins, or sarcophagi, are more abundant. Since 1457, it had been the habit to organise the local Wappenshaw (presenting weaponry for inspection) in the local graveyards. The resulting wounds on the fine sandstone of many rare stones has left them defaced by the continuous bombardment of missiles.  Post-Reformation  The 16th century, the century in which Scotland played host to her own Protestant Reformation, was a quiet one for Scottish gravestones. It seems that they were seldom produced and are indeed a rare sight today in our old graveyards. More stones were produced in the 17th and 18th centuries.  17th-century stones  Trade Tools depicted on a 17th- century lowland Paisley GravestoneBy the early 17th century, many ancient graveyards had become swollen with so many bodies that their lands were recognisable as burial grounds. Some sites have been subjected to an increase of several feet in height. By the middle of the century, we begin to see more identification marks on the stones. Heraldic devices, craft tools, symbols of mortality and the name, date of birth and often the address of the deceased began to be crammed onto the limited surfaces of the stone. One side of the headstone was dedicated to written identification while the other was to be used for symbolic expression. The symbolic elements would usually reveal the man's occupation while reminding the living viewer that he or she too must depart this earth sooner or later.  18th-century stones  18th-century Lowland Gravestone.Perhaps the most ambitious period of Headstone carving. Indeed, it was this century that the traditional headstone came to be used as standard. One fact that marks the Lowland Scottish Headstone as unique is that the Headstone took almost a century to penetrate into the highlands, where the older slab and table grave markers were still being used until shortly before the 19th century. The height of 18th-century Scottish Lowland Gravestones can be anywhere between 60 cm and 100 cm. Also unique to the Scottish Lowland gravestone are the materials. Sandstone is an easily carved but easily weathered rock but it was used as the standard gravestone material in the north of Britain. In the south, where marbles and granite were the preferred medium, we see an understandable hesitation on the part of the stonemason to overly decorate the hard stones of England. 18th-century Scottish gravestones are almost always oriented east to west. The part which contains the identification of the cadaver usually faces towards the Holy Land. Since most 18th-century were left relatively unadorned, the rear side of stone was frequently left unmarked. This is the side that invariably faced away from the Holy Land, towards the west. However, in many lowland graveyards, the side usually left unmarked is covered with extravagant designs. 19th-century ornate stone In the mid-18th century, tradesman, craftsmen and tenant farmers found themselves in a time of prosperity. A direct result of this was the increase in carefully inscribed gravestones for the common folk.  19th-century stones  The 19th century saw almost all memorial permutations of the past come back with gusto. Wall monuments, crypts, headstones, table and slab stones and even replica Hog Backs were all common designs in Victorian Scotland. The introduction of the Cast-Iron Grave Marker would simply add yet another embellishment to an already decorative art form.

The nuclear warheads in the missiles were supposed to have been removed before the missiles were taken from their storage bunker. The missiles with the nuclear warheads were not reported missing, and remained mounted to the aircraft at both Minot and Barksdale for 36 hours. During this period, the warheads were not protected by the various mandatory security precautions for nuclear weapons. The incident was reported to the top levels of the United States military and referred to by observers as a Bent Spear incident, which indicates \\"an unexpected occurrence involving nuclear weapons or nuclear components that does not fall under the NUCFLASH or BROKEN ARROW categories\\" or \\"a nuclear incident involving a nuclear weapon/warhead or nuclear component. In the Army and Air Force, this term includes a 'significant incident' as defined in DoD Directive 5100.52\\". In response to the incident, the United States Department of Defense (DoD) and USAF conducted an investigation, the results of which were released on 19 October 2007. The investigation concluded that nuclear weapons handling standards and procedures had not been followed by numerous USAF personnel involved in the incident. As a result, four USAF commanders were relieved of their commands, numerous other USAF personnel were disciplined or decertified to perform certain types of sensitive duties, and further cruise missile transport missions from‚Äîand nuclear weapons operations at‚ÄîMinot Air Force Base were suspended. In addition, the USAF issued new nuclear weapons handling instructions and procedures. Separate investigations by the Defense Science Board and a USAF \\"blue ribbon\\" panel reported that concerns existed on the procedures and processes for handling nuclear weapons within the Department of Defense but did not find any failures with the security of United States nuclear weapons. Based on this and other incidents, on 5 June 2008, Secretary of the Air Force Michael Wynne and Chief of Staff of the Air Force General T. Michael Moseley were asked for their resignations, which they gave. In October 2008, in response to recommendations by a review committee, the USAF announced the creation of Air Force Global Strike Command to control all USAF nuclear bombers, missiles, and personnel. Background AGM-129A cruise missile in flight In August 2007, Minot Air Force Base was the home of the 5th Bomb Wing (5 BW) and Barksdale Air Force Base was the home of 2nd Bomb Wing (2 BW), both of which fell under the 8th Air Force (8 AF), also based at Barksdale. At the time, the 5 BW, the 2 BW, and the 8 AF were all subordinate organizations of Air Combat Command (ACC). Both bomb wings and 8 AF had previously been units of the Strategic Air Command (SAC) until a 1992 reorganization of the Air Force's major commands (MAJCOMs) had resulted in the disestablishment of SAC and the reassignment and merger of its manned bomber force with the former Tactical Air Command (TAC), which was primarily the USAF's fighter aircraft force. The new organization was named Air Combat Command (ACC), although it retained both TAC's organizational insignia and TAC's former headquarters at Langley AFB, Virginia. At the time of the incident, the 5th Bomb Wing was commanded by Colonel Bruce Emig, the 2nd Bomb Wing by Colonel Robert Wheeler, the 8th Air Force by Lieutenant General Robert Elder Jr., and ACC by General Ronald Keys. The 5th Bomb Wing, according to the USAF's statement on the wing's mission, served with its B-52H bombers as part of the USAF's conventional and strategic combat force. The \\"strategic\\" portion of the 5th's mission included the ability to deliver nuclear weapons against potential targets worldwide. Thus, Minot Air Force Base stored and maintained a ready arsenal of nuclear bombs, nuclear warheads, and associated delivery systems, including the AGM-129 Advanced Cruise Missile. The AGM-129 was fielded in 1987 as a stealthy cruise missile platform to deliver the W80-1 variable yield nuclear warhead. Although originally designed to equip the B-1B Lancer bomber, the AGM-129 was redesignated so that it would only be carried by the B-52H, mounted on external pylons on the wings or internally in the bomb bay. In March 2007, the USAF decided to retire its AGM-129 complement in order to help comply with international arms-control treaties and to replace them with AGM-86 missiles. In order to do so, the USAF began to transport its AGM-129s stored at Minot to Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana by B-52s for ultimate disposal. According to The Washington Post, by 29 August 2007, more than 200 AGM-129s had been shipped from Minot to Barksdale in this manner. Incident Between 0800 and 0900 (local time) on 29 August 2007, a group of USAF airmen, called the breakout crew, entered one of the weapons storage bunkers at Minot to prepare AGM-129 missiles for transport to Barksdale. That day's missile transport, the sixth of twelve planned ferry missions, was to have consisted of twelve AGM-129s, installed with training warheads, with six missiles per pylon and one pylon mounted under each wing of a Barksdale-assigned, 2nd Bomb Wing B-52 aircraft. When the airmen entered the bunker, six live warheads were still installed on their missiles, as opposed to having been replaced with the dummy training warheads. A later investigation found that the reason for the error was that the electronic production system for tracking the missiles \\"had been subverted in favor of an informal process that did not identify the pylon as prepared for the flight.\\" The airmen assigned to handle the missiles used outdated materials that contained incorrect information on the status of the missiles. The missiles originally planned for movement had been replaced by missiles closer to expiration dates for limited life components, which was standard procedure. The change in missiles had been reflected on the movement plan but not in the documents used for internal work coordination processes in the bunker. An AGM-129 pylon is loaded onto the wing of a B-52 at Minot. Although the breakout crew in the weapons storage began to inspect the missiles, an early-arriving transport crew hooked up the pylons and towed them away without inspecting or ensuring that the missiles had been inspected or cleared for removal. The munitions control center failed to verify that the pylon had received proper clearance and inspection and approved the pylon for loading on the B-52 at 0925. After taking eight hours to attach the pylons, the aircraft with the missiles loaded then remained parked overnight at Minot for 15 hours without the special guard required for nuclear weapons. On the morning of 30 August one of the transport aircraft's flight officers, a Barksdale-assigned B-52 instructor radar navigator, closely inspected the six missiles on the right wing only, which were all properly loaded with training warheads. The B-52 command pilot did not do a final verification check, before signing the manifest listing the cargo as a dozen unarmed AGM-129 missiles to depart Minot. The B-52 departed Minot at 0840 and landed at Barksdale at 1123 (local times) on 30 August. The aircraft remained parked and without special guard until 2030, when a munitions team arrived to remove the missiles. After a member of the munitions crew noticed something unusual about some of the missiles, at 2200 a \\"skeptical\\" supervisor determined that nuclear warheads were present and ordered them secured and the incident reported, 36 hours after the missiles were removed from the bunker at Minot. General T. Michael Moseley, USAF chief of staff at the time of the incident The incident was reported to the National Military Command Center as a Bent Spear incident. General T. Michael Moseley, Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force, quickly called United States Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, on 31 August to inform him about the incident. Gates requested daily updates regarding the investigation and informed President Bush about the incident. The USAF has yet to officially designate what type of incident actually occurred, Bent Spear or otherwise. The incident was the first of its kind in 40 years in the United States and was later described by the media as \\"one of the worst breaches in U.S. nuclear weapons security in decades\\". Response by the U.S. government The USAF and Department of Defense at first decided to conceal the incident, in part because of the USAF policy not to comment on the storage or movement of nuclear weapons and an apparent belief that the incident would not generate much public concern. In fact, the initial DoD incident report contained the statement, \\"No press interest anticipated.\\" Details of the incident were then leaked by unknown DoD officials to the Military Times newspaper, which published a small article about the incident on 5 September 2007. In response, a 5 September news briefing at the Pentagon by Press Secretary Geoff Morrell stated that at no time was the public in any danger and that military personnel had custody of the weapons at all times. The USAF announced that within days of the incident, the USAF relieved the Minot munitions squadron commander of duty and eventually disciplined 25 airmen. USAF Major General Doug Raaberg was assigned by General Keys to lead an investigation into the incident. The USAF inventory of nuclear warheads was checked to ensure that all warheads were accounted for. In addition, the DoD announced that a Pentagon-appointed scientific advisory panel, called the Defense Science Board, would study the mishap as part of a larger review of procedures for handling nuclear weapons. On 28 September, the USAF announced that General Keys was retiring and would be replaced as ACC commander by General John Corley, effective 2 October. USAF Secretary Michael Wynne and Major General Richard Newton brief the results of the USAF investigation into the incident at the Pentagon on 19 October 2007. On 19 October 2007, United States Secretary of the Air Force Michael Wynne and USAF Major General Richard Newton, deputy chief of staff for operations, plans, and requirements, announced the investigation report findings, stating that \\"there has been an erosion of adherence to weapons-handling standards at Minot Air Force Base and at Barksdale Air Force Base\\" and that \\"a limited number of airmen at both locations failed to follow procedures.\\" Colonel Emig, the commander of the 5th Bomb Wing, Colonel Cynthia Lundell, the commander of the 5th Maintenance Group at Minot, and Colonel Todd Westhauser, the commander of Barksdale's 2d Operations Group, and four senior non-commissioned officers from the 5th Munitions Squadron \\"received administrative action\\" and were relieved of their commands or positions and reassigned. All of the 5th Bomb Wing personnel were stripped of their certifications to handle nuclear and other sensitive weaponry and to conduct \\"specific missions\\". Sixty-five airmen of varying ranks lost their Personnel Reliability Program certifications. Tactical ferry operations were suspended. The inspector general offices of all USAF Major Commands that handle nuclear weapons were directed to conduct immediate \\"Limited Nuclear Surety Inspections (LNSIs) at every nuclear-capable unit\\" with oversight provided by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency. The new ACC commander, General Corley, referred the matter to USAF Lieutenant General Norman Seip, commander of the 12th Air Force, as a court-martial convening authority to determine if additional charges or actions would be taken against any of the personnel involved in the incident. Seip later closed the investigation without recommending criminal charges against anyone involved. Retired USAF Chief of Staff General Larry Welch was asked by Gates, who had reportedly raised concerns with USAF officials that the original investigation may have unfairly limited blame to midlevel officers, to lead the Defense Science Board advisory panel that would study the mishap as part of a larger review of procedures and policies for handling nuclear weapons. In addition, the USAF chartered a \\"blue ribbon\\" review chaired by USAF Major General Polly Peyer and consisting of 30 additional personnel to \\"make recommendations as to how we can improve the Air Force's capability to safely and securely perform our nuclear weapons responsibility\\". Furthermore, the United States Congress requested that the DoD and the United States Department of Energy conduct a bottom-up review of nuclear procedures. Aftermath=USAF actions Colonel Joel Westa became the new commander of the 5th Bomb Wing in the wake of the incident. On 24 October 2007, Secretary of the Air Force Wynne told the House Armed Services Committee that he believed that the 5th Bomb Wing could be recertified and could resume ferrying the AGM-129 cruise missiles to Barksdale for retirement. He did not provide a timeline for that recertification process. On 1 November 2007 Colonel Joel Westa took command of the 5th Bomb Wing. That same day, General Keys retired from the Air Force. Personnel from Barksdale's 2d Bomb Wing temporarily took over maintenance duties of Minot's nuclear stockpile until the 5th Bomb Wing could be recertified. A nuclear surety inspection (NSI), required for recertification, originally scheduled for the 5th Bomb Wing for 23 January 2008 was postponed after the wing failed an initial NSI that took place on 16 December 2007. Another initial NSI was completed on 29 March and Corley recertified the wing on 31 March 2008. A full NSI was scheduled for May 2008. The wing needed to regain its certification in order to hold the full NSI. Units handling nuclear weapons must pass NSIs every 18 months in order to retain their certifications. The USAF issued a new policy directive regarding the handling of nuclear weapons and delivery systems, which prohibits the storing of nuclear armed and nonnuclear armed weapons in the same storage facility. The directive further instructs that all nonnuclear munitions and missiles must be labeled with placards clearly stating that they are not armed with nuclear warheads. Wing commanders are now charged with approving any movement of nuclear weapons from weapons storage areas and must appoint a single individual as a munitions accountability system officer and weapons custodian. All units that handle nuclear weapons must develop a coordinated visual inspection checklist. The policy further directs that airmen charged with handling or maintaining nuclear weapons cannot be on duty for longer than 12 hours, unless during an emergency, when their duty period can be extended to a maximum of 16 hours. The USAF has since instituted a program of surprise inspections at nuclear-armed bases. Review reports Larry Welch (1984) Welch and Peyer briefed the results of their reviews before the United States Senate Committee on Armed Services on 12 February 2008. In addition to Welch and Peyer, Lieutenant General Daniel Darnell, USAF Deputy Chief of Staff for Air, Space and Information Operations, and Major General Raaberg testified and answered questions from the Senate committee's members. During the hearing, Welch stated that \\"the military units responsible for handling the bombs are not properly inspected and, as a result, may not be ready to perform their missions.\\" He added, \\"If you look at all the areas and all the ways that we have to store and handle these weapons in order to perform the mission, it just requires, we believe, more resources and more attention than they're getting.\\" Welch's report concluded that the combining of DoD nuclear forces with nonnuclear organizations has led to \\"markedly reduced levels of leadership whose daily focus is the nuclear enterprise and a general devaluation of the nuclear mission and those who perform the mission.\\" Nevertheless, neither Welch's nor Peyer's reports found any failures with the security of United States nuclear weapons. Responding to Welch's and Peyer's reports, USAF officials stated that they were already implementing many of the recommendations contained in the reports but added that existing regulations governing nuclear procedures were satisfactory. During his testimony before the senate committee, Darnell stated that \\"the Air Force portion of the nuclear deterrent is sound, and we will take every measure necessary to provide safe, secure, reliable nuclear surety to the American public.\\" Inspections, resignations, and further discipline Minot's full NSI took place beginning on 17 May 2008, and was conducted by inspectors from the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) and the USAF's Air Combat Command (ACC). On 25 May, the DTRA issued the 5th Bomb Wing an \\"unsatisfactory\\" rating, the lowest rating possible, from the inspection. The 5th passed the inspection in nine of ten areas, but failed in the area of nuclear security. Following the inspection, Westa stated, \\"Overall, their assessment painted a picture of some things we need to work on in the areas of training and discipline\\". The 5th Bomb Wing Security Forces Squadron Commander, Lieutenant Colonel John Worley, was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel Stephen Weaver on 16 June 2008. In spite of failing the NSI, the wing kept its nuclear certification. Said Hans Kristensen, director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists about the 5th's failure in the inspection, \\"It makes you wonder what's going on elsewhere, like the nuclear weapons stationed at bases overseas, and at Barksdale Air Force Base and Whiteman Air Force Base.\\" Minot passed the follow-up inspection on 15 August 2008. Robert Gates (2006) On 5 June 2008, Robert Gates announced the results of an investigation into the incorrect shipment in 2006 of four Mk 12 forward-section reentry vehicle assemblies to Taiwan. The investigation, conducted by Admiral Kirkland H. Donald, director of U.S. Naval Nuclear Propulsion, found that the Taiwan missile incident was, in Gates' words, \\"a degradation of the authority, standards of excellence and technical competence within the nation's ICBM force. Similar to the bomber-specific August 2007 Minot-Barksdale nuclear weapons transfer incident, this incident took place within the larger environment of declining Air Force nuclear mission focus and performance\\" and that \\"the investigation identified commonalities between the August 2007 Minot incident and this [the Taiwan] event.\\" In his investigation report, Donald stated that the issues identified by his investigation were \\"indicative of an overall decline in Air Force nuclear weapons stewardship, a problem that has been identified but not effectively addressed for over a decade. Both the Minot-Barksdale nuclear weapons transfer incident and the Taiwan misshipment, while different in specifics, have a common origin: the gradual erosion of nuclear standards and a lack of effective oversight by Air Force leadership.\\" As a result of the investigation, Gates announced that \\"a substantial number of Air Force general officers and colonels have been identified as potentially subject to disciplinary measures, ranging from removal from command to letters of reprimand,\\" and that he had accepted the resignations of Secretary of the Air Force Michael Wynne and USAF Chief of Staff T. Michael Moseley. Gates added that he had asked James R. Schlesinger to lead a senior-level task force to recommend improvements in the stewardship and operation of nuclear weapons, delivery vehicles and sensitive components by the Department of Defense. Members of the task force came from the Defense Policy Board and the Defense Science Board. On 13 September 2008, Gates announced Schlesinger's task force's recommendations by calling on the USAF to place all nuclear weapons under a single command. The task force suggested that the new command be called Air Force Strategic Command, which would replace the current Air Force Space Command, and make it accountable for the nuclear mission. It also called for all USAF bombers to be placed under a single command. In addition, the task force recommended that the USAF move an additional 1,500 to 2,000 airmen into nuclear-related jobs. Gates announced that acting Air Force Secretary Michael B. Donley and Chief of Staff General Norton A. Schwartz were \\"reviewing the recommendations\\" for disciplinary action against USAF officers previously involved in the nuclear mission. The task force found an \\"unambiguous, dramatic and unacceptable decline in the Air Force's commitment to perform the nuclear mission and, until very recently, little has been done to reverse it.\\" On 25 September 2008, the United States Department of Defense announced that six Air Force generals, two Army generals, and nine colonels had received letters of reprimand, admonishment, or counseling. Two Air Force major generals were asked to stay in their current position and the others either retired, planned to retire, or were removed from their position. Air Force Chief of Staff Norton Schwartz met with each officer personally before issuing the letters. He noted that they had committed no offense under the UCMJ, but \\"did not do enough to carry out their leadership responsibilities for nuclear oversight\\" and \\"for that they must be held accountable.\\" The Air Force stated that the discipline was in response to the mistaken shipment of nuclear fuzes to Taiwan, not for the Minot nuclear weapons incident. One of those reprimanded was Lieutenant General Kevin Sullivan, Air Force Deputy Chief of Staff for Logistics, Installations and Mission Support at the Pentagon. Sullivan was demoted and retired at the rank of major general in November 2008. Lieutenant General Michael Hamel, commander of the Space and Missile Systems Center, received a letter of admonishment and also retired in November 2008. Major General Roger Burg, commander of the Twentieth Air Force, Major General Kathleen Close, commander of the Ogden Air Logistics Center, Brigadier General Francis Bruno, Director of Logistics, Air Force Materiel Command, and Brigadier General Arthur Cameron III, Air Force director of resource integration, also received letters of admonishment. In November 2008, the 341st Missile Wing at Malmstrom Air Force Base failed its nuclear surety inspection. The 90th Missile Wing at F. E. Warren Air Force Base failed its nuclear surety inspection one month later. In November 2009 at Kirtland Air Force Base the 377th Air Base Wing, commanded by Colonel Michael S. Duvall, and 498th Nuclear Systems Wing, commanded by Colonel Richard M. Stuckey, failed their nuclear surety inspections. On 30 October 2009 Westa was relieved as commander of the 5th Bomb Wing by Major General Floyd L. Carpenter, commander of 8th Air Force under \\"perfection is the standard\\" philosophy. Carpenter stated that Westa was relieved for his \\"inability to foster a culture of excellence, a lack of focus on the strategic mission and substandard performance during several nuclear surety inspections, including the newly activated 69th Bomb Squadron.\\" On 8 January 2009 Schlesinger's task force released its report regarding the overall DoD's management of the country's nuclear weapons mission. The report criticized the DoD for a lack of focus and oversight on its nuclear weapons programs and recommended that the DoD create a new assistant secretary position to oversee its nuclear management. The task force found that within the DoD only the United States Navy was effectively managing its nuclear arsenal. The panel stated that it found \\"a distressing degree of inattention to the role of nuclear weapons in deterrence among many senior DoD military and civilian leaders.\\" New command USAF Secretary Michael Donley discusses the creation of the Global Strike Command with media representatives at the Pentagon on 24 October 2008. On 24 October 2008 new USAF Secretary Michael Donley announced the creation of Air Force Global Strike Command, which became operational on 7 August 2009. The USAF's intercontinental nuclear missile force was moved from Air Force Space Command to the new command. Barksdale Air Force Base was selected as the location of the new command's headquarters. The new major command is led by General Robin Rand and controls all USAF nuclear-capable bombers, missiles, and personnel.

It is considered a good example of pioneer architecture and construction in Elgin County, and a valuable relic of early settlement days in Southwestern Ontario, if not in the province. It is an example of Georgian architecture, a two-storey structure of stone and brick, it features a symmetrical five bay front fa√ßade with a central door and two sets of flanking windows on the main floor, and five on the second storey. Fieldstone chimneys rise from the end gables and connect to fireplaces on each floor. This house, \\"similar to many early Quaker homes in the Township of Norwich, was built into the side of a hill to accommodate a basement kitchen. This feature provided more space in an otherwise small home and was suitable for baking in the heat of the summer as well as the chill of winter.\\"The cider Press, The Norwich and District Museum and Archives, Volume 38, Issue 3, Fall 2007 With the house built into the Sparta moraine, the back of the second storey opens to the ground level. Local legend has it that this feature allowed one of the rebels of the Rebellions of 1837 to escape pursuing Loyalist forces. Whether or not that story is true, it is documented that John Moore, though a United Empire Loyalist and a Quaker, became a leading advocate of reform in the turbulent 1830s, and was charged with treason in the aftermath of the failed rebellion.St. Thomas Times-Journal, Thursday, August 9, 2007 John‚Äôs son, Joseph, was also arrested and died in prison from an infection related to the squalid living conditions. John was released and continued on as a prominent farmer in the Yarmouth Township area. One brother Elias Moore was the area MPP in the 12th Parliament of Upper Canada and the 13th Parliament of Upper Canada. A third brother, Enoch, was also sentenced to hang for his part in the rebellions. Around this same time, John's younger brother, Lindley Murray Moore was founding an Anti-Slavery Society in Rochester, N.Y.. The bricks used in the John Moore house were made on his farm, one of the five springs there supplying water to form a shallow pool, where oxen trod the clay to proper consistency to use as mortar for the walls and foundations. Lime was secured by burning stopes found on the hillside, and it is more than probable that John Moore was the first to use Elgin lime for building purposes. The size, shape and pale strawberry tint, prove beyond doubt the old hand-made brick, so easily distinguished from the later product of brickyards of larger size and deeper red as to color. The stones used in combination with bricks were gathered from the farm, and the solid face this old home presents to the world today makes this an outstanding example of the skills and determination of Ontario's early pioneers.

It was released in late 1969 as part of the group's new recording contract with Polydor Records. It would be the only album Polydor released of the band as they broke up before its release. History & Production In 1969, the group parted ways with their production company Albert Productions and their international record company United Artists Records. After signing with Polydor Records, the Easybeats teamed up with producer Ray Singer for the single \\"St. Louis\\" and its B-side \\"I Can't Find Love\\". The single failed to chart in the UK, but reached #21 on the Go-Set Charts in their home country of Australia. In August the band's key songwriters, Harry Vanda and George Young, took over a small recording studio located in an apartment in Moscow Road, London. The studio was previously used for recording jingles for pirate radio. The pair used the studios to record various demos for other artists, sometimes using other members of the Easybeats to contribute instrumentation and vocals. These demo recordings, along with the two songs recorded with Ray Singer were released by Polydor as Friends in the UK and Australia. Release In February 1970 the album was listed on the new release schedule as being the group's final album. Between Australia and the UK there are two different versions of the song \\"Friends\\". On the Australian LP, the song is a faster paced version sung by George Young (titled \\"Friends\\") while in the U.K. it is a slower ballad sung by Harry Vanda titled \\"Who Are My Friends\\". Vanda's \\"Who Are My Friends\\" was released as a single in the UK and Australia (under the same title as George's \\"Friends\\"). The album was released in Europe and Canada as Holding On and was due for U.S. release under the title Easy Ridin' through Rare Earth Records. This release would be canceled. It was reissued on vinyl in 1980 in Australia as part of the Rock Legends series. Repertoire Records released the album on compact disc twice (1992 and 2006).

Both the November 2011 Bering Sea cyclone and the November 2014 Bering Sea cyclone were post-tropical cyclones that had dissipated and restrengthened when the systems entered the Aleutian Low region. The storms are remembered and marked as two of the strongest storms to impact the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands with pressure dropping below 950 mb in each system. The magnitude of the low pressure creates an extreme atmospheric disturbance, which can cause other significant shifts in weather. Following the November 2014 Bering Sea cyclone, a huge cold wave, November 2014 North American cold wave, hit the US bringing record breaking low temperatures to many states.  Effects  The low serves as an atmospheric driver for low-pressure systems, post-tropical cyclones and their remnants and can generate strong storms that impact Alaska and Canada. Intensity of the low is strongest in the winter and almost completely dissipates in the summer. The circulation pattern is measured based on averages of synoptic features help mark the locations of cyclones and their paths over a given time period. However, there is significant variability in these measurements. The circulation pattern shifts during the Northern Hemisphere summer when the North Pacific High takes over and breaks apart the Aleutian Low. This high-pressure circulation pattern strongly influences tropical cyclone paths. The presence of the Eurasian and North American continents prevent a continuous belt of low pressure from developing in the Northern Hemisphere sub-polar latitudes, which would mirror the circumpolar belt of low pressure and frequent storms in the Southern Ocean. However, the presence of the continents disrupts this motion, and the subpolar belt of low pressure is well developed only in the North Pacific (the Aleutian Low) and the North Atlantic (the Icelandic Low, which is located between Greenland and Iceland).

He was a member of the Whig Party (United States) until its dissolution, at which time he joined the early modern day Republican Party (United States). He served as a member of the Indiana State Senate (1857‚Äì59, 1869‚Äì71), as a common pleas court judge (1860‚Äì64), and as an alternate delegate to the Republican National Convention (1868). Early life and education John Green was born May 20, 1807 to James and Catherine Green in Yancey County, North Carolina. Both of his grandfathers were veterans of the Revolutionary War. Green's parents moved to the Indiana Territory in 1810 and settled in Jefferson County. During the War of 1812 his father was enrolled as a ranger, or home-guard. Between 1828-1838, beginning one year after its establishment, he entered Hanover College the oldest private college in Indiana. He began his college education with ministry in mind, but later changed his mind. In 1832 settled in Tipton, Indiana and pursued a career in farming until 1839, when he began studying law under the Honorable Lyle Wilberforce of Madison, Indiana. In 1842 he was licensed to practice law and was later admitted to practice in the Federal and Supreme Courts. Career In 1856 he was first elected to the Indiana State Senate and served four years. While a member of the Upper House he was chairman of the Swamp Land Committee. After his term he was elected Judge of the Common Pleas Court for four years. He was then re-elected in 1868 to the State Senate and was named as chairman of the Committee on the Organization of Courts. Personal life A three time widower, he was married to: Mary Marshall (1829-1865) of Jefferson County, widow of Robert Marshall, Catherine A. Humerrikhouse (?-1875), and Caroline Passwater (daughter of a Judge Cottingham). He was also the adoptive parent of John Green Brady (May 25, 1847 ‚Äì December 17, 1918) who was an American politician and the Governor of the District of Alaska from 1897 to 1906.

He was previously a member of the South Carolina House of Representatives from 1997 through 2000. Pinckney was a senior pastor at Mother Emanuel A.M.E. in Charleston. On June 17, 2015, Pinckney was murdered by Dylann Roof in a racially motivated mass shooting at an evening Bible study at Pinckney's church. U.S. President Barack Obama delivered the eulogy at Pinckney's funeral nine days later. Early life and education Clementa Carlos Pinckney was born on July 30, 1973 in Beaufort, South Carolina. His mother, Theopia Stevenson Aikens (n√©e Brooms; 1945‚Äì2005), was an early childhood development educator, and his father, John Pinckney, was an auto mechanic. Pinckney had at least six brothers and sisters. He began preaching at his church at age 13 and, by age 18, he was appointed pastor. Pinckney's maternal family, the Stevensons, has many generations of pastors in the African Methodist Episcopal Church (AMEC). His maternal great-grandfather, Reverend Lorenzo Stevenson, brought a lawsuit against the state's Democratic Party to end unintegrated primaries. During the Civil Rights Movement, Pinckney's maternal uncle, Reverend Levern Stevenson, worked with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) to desegregate school buses, and sued South Carolina Governor John C. West to create single- member districts to help elect more blacks into the South Carolina General Assembly. Pinckney's paternal family are based in the Beaufort, South Carolina area and may be descendants of slaves owned by Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, who was instrumental in framing the United States Constitution and was part of the Middleton-Rutledge-Pinckney family, a family that included many politicians. The Pinckney Island National Wildlife Refuge is where the plantation was located. Pinckney went to Jasper County High School, where he was elected class president for two years. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree from Allen University in 1995 and went on to obtain a Master of Public Administration degree from the University of South Carolina in 1999. He then received a Master of Divinity degree from Lutheran Theological Southern Seminary. Pinckney was a student at Wesley Theological Seminary pursuing a Doctor of Ministry degree at the time of his death.  Career = Religious career  Pinckney preached in Beaufort, Charleston, and Columbia. He became pastor of Emanuel A.M.E. Church in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2010. As part of his work, Pinckney oversaw 17 churches in the area. In his leadership position at Mother Emanuel, Pinckney followed in the footsteps of Reverend Richard H. Cain and other AME church leaders, continuing a tradition of religious leaders serving in political positions with a focus on political activism in service to his community. Pinckney said he felt a deep connection between serving his community in politics in complement to his ministry work. Historian Henry Louis Gates, Jr. featured Pinckney in interviews for his award-winning PBS series The African Americans: Many Rivers to Cross. Pinckney was among several South Carolina pastors to hold rallies after the shooting of Walter Scott in 2015, attracting some local controversy.  Legislative career  Pinckney was first elected to the South Carolina General Assembly in 1996 at the age of 23, becoming the youngest African American elected as a South Carolina state legislator. He served in the South Carolina House of Representatives until being elected to the South Carolina Senate in 2000. Pinckney was a Democrat and was a member of the South Carolina Legislative Black Caucus. Pinckney represented Allendale, Beaufort, Charleston, Colleton, Hampton, and Jasper Counties in South Carolina. At the time of his death, he was on the following Committees: Banking and Insurance, Corrections and Penology, Education, Finance, and Medical Affairs. As a state senator, Pinckney pushed for laws to require police and other law enforcement officials to wear body cameras after Walter Scott, an unarmed black man, was shot eight times in the back by a police officer in North Charleston. In April 2015, Pinckney gave an impassioned speech on the topic at the South Carolina Senate, citing the fact that national news had come to North Charleston because of the video tape of the incident.  Murder  Barack Obama delivers the eulogy at the funeral of Reverend Clementa Pinckney 2015-06-26 On the night of June 17, 2015, Pinckney was killed in the Charleston church shooting. He spent the earlier part of that day campaigning with Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in Charleston. That evening, he led a Bible study and prayer session at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, where he was senior pastor. The shooter, Dylann Roof, specifically asked for Pinckney and later opened fire on the congregation, killing Pinckney and eight others. While the FBI investigated the mass shooting as a hate crime, many others considered the attack a racially motivated act of terrorism, and criticized law enforcement and the media for not labeling it as such. On June 24, 2015, there was a public viewing of Pinckney's casket in the rotunda lobby of the State Capitol Senate Chamber where Pinckney served in the South Carolina legislature, and where his body lay in state. Public viewings were held at St. John AME Church in Ridgeland, South Carolina, and Mother Emanuel in Charleston, South Carolina. A funeral was held on June 26, 2015, at the College of Charleston in TD Arena, which was filled up to maximum capacity, necessitating a viewing center with a video feed at the Charleston Museum. President Barack Obama, Michelle Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, and Jill Biden, among many other politicians and public figures, attended the funeral, with Obama giving the eulogy. During the eulogy, Obama sang the opening stanza of \\"Amazing Grace\\". A recording of Obama's singing was later sampled in the Coldplay song \\"Kaleidoscope\\" from the album A Head Full of Dreams.  Aftermath  As a result of the shooting, in July 2015, the South Carolina Legislature enacted legislation to take down the Confederate flag flying in front of the South Carolina State House and move it to the Confederate Relic Room and Military Museum. The shooter had previously posed in front of and posted images of a similar flag on his website. Pinckney's widow attended the session during the final vote to thank her husband's colleagues for their support. In June 2015, the family of Pinckney established the Clementa C. Pinckney Foundation to support poor families in the South Carolina Lowcountry region. Jennifer Pinckney, his wife, Senator Gerald Malloy, who served with Pinckney in the Senate, and Reverend Kylon Jerome Middleton, Ph.D., Pinckney's best friend, established the foundation in Pinckney's honor to support educational, health, pastoral training, and charitable causes. In July 2015, Mother Emanuel, in response to anonymous donations of more than $3 million, established The Reverend Pinckney Scholarship Fund, which was created to support education scholarship for church members, victims of the shooting and their extended families. The initial fund was overseen by Charleston Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr, historian and educator Henry Louis Gates Jr and investment banker William M. Lewis Jr. In August 2015, the Charleston County School District decided to name new Charleston County middle school Simmons-Pinckney Middle School, in honor of both Pinckney and blacksmith Philip Simmons. On August 8, 2019, the Churchwide Assembly of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America adopted a resolution to recognize Clementa C. Pinckney and the Emanuel 9 as martyrs on their liturgical calendar and declare June 17 as \\"a day of repentance in the ELCA for the martyrdom of the Emanuel 9.\\" At the time of the shooting, Dylann Roof was a member of an ELCA congregation. The Rev. Clementa Pinckney was a graduate of Lutheran Theological Southern Seminary, a seminary of the ELCA.  Personal life  In 1999, Pinckney married Jennifer Pinckney (n√©e Benjamin) in Augusta, Georgia. They met while he was at Allen University and she was at the University of South Carolina. The couple lived in Ridgeland, South Carolina with their two daughters, Eliana Yvette Pinckney and Malana Elise Pinckney. Pinckney was a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. Pinckney was named in honor of the baseball player Roberto Clemente of the Pittsburgh Pirates due to his mother's love of baseball. During his eulogy, multiple friends and family pronounced his first name as \\"Clemen-tay\\". Pinckney is the cousin of the businessman and conservative commentator Armstrong Williams. Pinckney was buried in Marion, South Carolina at the St. James AME Cemetery. ReferencesExternal links * Senator Clementa C.

At the end of December she bombarded the defenses at Wilmington in support of the first assault against Fort Fisher. Returning on 13 January 1865, she again turned her guns on that fort; sent men and boats to participate in the successful assault on the 15th; then resumed blockade duties.

It was developed by British software consultant Michael A. Jackson in the 1990s.  History  The problem frames approach was first sketched by Jackson in his book Software Requirements & Specifications (1995) and in a number of articles in various journals devoted to software engineering. It has received its fullest description in his Problem Frames: Analysing and Structuring Software Development Problems (2001). A session on problem frames was part of the 9th International Workshop on Requirements Engineering: Foundation for Software Quality (REFSQ)] held in Klagenfurt/Velden, Austria in 2003.9th International Workshop on Requirements Engineering: Foundation for Software Quality (REFSQ) held in Klagenfurt/Velden, Austria in 2003. The First International Workshop on Applications and Advances in Problem FramesFirst International Workshop on Applications and Advances in Problem Frames was held as part of ICSE‚Äô04 held in Edinburgh, Scotland. One outcome of that workshop was a 2005 special issue on problem frames in the International Journal of Information and Software Technology. The Second International Workshop on Applications and Advances in Problem FramesSecond International Workshop on Applications and Advances in Problem Frames was held as part of ICSE 2006 in Shanghai, China. The Third International Workshop on Applications and Advances in Problem Frames (IWAAPF) was held as part of ICSE 2008 in Leipzig, Germany. In 2010, the IWAAPF workshops were replaced by the International Workshop on Applications and Advances of Problem-Orientation (IWAAPO). IWAAPO broadens the focus of the workshops to include alternative and complementary approaches to software development that share an emphasis on problem analysis.International Workshop on Applications and Advances of Problem-Orientation IWAAPO-2010 was held as part of ICSE 2010 in Cape Town, South Africa. Today research on the problem frames approach is being conducted at a number of universities, most notably at the Open University in the United Kingdom as part of its Relating Problem & Solution Structures research themeRelating Problem & Solution Structures research theme.For example: \\"Relating software requirements and architectures using problem frames\\" by Hall, J.G.; Jackson, M.; Laney, R.C.; Nuseibeh, B.; Rapanotti, L., in Proceedings of the IEEE Joint International Conference on Requirements Engineering (2002), pp. 137‚Äì144 The ideas in the problem frames approach have been generalized into the concepts of problem-oriented development (POD) and problem-oriented engineering (POE), of which problem- oriented software engineering (POSE) is a particular sub-category. The first International Workshop on Problem-Oriented Development was held in June 2009.  Overview = Fundamental philosophy  Problem analysis or the problem frames approach is an approach ‚Äî a set of concepts ‚Äî to be used when gathering requirements and creating specifications for computer software. Its basic philosophy is strikingly different from other software requirements methods in insisting that: * The best way to approach requirements analysis is through a process of parallel ‚Äî not hierarchical ‚Äî decomposition of user requirements. * User requirements are about relationships in the real world‚Äîthe application domain ‚Äì not about the software system or even the interface with the software system. The approach uses three sets of conceptual tools.  Tools for describing specific problems  Concepts used for describing specific problems include: phenomena (of various kinds, including events), problem context, problem domain, solution domain (aka the machine), shared phenomena (which exist in domain interfaces), domain requirements (which exist in the problem domains) and specifications (which exist at the problem domain:machine interface). The graphical tools for describing problems are the context diagram and the problem diagram.  Tools for describing classes of problems (problem frames)  The Problem Frames Approach includes concepts for describing classes of problems. A recognized class of problems is called a problem frame (roughly analogous to a design pattern). In a problem frame, domains are given general names and described in terms of their important characteristics. A domain, for example, may be classified as causal (reacts in a deterministic, predictable way to events) or biddable (can be bid, or asked, to respond to events, but cannot be expected always to react to events in any predictable, deterministic way). (A biddable domain usually consists of people.) The graphical tool for representing a problem frame is a frame diagram. A frame diagram looks generally like a problem diagram except for a few minor differences‚Äîdomains have general, rather than specific, names; and rectangles representing domains are annotated to indicate the type (causal or biddable) of the domain.  A list of recognized classes of problems (problem frames)  The first group of problem frames identified by Jackson included: # required behavior # commanded behavior # information display # simple workpieces # transformation Subsequently, other researchers have described or proposed additional problem frames.  Describing problems = The problem context  Problem analysis considers a software application to be a kind of software machine. A software development project aims to change the problem context by creating a software machine and adding it to the problem context, where it will bring about certain desired effects. The particular portion of the problem context that is of interest in connection with a particular problem ‚Äî the particular portion of the problem context that forms the context of the problem ‚Äî is called the application domain. After the software development project has been finished, and the software machine has been inserted into the problem context, the problem context will contain both the application domain and the machine. At that point, the situation will look like this: center The problem context contains the machine and the application domain. The machine interface is where the Machine and the application domain meet and interact. The same situation can be shown in a different kind of diagram, a context diagram, this way:  The context diagram  The problem analyst's first task is to truly understand the problem. That means understanding the context in which the problem is set. And that means drawing a context diagram. Here is Jackson's description of examining the problem context, in this case the context for a bridge to be built: : You're an engineer planning to build a bridge across a river. So you visit the site. Standing on one bank of the river, you look at the surrounding land, and at the river traffic. You feel how exposed the place is, and how hard the wind is blowing and how fast the river is running. You look at the bank and wonder what faults a geological survey will show up in the rocky terrain. You picture to yourself the bridge that you are going to build. (Software Requirements & Specifications: \\"The Problem Context\\") An analyst trying to understand a software development problem must go through the same process as the bridge engineer. He starts by examining the various problem domains in the application domain. These domains form the context into which the planned Machine must fit. Then he imagines how the Machine will fit into this context. And then he constructs a context diagram showing his vision of the problem context with the Machine installed in it. The context diagram shows the various problem domains in the application domain, their connections, and the Machine and its connections to (some of) the problem domains. Here is what a context diagram looks like. This diagram shows: * the machine to be built. The dark border helps to identify the box that represents the Machine. * the problem domains that are relevant to the problem. * the solid lines represent domain interfaces ‚Äî areas where domains overlap and share phenomena in common. A domain is simply a part of the world that we are interested in. It consists of phenomena ‚Äî individuals, events, states of affairs, relationships, and behaviors. A domain interface is an area where domains connect and communicate. Domain interfaces are not data flows or messages. An interface is a place where domains partially overlap, so that the phenomena in the interface are shared phenomena ‚Äî they exist in both of the overlapping domains. You can imagine domains as being like primitive one-celled organisms (like amoebas). They are able to extend parts of themselves into pseudopods. Imagine that two such organisms extend pseudopods toward each other in a sort of handshake, and that the cellular material in the area where they are shaking hands is mixing, so that it belongs to both of them. That's an interface. In the following diagram, X is the interface between domains A and B. Individuals that exist or events that occur in X, exist or occur in both A and B. Shared individuals, states and events may look differently to the domains that share them. Consider for example an interface between a computer and a keyboard. When the keyboard domain sees an event Keyboard operator presses the spacebar the computer will see the same event as Byte hex(\\"20\\") appears in the input buffer.  Problem diagrams  The problem analyst's basic tool for describing a problem is a problem diagram. Here is a generic problem diagram. In addition to the kinds of things shown on a context diagram, a problem diagram shows: * a dotted oval representing the requirement to bring about certain effects in the problem domains. * dotted lines representing requirement references ‚Äî references in the requirement to phenomena in the problem domains. An interface that connects a problem domain to the machine is called a specification interface and the phenomena in the specification interface are called specification phenomena. The goal of the requirements analyst is to develop a specification for the behavior that the Machine must exhibit at the Machine interface in order to satisfy the requirement. Here is an example of a real, if simple, problem diagram. This problem might be part of a computer system in a hospital. In the hospital, patients are connected to sensors that can detect and measure their temperature and blood pressure. The requirement is to construct a Machine that can display information about patient conditions on a panel in the nurses station. The name of the requirement is \\"Display ~ Patient Condition\\". The tilde (~) indicates that the requirement is about a relationship or correspondence between the panel display and patient conditions. The arrowhead indicates that the requirement reference connected to the Panel Display domain is also a requirement constraint. That means that the requirement contains some kind of stipulation that the Panel display must meet. In short, the requirement is that The panel display must display information that matches and accurately reports the condition of the patients.  Describing classes of problems = Problem frames  A problem frame is a description of a recognizable class of problems, where the class of problems has a known solution. In a sense, problem frames are problem patterns. Each problem frame has its own frame diagram. A frame diagram looks essentially like a problem diagram, but instead of showing specific domains and requirements, it shows types of domains and types of requirements; domains have general, rather than specific, names; and rectangles representing domains are annotated to indicate the type (causal or biddable) of the domain.  Variant frames  In Problem Frames Jackson discussed variants of the five basic problem frames that he had identified. A variant typically adds a domain to the problem context. * a description variant introduces a description lexical domain * an operator variant introduces an operator * a connection variant introduces a connection domain between the machine and the central domain with which it interfaces * a control variant introduces no new domain; it changes the control characteristics of interface phenomena  Problem concerns  Jackson also discusses certain kinds of concerns that arise when working with problem frames. Particular concerns * overrun * initialization * reliability * identities * completeness Composition concerns * commensurable descriptions * consistency * precedence * interference * synchronization  Recognized problem frames  The first problem frames identified by Jackson included: # required behavior # commanded behavior # information display # simple workpieces # transformation Subsequently, other researchers have described or proposed additional problem frames.  Required-behavior problem frame  The intuitive idea behind this problem frame is: * There is some part of the physical world whose behavior is to be controlled so that it satisfies certain conditions. The problem is to build a machine that will impose that control.  Commanded-behavior problem frame  The intuitive idea behind this problem frame is: * There is some part of the physical world whose behavior is to be controlled in accordance with commands issued by an operator. The problem is to build a machine that will accept the operator's commands and impose the control accordingly.  Information display problem frame  The intuitive idea behind this problem frame is: * There is some part of the physical world about whose states and behavior certain information is continually needed. The problem is to build a machine that will obtain this information from the world and present it at the required place in the required form.  Simple workpieces problem frame  The intuitive idea behind this problem frame is: * A tool is needed to allow a user to create and edit a certain class of computer-processible text or graphic objects, or similar structures, so that they can be subsequently copied, printed, analyzed or used in other ways. The problem is to build a machine that can act as this tool.  Transformation problem frame  The intuitive idea behind this problem frame is: * There are some given computer-readable input files whose data must be transformed to give certain required output files. The output data must be in a particular format, and it must be derived from the input data according to certain rules. The problem is to build a machine that will produce the required outputs from the inputs.  Problem analysis and the software development process  When problem analysis is incorporated into the software development process, the software development lifecycle starts with the problem analyst, who studies the situation and: * creates a context diagram * gathers a list of requirements and adds a requirements oval to the context diagram, creating a grand \\"all-in-one\\" problem diagram. (However, in many cases actually creating an all-in-one problem diagram may be impractical or unhelpful: there will be too many requirements references criss-crossing the diagram to make it very useful.) * decomposes the all-in-one problem and problem diagram into simpler problems and simpler problem diagrams. These problems are projections, not subsets, of the all-in-one diagram. * continues to decompose problems until each problem is simple enough that it can be seen to be an instance of a recognized problem frame. Each subproblem description includes a description of the specification interfaces for the machine to be built. At this point, problem analysis ‚Äî problem decomposition ‚Äî is complete. The next step is to reverse the process and to build the desired software system though a process of solution composition. The solution composition process is not yet well understood, and is still very much a research topic. Extrapolating from hints in Software Requirements & Specifications, we can guess that the software development process would continue with the developers, who would: * compose the multiple subproblem machine specifications into the specification for a single all-in-one machine: a specification for a software machine that satisfies all of the customer's requirements. This is a non-trivial activity ‚Äî the composition process may very well raise composition problems that need to be solved. * implement the all-in-one machine by going through the traditional code/test/deploy process.  Similar approaches  There are a few other software development ideas that are similar in some ways to problem analysis. * The notion of a design pattern is similar to Jackson's notion of a problem frame. It differs in that a design pattern is used for recognizing and handling design issues (often design issues in specific object-oriented programming languages such as C++ or Java) rather than for recognizing and handling requirements issues. Furthermore, one difference is that design patterns cover solutions while in problem frames problems are represented. However, the design patterns also tend to account for semantic outcomes that are not native to the programming language they are to be implemented in. So, another difference is that problem frames is a native meta-notation for the domain of problems, whereas design patterns are a catalogue of technical debt left behind by the language implementers. * Aspect-oriented programming, AOP (also known as aspect-oriented software development, AOSD) is similarly interested in parallel decomposition, which addresses what AOP proponents call cross-cutting concerns or aspects. AOP addresses concerns that are much closer to the design and code-generation phase than to the requirements analysis phase. * AOP has moved into requirement engineering notations such as ITU-T Z.151 User Requirements Notation (URN). In URN the AOP is over the all the intentional elements. AOP can also be applied over requirement modelling that uses problem frames as a heuristic. URN models driven with problem frame thinking, and interleaved with aspects, allows for inclusion of architectural tactics into the requirement model. * Martin Fowler's book Analysis Patterns is very similar to problem analysis in its search for patterns. It doesn't really present a new requirements analysis method, however. And the notion of parallel decomposition ‚Äî which is so important for problem analysis ‚Äî is not a part of Fowler's analysis patterns. * Jon G.

He first entered the public sphere in Seattle through his involvement with the social and political movements of the 1960s, especially the underground press. He later became more widely known as a local television personality and for his pioneering work as a local historian, including co-creating the website HistoryLink.org, which he considered to be his crowning achievement. Life Born in Ferndale, Michigan, the only child of engineer and inventor Walter A. Crowley and Violet King (now Kilvinger), Walt lived in Royal Oak, Michigan, Flint, Michigan, the Washington, D.C. area and Connecticut until 1961, when his father was hired by Boeing and moved to Seattle. Crowley graduated from Seattle's Nathan Hale High School, winning state honors as an artist, and briefly worked at Boeing as an illustrator. Entering the University of Washington, he became active in local socialist, antiwar, and civil rights campaigns. In 1967, he joined Paul Dorpat's underground newspaper Helix as a cartoonist, writer, and editor. The following year he ran for the Washington State House of Representatives on the Peace & Freedom Party ticket. Crowley's service as mediator between the Seattle officials, local leaders, and the community's street people led to the founding of a youth hostel and social service agency called the U District Center, which Crowley directed from 1970 to 1972. He later worked for the Seattle Model Cities Program and then for the city itself in various planning and outreach roles. He returned to private industry in 1977 and ran unsuccessfully for the Seattle City Council. He had a variety of civic involvements afterwards, including serving as president of the venerable civic organization Allied Arts. Seattle's Blue Moon Tavern in 2007. The upper-left sign from the 1960s was made in support of liberal Democratic governor Albert Rosellini. In 1980, Crowley formed Crowley Associates, which publishes guides to Seattle and provides services for many local political campaigns. He was a columnist and commentator in many local forums, most notably having a seven- year run in a \\"Point-Counterpoint\\" format with conservative John Carlson on KIRO television. Crowley wrote several histories of local civic institutions, from the elite Rainier Club to the blue-collar Blue Moon Tavern. He led the campaign to save the Blue Moon from demolition, ran the task force that drafted new laws to restore historic Downtown theaters, and served on numerous other civic projects. HistoryLink.org In 1997, Crowley discussed preparing a Seattle/King County historical encyclopedia for the 2001 sesquicentennial of the Denny Party. His wife Marie suggested publishing the encyclopedia on the Internet. Alongside Paul Dorpat they incorporated History Ink on November 10, 1997, with seed money from Priscilla \\"Patsy\\" Collins, by birth a member of Seattle's wealthy and prominent Bullitt family. The prototype of HistoryLink.org debuted on May 1, 1998, and attracted additional funding for a formal launch in 1999. In 2003 HistoryLink.org expanded its content to cover Washington state history. Meanwhile, History Ink continues, focusing on the production of history books. Crowley and HistoryLink.org have won many awards, including *The Pacific Northwest Historians Guild's 2007 History Award * The Washington State Historic Preservation Office's award for media in 2001 * The Association of King County Historical Organizations ** Award for best long- term project (2000) ** Award for best book (2005) (Alan Stein's history of the Fairmont Olympic Hotel) Personal life Walt Crowley married graphic designer and business associate Marie McCaffrey in 1982. In 2005, Crowley was diagnosed with laryngeal cancer and fought it with characteristic stubbornness; the night before his larynx was removed, he held a \\"Famous Last (Natural) Words\\" party. He died at Virginia Mason Hospital in Seattle on September 21, 2007 at the age of 60, after suffering a stroke following an operation for the cancer.https://crosscut.com/2007/09/jean-godden-saying- goodbye-our-friend-walt-crowley Bibliography * Helix Drawings 1967-1970 (Seattle: Medium Rare, 1977) * The Compleat Browser's Guide to Pioneer Square (Seattle: Pioneer Square Association, 1981) * The Continental Family (Seattle: Continental Mortgage and Savings Bank, 1997) * Forever Blue Moon: The Story of Seattle's Most (In)Famous Tavern (Seattle: Blue Moon Tavern, 1992) * Group Health Timeline (Seattle: HistoryLink for Group Health Cooperative, 1997) * Historic Photos of Seattle (Paducah, Kentucky: Turner Publishing, 2006) * The National Trust Guide: Seattle (New York: National Trust for Historic Preservation/John Wiley & Sons, 1998) * The Rainier Club, 1888‚Äì1988 (Seattle: Rainier Club, 1988) * Rites of Passage: A Memoir of the Sixties in Seattle (Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1995) * Routes: An Interpretative History of Public Transportation in Metropolitan Seattle (Seattle: Metro Transit, 1993) * The Seattle Aquarium's Guide to Life in the Sea (Seattle: City of Seattle, 1981) * Seattle & King County Timeline (Seattle: History Ink/University of Washington Press, 2001 & 2002) * Seattle University: A Century of Jesuit Education (Seattle: Seattle University, 1991) * The Woodland Park Zoo Guide (Seattle: Woodland Park Zoological Society, 1995) * To Serve the Greatest Number: A History of Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound (Seattle: University of Washington Press/Group Health Cooperative, 1996) * William J.

She was captured by Union Navy forces during the Union blockade of the Confederate States of America, and was commissioned as a Union gunboat. Aries was named for the constellation. Although sold by the United States Navy post-war in 1865, Aries ‚Äî the first ship to bear that name for the U.S. Navy ‚Äî continued her work in the merchant service for nearly half a century, before being scrapped in 1908. Built in Sunderland, England The first U.S. Navy ship to bear the name Aries, she was laid down in 1861 at Sunderland, England, by James Laing's Deptford yard. Built during the American Civil War in the hope that she would be purchased by persons planning to break the Union blockade of the South, this iron-hulled, screw steamer was completed in 1862 and sold later that year to Frederic Peter Obicino of London, England. She has resold, apparently sometime in 1863, to the Cuban firm, V. Malga & Cie, of Havana, Cuba. Blockade running Almost no records of her career as a blockade runner seem to have survived, but we know that Aries did enter that chancy business, for a Confederate report on cotton exports between 1 November 1862 and 31 May 1863 states that she carried 740 tons of cotton out of either Wilmington, North Carolina, or Charleston, South Carolina. The number of her voyages to the South is unknown; and, in any case, her efforts to supply the Confederacy ended on 28 March 1863. Capture by Union Navy forces Shortly after midnight, lookouts on screw steamer Stettin ‚Äî herself an erstwhile blockade runner now, following capture, turned blockader ‚Äî spotted Aries off Bull's Bay, South Carolina, attempting to slip through the blockade with a cargo of liquor. The Union screw gunboat immediately weighed anchor and gave chase. When the runner was within range, Stettin opened fire on Aries and continued the pursuit until shoal water forced her to anchor. At daybreak, Stettin's commanding officer, Acting Master Edward F. Devens, saw that his quarry had run ashore on the south end of Petrel Bank. He immediately lowered two boats, and, \\"...taking command in person... went on board and took possession of her as a prize to the U.S. Government.\\" Since the blockade runner was aground astern, Devens had her cargo shifted forward; and the stranded steamer floated free with the rising tide. Devens took Aries via Charleston to Port Royal, South Carolina, where Rear Admiral Samuel Francis DuPont stated that she \\"...is the most perfect example of a blockade runner we have yet seen ‚Äî her masts lower in a peculiar way, invented for this very purpose.\\" He ordered her north for adjudication in admiralty court and, since Devens was ill, detached him from Stettin and placed him in charge of the prize crew for the voyage to Boston, where she was condemned and purchased there by the Navy on 20 May 1863. Civil War operations=New England shoreline terrorized While Aries was being fitted out for service in the Union Navy, Lt. Charles W. Read, CSN, in the prize Clarence, captured the bark Tacony; shifted his crew to her as a better vessel; and began a cruise north and off the New England shoreline in which he terrorized Union shipping and frightened Northern coastal cities. To still the clamor of frightened citizens for protection from this \\"rebel pirate,\\" Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles sent out a number of warships in pursuit of the commerce raider and promised that Aries would soon join them. However, before Aries was ready for sea, other Union warships closed in on Read and compelled him to surrender his force. Aries was placed in commission at the Boston Navy Yard on 25 July 1863, Acting Vol. Lt. Edward F. Devens in command. Assigned to the South Atlantic blockade On the day of her commissioning, the screw steamer sailed for Port Royal, South Carolina, carrying 200 men: marines to help Rear Admiral John A. Dahlgren build up his forces for a renewed attack on Fort Wagner which guarded the seaward approaches to Charleston, South Carolina. After disembarking her passengers, she got underway again for Fortress Monroe, Virginia, carrying word that Dahlgren's coal had been exhausted and that \\"... a supply can not be forwarded too soon.\\" From Hampton Roads, Virginia, Aries proceeded to New York City where she took on board two hundred more men for the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron, before heading south once more. At sea in hurricane- force winds After delivering these replacements at Port Royal, she embarked some 100 passengers‚Äîmostly either sailors who were too ill to remain in a fighting zone or men whose periods of enlistment had expired. However, during her voyage north, she encountered a fearful storm off Cape Lookout, North Carolina, on 27 August and suffered engine failure while fighting its waves. The wind was so severe that Comdr. John J. Almy ‚Äî the commanding officer of which chanced upon the disabled Aries on 1 September ‚Äî described the weather as worse \\"... than I ever recollect to have seen it in the course of my sea service of more than twenty-one years.\\" The commanding officer of another Union warship, stated that \\"... had the hurricane ... continued with unabated force much longer this ship (Pocahontas) could not have outlived it...\\" Connecticut took Aries in tow and proceeded via Beaufort, North Carolina, to Hampton Roads, Virginia, where they arrived on the 6th. Two days later, the screw steamer arrived and towed Aries to Baltimore, Maryland, for repairs. Capturing the blockade runner Ceres Early in November, as the yard work on Aries was approaching completion, Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles ordered Devens to proceed in her to the waters off Wilmington, North Carolina, for duty in the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron. Her first action in this new assignment began at daybreak on 6 December when one of her lookouts spotted a steamer aground on Western Bar near Smith's Island, North Carolina. Aries got underway immediately and headed for the stranded blockade runner which soon proved to be the new British, iron-hulled, screw-propelled steamer Ceres which had departed Bermuda on the 3d and had struck bottom while attempting to slip into the Cape Fear River sometime on the night of the 5th and 6th. When shoal water compelled Aries to heave to, Devens launched two boats which continued on to the blazing Ceres. Upon boarding the prize, the boat parties set to work with fire buckets trying to quench the flames and stuck to the task despite fire from Southern batteries ashore. Meanwhile, the officers in charge of the boats broke into the captain's cabin and found a number of papers which contained highly valuable intelligence. Finally ‚Äî after realizing that, despite the diligent efforts of the Union bluejackets, the flames were gaining on the bucket handlers ‚Äî the boat parties withdrew from the British blockade runner and returned to their own ship. That night, the rising tide refloated Ceres; and, early the following morning, observers on the blockaders could see her drifting seaward. A boat's crew from boarded the prize, anchored her in safe water, and ‚Äî with men from Aries, , and Connecticut ‚Äî put out the remaining fires. Aries then towed the erstwhile blockade runner to Beaufort, the prize's first stop on a voyage via Hampton Roads to Washington, D.C. for adjudication. Capturing blockade runner Antonio After delivering Ceres to Beaufort, Aries returned to blockade duty off Wilmington. At dawn on 20 December, men on board the ship sighted steam rising from a strange vessel, some four miles away to the east, southeast. Shortly thereafter, Union blockader , appeared, closing the potential prize while Aries joined in the pursuit. As she neared shoal waters, Aries anchored in four fathoms of water and sent an armed boat bearing a boarding party to the blockade runner. They learned that the stranger was the Confederate blockade runner Antonio which previously had won considerable renown under the names Lamar and Herald playing a cat-and-mouse game with Federal blockaders as she carried contraband cargo into Southern ports and escaped to sea, laden each time with between 1,000 and 1,200 bales of cotton. The night before she had been taking the part of the mouse as she ran aground while attempting to slip into the Cape Fear River with a cargo consisting primarily of potable spirits. After brief efforts to pull free proved futile, Capt. W. F. Adair, the commander of the steamer, ordered his crew to abandon their ship and to head for the nearest land in boats, hoping to reach shore before daylight. However, they were spotted by Union blockader Governor Buckingham and captured by that steamer and the Federal tug Violet. Men from Aries and from several other Union ships remained on board Antonio, for the next few days laboring in vain to refloat the prize. When rising water in the grounded and damaged steamer's hull made it clear that the effort could not possibly succeed, the Federal sailors finally left the ship on Christmas Eve. Burning blockade runner Dare Aries' next adventure came at the end of the first week of 1864. Shortly after daybreak on 7 January, while his ship was lying within the entrance of Little River, North Carolina, Devens \\"...discovered a strange steamer standing to the E.S.E., with the in chase of her...\\" Aries immediately got underway to join in the pursuit and gained on the stranger. Weather was bad and, about 8:20 a.m., thick fog settled and hid the fleeing steamer. When it lifted a bit over an hour later, the chase was considerably closer than she had been when last seen. Aries opened fire, and her shot fell close to the target. This accuracy prompted the blockade runner to haul \\"... to the westward...\\" However, the steamer ran aground close to North Inlet, near Georgetown, South Carolina; and her crew escaped to shore. Closing fast, Aries came to anchor to avoid being stranded herself and \\"...immediately sent two armed boats to board the steamer and get her off.\\" High surf thwarted their efforts to refloat the prize, so the boats' crews set the vessel afire and returned to Aries with word that the blockade runner was the Confederate steamer Dare. Unfortunately, Aries second cutter swamped in the surf during the expedition resulting in the capture of two of its officers and seven enlisted men by Confederate forces. A boat from Montgomery also capsized with the loss of two officers and fourteen men who were imprisoned. Continuing interception operations On the evening of 10 January, orders reached Lt. Devens to send his boats to assist which had run aground that morning while attempting to refloat the stranded blockade runner Bendigo near Lockwood's Folly Inlet. About midnight, her boats ‚Äî along with some from , , and Governor Buckingham ‚Äî received the officers and men of the doomed Union screw steamer. The following morning, 11 January, Aries joined Minnesota, Daylight, and Governor Buckingham in chasing the blockade runner Ranger which was attempting to enter the Cape Fear River with a cargo from Newcastle upon Tyne, England. The Northern ships drove the steamer aground where she was abandoned by her crew. However, their efforts to refloat Ranger as a prize were stopped by Southern sharpshooters \\"...whose fire completely commanded her (Ranger's) decks.\\" Since it was impossible to take possession of Ranger, the Union sailors burned her. While these actions were taking place, black smoke was spotted in the direction of Shallotte Inlet. Aries, which had been withdrawn from her station in that quarter the previous night, was sent to investigate. She soon came across \\"... a fine-looking double propeller blockade runner, resembling Ceres, beached and on fire between Tubb's and Little River Inlets ...\\" Once more Southern sharpshooters prevented Union parties from boarding the steamer, extinguishing the flames, and taking possession of the prize. The next day, after the riflemen had withdrawn, Devens did manage to board the ship and learned that she was Vista, a sister ship of Ceres. However, serious damage to her hull made it impossible to refloat the blockade runner, and her two anchors were his only booty. Shelled by shore batteries Aries' next lively action came two months later. On 14 March, she and drove a large, long, and low side-wheel steamer ashore on the west point of Oak Island, near the Western Bar, off Wilmington. Their approach to the unidentified potential prize ‚Äî which resembled the recently captured North Carolina blockade runner A. D. Vance ‚Äî was ended by shelling from Southern shore batteries. Much of the spring and summer, Aries was out of action undergoing repairs; but she returned to duty off Wilmington in September. On 28 October, she assisted and in capturing the English steamer Lady Sterling. Again on the night of 6 November, Aries \\"...discovered a strange steamer ...\\", immediately gave chase, opened fire on the stranger, and threw rockets to the eastward, indicating his course. Nevertheless, despite assistance in the pursuit by Maratanza and Eolus and the blockade runner's being briefly stranded, a rising tide and clever seamanship enabled the steamer to escape to safety in Wilmington. On 3 December, Aries joined five other ships in shelling blockade running steamer Ella which Union blockader had forced aground on Marshall Shoal, Smith's Island, North Carolina, \\"... placing her in a condition which rendered it impossible to get her off...\\" Attack on Fort Fisher Years of labor and the endurance of tedium by the sailors who manned the Union warships on blockade duty were finally strangling the Confederacy. Not only were more and more blockade runners being destroyed and captured, but joint Army-Navy operations were snatching one seaport after another from the South. As the year 1864 drew to a close, only one major port remained in Confederate hands, Wilmington, where Aries had served almost exclusively since entering the Union Navy. And, at that time, plans were well advanced for an amphibious attack against Fort Fisher which guarded that last center of Southern maritime activity. Aries was in the reserve division of a vast task force which departed Beaufort on 18 December and headed for the mouth of the Cape Fear River. Troops went ashore on Christmas Eve and seriously threatened Fort Fisher; but the Army commander, Major General Benjamin F. Butler, feared that his troops could not cope with the Southern forces that defended the Confederate works. As a result, he ordered his men to re-embark. Second attack on Fort Fisher Dissatisfied with Butler's lack of resolution, Rear Admiral David Dixon Porter ‚Äî the commander of the naval forces in the operation ‚Äî pressed Washington, D.C., for a renewed attack. Early in January 1865, a mighty force was assembled for a new effort against Fort Fisher. Aries, although again assigned to the reserve division, helped to land troops on the 13th and, once they were ashore, supported the troops for the next two days. The defenders finally capitulated on the 15th, shutting off the South from all foreign aid. The Confederacy was now doomed. Reassigned to the East Gulf blockade After supporting mopping up operations in the vicinity of Wilmington for the remainder of January and all of February, Aries departed Hampton Roads on the morning of 5 March and headed for Key West, Florida, to join the East Gulf Blockading Squadron. However, when she reached Florida waters, her machinery necessitated her remaining in port undergoing repairs into May. She was then sent to sea to cruise off Havana, Cuba, to intercept should that Confederate raider attempt to escape to sea. After Stonewall's commanding officer, Capt. Thomas Jefferson Page, learned of the end of the war and turned his ship over to Spanish authorities, Post-war sale and subsequent career Aries returned to Key West. On 1 June, she was ordered to Boston, Massachusetts, where she was decommissioned at the Boston Navy Yard on the 14th of that month. Sold at public auction at Boston on 1 August 1865 to Sprague, Soule & Co., the steamer was documented on 12 August 1865 as SS Aries. She retained her original name throughout a long career in merchant service carrying freight between Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and New England ports. She was sold in 1908 for scrapping.

She was armed with heavy guns and assigned to the Union blockade of the waterways of the Confederate States of America. Built in Brooklyn, New York Bienville built at Brooklyn, New York in 1860. She was a two-masted sail-steamer, with a Walking beam steam engine driving a pair of side paddle wheels. The Union Navy bought her in August 1861 as part of the great expansion that took place in the first months of the American Civil War. Civil War operations=Assigned to the South Atlantic blockade She was commissioned in October 1861 and soon took part in the expedition that seized future Naval bases at Port Royal and Beaufort, South Carolina. Bienville operated off the Confederacy's Atlantic coast for more than a year, taking part in the capture of positions along the Georgia and Florida shore as well as ending the careers of several blockade runners, among them the steamships Stettin (later ) (taken on May 24, 1862) and Patras (May 27, 1862). Gulf of Mexico operations Bombardment and Capture of Port Royal, South Carolina, November 7, 1861 In 1863 USS Bienville was transferred to the Gulf of Mexico, where she continued her blockading work. She supported the capture of the entrances to Mobile Bay, Alabama on August 5, 1864. The USS Princess Royal and Bienville was stationed off the coast of Texas blockading Galveston. On the night of February 7, 1865, the two gunships sent a boat party into Galveston Bay, Texas to seize two schooners loaded with cotton. The actual prize sought was the destruction of Wren, a ship built by Laird, Son & Co. of Birkenhead (no. 317), along with sister ship (no. 318) the Lark, for Fraser, Trenholm and Company. The Wren had run aground February 6, 1865, but was freed narrowly escaping capture, and moored inside Galveston Harbor. The schooners Pet, with 256 bales of cotton on board, and Annie Sophia, with 220 bales, were anchored near the main channel at Fort Point. Acting Ensign George French was dispatched with twenty seamen and three officers to destroy the Wren and capture the schooners. Successful in capturing the schooners they were not able to get to the Wren. Decommissioning and civilian career Bienville was decommissioned soon after the end of the Civil War. After about two years in reserve, she was sold in October 1867. She operated under the same name as a commercial steamship until August 15, 1872, when a fire destroyed her at Watling Island, Bahamas.

It was the second game show to be produced and broadcast on the network, produced by Albie Hecht, Alan Goodman, and Fred Seibert, of Chauncey Street Productions in New York City. The series was hosted by Jordan Brady with Stuffy Shmitt as co-host and announcer. Shmitt also provided music along with his band Zombo Combo. Gameplay Three contestants tested their musical knowledge. Rounds 1 and 2 In each round, four categories each with three point values (10, 20 & 30 points) were displayed on a video wall. The player in control selected a category, then host Brady asked a question. The first player to ring-in had a chance to answer. A correct answer added the chosen points to the score, and chose another category, but an incorrect answer gave the opponents a chance to answer. Round one was played with normal music questions, while round two was played with audio/video clips using the video wall. Regular categories in round 2 include: Total Recall: Contestants are shown thirty seconds of a music video. After the clip was played, the players were asked questions about the video. Sing This: Contestants must sing the next verse after a music video stopped. Say What?: Contestants have to repeat the lyrics the singer sang in the music video. Talk Radio: An audio clip of an interview was played (the video featured a VU meter). Contestants must identify the artist. Spare Parts: A portion of a photograph of an artist was shown and Brady reads a clue about the artist. Pick a Player: A member of the band asks a question about musicians who play the same instrument as he/she does. During the round, a horn playing the Charge fanfare would sound, indicating one minute of gameplay remained for the round. The round ended when all 12 questions were asked or if time ran out (the band would play the theme song, signaling the round's end). The two high-scorers at the end of round two went on to play the final round, \\"Add-A-Track.\\" Add-A-Track (Final round) In the final round, the two surviving players listened to four songs for two minutes (30 seconds per song). On each song, only one musical instrument played the song, with a new one added every five seconds. The player rang in once he/she thought they could identify the song. If correct, that player earned the points plus a prize; if wrong, the opposing player got a chance to answer. Each song had a different point value: *1st song - 25 points *2nd song - 50 points *3rd song - 75 points *4th song - 100 points The scores from the previous two rounds were not carried over until after the round was over, at which point the scores from the Add-A-Track round were added to the scores from the other two rounds. The player with a most points won the game and a prize. In addition, if a player had correctly identified all four songs in the Add-A-Track round, he/she won a grand prize.

Organizational ethics is interdependent with the organizational culture. Although it is akin to both organizational behavior and industrial and organizational psychology as well as business ethics on the micro and macro levels, organizational ethics is neither organizational behavior nor industrial and organizational psychology, nor is it solely business ethics (which includes corporate governance and corporate ethics). Organizational ethics express the values of an organization to its employees and/or other entities irrespective of governmental and/or regulatory laws. Ethics are the principles and values used by an individual to govern his or her actions and decisions.Matthews, J. (n.d.). Eight Elements of an Ethical Organization. Retrieved November 30, 2014, from http://www.entrepreneurship.org/resource-center/eight-elements-of- an-ethical-organization.aspx An organization forms when individuals with varied interests and different backgrounds unite on a common platform and work together towards predefined goals and objectives. A code of ethics within an organization is a set of principles that is used to guide the organization in its decisions, programs, and policies.Kelchner, L. (n.d.). The Importance of Ethics in Organizations. Retrieved November 30, 2014, from http://smallbusiness.chron.com/importance-ethics-organizations-20925.html An ethical organizational culture consists of leaders and employees adhering to a code of ethics. Overview An organization's ethical philosophy can affect the organization in many ways including its reputation, productivity, and the bottom line of the organization. Ethics within an organization can offer many benefits. A positive ethical corporate culture improves the morale among the workers in an organization, which could increase productivity, employee retention and loyalty. Higher productivity improves the efficiency of the organizations and increased employee retention reduces the cost of replacing employees. Other essential benefits of an ethical culture include better internal communication and wider community development through corporate social responsibility. In the USA, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act restricts the United States business firms from engaging in bribery and other illegal practices internationally. There are laws that have the same type of prohibition for European companies which create a disadvantage competitively for both European and U.S. firms.Svensson, Jakob, ‚ÄúWho Must Pay Bribes and How Much? Evidence from a Cross-Section of Firms,‚Äù Quarterly Journal of Economics, 118(2003), page 207 Such laws are not a restricting element to organizations that have highly elevated ethical behavior as part of their values. Organizations that lack ethical practices as a mandatory basis of their business structure and corporate culture, have commonly been found to fail due to the absence of business ethics. Corporate downfalls would include, but are not limited to, the recent Enron and WorldCom scandals, two primary examples of unethical business practices concerning questionable accounting transactions. Organizations focusing on encouraging ethical practices are commonly viewed with respect by their employees, the community, and corresponding industries.Managing with Soul: Combining Corporate Integrity with the Bottom Line,‚Äù November 14, 2003, www.hreonline.com/HRE. Ethical business practices of organizations have resulted in a solid financial bottom- line. This has been seen through greater sales and increased revenue by companies retaining talented personnel and attracting new skilled employees. More importantly, an ethical organization will have the ability to retain employees that are experienced and knowledgeable (generally referred to as human capital). This human capital results in less employee turnover, less training time for new employees, and greater output regarding services (or production of goods). Basic ethical elements There are at least four elements that aim to create an ethical culture and behavior of employees within an organization. These elements are: # a written code of ethics and standards (ethical code) # ethics training for executives, managers, and employees # the availability of ethical situational advice (i.e. advice lines or offices) # confidential reporting systemsClark, Margaret M., JD., SPHR, \\"Corporate Ethics Programs Make a Difference, but not the only difference\\", HR Magazine, July 1, 2003, page 36. Organizations are constantly striving for a better ethical atmosphere within the business climate and culture. Businesses must create an ethical business climate in order to develop an ethical organization. Otherwise said, companies must focus on the ethics of employees in order to create an ethical business. Employees must know the difference between what is acceptable and unacceptable in the workplace. These standards are found in the written code of ethics or may be referred to as the employee handbook. These standards are a written form of employee conduct and performance expectations. Employee handbooks also commonly include rules concerning expectations and consequences that follow misconduct. Handbooks normally will clearly state the rules, guidelines, and standards of an organization as well as possible rules, regulations, and laws that they are bound by. Many company handbooks will include laws regarding sexual harassment, alcohol abuse, and drug/substance abuse. For more information regarding situational ethical principles, refer to \\"Situational Ethics.\\" Intrinsic and extrinsic organizational rewards The intrinsic and extrinsic rewards of an ethical organization are bound to an organization's culture and ethics. Based on the reliability and support structure of each of the four areas needed for ethical behavior, the organizational ethics will be evident throughout the organization. The organization including the employees, managers, suppliers, customers, and other entities, will receive intrinsic and extrinsic rewards. Actions of employees can range from whistle blowing (intrinsic) to the extraordinary actions of hourly employee purchasing all the recently produced peanut butter (as produced by his employer), that has no resale value due to mislabeled jars. This employee was aware that his employer (extrinsic) would reimburse him in full for purchasing the mislabeled peanut butter.Peters, T.J., and Austin, N. ,(1985), Passion for Excellence: The Leadership difference. New York: Ballantine. For more information regarding intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, see \\"Intrinsic and Extrinsic Motivation.\\" Ethical theory and leadership empowerment There are many theories and organizational studies that are related to ‚Äúorganizational ethics,‚Äù but \\"organizations\\" and \\"ethics\\" are wide and varied in application and scope. These theories and studies can range from individual(s), team(s), stakeholder, management, leadership, human resources, group(s) interaction(s), as well as the psychological framework behind each area to include the distribution of job tasks within various types of organizations. As among these areas, the influence of leadership in any organization cannot go unexamined, because of a clear understanding of the organization‚Äôs vision, goals (to include immediate and long-term strategic plans), and values. Leadership sets the tone for organizational management (strategic actions taken by an organization to create a positive image to both internal and external public). In turn, leadership directly influences the organizational symbolism (which reflects the culture, the language of the members, any meaningful objects, representations, and/or how someone may act or think within an organization). The values and ideals within an organization generally center upon ‚Äúvalues for business‚Äù as the theoretical approach most leaders use to present to their \\"co-members\\" (which in truth maybe subordinates). In fact, an examination of business reveals that most leaders approach the X(?) from the perspective of values for the business.Dricscoll, Dawn-Marie and Hoffman, W. Michael (2002). Ethics Matters: How to Implement Values-Driven ManagementMcDaniel, Charlotte, (2004), Organizational Ethics: Research and Ethical Environments, page 39 Alongside presenting the vision, values, and goals of the organization, the leader should infuse empowerment and motivation to its members. Leaders using empowerment to motivate their subordinates, is based upon the view of: ‚ÄúAchieving organizational ownership of company values is a continuous process of communication, discussion, and debate throughout all areas of the organization‚ÄùDricscoll, Dawn-Marie and Hoffman, W. Michael, (2002), Ethics Matters: How to Implement Values-Driven Management, page 172 as. For more information about organization theory, refer to \\"Organizational Theory.\\" Stakeholder theory Whether it is a team, small group, or a large international entity, the ability for any organization to reason, act rationally, and respond ethically is paramount. Leaders must have the ability to recognize the needs and desires of members (or called ‚Äústakeholders‚Äù in some theories or models), and how they correspond to the organization. It is the stakeholder theory that implies that all stakeholders (or individuals) must be treated equally, regardless of the fact that some individuals will contribute more than others to the organization.D.A. Gioia, (1999), \\"Practicability, Paradigms, and Problems in Stakeholder Theorizing,\\" Academy of Management Review, 24(2), pp. 228‚Äì232. Leaders who motivate others must present the goals of an organization to the stakeholders with respect to particular benefits of the stakeholders. Leaders must set aside individual (or personal) ambitions (along with any prejudice) in order to present these goals properly. Furthermore, it is leadership that influences stakeholders towards ethical behavior for the organization. They must step behind a veil of ignorance and treat every stakeholder as a means with equal weight. Importantly, the leader (or stakeholder management) must possess the necessary skills and rank to ensure that each stakeholders voice is respected and heard within the organization to ensure that other voices are not expressing views (or needs as in respects to Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs). Therefore, stakeholder management must ensure an ethical system for their own management styles, personalities, systems, performances, plans, policies, strategies, productivity, openness, and even risk(s) within their cultures or industries. Ethical system implementation The function of developing and implementing business ethics into an organization is difficult. Due to each organization's culture and atmosphere being different, there is no clear or specific way to implement a code of ethics to an existing business. Business ethics implementation can be categorized into two groups; formal and informal measures. Formal measures include training and courses pertaining to ethics. Informal measures are led by example from either the manager or the social norm of the company. There are several steps to follow when trying to implement an ethical system. Some of these steps include obtaining a commitment from the board of directors and senior managers, developing resources for ethics initiatives, and determining ethical risks and developing contingency plans. Other steps include developing an ethics program that addresses risks while still maintaining compliance with the ethical standards, providing insight for implementation and audits of the ethical programs, and communicating with stakeholders to create shared commitment and values for ethical conduct. The implementation should be performed to the entirety of the business including all areas of operations. If it is not implemented pragmatically and with caution for the needs, desires, and personalities (consider the Big Five personality traits) of the stakeholders, the culture, and the employees, then problems may arise. Although a great deal of time may be required, stakeholder management should consider the Rational Decision- Making Model for implementation of various aspects, details, and standards of an ethical system to the stakeholders. If an implementation has been performed successfully, then all stakeholders have accepted the newly designed ethics system for the organization. With the implementation of an ethical system comes the implementation of new tasks and responsibilities. The responsibilities include leadership in ethics, delegating, and communicating as well as motivating the company‚Äôs ethical position to its employees. Some corporations have tried to burnish their ethical image by creating whistle- blower protections, such as anonymity. In the case of Citi, they call this the Ethics Hotline. Though it is unclear whether firms such as Citi take offences reported to these hotlines seriously or not.

Since the Meiji period, many Itoman fishermen have migrated to other parts of Okinawa Prefecture, with their haaree races. For example, they started the boat race in Ishigaki City of the Yaeyama Islands in 1906. Ethnologist Matsuo K≈çichi noted that in some coastal communities of the Miyako and Yaeyama Islands, boat races were no longer associated with the yukka nu hii festival but with the harvest festival of the 6th lunar month or the shichi festival of the 9th month.

Over the next fifty-four years, its annual concert series formed the most sophisticated musical phenomenon in North America. Due to loss of the organization's administrative records during the American Civil War, much inaccurate information about the society has been published. Its important role in the formation of early American musical culture has largely been overlooked. Although its musical patronage ended in 1820, the St. Cecilia Society continues to flourish today as one of South Carolina's oldest and most exclusive social institutions. Origin Many writers have labeled Charleston's St. Cecilia Society the first musical society in the United States, but it would be more accurate to describe it as the earliest known private subscription concert organization in North America. Similar subscription concert organizations, such as the Academy of Ancient Music, abounded in mid-18th-century Britain, and similar subscription series also appeared in Boston, New York City, and Philadelphia in the mid-1760s. Unlike those northern examples that were founded as public commercial ventures run by professional musicians, however, Charleston's St. Cecilia Society was established as a private organization. It was incorporated and administered by gentlemen amateurs, who contracted with professional musicians to present an annual series of private concerts.The details of the St. Cecilia Society early management and finances are found in Butler, Votaries of Apollo, 63-111. This arrangement not only endowed the society with a more secure financial base, but also ensured its survival beyond the initial generation of founders. Since the loss of the society's earliest records, its founding date has been the subject of a good deal of speculation and confusion.The loss of the society's early records is confirmed in Butler, Votaries of Apollo, 43-44. A wide range of dates, spanning from as early as 1732 to as late as 1784, has been published in various books and articles over the past century, but the year 1762 is most often cited in reference to the society's origin. Unfortunately, this widely accepted date is grounded on inaccurate information taken from secondary sources. The preponderance of historical evidence, of which there is a considerable amount, clearly places the founding of Charleston's St. Cecilia Society in the year 1766.A detailed discussion of the historical confusion about the St. Cecilia Society's founding date can be found in Butler, Votaries of Apollo, 40-44. Early membership The full list of the early members of Charleston's St. Cecilia Society perished with the rest of its records during the Civil War. Recent efforts to reconstruct the early membership from archival sources have yielded more than two hundred names, which, while representing only a fraction of the membership, allow some general conclusions to be drawn. From the beginning, the St. Cecilia Society's membership included the most prosperous planters, politicians, lawyers, physicians, and merchants in the South Carolina Lowcountry. As with other social organizations and political institutions formed in 18th-century South Carolina, the society's early membership consisted entirely of white Protestant men, the majority of whom were members of the Anglican or Episcopal Church.A list of the known members of the society during its first half century, drawn from extant archival sources, is included in Butler, Votaries of Apollo, 273-78. Following the example of the numerous subscription concert organizations in late 18th- century Britain, the membership of the St. Cecilia Society was (and still is) open only to men. Women have formed a significant part of the audience at the society's events since 1767, but they have never been considered as members of the organization.Butler, Votaries of Apollo, 21-22, 48-49, 81-84. Concert series Over the span of 54 years of concert activity, 1766 to 1820, the St. Cecilia Society presented 43 seasons of regular concerts. The eleven years of apparent inactivity were the result of the American Revolution (eight seasons, autumn 1775 - spring 1783), financial complications (two seasons, autumn 1788 ‚Äì spring 1790), and the War of 1812 (one season, autumn 1814 - spring 1815). While the date of the commencement and termination of each season varied from year to year, the concerts generally began in mid-autumn and continued fortnightly through early spring. The number of concerts each season also varied, but over the course of half a century they averaged at least eight or nine performances per season.A reconstructed calendar of the St. Cecilia Society's concerts, 1766-1820, is included in Butler, Votaries of Apollo, 259-64. Elegant balls or dancing assemblies replaced the concerts after 1820, but dancing was not a new addition to the society's activities. Beginning with its inaugural season in 1766-67, each concert was followed by several hours of social dancing.Butler, Votaries of Apollo, 48. Since 1820, however, dancing assemblies have been the focus of the society's annual events.Fraser, Reminiscences of Charleston, 61; Butler, Votaries of Apollo, 59-61. Audience A number of music historians have described the St. Cecilia Society's performances as among the earliest public concerts in the United States. This statement is misleading, however, as the society's concerts were never \\"public\\" events in the modern American sense of the word. From the beginning, the St. Cecilia concerts were open only to members of the society and their guests, including the ladies of the members' families and invited gentlemen. The early success of its concerts prompted the society to enact measures to control access to its events. Many of its early rules articulated the eligibility requirements for male guests and expressly prohibited the admission of \\"boys.\\"See the discussions of the society's rules and its distribution of tickets for ladies in Butler, Votaries of Apollo, 265-72. Performance venues In its long history, the St. Cecilia Society has never owned or built its own performance space. During its concert era the society hired eight different venues in Charleston, ranging in size from approximately 1,000 to nearly . Four of these structures still survive: the Great Room in the Exchange Building, the Long Room of McCrady's Tavern, the South Carolina Society Hall, and the first South Carolina State House (now Charleston County Courthouse).All eight of the venues hired by the St. Cecilia Society are discussed in Butler, Votaries of Apollo, 113-50. Between 1821 and 1861, the society held its events at St. Andrew's Hall. After the Civil War it briefly used the South Carolina Society Hall and the Deutsche Freundschafts Bund Hall (now the home of Charleston's Washington Light Infantry). Since the early 1880s, its events have taken place at Hibernian Hall.Each of the numerous invitations in the St. Cecilia Society Collection at the South Carolina Historical Society, which span from 1841 through the 20th century, names the location of the event. Performers The music at the St. Cecilia Society's concerts was performed by a combination of amateurs and hired professionals. Like the British subscription concert organizations it emulated, the core of the society's early orchestra was drawn from its membership, and seasoned professionals were hired as its treasury grew. Professional musicians were usually drawn from the local population or recruited through private channels, but in 1771 the society advertised throughout the American colonies and in London to fill several positions, offering contracts for one to three years. On the eve of the American Revolution, the orchestra of the St. Cecilia Society included at least twenty musicians, including gentlemen amateurs and professionals from England, the Dutch Republic, France, Germany, Italy, and the West Indies.Butler, Votaries of Apollo, 151-74. Following several years of rebuilding its forces in the wake of the Revolution, the size of the society's orchestra was augmented in 1793 by the opening of the Charleston Theatre, with its seasonally resident orchestra, and the nearly simultaneous arrival of French musicians fleeing the Haitian Revolution. Over the next two decades, the society enjoyed a symbiotic relationship with the local theater musicians, many of whom traveled northward for the summer months and performed at other concert series.Butler, Votaries of Apollo, 175-201. Female amateurs and female professionals appeared occasionally at the St. Cecilia Society's concerts, as instrumental or vocal soloists. Professional singers, usually affiliated with the local theater, presented songs from popular English and French stage works. Young lady amateurs, generally performing on the harpsichord, piano, or harp, occasionally played solo works or appeared in small ensembles or as concerto soloists.Numerous examples of female performers at these concerts are mentioned in Butler, Votaries of Apollo, 180-94. Musical repertoire Despite the long distance between Charleston and London, the repertoire of the St. Cecilia concerts (as the society's performances were known) generally kept pace with the musical fashions of contemporary Britain. The constant commercial trade between the two cities, augmented by Charleston's fervent desire to follow English fashions, encouraged the importation of musical works by the most \\"modern\\" and \\"fashionable\\" European composers, or at least the works of composers then favored in London. Among the composers whose works were heard in Charleston between 1766 and 1820 are Carl Friedrich Abel, Johann Christian Bach, Ludwig van Beethoven, George Frideric Handel, Joseph Haydn, Leopold Kozeluch, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Josef Mysliveƒçek, Ignaz Pleyel, and Johann Stamitz.A complete discussion of the society's musical tastes and the repertoire heard in Charleston is found in Butler, Votaries of Apollo, 203-36. London musical fashions did not completely monopolize the concert repertoire heard in Charleston during this period. Thanks to the influx of French musicians in the 1790s in the wake of the French Revolution and the Haitian Revolution, the works of composers such as Fran√ßois Adrien Boieldieu, Nicolas- Marie Dalayrac, Andr√© Ernest Modeste Gr√©try, and √âtienne M√©hul were also heard in Charleston.The influence of French refugees and French repertoire on the content of the St. Cecilia Society's concerts is discussed in Butler, Votaries of Apollo, 203-36. Although several of the musicians residing in Charleston during the late 18th and early 19th centuries are known to have composed some music, the St. Cecilia Society made no effort to encourage the creation of a local musical style. Since the society measured its musical success by its ability to replicate contemporary European practices, the cultivation of a \\"native\\" musical language would have seemed too provincial for an organization that strove to appear as cosmopolitan as possible.Butler, Votaries of Apollo, 206-7. In keeping with British practices of the day, each of the St. Cecilia Society's concerts included a mix of musical genres. Orchestral works opened and closed each of the \\"acts\\" or \\"parts\\" of the concert, while a varied succession of concertos, pieces for small instrumental ensembles, and vocal selections filled the rest of the bill.Butler, Votaries of Apollo, 207-11. Cessation of concerts The termination of the society's concert series in 1820 was motivated by several factors. By 1815, musical fashions in Charleston were changing and enthusiasm for the society's concerts, a conspicuous vestige of the Age of Enlightenment, was in decline. In 1817, the Charleston Theatre Company initiated a touring circuit which disrupted the society's long- standing practice of sharing musicians with the local theater. On a number of occasions in the ensuing seasons, the St. Cecilia Society offered balls as last-minute substitutes for concerts when a sufficient number of musicians could not be procured. Finally, the Panic of 1819 unraveled the local economy and induced the organization to curtail its activities. After three increasingly meager seasons, the society held its last regular concert in the spring of 1820 and in subsequent years presented a greatly reduced number of balls.The multiple causes leading to the termination of the St. Cecilia Society concert series are examined in Butler, Votaries of Apollo, 237-51. Historical significance The St. Cecilia Society's importance as a musical institution is considerable, although this aspect of the society's heritage it is often overlooked in favor of its relatively more recent notability as an elite social organization. While the society's existence is not unknown to music historians, few details of its concert activity have heretofore been available, to facilitate comparisons with European or other early American musical phenomena. For more than a century, musicologists have been inclined to characterize 18th-century American concert life in general as a \\"feeble imitation\\" of European practices.Sonneck, Early Concert-Life in America, 8. In contrast to this conclusion, however, Nicholas Butler's recent reconstruction of the St. Cecilia Society's concert era demonstrates the existence of a robust and long-term effort in Charleston to replicate Old World models. It portrays the society as the most significant example of concert patronage in the United States before the advent of the New York Philharmonic in 1842.Butler, Votaries of Apollo, 253-58. Memories of the society's musical heritage soon faded after its records were lost during the Civil War, and subsequent writers have focused on the society's social activities and the glamour of its annual debutante ball. At the end of the 19th century, many Charlestonians began to view the St. Cecilia Society as a valuable link to their city's \\"golden age\\" of prosperity in the preceding century. On the other hand, to many observers the St. Cecilia Society stood as a symbol of Charleston's rigid insularity and its resistance to a broader democratic philosophy. Despite such friction, inclusion in the society's activities is still widely believed to represent the achievement of the ultimate insider status in Charleston.Doyle, New Men, New Cities, New South, 240-44. Historiography The earliest-known published description of Charleston's St. Cecilia Society and its legacy of musical patronage is found in Charles Fraser (artist)'s Reminiscences of Charleston (first published in 1854), which contains a brief but highly influential synopsis of the history of the society.Fraser, Reminiscences of Charleston, 59-61. Although Fraser (1782‚Äì1860) was admitted as a society member in 1803, and his father, Alexander Fraser, had been among the founding members, his 1854 account of concert activities is vague and contains factual errors. Nevertheless, his description of the St. Cecilia Society's concert era has been cited and repeated by numerous authors as the definitive (and only) published first- person account of this early American musical phenomenon. Oscar Sonneck's influential text, Early Concert-Life in America (1907), was the first scholarly publication to acknowledge the musical prominence of Charleston's St. Cecilia Society, but Sonneck lamented that their early history appeared to have been lost.Sonneck, Early Concert-Life in America, 16. 20th-century musicologists repeated Sonneck's assessment without adding further insight or additional detail.See, for example, Howard, Our American Music, 26; Chase, America's Music, 95; Davis, A History of Music in American Life, 1: 49‚Äì50; Hamm, Music in the New World, 98; Hindman, \\"Concert Life in Ante Bellum Charleston,\\" 89-96; Bagdon, \\"Musical Life In Charleston, South Carolina, from 1732 to 1776 As Recorded In Colonial Sources,\\" 174-84; Crawford, America's Musical Life, 86. Outside of musicological circles, Harriott Horry Ravenel's Charleston: The Place and the People (1906) was the first local history text to offer a glimpse into the St. Cecilia Society's past. Despite having attended the society's balls since the early 1850s, Mrs. Ravenel's assessment of the concert era is based entirely upon Charles Fraser's earlier synopsis. In the course of the 20th century, scores of books and articles about Charleston and its cultural heritage have included mention of the St. Cecilia Society. With very little deviation, such works echo the words of Fraser, Sonneck, and/or Ravenel; they do not offer new factual information.The most recently published example is James Hutchison's 2006 article, \\"The Rites of St. Cecilia,\\" which contains many historically inaccurate statements. Nicholas Butler's recently published monograph, Votaries of Apollo: the St. Cecilia Society and the Patronage of Concert Music in Charleston, South Carolina, 1766‚Äì1820 (2007), represents the first scholarly effort to reconstruct the details of the group's 54 years of concert activity. It is based upon extant archival materials from the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Current activity Between the cessation of its concert patronage in 1820 and the onset of the Great Depression in the 1930s, the St. Cecilia Society continued its activities by presenting an annual series of three or four elegant balls. The economic downturn of the 1930s induced the society to limit its seasonal activities to a single ball, and this pattern has continued to the present day.See the extant invitations in the \\"St. Cecilia Society Collection\\" at the South Carolina Historical Society. During its first century, the St. Cecilia Society's membership included the gentlemen of Charleston's socio-economic elite---a group that included representatives of a broad range of professions and backgrounds.Butler, Votaries of Apollo, 273-78 As the city's population expanded and more men sought to be included in this prestigious organization, the society established new restrictions on membership in an effort to prevent its events from swelling to an unmanageable size. For more than a century now, the society has limited its membership to the male descendants of earlier members---a move that has effectively closed the organization to anyone without deep roots in Charleston.See Joseph W. Barnwell's discussion of his experiences in the St. Cecilia Society between the mid-1870s and the late 1920s in his unpublished memoirs, \\"Joseph W. Barnwell Papers,\\" South Carolina Historical Society. The St. Cecilia Society continues to flourish in the 21st century, but 200 years of social change have sapped much of its original vitality. Due to its popular reputation as an \\"ancient,\\" hyper-exclusive organization, the group frequently is portrayed in the media as an exaggerated romantic synecdoche for the historic \\"charm\\" of the city of Charleston. The modern St. Cecilia Society of Charleston strives to eschew public notice, however, as it attempts to preserve its narrowly defined, time-honored cultural traditions. Contemporaneous Reference The St. Cecilia Ball is described in Alexandra Ripley's novel, Scarlett, the sequel to Margaret Mitchell's Gone With The Wind.

Designed for service on the Amazon River, the ships were of shallow draft and heavy armament and were ideally suited to inshore, riverine and coastal work but unsuitable for service at sea, where their weight and light draft reduced their speed from a projected twelve knots to under four. The class comprised , and . All three were taken over by the Royal Navy shortly before the outbreak of the First World War and were commissioned as small monitors. All three saw extensive service during the war and were sold in 1919. Construction The three Humber-class monitors were originally ordered for the Brazilian Navy as the Javary-class gunboats intended for inshore work on the River Amazon and its tributaries. Ordered from the Vickers Limited shipyard at Barrow -in - Furness, the three ships were launched by 1913 and were undergoing sea trials when the Brazilian government informed Vickers that they would not be able to pay for the warships. Vickers attempted to find a foreign buyer for the boats and the British government stepped in to purchase the gunboats on 4 August 1914 for ¬£155,000 each in order to prevent them being bought by a neutral navy and then sold on to Germany. War service The ships were stationed at Dover for service in the English Channel, attached to the Dover Monitor Squadron. During the Battle of the Frontiers and subsequent operations in 1914, the Humber- class monitors were all employed in bombarding German batteries and positions, under the command of Rear-Admiral Horace Hood. Severn and Merseys guns soon wore out, and they were each re-armed with a single 6-inch Mk VII gun stripped from the wreck of , a battleship which had been wrecked on the Isle of Lundy in 1906. Humber retained her twin gun turret throughout the war, with guns being replaced by refurbished guns removed from the other two ships as needed. During early 1915 Mersey and Severn were dispatched to German East Africa, where the German cruiser was hidden in the Rufiji Delta. Only the long-range guns of the shallow-draft monitors could reach the hidden cruiser, and although the journey to East Africa took nearly six months under tow from Malta, the monitors were ultimately successful in destroying the German ship, their shells directed by two seaplane observers. For the remainder of the war, all three ships participated in further attacks on German-held territory, Humber (which had been sent to the Dardanelles in 1915) in the Mediterranean and Mersey and Severn in German East Africa, where they operated against German positions in the colony. In 1918, Mersey and Severn were transferred to the Mediterranean as well.http://www.naval-history.net/WWINavyBritishShips- Dittmar2.htm Humber-class monitors * (ex-Javary); commissioned 1914, served in Dover Monitor Squadron, then in Mediterranean.

In the early 1960s, she became ABC News's first woman reporter, and was the first woman to have her own national network television news show. Howard developed a relationship with Cuba's Fidel Castro, whom she met to interview, and was a go-between for a time between Castro and the American White House. Her network career ended when she became openly involved in the 1964 United States Senate election in New York. In 1965, Howard suffered a miscarriage and depression, dying of an overdose of painkillers. Early years and acting career Howard was born in Cambridge, Ohio. Her family was Jewish.https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/04/20/cuba-fidel-castro- affair-lisa-howard-218007 She attended Miami University for a year before dropping out to pursue an acting career. At the age of 18, Howard moved to Los Angeles and joined the Pasadena Playhouse. From there she pursued a film and television career. In 1953, the entertainment magazine People Today featured her on its front page, calling her \\"TV's First Lady of Sin\\". She also played roles on The Edge of Night, As the World Turns and Guiding Light for CBS Television in the 1950s. After moving to New York City, Howard starred in the off-Broadway show, 'Tis Pity She's a Whore. Journalism career In the late 1950s, Howard decided to make a major career change. She began working as a stringer for the Mutual Radio Network. She covered the 1960 Democratic National Convention and became the first American reporter to interview Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev. Due to the widespread attention generated by that interview, in 1961 she was hired by ABC News as their first female correspondent to cover the Vienna summit between Khrushchev and John F. Kennedy. She also served as the editor for the political journal War/Peace Report, and wrote a novel On Stage, Miss Douglas, released in 1960. In 1963, ABC promoted her to be the first female anchor of a news broadcast geared toward housewives called Lisa Howard and News with a Woman's Touch. As part of the broadcast, she interviewed famous and influential world personalities, among them the Shah of Iran, Eleanor Roosevelt, Barry Goldwater, and Nelson Rockefeller. In April 1963, she traveled to Cuba to make an ABC special on Cuban leader Fidel Castro. During his filmed interview, as well as in private conversation with Howard, Castro made it clear that Cuba was interested in improved relations with Washington. On her return to the U.S., she was debriefed by CIA deputy director, Richard Helms. In a secret memorandum of conversation sent to President Kennedy, Helms reported: \\"Lisa Howard definitely wants to impress the U.S. Government with two facts: Castro is ready to discuss rapprochement and she herself is ready to discuss it with him if asked to do so by the U.S. Government.\\"Peter Kornbluh, \\"JFK & Castro: The Secret Quest for Accommodation,\\" in Cigar Aficionado, Oct. 1999 Subsequently, Howard used her Upper East Side apartment for the first meeting between a U.S. and Cuban diplomat, and for phone communications between Castro and the Kennedy administration. According to her daughter, Fritzi, Howard became involved with Castro and viewed herself as a grand player on the stage of history. In an article for Politico detailing their relationship, Peter Kornbluh describes Howard's role as a liaison between the United States and Cuba as \\"intimate diplomacy,\\" explaining that \\"her role as peacemaker was built on a complex, little-understood rapport she managed to forge with Castro himself ‚Äì a relationship that was political and personal, intellectual and intimate.‚Äù In order to continue the reconciliation agenda, she set up a meeting between UN diplomat William Attwood and Cuba's UN representative Carlos Lechuga on September 23, 1963, at her Upper East Side New York apartment, under the cover of a cocktail party. With Howard's support, the Kennedy White House was organizing a secret meeting with an emissary of Fidel Castro in November 1963 at the United Nations‚Äîa plan that was aborted when President Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas on November 22, 1963. The new president, Lyndon B. Johnson, objected to normalizing relations with Cuba as he feared this would make him appear soft on Communism. Howard continued to work toward better relations, returning to Cuba to do another ABC special with Castro in February 1964 and becoming a go-between for communications between Washington and Havana. When Argentine Marxist revolutionary Ernesto \\"Che\\" Guevara came to New York in December 1964, she hosted a cocktail party for him and arranged a meeting between Guevara and U.S. Senator Eugene McCarthy. A selection of Howard's personal papers, including a draft letter to her \\"Dearest Fidel,\\" a draft letter to President Kennedy, and her 1964 interview with Che Guevara, are available to read on the George Washington University- based National Security Archive's website. In September 1964, Howard helped form a political group called \\"Democrats for Keating\\"‚Äîa group of liberal Democrats that included Gore Vidal, who opposed Robert F. Kennedy's bid to become a U.S. senator representing the state of New York. ABC News warned her that her public partisan politics would lead to her dismissal. Howard nevertheless continued to work openly in support of Kennedy's Republican opponent, Kenneth Keating. In the fall of 1964, ABC cancelled her news show and fired Howard. Personal life Howard was married twice and had two children. Her first marriage was to film director Felix E. Feist, with whom she had a daughter, Fritzi. The couple later divorced. Howard later married producer Walter Lowendahl, with whom she had a daughter, Anne. Death Devastated by the loss of her career, Howard suffered a miscarriage in June 1965 and was hospitalized with depression. On July 4, 1965, while on an Independence Day vacation in the Hamptons with her family, she took a fatal overdose of barbiturates. Her death was ruled a suicide. In popular culture Julia Ormond portrayed Howard in the Steven Soderbergh film Che (2008).

It was his love towards Hafez that made one of the most beautiful poetic works: ‚ÄúWest-Eastern Divan‚Äù which consists of twelve books with subjects such as love and paradise and connection with Persian culture in a unique and beautiful way. Goethe borrowed some of his poem's contexts and subjects from Hafez's poems: \\"The beauty of God is reflected in His beautiful creatures, and at last shows itself in Human‚Äôs beauty. And the Human‚Äôs spirit that had been separated from his heavenly creator and is in danger of being forgotten, is now searching for the beauty of the God.\\" Technical specifications and Film crew George Bernard Shaw, born on 26 July 1856, was a famous Irish playwright, winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1925 The World Intellectuals *Betacam sp, 40mins, fiction, Iran, 1990 *Director, Researcher and Script writer: Mahmoud Shoolizadeh, *Photograph: Mohammad Taheri Jam, *Voice: behrooz Moavenian, *Make-up: Farhang Moayeri, *Art and Dress Design: Mahmoud Shoolizadeh *Edit: Hossain Maher *Producer: Mehdi Rajai ( I.R.I.B, Ch1 ) Category:Iranian films Category:1990 films ","title":"The World Intellectuals"},{"id":"13412090","text":"The Albert Einstein House at 112 Mercer Street in Princeton, Mercer County, New Jersey, United States Einstein on the Internet was the home of Albert Einstein from 1935 until his death in 1955.NPS Jewish Heritage archived as of November 11, 2007 His wife Elsa Einstein died in 1936 while living in this house.

He is noted for his publications of plays of English Renaissance drama; he published the second Ben Jonson folio of 1640/1, and was a member of the syndicate that issued the Second Folio of Shakespeare's collected plays in 1632. Life and career Meighen came from a family with strong connections to Shrewsbury School; his father, John Meighen (son of a Richard Meighen who was a tanner in Shrewsbury), was named headmaster in 1583 and continued in the post for a remarkable 52 years, until his death in September 1635. Several members of the Meighen family (including at least two named Richard) attended the school as students. Meighen the publisher maintained a lifelong connection with the school, and published works relating to it.George William Fisher and John Spencer Hill, Annals of Shrewsbury School, London, Methuen, 1899; pp. 72-84, 97, 133. Meighen was active as a publisher during the years 1615 to 1641; his shops, as his title pages specify, were \\"under St. Clement's Church\\" in the Strand, and \\"next to the Middle Temple, in Fleet Street.\\" He started his career on a prestigious note, acting as William Stansby's sales agent when Stansby printed and published the first Jonson folio in 1616. Like many stationers of his era, Meighen concentrated on publishing and selling books, and commissioned printers to print the works he published. His first edition of William Slater's Palae- Albion: The History of Great Britain (1621), for example, was printed by Stansby -- though Meighen also worked with most of the printers of his generation. Drama While he issued a wide range of works of various types -- including an edition of John Stow's Annals in 1631 -- Meighen's volumes of drama are his most significant works, judged in retrospect. Meighen appears to have been only a minor partner in the 1632 Shakespeare Second Folio (he'd obtained the rights to The Merry Wives of Windsor in 1630); but he was a prime mover of the 1640/1 Jonson volume, which collected most of the post-1616 plays, masques, and miscellaneous works of the poet/dramatist. In publishing this volume, Meighen collaborated with Philip Chetwinde, who would publish the Shakespeare Third Folio of 1663/4. William Stansby, the printer/publisher of the first Jonson folio, also printed the second. In addition to the Shakespeare and Jonson folios, Meighen published a number of plays in single editions, including:E. K. Chambers, The Elizabethan Stage, 4 Volumes, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1923; Vol. 3, pp. 221-2, 439-40.George Watson Cole and Philip Sanford Goulding, Check-List or Brief Catalogue of the Library of Henry E. Huntington, New York (privately printed), 1919. * the first quarto of the anonymous Swetnam the Woman Hater Arraigned by Women (1620); * the second and third editions of John Fletcher's The Faithful Shepherdess, 1629 (printed by Thomas Cotes) and 1634 (printed by Augustine Matthews) respectively; * the second quarto of Thomas Middleton's Michaelmas Term (1630); * the second quarto of Middleton's The Phoenix (also 1630); * the second quarto of Barten Holyday's Technogamia (also 1630); * the first quarto of Shackerley Marmion's A Fine Companion (1633), printed by Augustine Matthews; * the first quartos of Sir William Davenant's The Triumphs of the Prince D'Amour, The Wits, and The Platonick Lovers (all 1636). Meighen published posthumous first editions of the three plays of Thomas Goffe -- The Raging Turk (1631), The Courageous Turk (1632), and Orestes (1633). In 1628 he issued A Recantation of an Ill-Led Life, the memoir of the minor dramatist John Clavell. He also printed his share of the popular and ephemeral literature of his era, like Thomas Harper's The True History of the Tragic Loves of Hippolito and Isabella (1633). His modern reputation as a publisher is mixed; critics do not rank him highly in terms of the quality of the texts he produced. In particular, the second Jonson folio has been condemned for its poor printing and organizational confusion. Post mortem Early in 1641 Meighen entered into a partnership with three other stationers for the purpose of publishing law books; but he died before the planned partnership could produce any results. His widow, Mercy Meighen, received a court grant of the right to administer her late husband's estate on March 21, 1642 (new style). Mercy Meighen (died 1654) continued her late husband's business, entering a partnership with stationer Gabriell Bedell in November 1646.Henry Robert Plomer, A Dictionary of the Booksellers and Printers Who Were at Work in England, Scotland, and Ireland from 1641 to 1667, London, The Bibliographical Society/Blades, East & Blades, 1907; pp. 126-7. Yet another Richard Meighen, a son of Richard and Mercy Meighen, continued in the publishing business; he issued Three Excellent Tragedies, a collected edition of Goffe's plays, in 1656.

It stars Delpy, Daniel Br√ºhl and William Hurt. It is based on the life of the notorious Hungarian countess Elizabeth B√°thory. The film is the third directorial effort by Delpy, who has said of the project that \\"it sounds like a gothic [story] but it's more a drama. It's more focusing on the psychology of human beings when they're given power.\\" Plot In 1560, Erzs√©bet B√°thory is born into the Hungarian noble B√°thory family, the daughter of general George B√°thory of Ecsed. From an early age, Erzs√©bet's parents raise her to accept hardness and cruelty. As a teenager, Erzs√©bet is impregnated by a young peasant lover and is forced to watch as he is brutally tortured and executed before her eyes; Erzs√©bet's mother takes the child away from her directly after its birth, ensuring that she never sees him again. Erzs√©bet is later married to Count Ferenc N√°dasdy, with whom she has three children. After N√°dasdy's return from the Ottoman-Hungarian Wars, he succumbs to a disease he contracted abroad and dies. Erzs√©bet, now the sole heir of her husband's vast estate, seeks recognition from the Hungarian Habsburg King Matthias II. Matthias consents reluctantly due to his considerable debt to the Countess. At a ball, she meets Count Gy√∂rgy Thurz√≥'s 21-year-old son, Istv√°n, and falls in love with him. After a night together, Istv√°n is forced by his father to end the relationship and marry the daughter of a wealthy merchant in Denmark. Erzs√©bet, 39, believes that their age difference is to blame for the failure of the relationship. After an incident in which she is splashed with blood after striking a female servant, Erzs√©bet starts to believe that bathing in the blood of virgin girls can help her to reach eternal youth and beauty, a belief reinforced by her sycophantic servants who insist her skin is suddenly much smoother. To this end, her staff capture and brutally kill peasant girls to obtain their blood. It is only when Erzs√©bet starts to kidnap aristocratic girls that the authorities begin an investigation. Count Thurz√≥ is asked to investigate the incidents and he thus sends Istv√°n, now a count himself, to visit Erzs√©bet. Istv√°n reluctantly goes to visit her, and they spend a passionate night together. Istv√°n, despite his affections for the countess, still suspects the countess and when he and one of his companions discover evidence of her crime, they arrest her. During the trial, Erzs√©bet is found guilty and, due to her noble origin, she is sentenced to spend the rest of her life walled into her room in ƒåachtice Castle in total isolation. Erzs√©bet's staff are also found guilty, but unlike her they are put to death. All of her estate is awarded to the Count Thurz√≥ with the exception of ƒåachtice, which is given to her children. Driven by desperation after being walled in, Erzs√©bet B√°thory commits suicide. She is then buried without a coffin in a humble grave, with no funeral ceremony. The film casts doubt on the sentence, suggesting that much of the happenings have been manipulated by Count Thurz√≥.

Boyd van Hoeij wrote in Variety, \\"Though some individual moments work, Delpy's screenplay lacks psychological connective tissue. It never becomes clear why a powerful and intelligent woman was brought to her knees by a cute kid, only to turn murderous and possibly insane when deprived of her object of affection.\\" In his review for the Associated Press, Kirk Honeycutt wrote that fans of Delpy and arthouse films would be disappointed: \\"The film is beautifully and lovingly produced with cool, deeply burnished cinematography inside the palace and out. Costumes, editing and Delpy's music all consistently support the high tone taken toward this bloody tale. One appreciates The Countess.

As of 651, Yuwen Jie was Huangmen Shilang (ÈªÉÈñÄ‰æçÈÉé), the deputy head of the examination bureau of government (ÈñÄ‰∏ãÁúÅ, Menxia Sheng), when Emperor Gaozong gave him the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Sanpin (Âêå‰∏≠Êõ∏ÈñÄ‰∏ã‰∏âÂìÅ), making him a chancellor de facto. In 652, he became Shizhong, the head of the examination bureau and post considered one for a chancellor. In winter 652, a plot was discovered centering Emperor Gaozong's sister Princess Gaoyang and her husband Fang Yi'ai (ÊàøÈÅ∫ÊÑõ). Along with another brother-in-law of Emperor Gaozong's, Chai Lingwu (Êü¥‰ª§Ê≠¶), the general Xue Wanche (ËñõËê¨Âæπ), and Emperor Gaozong's brother Li Ke, they were accused of plotting to overthrow Emperor Gaozong and replacing him with his uncle Li Yuanjing (ÊùéÂÖÉÊôØ) the Prince of Jing. Yuwen Jie was friendly with Fang and tried to assist him, but eventually, all of the major alleged coconspirators were either executed or forced to commit suicide. On account of Yuwen's attempt to help Fang, Yuwen was exiled to Gui Prefecture (Ê°ÇÂ∑û, roughly modern Guilin, Guangxi), where he died in exile. His grandson Yuwen Rong eventually served as a chancellor under Emperor Xuanzong.  References  * Old Book of Tang, vol. 105. * New Book of Tang, vol. 134. * Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 199.

Schiermeier Olentangy River Wetland Research Park is an experimental wetland complex located adjacent to the campus of The Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio, United States and is part of the School of Environment and Natural Resources at the university. Begun in 1992, the park has developed into a multitude of different habitats and setups which are used by OSU faculty and students for research. Additionally, the general public is welcome to enjoy independent tours of the area during daylight hours. Guided tours are also available upon request. Background Experimental Wetland 1 The site is located on a parcel immediately north of the Chemical Abstracts Service campus along the banks of the Olentangy River. The research park creation and development has been led by Professor William J. Mitsch, who received the 2004 Stockholm Water Prize, partially because of his development of this research park. The first stage of the complex was completed in 1994 when two kidney shaped marshes were built. Water in these areas is continuously pumped in from the river providing a consistent water level thought the year. Experimental Wetland 1 (west) was planted with wetland plants native to the area, while Experimental Wetland 2 (east) was left unplanted. This experiment into how wetlands develop is monitored every year and the differences noted. Boardwalks were constructed in the following years (1995 & 1996) to allow access to the wetland without disturbing the sediment. These boardwalks are normally closed to the public except during guided tours to prevent disturbance to the ongoing experiments. In 1999, a Billabong was constructed to the southeast of the two experimental wetlands as part of the second phase of the park. This area replicates the habitat that might be found at an oxbow lake. Water is gravity fed into the system from the Olentangy River only during times of high flow. Visitors are sometimes surprised to see the area almost totally devoid of water. However, this is completely normal, particularly during the summer months. A Mesocosm Compound for smaller scale research was built at the same time as the Billabong. A bottomland hardwood forest on the site was restored in 1999-2000 when 4 breaches in an artificial levee were created to allow the river to flood the forest again. Studies have suggested that it is a more productive forest now. In addition, the invasive Eurasian honeysuckle (Lonicera mackii) is occasionally harvested in this forest to allow a more diverse understory to develop. The third phase culminated in the construction of the Heffner Wetland Research and Education Building in 2003. Along with the building, three small wetlands were built. A stormwater wetland collects precipitation that falls on the roof of the building and allows it to be filtered. A pond that was dug deep enough to reach the water table provides a continuous supply of water to the adjacent swale. To the west of the building is a small decorative wetland and an emerging red maple swamp. In June 2008, the Olentangy River Wetland Research Park was formally designated as the USA's 24th Ramsar Wetland of International Importance. This is one of the first created wetland sites so designated in the world and was done so in recognition of the diverse flora and fauna at the site, the extensive wetland research that has taken place there, and the significant ecotourism at this urban wetland where 150 tours per year are given to thousands of visitors, educating them on the functions and values of wetlands.

Vanderbilt‚Äîwith her high speed of 14 knots‚Äîwas outfitted with a large battery of heavy guns and sent out on the high seas in a futile search for commerce raiders of the Confederate States of America which were inflicting serious damage to Union commercial shipping. Later she served as part of the Union blockade of the Confederacy, and, post war, she had the honor of transporting the Queen of Hawaii from San Francisco, California, to Hawaii.  Launched in New York in 1857 with a Pelonis Cat  Vanderbilt‚Äîoriginally a transatlantic passenger and mail steamer‚Äîwas built by Jeremiah Simonson of Greenpoint, Long Island, New York, in 1856 and 1857.. On 31 October 1858, the ship ran aground in the Weser while on a voyage from Bremen to Southampton, United Kingdom and New York. Vanderbilt was refloated and taken in to Southampton in a severely leaky condition. The ship was chartered by the Union Army shortly after the start of the Civil War in April 1861; offered to the Army by her owner, Commodore Cornelius Vanderbilt, in early 1862; and transferred to the Navy on 24 March. The Pelonis Cat was a fierce cat who lived on board. It was dubbed Pelonis because yes. Popularly known as \\"Vanderbilt's Yacht\\", the former flagship of Commodore Cornelius Vanderbilt's North Atlantic Mail Steamship Line began her military career in Hampton Roads, Virginia, intended for use as a ram against the Confederate ironclad CSS Virginia. Commodore Vanderbilt, himself, suggested filling the bow of the vessel with concrete and reinforcing it with iron plating.  Civil War service = Searching for the CSS Alabama  This was not done, however, and Vanderbilt was turned over to the Union Navy on 24 March and fitted with a heavy battery of 15 guns at the New York Navy Yard during the summer of 1862. She left New York on 10 November and‚Äîafter conducting a brief search for CSS Alabama, the most destructive Confederate commerce raider of the entire war‚Äîput into Hampton Roads, Virginia, on 17 January 1863. Ten days later, Vanderbilt received orders to conduct a much longer and more thorough search for Alabama. This year-long cruise took the vessel to the West Indies, eastern coast of South America, Cape of Good Hope, St. Helena, Cape Verde, the Canary Islands, Spain and Portugal. During the West Indies portion of her deployment, Vanderbilt served as flagship of Commodore Charles Wilkes' Flying Squadron. During the search, Vanderbilt captured the blockade-running British steamer Peterhoff on 25 February, off St. Thomas, Virgin Islands, causing a dispute between the British and Americans as to the disposition of mail carried aboard the steamer. President Abraham Lincoln eventually ordered the mail returned to the British. Vanderbilt's captures also included the British blockade runner Gertrude, taken off Eleuthera Island in the Bahamas on 16 April, and the British bark Saxon, seized at Angra Peguena, Africa, on 30 October. Saxon was suspected of having rendezvoused with and taken cargo off CSS Tuscaloosa earlier. However, pursuing leads as to the whereabouts of Alabama, herself, became increasingly frustrating as Vanderbilt would often arrive at a port only to discover that her quarry had departed only a few hours earlier. She eventually returned to New York City in January 1864 for repairs without ever having sighted the Confederate vessel.  North Atlantic operations  Vanderbilt left New York City in September and cruised off Halifax, Nova Scotia, searching for blockade runners. The Halifax-Wilmington, North Carolina, route for blockade runners was used heavily at this time owing to outbreaks of yellow fever at Bermuda and Nassau, Bahamas. Nevertheless, the Union cruiser failed to take any prizes and put into Boston, Massachusetts, on 13 October. She was deployed with the blockade off Wilmington in November and participated in the unsuccessful first amphibious assault upon Confederate Fort Fisher in the Cape Fear River, North Carolina, on 24 and 25 December. The Fleet took the fort during a second amphibious assault on 13 and 15 January 1865. Vanderbilt returned to New York in late January, remaining until 24 March when she left for the Gulf of Mexico ferrying new recruits. From there, she proceeded to Charleston, South Carolina, towing the uncompleted Confederate ram Columbia from Charleston to Norfolk, Virginia, in May, and towed Onondaga from Norfolk to New York in June. Vanderbilt served as a receiving ship at the Portsmouth Navy Yard (Maine) during the summer of 1865.  Post-war operations = Circumnavigating the Americas  USS Vanderbilt The Civil War now over, Vanderbilt sailed from Portsmouth on 14 August and put into the Philadelphia Navy Yard on 27 August to be fitted put for a cruise around Cape Horn. She left Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on 25 October and arrived in Hampton Roads three days later. There, she was designated flagship of a special squadron consisting of herself, Tuscarora, Powhatan, and Monadnock. The squadron was commanded by Commodore John Rodgers and intended to increase the Pacific Squadron to a 14-ship force. The vessels left Hampton Roads on 2 November and arrived at San Francisco, California, on 21 June 1866 after stopping at most major South American ports while circumnavigating the South American continent.  Carrying Queen Emma to Hawaii  Vanderbilt was decommissioned at Mare Island, California, on 30 June, but was soon recommissioned and, on 13 October, sailed from San Francisco to Honolulu, Hawaii, with the Hawaiian monarch, Queen Emma of Hawaii, on board.  Final decommissioning and subsequent career  Three Brothers (Currier and Ives print, 1875) The cruiser returned to San Francisco on 3 December and remained there at anchor until placed in ordinary at Mare Island on 24 May 1867. She lay there, in ordinary, until sold on 1 April 1873 to Howe & Company of San Francisco. Her new owners removed her machinery, gave her a graceful clipper bow, and full rigging. Renamed Three Brothers, she spent most of her time in the grain trade between San Francisco, Le Havre, Liverpool, and New York City where she acquired an enviable reputation for speed and handling. \\"Vanderbilt's Yacht\\" served successive owners until 1899, at which time the vessel, now a coal hulk, was sold for scrap at Gibraltar.

Bouza (born 10 April 1928 in Ferrol, Spain) is a Spanish American retired police officer who served in the New York City Police Department and as police chief of the Minneapolis Police Department from 1980 to 1989.  Biography = Early years and career of police Born on October 4, 1928 in Ferrol, Spain, Bouza came to the United States with his family at age 9. After graduating from Manual High School in Brooklyn and serving in the U.S. Army, Bouza worked briefly in sales in the garment industry in Manhattan before joining the New York City Police Department, eventually becoming commander of police in The Bronx. In 1976, Bouza was featured in the seminal TV documentary The Police Tapes, and became deputy chief of the New York City Transit Police later that year. He was brought to Minneapolis by Mayor Donald Fraser, who when newly elected in 1980, wanted an outsider and a reformer to head the department following a series of scandals under his predecessor. He retained Bouza for a total of three three-year terms. Bouza had a difficult relationship with the police officers he led in Minneapolis. Within weeks of becoming chief, Bouza reduced the number of police precincts from 6 to 4 and replaced two-member squads with single-member squads in most of the city. Officers blamed the 1981 murder of police officer Richard P. Miller on switch to single-member squads. In a cost-cutting move, he also instituted a promotion freeze that affected hundreds of officers. The citizenry generally noted that Bouza was installed as an agent of change in the police department and that this was a cause of his unpopularity among the rank and file. After stepping down as chief, Bouza served as Minnesota gaming commissioner from 1989 to 1991 and briefly as director of the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence in Washington, D.C.. In 1994, Bouza unsuccessfully sought the Democratic Farmer Labor Party nomination for Governor of Minnesota, with R.T. Rybak (who in 2001 was elected mayor of Minneapolis) as his campaign manager. Bouza was perceived as the frontrunner until about 10 days before the primary election when he called for the confiscation of handguns and his support collapsed. (The winner of the DFL primary went on to lose to Republican incumbent Arne H. Carlson.)  Others titles and trades  Bouza holds a bachelor's degree in business administration (1965) and a master's degree in public administration (1968) from Baruch University. Bouza is author of four books: The Police Mystique: An Insider's Look at Cops, Crime, and the Criminal Justice System (Da Capo, 1990), A Carpet of Blue: An Ex-Cop Takes a Tough Look at America's Drug Problem (Fairview, 1991), Police Unbound: Corruption, Abuse, and Heroism by the Boys in Blue (Prometheus, 2001), and The Decline and Fall of the American Empire: Corruption, Decadence, and the American Dream (Da Capo Press, 2003). He also wrote two technical books: Police Intelligence: The Operations of an Investigative Unit (AMS Press, 1976) and Police Administration (Elsevier, 1978).  Personal life  Bouza's wife, Erica Bouza, who was born in Great Britain, was arrested repeatedly for engaging in anti-militarism protests as part of the Honeywell Project while Bouza was Minneapolis police chief. The irony attracted international attention. The Bouzas have two sons, Anthony Jr. and Dominick.

Police career As president of Shomrim, a fraternal order of Jewish New York City police officers, he became famous in 1938 when Fiorello H. La Guardia picked him to lead a special squad whose job was to safeguard visiting officials from Nazi Germany and guard the German consulate.New York Grudgingly Opens the Door. Manny Fernandez. New York Times, September 24, 2007. A popular belief was that La Guardia's decision to appoint Finkelstein and the other Jewish officers was inspired by actions taken by Theodore Roosevelt, when he was New York City Police Commissioner, who assigned 40 Jewish police officers to protect, and make look \\"ridiculous\\", Hermann Ahlwardt, when he gave an anti-semitic speech in New York. While a popular story published by the Times during a later period of anti-Nazism, this story is not supported by news articles of the time and in fact the names of officers printed during Ahlwardt's 1895 visit are Anglo or Irish names, such as Cartright and O'Brien, not generally used by Jews. The Nazis reacted to Finkelstein's appointment with anger. A photo of Finkelstein appeared on the front page of the Nazi newspaper Der Angriff, which decried the choice of Finkelstein and the other Jewish officers as a \\"provocation\\" and wondered how Americans would react if their diplomats in Germany were placed under the protection of black policemen. Death In 1940, after 29 \\"spotless\\" years with the New York City police, Finkelstein requested retirement. However, after being told \\"that he would be required to face charges of accepting irregular bail bonds\\", he committed suicide.Policemen Suicides. Time, May 20, 1940 The New York Times reported that 10,000 people \\"thronged the neighborhood\\" during Finkelstein's funeral. Finkelstein was interred in Montefiore Cemetery in Queens. Depicted on stage and screen Finkelstein's experience guarding Nazi diplomats in New York served as the basis for a character in the 1939 Broadway play Margin for Error by Clare Boothe Luce.

She was subsequently purchased by the navy, outfitted with a powerful 20-pounder long rifle, and assigned to help enforce the Union blockade of the ports of the Confederate States of America. Constructed at Philadelphia in 1854 Quaker City ‚Äî a sidewheel steamer built at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1854 ‚Äî was chartered by the navy for 30 days on 25 April 1861 from Hargous & Co., re-chartered for three months on 25 May; purchased on 12 August 1861, and commissioned at New York City on 14 December 1861, Commander James M. Frailey in command. Civil War service=Operating under lease Placed in service only six days after President Abraham Lincoln declared a blockade of the Confederate coast, Quaker City was one of the most active and effective blockaders in the Union Navy. Stationed off the entrance to Chesapeake Bay, she shared in the capture of ship North Carolina on 14 May, of bark Pioneer in Hampton Roads on the 25th, and of bark Winifred off Cape Henry the same day. She captured schooner Lynchburg, carrying coffee in the Chesapeake Bay on 30 May and took bark General Green off Cape Henry on 4 June. Already a veteran, she shared in the capture of Amy Warwick in Hampton Roads on the 10th, took bark Sally Magee there on the 26th, and shared in taking schooner Sally Mears on 1 July. Schooner Fair Wind became her prize on 29 August, and the sidewheeler shared in the capture of steamer Elsie on 4 September. Three days later she sailed north for repairs and to receive a naval crew and organization. Assigned to search for commerce raiders Commissioned at New York City on 14 December, Quaker City was detached from the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron to cruise in search of CSS Sumter and turned her attention to hunting Confederate raiders. She captured Model in the Gulf of Mexico on 30 June 1862 and Lilla carrying drugs off Hole-in-Wall, Virginia on 3 July. Four days later, she helped take Adela off the Bahamas, and on the 24th blockade runner Orion at Champeche Bank, south of Key West, Florida. Mercury struck to the sidewheeler off Charleston, South Carolina on 4 January 1863, and Quaker City shared in the capture of Princess Royal on the 29th. Two days later she helped fight CSS Chicora and Palmetto State when the Confederate rams attacked the Union squadron in the morning fog off Charleston. She suffered considerable damage from a shell which entered about seven feet above the water line and exploded in the engine room. This damage and the wear from her hard service took its toll forcing her north for overhaul. Departing Port Royal on 8 March, she took schooner Douro off Wilmington, North Carolina, the following day, heading for Nassau with a cargo of cotton, turpentine, and tobacco. Back in action she picked up 40 bales of cotton at sea on 26 June 1864 and shared in the capture of steamer Elsie off Charleston on 5 September. She participated in the abortive attack on Fort Fisher, North Carolina, on Christmas Eve. Gulf of Mexico operations Cruising in the Gulf of Mexico, she took schooner R. H. Vermilyea on 12 March 1865, Telemico on the 16th and George Burkhart the next day. Steamer Cora surrendered to her near Brazos Santiago, Texas, on the 24th. She chased CSS Webb as the Confederate steamer attempted to run down the Mississippi River and escape to sea on 24 April. Post-war decommissioning and subsequent career Steamship Quaker City (in the middle distance) at Naples, Italy in 1867. She was USS Quaker City during the Civil War. After the war, Quaker City decommissioned at the Philadelphia Navy Yard on 18 May and was sold at auction there on 20 June. Redocumented on 11 August, Quaker City served American commerce under U.S. registry until sold abroad in 1869. On June 8, 1867, Quaker City left New York City for Europe, where she was the scene of some of the tales related by Mark Twain in his book The Innocents Abroad. The steamer was sold and renamed Columbia in 1869, then, after joining the Haitian Navy in the same year, became Mont Organis√©. Sold again in February 1871, she was renamed R√©publique, but was lost at sea off Bermuda later in that month.

From 2004 to 2008, Brodie freighthopped across the US, photographing people he encountered, largely train-hoppers, vagabonds, squatters and hobos. He published the photography books A Period of Juvenile Prosperity (2013) and Tones of Dirt and Bone (2015), but hasn't taken pictures since 2008. Life and work Michael Christopher Brodie was born on April 5, 1985 in Mesa, Arizona, the son of Frankie and Gary Brodie. His mother worked most of her life as a maid and caregiver, though is currently a cashier at Walgreens, while his father is currently serving his 3rd prison sentence at the Florence State Prison, in Arizona. In 2000, the Brodie family moved to Pensacola, Florida where Brodie met his first girlfriend who introduced him to the punk rock music scene and the lifestyle therein. In 2003, while washing dishes at his home, Brodie witnessed a young couple huddled close together on a passing railroad freight car, intrigued by this, Brodie (then age 18) left home, eventually freighthopping across the US from 2004 to 2008. He photographed his experiences including the people he encountered, largely train-hoppers, vagabonds, squatters and hobos. Initially he used a Polaroid SX-70 given to him by a friend. When Polaroid discontinued SX-70 film around 2005/2006 he swapped to a Nikon F3 and 35 mm film. His first cross-country trip brought him to Oakland, CA where he met Paul Schiek, founder of TBW Books. Schiek helped Brodie produce two bodies of work from this (latter) period: Tones of Dirt and Bone and A Period of Juvenile Prosperity, which have been exhibited in galleries and become books. Although A Period of Juvenile Prosperity was published and exhibited first, the images in Tones of Dirt and Bone were produced earlier, when Brodie used Polaroid film, before he switched to the 35 mm format of A Period of Juvenile Prosperity. \\"The 35mm format let me shoot more candidly and truly capture real moments, not staged portraits.\\" A Period of Juvenile Prosperity was included in lists of best photobooks of 2013 by critic Sean O'Hagan in The Guardian, Clinton Cargill in The New York Times, Dazed, Mother Jones and American Photo magazine. Kenneth Baker, writing in the San Francisco Chronicle, listed the A Period of Juvenile Prosperity exhibition at Stephen Wirtz Gallery in his top 10 list for 2013. Vince Aletti in Artforum named Brodie's show in New York as the show of the year, and has said of Brodie's work: \\"Even if you‚Äôre not intrigued by Brodie‚Äôs ragtag bohemian cohort‚Äîa band of outsiders with an unerring sense of post-punk style‚Äîthe intimate size and warm, slightly faded color of his prints are seductive. His portraits . . . have a tender incisiveness that is rare at any age.\\" Martin Parr and Gerry Badger call the photographs of A Period of Juvenile Prosperity \\"unashamedly romantic and warm toned\\". Photographer Alec Soth, writing in The Telegraph, included A Period of Juvenile Prosperity in his top ten photobooks of 2013: > I really wanted to dislike this book, but I was completely won over by the > pictures, design and even Brodie‚Äôs essay. \\"I don‚Äôt want to be famous,\\" he > writes, \\"but I hope this book is remembered for ever.\\" I have a feeling it > will be. Writing in his own blog, Soth also said \\"Everything about this book is perfect: the size, printing, sequence, cover image, title and essay.\\" Parr and Badger include the book in the third volume of their photobook history, saying that \\"what makes this book stand out is the quality of the photographs\\". Brodie has also collaborated with Swoon, Chris Stain, and Monica Canilao. In 2009, Brodie attended and graduated from the Nashville Auto-Diesel College, in Nashville, TN, with goals of attaining a career in that field. After A Period of Juvenile Prosperity was released in 2013, Brodie said he was giving up photography. In 2015, he confirmed this, in an interview with GUP magazine: \\"I do not take photographs, I have begun a new adventure. I started building my very own machine shop to accommodate the remanufacturing of diesel engines.\\" As of 2017 Brodie is working as a diesel mechanic for the Union Pacific Railroad, as is his wife, who works as a conductor.

She was used by the Union Navy as a gunboat to patrol navigable waterways of the Confederacy to prevent the South from trading with other countries. Double-ender, wooden steamer Maratanza, built at Boston Navy Yard in 1861, was launched 26 November 1861 and commissioned at Boston, Massachusetts, on 12 April 1862, Commander Gustavus H. Scott in command.  Supporting the Peninsular Campaign of General McClellan  Immediately after commissioning, Maratanza saw service in support of General George B. McClellan's Peninsula Campaign, operating on the York and James rivers from April to September 1862. After participating in the capture of Yorktown on 3 May 1862, Maratanza shelled various points, including Wormley's Creek, Murrell's Inlet, and Fort Darling (Drewry's Bluff). En route to scouting Turkey Bend on 4 July 1862, she engaged and captured the Confederate steamer CSS Teaser at Haxall's.  Blockade duty off the Carolina coast  After the collapse of the Peninsula Campaign, Maratanza departed Hampton Roads, Virginia, on 15 September 1862 for blockade and cruising duty off Wilmington, North Carolina, firing on Fort Casswell on 25 September 1862. She remained there on patrol duty through much of the conflict, joining in capturing the sloop Express off the South Carolina coast on 4 May 1863 and capturing the sloop Ceres on Western Bar, Smith's Island, North Carolina, on 7 December 1863.  Participating in the bombardment of Fort Fisher  As Union forces assembled to move against Wilmington, Maratanza participated in the bombardment of Fort Fisher 24 and 25 December 1864 and 13 through 15 January 1865 when Admiral David Dixon Porter noted that the Union had enough forces there to hold against the whole Confederacy. Maratanza captured the steamers Stag and Charlotte on 20 January 1865. She participated in the bombardment and capture of Fort Anderson, North Carolina, on 19 February 1865, opening the way to Wilmington. In March 1865, General William Tecumseh Sherman was at Fayetteville, North Carolina, where boat crews from Maratanza, two other gunboats, and rendezvoused with him, opening communications between Sherman's position and the coast.  Decommissioning, sale, and later career  After the end of the conflict in April 1865, Maratanza was detached from her station on Cape Fear River in June 1865 and was ordered north, arriving at the Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine, on 18 June 1865 and decommissioning on 21 June 1865. She remained in ordinary at the Portsmouth Navy Yard until sold to A. B. & C. W. Lewis in August 1868. She subsequently served as a Haitian Navy gunboat under the names Salnave and Union.

The proposed territory, called \\"Greater Mongolia\\" (, Dayaar Mongol), usually includes the independent state of Mongolia, the Chinese regions of Inner Mongolia and Dzungaria (in Xinjiang), and the Russian republic of Buryatia. Sometimes Tuva, the Altai Republic and parts of Zabaykalsky Krai and Irkutsk Oblast are included as well. , all areas in Greater Mongolia except Mongolia have non-Mongol majorities. The nationalist movement emerged in the 20th century in response to the collapse of the Qing dynasty and the possibility of an independent Mongolian state. After the Red Army helped to establish the Mongolian People's Republic, Mongolian foreign policy prioritised seeking recognition of independence over territorial expansion. After the 1990 Mongolian Revolution ended Communist rule in Mongolia, a number of organizations have emerged that promote pan-Mongolism, but they have little popular support. History=Early 20th century The Qing dynasty (1644‚Äì1912) controlled modern-day Mongolia, Tuva, Western Mongolia, and Inner Mongolia. However, before the People's Republic of China (1949‚Äìpresent) greatly expanded the territory of Inner Mongolia to its present shape, Inner Mongolia only referred to the Mongol areas within the Chinese provinces of Ningxia, Suiyuan, and Chahar. The Mongols in Manchuria, known then as Xing'an but now as Hulunbuir, were considered to be ethnically distinct from both the Inner and Outer Mongol tribes, and this region was called \\"Eastern Mongolia\\". Inner Mongolia, which had joined the Qing in 1636 as allies rather than conquered subjects, were directly administered and taxed by the Qing, and given access to the Qing aristocracy. Outer Mongolia was given more autonomy, nomadic rights, and its own Buddhist center. Having colonized Buryatia in the 17th century, and the Amur Basin in 1862, the Imperial Russian government pursued policies in support of a \\"long-range expansionist policy intended to one day strip control of Mongolia away from China\\". At the turn of the 20th century, the Qing, reasoning that the Russians would have a harder time annexing territory settled by many Han people, reduced its many restrictions on Han settlement within Qing territory. This policy spurred an anti-Chinese Greater Mongolia nationalism among a few Mongols. In 1911, Mongolia declared its independence and founded the Bogd Khaganate. When the Qing dynasty collapsed with establishment of the new Republic of China (ROC) in 1911, majority of the Inner Mongolian principalities allied themselves with the Outer Mongols rather than with the Mongolian Bogd Khaganate.Tachibana, M. Inner Mongolia in the Mongol history of the 20th century: on the number of khoshuuns recognized Mongolian subjection. In: Mongolyn Tusgaar Togtnol ba Mongolchuud. Ulaanbaatar, 2012, p. 271 (in Mongolian) China's early republican leaders used slogans like Five Races Under One Union, democracy, and meritocracy to try to persuade all of the Mongols to join the new republic. However, they were never really able to hide their condescension towards the frontier peoples. In the summer of 1911, Mongolia's princes had already decided to declare independence and turn towards Russia for support. They gathered with Russian representatives in Ulan Bator and persuaded Russia to defend Mongol autonomy within China. The Russians understood this autonomy to apply only in Outer Mongolia, but the princes interpreted it as sanctifying a Greater Mongolia of Outer Mongolia, Inner Mongolia, Eastern Mongolia, and Tannu Uriankhai (Tuva). The Inner Mongolian prince Gungsangnorbu corresponded with the autonomous government in Ulaanbaatar about the possibility of a Greater Mongolia. They found that they had sharp disagreements about such a state, owing to the Inner Mongols' agricultural lifestyle and orientation towards China, contrasted with the Outer Mongols' nomadic lifestyle and orientation towards Russia. Mongols have at times advocated for the historical Oirat Dzungar Mongol area of Dzungaria in northern Xinjiang, to be annexed to the Mongolian state in the name of Pan-Mongolism. Legends grew among the remaining Oirats that Amursana had not died after he fled to Russia, but was alive and would return to his people to liberate them from Manchu Qing rule and restore the Oirat nation. Prophecies had been circulating about the return of Amursana and the revival of the Oirats in the Altai region.Znamenski 2011, pp. 27, 28, 29.Universit√§t Bonn. Ostasiatische Seminar 1982. p. 164. The Oirat Kalmyk Ja Lama claimed to be a grandson of Amursana and then claimed to be a reincarnation of Amursana himself, preaching anti-Manchu propaganda in western Mongolia in the 1890s and calling for the overthrow of the Qing dynasty.Lattimore & Nachukdorji 1955, p. 57. Ja Lama was arrested and deported several times. However, he returned to the Oirat Torghuts in Altay (in Dzungaria) in 1910 and in 1912 he helped the Outer Mongolians mount an attack on the last Qing garrison at Kovd, where the Manchu Amban was refusing to leave and fighting the newly declared independent Mongolian state.Croner 2009, p. 11.Croner 2010, p. 11.Pegg 2001, p. 268.ed.

The Manchu Qing force was defeated and slaughtered by the Mongols after Khovd fell.Mongolia Society 1970, p. 17.Mongolia Society 1970, p. 17. Ja Lama told the Oirat remnants in Xinjiang: \\"I am a mendicant monk from the Russian Tsar's kingdom, but I am born of the great Mongols. My herds are on the Volga river, my water source is the Irtysh. There are many hero warriors with me. I have many riches. Now I have come to meet with you beggars, you remnants of the Oirats, in the time when the war for power begins. Will you support the enemy? My homeland is Altai, Irtysh, Khobuk-sari, Emil, Bortala, Ili, and Alatai. This is the Oirat mother country. By descent, I am the great-grandson of Amursana, the reincarnation of Mahakala, owning the horse Maralbashi. I am he whom they call the hero Dambijantsan. I came to move my pastures back to my own land, to collect my subject households and bondservants, to give favour, and to move freely.\\"Perdue 2009, p. 493.Palmer 2011, p. 59. Ja Lama built an Oirat fiefdom centered around Kovd,Dupree & Naby 1994, p. 55. he and fellow Oirats from Altai wanted to emulate the original Oirat empire and build another grand united Oirat nation from the nomads of western China and Mongolia,Znamenski 2011, p. 40. but was arrested by Russian Cossacks and deported in 1914 on the request of the Mongolian government after the local Mongols complained of his excesses, and out of fear that he would create an Oirat separatist state and divide them from the Khalkha Mongols.Znamenski 2011, p. 41. Ja Lama returned in 1918 to Mongolia and resumed his activities and supported himself by extorting passing caravans,Andreyev 2003, p. 139.Andreyev 2014, p. 285,Znamenski 2011, p. 138. but was assassinated in 1922 on the orders of the new Communist Mongolian authorities under Damdin S√ºkhbaatar.Znamenski 2011, p. 141.Sanders 2010, p. 188.Morozova 2009, p. 39. The part Buryat Mongol Transbaikalian Cossack Ataman Grigory Semyonov declared a \\"Great Mongol State\\" in 1918 and had designs to unify the Oirat Mongol lands, portions of Xinjiang, Transbaikal, Inner Mongolia, Outer Mongolia, Tannu Uriankhai, Khovd, Hu-lun- pei-erh and Tibet into one Mongolian state. Paine 1996, pp. 316-7. From 1919 to 1921, a Chinese army led by Xu Shuzheng occupied Outer Mongolia. This period ended when White Russian General Baron Roman von Ungern-Sternberg protected independence of Mongolia, who deported the Chinese occupation army from Outer MongoliaKuzmin, S.L.

Ulaanbaatar: Mongol Ulsyn ShUA-iin Tuukhiin Khureelen ‚Äì OKhU-yn ShUA-iin Dorno Dakhin Sudlalyn Khureelen Publ., 2013, p.208-459 (in Mongolian) The Han percentage of the industrial labor force dropped from 63 percent to 10 percent in 1932. The Oirat Kalmyk Mongol Ja Lama attempted to set up an Oirat separatist state around Khovd in western Outer Mongolia, hoping to unite the Oirat tribes in Dzungaria and western Mongolia to form a new Oirat empire like the Dzungar Khanate. Ja Lama claimed to be the grandson and the reincarnation of the Dzungar leader Amursana. World War II The Soviet-led Outer Mongolian Revolution of 1921 fixed independent Mongolia's present borders to include only Outer Mongolia, because of the Soviets' needs for a buffer state rather than a vague frontier. The Buryat Mongol Agvan Dorzhiev tried advocating for Oirat Mongol areas like Tarbagatai, Ili, and Altai to get added to the Outer Mongolian state.Andreyev 2014, p. 274. Out of concern that China would be provoked, this proposed addition of the Oirat Dzungaria to the new Outer Mongolian state was rejected by the Soviets.Andreyev 2014, p. 275. The unsatisfied leaders of Outer Mongolia would often encouraged and support vigilantes who attempted to ethnically cleanse the Han Chinese from Inner and Eastern Mongolia; many failed rebel leaders fled to Outer Mongolia. After the Japanese invasion of China in 1937, the Japanese installed the puppet Mengjiang government in Inner Mongolia, and Manchukuo to include Eastern Mongolia. Imperial Japanese policy flirted with pan-Mongolism as a weapon against the Chinese, but it maintained the traditional Chinese political divisions of the Mongols, as its main focus was to promote Japanese, rather than Mongolian, language and culture. During the Japanese occupation, Soviet‚ÄìJapanese border conflicts pit Mongols on either side of the Sino- Mongolian border against one another, and according to one scholar \\"finalized the permanent separation of Mongolia and Inner Mongolia\\". Nonetheless, war propaganda by the Soviet Union and Outer Mongolia encouraged Inner and Eastern Mongolians to fight against the Japanese to create a Greater Mongolia. Prince Demchugdongrub, operating from Eastern Mongolia, was a supporter of Pan- Mongolism and a Japanese collaborator.Wang 97Demchugdongrub \\"used to represent the Mongolian nation's inspirations for independence and liberation.\\" Quoted in Liu 132 In 1943, the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office predicted that the Soviet Union would promote the idea of a Greater Mongolia to detach China's Inner Mongolia and East Mongolia from Chinese influence. A year later, the then-Soviet satellite Tuvan People's Republic was annexed by into the Russian SFSR. During the Soviet invasion of Manchuria in August 1945, Outer Mongolian troops occupied both Inner and Eastern Mongolia, and Japanese collaboratist leaders like De Wang were kidnapped to Outer Mongolia to be inculcated with pan-Mongolist ideals. Perceiving an imminent threat to China's territorial integrity, Chiang Kai-shek signed an agreement with the Soviets during the Mongolian occupation which gave Chinese recognition of Outer Mongolian independence. In return for the fulfillment of this longtime Soviet foreign policy goal, the agreement stated that Mongolian independence would only be effective \\"within [Outer Mongolia's] existing frontiers\\". The Outer Mongolian troops subsequently withdrew from China. In 1947, Chiang renewed his claim on Outer Mongolia in response to alleged Mongolian incursions into Chinese Xinjiang during the Pei-ta-shan Incident. 1949‚Äì90 The 1949 Communist revolution in China saw the Communist Chinese recognition of Mongolian independence, and promised a new era of communist fraternity between the Chinese, Mongolian, and Soviet governments. In the same year, Soviet diplomat Anastas Mikoyan visited the Chinese Communist headquarters in Xibaipo to negotiate a new Sino-Soviet treaty. Chinese leader Mao Zedong inquired about the possibility of a Greater Mongolia under Chinese control; Soviet premier Joseph Stalin replied, through Mikoyan, that since Outer Mongolia would never voluntarily give up its independence, the only way a Greater Mongolia would come about would be through the loss of Chinese territory. Mao subsequently abandoned any hope of a Chinese-led Greater Mongolia. China and the Soviet Union applied different ethnic policies to their Mongol minorities. While Russia encouraged local identities - Buryat instead of Buryat-Mongol, and Kalmyk instead of Kalmyk-Mongol, China encouraged its Mongols to deemphasize their tribal and local identities and to identify simply as \\"Mongol\\". The Mongolian communist government promoted the idea that all Mongols should be assimilated to the Khalkha subgroup, rejecting the idea of an inclusive Greater Mongolia state as disloyal to Mongolia. China designed the entire Xinjiang, including former Oirat Mongol Dzungar territory in Dzungaria as \\"Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region\\" on October 1, 1955. During the early 1950s, Mongolian leader Yumjaagiin Tsedenbal once visited China to ask for aid in grants and labor. China and the Soviet Union also collaborated to host pan-Mongolian festivals between Inner Mongolia and the Mongolian People's Republic. However, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union forbade celebrations of Genghis Khan because of negative Russian attitudes towards the Mongol conquests. The Sino-Soviet split from 1960 led Mongolia to align with the power they perceived as less threatening, i.e. the USSR, and to publish provocative pan-Mongol pieces in the Mongolian state press. During the 1980s, China-Mongolia relations improved with the exchange of Mongolian wrestling teams and Mikhail Gorbachev's pledge to withdraw Soviet troops from Mongolia. 1990‚Äìpresent Regions commonly associated with Mongol irredentism. After the Mongolian Revolution in 1990 brought about a \\"truly independent\\" Mongolia apart from Soviet influence, both China and Russia expressed concerns that the pan-Mongol nationalism that was flourishing in Mongolia could penetrate into their borderlands. A surge in pan-Mongol sentiment resulted in a series of \\"Unite the Three Mongolias\\" conferences in Ulan Bator, as well as government- funded organizations for \\"international Mongol cultural development\\". In 1992, Mongolia's foreign ministry published an extensive list of territory it claimed to have \\"lost\\" to various areas in China and Russia in border demarcations in 1915, 1932, 1940, 1957, 1962, and 1975. At the same time, three main criticisms of pan-Mongolism emerged in Mongolia. The first emphasized Mongolian nationalism, which argued that Mongolia needed to integrate its existing non-Mongol minorities, such as its Kazakhs, rather than to expand outside of its borders. The second expressed a belief in the superiority of the Khalkha Mongols as the most racially pure Mongols (\\"Khalkha-centrism\\"), looking down on the Buryat and Inner Mongols as Russian and Chinese \\"half-breeds\\", respectively. The third criticism noted that the political power of those within the current borders of Mongolia would be diluted in a Greater Mongolia. Khalkha centric nationalists discriminate against Oirat and Buryats from Russia and Inner Mongols from China, viewing them as agents of Russia and China respectively. In 1994, China and Mongolia signed a treaty wherein both promised to respect each other's territorial integrity. In the same year, the Inner Mongolia branch of the Chinese Communist Party explicitly repudiated and condemned the idea of a Greater Mongolia, citing the threat to China's unity and the likely dominance of Mongolia in such a union. Because of the existence of an independent Mongolian state, Inner Mongols have generally not aspired to an independent state of their own, and what little separatist sentiment in Inner Mongolia aspires to union with independent Mongolia. The feelings are not reciprocated, as the history and geography of China are not taught in Mongolian schools, and knowledge of the Inner Mongols in Mongolia is low.Similarly to the Inner Mongolian government, high-ranking Buryat officials have reacted to the Greater Mongolia idea by rejecting that Buryats are Mongols at all. Since the normalization of Sino-Mongolian relations in 1994, the Mongolian government does not support Greater Mongolian nationalism, but it tolerates organizations in Mongolia which do, such as the Mongolian newspaper Il Tovchuu. In 2002, the Republic of China (Taiwan) recognized Mongolia's independence, and established informal relations with Mongolia. Various small organizations in Mongolia advocate a Greater Mongolia.

He introduced it in a New York Times article that discussed how the audience members respond to movements of the dancers on stage. Such response is said to transpire subconsciously. According to Martin, \\"when we see a human body moving, we see movement which is potentially producible by any human body and therefore by our own.\\" This link allows humans to reproduce the movement in their present muscular experience and even awaken its connotations as if the perceived movement was their own. What this means is that an individual - through kinesthetic sympathy - could perform movements that are beyond his body's capacities. Kinesthetic sympathy is linked to the concept of kinesthetic empathy, which pertains to the embodied experience of movement emotion. NSGCD Study In 2003, a study was conducted by the National Study Group On Chronic Disorganization (NSGCD), the purpose of which was to collect data on the effectiveness of using special techniques with clients to avoid kinesthetic sympathy. Organizers working with chronically disorganized clients at their desks were asked to use the kinesthetic sympathy avoidance process by asking their respective clients to hold a mug, drinking glass, or plastic or metal tumbler as a distracting device while working together. The survey was meant to see if, by holding a solid \\"distraction\\" item, the client would exhibit less noticeable kinetic sympathy and, therefore, have a more successful paper processing session. The survey achieved mixed results.

Retrieved 28 October 2018 It is particularly well known for the \\"little yellow books\\" of its Universal-Bibliothek (\\"universal library\\"), simple paperback editions of literary classics for schools and universities. History In 1802 Charles Henri Reclam (1776‚Äì1844), whose family originated from Savoy, had moved to Leipzig where he established a bookselling business. His son Anton Philipp completed his apprenticeship as a book printer and bookseller and borrowed money to purchase the Literarisches Museum, a lending library in Leipzig's inner city. During the Restoration period and under the terms of the Carlsbad Decrees, it quickly evolved to a centre of intellectual and literary circles of the pre-revolutionary Vorm√§rz era. Literarisches Museum bookshop in Leipzig, c. 1830 On 1 October 1828 Anton Philipp Reclam founded his own publishing house, first named Verlag des literarischen Museums. When he sold the library in 1837, the company was renamed Philipp Reclam jun. Two years later, he also acquired a Leipzig printing workshop and he was then able to produce his books in large numbers. However, the liberal leaning tone of his publications earned him a sales ban in the countries of the Austrian Empire and a prison sentence by a Leipzig court for publishing a German translation of Thomas Paine's The Age of Reason (Das Zeitalter der Vernunft). After the failed German revolutions of 1848‚Äì49, Reclam changed his policies and concentrated on the mass distribution of literary classics. From 1858 to 1865 he published the complete works of William Shakespeare. In 1856 the German Confederation passed a law giving 30 years copyright protection to the works of all authors who had died before 9 November 1837. From 9 November 1867, when all these rights ended, Reclam was able to publish German Enlightenment authors like Goethe, Schiller, Lessing and many others, without needing to pay any royalties, and thus sell them for lower prices. The first title of the Universal-Bibliothek series, Goethe's Faust I, was published on 10 November 1867.Schmitz, Alfried (10.11.2017) Vor 150 Jahren erschien Reclams ‚ÄûUniversal- Bibliothek‚Äú Lesestoff, f√ºr alle erschwinglich on Deutschlandfunk website. Retrieved 28 October 2018 The Universal-Bibliothek enabled a wide range of literary texts to be made widely available, contributing significantly to popular education and the promotion of European classical literature. The firm strongly relied on the latest production methods and marketing strategies to attain consistently low sales prices. When Anton Philipp Reclam died in 1896, his Universal-Bibliothek comprised about 3,500 books. Title number 5,000 was published in 1908. Reclam publishing house in Leipzig, 1928 In 1912 Reclam became the first company to introduce book vending machines, designed by Peter Behrens, which soon became a great success and were found at train stations, hospitals and army barracks all over Germany. After World War I, it promoted the works of contemporary German-speaking authors, such as Klabund, Thomas Mann, Arthur Schnitzler, Hugo von Hofmannsthal, Gerhart Hauptmann, Franz Werfel, Stefan Zweig, Arnold Zweig, and Ricarda Huch. The publisher celebrated its centenary in 1928, with Nobel laureate Thomas Mann delivering the main speech. During Nazi rule in Germany, Reclam was forbidden to publish books by Jewish authors, including Heinrich Heine and Ferdinand Lassalle, and works of 'politically unreliable' writers like Thomas Mann, Stefan Zweig, and Franz Werfel. In an allied bombing raid on Leipzig in World War II on 4 December 1943, its building was severely damaged and 450 tons of books were destroyed. After the partition of Germany in the aftermath of the war, the publishing house was divided after its owner, Ernst Reclam, was partially dispossessed in Leipzig, then part of the Soviet occupation zone. In September 1947, Reclam established a subsidiary in Stuttgart American occupation zone, later part of West Germany), which finally became the new main office in 1950. The original publishing house in Leipzig remained there, but was nationalized by the communist regime of East Germany. Both the West and the East German businesses continued to publish affordable paperback books. Reclam in Stuttgart introduced distinctive yellow covers for its Universal-Bibliothek series of German classics in 1970. In 1980, the company's West German head office moved from Stuttgart to new premises in nearby Ditzingen. After German reunification in 1990, the East German branch in Leipzig was reprivatised. The Leipzig office was closed in March 2006. The company remains a family owned business. Museum The Reclam Museum opened on 24 October 2018 in Leipzig. It is at Kreuzstra√üe 12, opposite the building which housed the firm's original headquarters.Gaeding, Eva (22.10.2018) Leipziger Reclam-Museum er√∂ffnet in MDR Kultur.

The word is derived from Latin graminis, meaning \\"grass\\", and vorare, meaning \\"to eat.\\"Graminivorous  Define Graminivorous at Dictionary.com Graminivory is a form of grazing. These herbivorous animals have digestive systems that are adapted to digest large amounts of cellulose, which is abundant in fibrous plant matter and more difficult to break down for many other animals. As such, they have specialized enzymes to aid in digestion and in some cases symbiotic bacteria that live in their digestive track and \\"assist\\" with the digestive process through fermentation as the matter travels through the intestines. Horses, cattle, capybara, hippopotamuses, geese, and giant pandas are examples of vertebrate graminivores. Some carnivorous vertebrates, such as dogs and cats, are known to eat grass occasionally. Grass consumption in dogs can be a way to rid their intestinal tract of parasites that may be threatening to the carnivore's health. Various invertebrates also have graminivorous diets. Many grasshoppers, such as individuals from the family Acrididae, have diets consisting primarily of plants from the family Poaceae. Graminivores generally exhibit a preference on which species of grass they choose to consume. For example, according to a study done on North American bison feeding on shortgrass plains in north-eastern Colorado, the cattle consumed a total of thirty-six different species of plant. Of that thirty-six, five grass species were favoured and consumed the most pervasively. The average consumption of these five species comprised about 80% of their diet. A few of these species include Aristida longiseta, Muhlenbergia species, and Bouteloua gracilis.

United States Department of State Nauert at the White House on July 25, 2017 Nauert speaking with Mike Pompeo at the Singapore Summit on June 12, 2018. On April 24, 2017, the United States Department of State announced that Nauert would be the new State Department spokesperson, her first role in government. She held her first press briefing in that role five weeks later, on June 6, 2017. Following the dismissal of Steve Goldstein on March 13, 2018, Nauert was named acting Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs, the fourth ranking position in the State Department. In that role, she oversaw a budget of $1.2 billion and almost a thousand employees. During her time in the State Department, Nauert did not develop a close relationship with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, but after Tillerson's dismissal, she became part of Mike Pompeo's inner circle when he took over as Secretary of State. Nauert voiced opposition to the Iraqi Kurdistan's decision to hold an independence referendum in September 2017. When the United States withdrew from Unesco, Nauert was quoted by the New York Times as saying, \\"We were in arrears to the tune of $550 million or so, and so the question is, do we want to pay that money? With this anti-Israel bias that's long documented on the part of Unesco, that needs to come to an end.\\" In April 2018, Nauert voiced support for Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen. She also condemned \\"Iran's malign influence\\" in Yemen. In May 2018, Nauert said in response to the Gaza border protests: \\"We oppose actions against Israel at the International Criminal Court (...) because it does not help the cause for peace.\\" Nauert called for the release of Ukrainian political prisoners in Russia such as Oleg Sentsov, Stanislav Klykh, Oleksandr Shumkov and Volodymyr Balukh. Nauert condemned the genocide of the Rohingya Muslim minority in Myanmar, saying: \\"We will continue to hold those responsible accountable.\\" In August 2018, Canada called for the immediate release of Saudi human rights activist Raif Badawi and his sister, Samar Badawi. In response to Canada's criticism, Saudi Arabia expelled the Ambassador of Canada and froze trade with Canada, leading to a decline in Canada‚ÄìSaudi Arabia relations. Nauert said: \\"It is up for the Government of Saudi Arabia and the Canadians to work this out. Both sides need to diplomatically resolve this together. We cannot do it for them.\\" Nauert criticized China's re-education camps and human rights violations against ethnic Uyghurs and other predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities in China's north-western province of Xinjiang. She said that \\"credible reports indicate that individuals sent by Chinese authorities to detention centers since April 2017 number at least in the hundreds of thousands, and possibly millions.\\" In February 2019, it was reported that she did not intend to return to work as State Department spokeswoman following her withdrawal from consideration as U.N. ambassador.  Proposed nomination as United States Ambassador to the United Nations  On December 6, 2018, major news organizations reported that Trump had picked Nauert to become United States Ambassador to the United Nations. On December 7 he announced that he would nominate her to the position. Trump told reporters that Nauert was \\"excellent,\\" adding, \\"She‚Äôs been a supporter for a long time.\\" Upon the announcement of her selection, news outlets noted that she had risen rapidly through the ranks of the State Department and that she had little official foreign policy experience (though in her time as a reporter she had interviewed numerous foreign officials and world leaders). Politico wrote, \\"Less than two years ago, Heather Nauert was conducting interviews on 'Fox and Friends.' Now, she‚Äôs preparing to navigate the world‚Äôs raging geopolitical issues.\\" A Washington Post headline read, \\"Heather Nauert once cited D-Day in 'long history' of U.S.-German relations. Now she‚Äôs headed to the U.N.\\" Despite Trump‚Äôs announcement of her selection, Nauert was never formally nominated. In filling out paperwork for the appointment, she reportedly revealed that she had employed a nanny who was in the country legally but lacked a proper work visa. Citing family considerations, Nauert withdrew her name from consideration on February 16, 2019.  J. William Fulbright Foreign Scholarship Board  On March 29, 2019, President Trump appointed Heather Nauert to serve as a member on the J. William Fulbright Foreign Scholarship Board, the 12-member board meets in Washington, D.C. and is responsible for supervising the Fulbright program.

The school is located on a , multiple building campus east of downtown Indianapolis, and is the only such type school in Indiana. The school's campus originally served as a U.S. Civil War era arsenal from 1864 until 1903, when it was closed following the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. A few years later, the school opened in 1912 under founder Milo H. Stuart. A number of extant buildings dating back to military use are still open and serve academic purposes for the school, such as the Arsenal building and the Barracks. In addition, a number of additional buildings were built in the following decades to accommodate the school's functions. Due to the significance of the school's campus, facilities, and history, Arsenal Technical was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. Arsenal Technical offers four academic programs at the school. These include the New Tech program, the Math and Science program, the Law and Public Policy program, and the Career Technology Center. History Arsenal Technical High School, once a United States Arsenal, includes a Civil War armory complex and 20th-century buildings on its campus. The campus has dual significance as the oldest military installation in central Indiana, and the third oldest high school in Indianapolis (of which it is the second oldest high school to still operate at its original location). United States arsenal Following the election of Abraham Lincoln to the presidency of the United States, the prospect of civil war was evident. Indiana governor Oliver P. Morton ordered the temporary creation of an Indiana arsenal in 1861 on the present grounds of the Indiana State House. However, it soon became clear that the location would not suffice, and in 1862, Congress passed an act \\"providing for a permanent National Arsenal at Indianapolis\\". The current location was chosen by army planners because it had close access to downtown Indianapolis, but was also far enough outside the city limits that it would not disrupt any neighborhoods. The first soldiers arrived in 1865. The location was used to store heavy artillery, lighter arms, and some munitions, and was maintained by the United States government until 1903. About fifteen different commanders and fifty soldiers were stationed at the Arsenal during its years of operation.  Winona Technical Institute  After the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, arsenals were dubbed obsolete for military needs; in addition, the city of Indianapolis had fully encroached on the site at the time. Note: This includes , Site map, and Accompanying photographs As a result, in 1903, the title to the Arsenal grounds was sold at public auction to an Indianapolis public trust, which aimed to keep the property intact as the site of a school or park. In 1904, the Winona Agricultural and Technical Institute established an Indianapolis school on the site. The Indianapolis public trust planned to execute the deed to the Institute upon proof of sufficient endowment; however, a 1909 investigation made it clear that the Institute was insolvent. As a result, a case was filed and venued to the Hendricks County Circuit Court by the Indianapolis public trust. Following years of litigation, including an appeal to the Indiana Supreme Court, a 1916 ruling gave the site to the Indianapolis Public Schools district, which had expressed interest in the site.  Arsenal Technical High School  The Indianapolis Public Schools district had been leasing the site since 1912, although it was granted the site's title in 1916. The school district operated Arsenal Technical Schools (now known as Arsenal Technical High School). Milo H. Stuart, the principal of Manual Training High School, opened Arsenal Technical High School on the grounds as the school's inaugural principal. The school occupies many extant buildings original to the days of the site's usage as an Arsenal. Regardless, in the decades following the opening of the school, many new buildings were added to accommodate the school's functions. These buildings include Stuart Hall and the Howard Longshore Stadium, which were built using New Deal funds. The most recent building addition to the campus was in 2012, with the opening of a community center known as the Chase Legacy Building. Academic programs Arsenal Technical offers four academic programs at the school. These include the New Tech program, the Math and Science program, the Law and Public Policy program, and the Career Technology Center.  New Tech  The New Tech program is a project-based program in a technology-driven, college preparatory environment, with resources provided by the New Tech Network. Students can take both dual credit and Advanced Placement courses, and are provided with individual laptops.  Math and Science  The Math and Science program is a traditional college-preparatory program with a focus on the STEM field. Students are offered double blocks in science as well as Advanced Placement courses. Students can explore a number of pathways ranging from engineering to biomedical sciences to information technology.  Law and Public Policy  The Law and Public Policy program is a humanities program with a focus on law-based education. Students can take Advanced Placement courses, participate in mock trial and student court programs, and take specific courses in the law field such as Street Law, Law Education, Speech, and Debate. The program also has partnerships with several institutions of high education including Butler University, the Indiana University McKinney School of Law, and Vincennes University.  Career Technology Center  The Career Technology Center is a vocational program offering both academic- and career-based pathways. These programs range from Fire and Rescue to Automotive Services. Certain pathways operate businesses on the school campus; the Cosmetology pathway operates a salon, and the Culinary Arts pathway operates a restaurant in the West Residence known as the Colonel's Cupboard. Buildings=19th century A number of extant buildings date back to the history of the site's usage as a U.S. Civil War arsenal. As a result of the age, history, and significance of these buildings, the school is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The West ResidenceThe guardhouseThe Arsenal building, also known as the Main building, was constructed in 1864. It is a three-story building which originally served as a storehouse. Wagons would pull up under the seven-story tower and be hoisted up by a platform lift. Once in place, rifles, cannon, or other materiel was unloaded at the appropriate floor. The Powder Magazine was built in 1866, and was used to store gunpowder and other volatile substances. According to stories at the time, children along the nearby street would run past when they neared the building, fearing an explosion. The Barracks were constructed in 1867, and housed the detachment of fifty soldiers that staffed the Arsenal. The building now houses the school's Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps (JROTC) program. The Barn, later renamed Allen Hall, housed the horses used by the military. The West Residence, constructed in 1870, accommodated officers, and now houses the Colonel's Cupboard, a public, student-run restaurant. The Guard House, constructed in 1872, also contains cells used to house military offenders. 20th and 21st century In the decades following the opening of the campus as Arsenal Technical High School, a number of additional buildings were built to accommodate the school's functions. The Stuart Hall bell tower is one of the tallest structures on campus, matched only by the Arsenal.Treadwell Hall was constructed in 1921 and was the second building addition to the new school, and the only one still standing. The original officer's East Residence was demolished in 1929 after two wings were added to Treadwell Hall in 1928. Lone Hall was constructed in 1922, and was originally known as the Power and Shop Building. It housed the school's power plant and vocational classes. Stuart Hall was built in 1939. The building holds a resemblance to the Arsenal building, with red brick walls accented by white stone trim. The building also contains a memorial entrance tower with stained glass, commemorative wall artwork, and a bust depicting the building's namesake, Milo H. Stuart. On the third floor of the tower is a carillon, which plays during the school's passing periods. The Howard Longshore Stadium is where the school's football team has its games and where the marching band, track and field, and cross country teams practice. It includes a running track which circumscribes it, as well as concrete bleachers on each side. Part of the front facade of Treadwell Hall Morgan Hall, named after former principal DeWitt S. Morgan, was dedicated in 1958. The building was created to house additional vocational classes. Moon Hall, constructed in 1965, houses the kitchen and cafeteria on the first floor, and the music department on the second. The Hanson H. Anderson Auditorium, constructed in 1978, is the school's main auditorium, and the school's plays and special classes, such as set design, are held. The East Gym, which includes a swimming pool, was constructed in 1978, then known as the Girl's Gym. The Cecil L. McClintock Media Center was constructed in 1978, and consists of a library, bookstore, and an outdoor amphitheater adjacent to the building. The building also contains the Tech Centennial Museum, which opened in 2012. The Legacy Center, formally known as the Chase Legacy Building, opened in 2012. The community center has a fitness facility, art studio, garden, greenhouse, and instructional kitchen. The funds used for the construction of the building were included in Indianapolis' successful bid for the 2012 Super Bowl.  Notable principals = Milo H. Stuart  Milo H. Stuart was the founder and first principal of Arsenal Technical High School, serving from 1912 until 1930. When Stuart opened the school in 1912, he was also serving as the principal of Manual Training High School. In 1916, however, Stuart was \\"relieved of his double responsibility\\" and formally appointed as the first principal of Arsenal Technical, following an Indiana State Supreme Court which gave Indianapolis Public Schools the deed to the Arsenal site. Under his tenure, Stuart oversaw the development of the Arsenal Technical curriculum; the remodeling of old government buildings on the site; the construction of the Arsenal, the Shops, and the Gymnasium; and the development of a lasting vision and direction for the school's operation. In 1930, Milo Stuart became assistant superintendent of Indianapolis Public Schools. He died three years later, and Stuart Hall was dedicated in his honor in 1940.  DeWitt S. Morgan  DeWitt S. Morgan was the second principal of Arsenal Technical High School, serving from 1930 until 1937, when he was appointed superintendent of Indianapolis Public Schools. Prior to his appointment as Arsenal Tech principal, he served as a history teacher, and later vice principal, at the school. Morgan Hall is named in his honor.  Hanson H. Anderson  Hanson H. Anderson was the third principal of Arsenal Technical High School, serving from 1937 until 1958. Anderson was one of the first teachers employed at the school in 1912, although he was later the head of the Mathematics department as well as a vice principal. Under his tenure, Anderson oversaw the erection and dedication of Stuart Hall. The Hanson H. Anderson auditorium is named in his honor. Notable alumni *Howard H.

Performed as either an instrumental or vocal, \\"A Closer Walk\\" is perhaps the most frequently played number in the hymn and dirge section of traditional New Orleans jazz funerals. The title and lyrics of the song allude to the Biblical passage from 2 Corinthians 5:7 which states, \\"We walk by faith, not by sight\\" and James 4:8, \\"Come near to God and He will come near to you.\\" History The precise author of \\"A Closer Walk\\" was unknown until recently. Circumstantial evidence strongly suggested it dated back to southern African-American churches of the nineteenth century, possibly even prior to the Civil War, as some personal African American histories recall \\"slaves singing as they worked in the fields a song about walking by the Lord's side.\\". Horace Boyer cites a story that repudiates this claim, stating, ‚ÄúOn a train trip from Kansas City to Chicago, composer Kenneth Morris exited the train on one of its stops to get some fresh air and heard one of the station porters singing a song. He paid little attention at first, but after he re-boarded the train the song remained with him and became so prominent in his mind that at the next stop, he left the train, took another train back to the earlier station, and asked the porter to sing the song again. Morris wrote down the words and music and published the song ‚ÄúJust a Closer Walk with Thee‚Äù that year, 1940, adding a few lyrics of his own to provide more breadth. Within two years the song became a standard in gospel music, eventually becoming a standard in Jazz, and then moving into the realm of American folk music, known and sung by many (Boyer, 75).‚Äù Songs with similar chorus lyrics were published in the 1800s, including \\"Closer Walk with Thee\\" with lyrics by Martha J. Lankton (a pseudonym for Fanny Crosby) and music by William Kirkpatrick, which was published in 1885.W. McDonald, Joshua Gill, J.R. Sweney, W. J. Kirkpatrick, \\"Closer Walk with Thee\\" Songs Of Joy And Gladness, (Boston, McDonald and Gill, 1885)pg. 28 https://books.google.com/books?id=AWNpcokyYbsC Some references in Atchison, Kansas, credit an African-American foundry worker and vocalist, Rev. Elijah Cluke (1907-1974), for the current rendition of the song. \\"Just a Closer Walk with Thee\\" became better known nationally in the 1930s when African-American churches held huge musical conventions. In 1940 Kenneth Morris arranged and published for the first time the well-known version after gospel musicians Robert Anderson and R.L. Knowles listened to William B. Hurse direct a performance of it in Kansas City and then brought it to Morris' attention.Encyclopedia of African American Music, Volume 3 (ABC-CLIO), pg. 83 Morris added some new lyrics and a choral arrangement. In the 1940s, a boom of recordings recorded the number in many genres, ranging from Southern gospel to jazz and brass bands. The first known recording was by the Selah Jubilee Singers on October 8, 1941, (Decca Records 7872) New York City; with Thurman Ruth and John Ford lead vocal; Fred Baker, lead baritone; Monroe Clark, baritone; J. B. Nelson, bass vocal; and Fred Baker on guitar.Dixon, Robert M. W. Blues and Gospel Records: 1890-1943, Oxford University Press (1997), page 786 - Rosetta Tharpe also recorded the song on December 2, 1941 (Decca 8594), with Lucky Millinder and His Orchestra.Dixon, Robert M. W. Blues and Gospel Records: 1890-1943, page 912 The revived interest in traditional New Orleans jazz resulted in multiple recordings of the number, including a 1945 session by Bunk Johnson's Brass Band featuring numbers Johnson had played in New Orleans before he left in 1915. In 1950, it was a million-seller for Red Foley. In 1958, an unreleased home recording was recorded by Elvis Presley, made in Waco, Texas, on May 27.Neale, David. Roots of Elvis, iUniverse, page 74 - Presley's studio version can be heard on Just a Closer Walk with Thee (2000) (Czech CD on Memory label). Tennessee Ernie Ford made the charts with it in the late 1950s. By the end of the 1970s, more than a hundred artists had recorded the song. Lyrics I am weak, but Thou art strong, Jesus, keep me from all wrong, I‚Äôll be satisfied as long As I walk, let me walk close to Thee. Just a closer walk with Thee, Grant it, Jesus, is my plea, Daily walking close to Thee, Let it be, dear Lord, let it be. Through this world of toil and snares, If I falter, Lord, who cares? Who with me my burden shares? None but Thee, dear Lord, none but Thee. When my feeble life is o‚Äôer, Time for me will be no more, Guide me gently, safely o‚Äôer To Thy kingdom's shore, to Thy shore.

It closed in 2018 but reopened in 2019 as Arlington Middle School. History Arlington High School was established in 1961 to address rapid suburbanization in Indianapolis. Arlington was among the last public high schools to open within the Indianapolis Public Schools system. In 2004, Arlington High School implemented a small school initiative: Traditional departments were done away with and five small schools, or schools within the school were created. Each school has its own academic dean, or principal, and the previous principal became the campus administrator. This district-pushed initiative was meant to improve student success. Due to decreased district enrollment and continued low performance, Arlington became a 7‚Äì12 community school beginning in the 2008‚Äì2009 academic year. In 2015, the school was returned to the control of IPS after being run by Tindley Accelerated Schools for three years. During the early parts of the year the school was faced with many challenges including drugs, vandalism, and violence. After Principal Law requested, and was granted, additional administrative staff from the district, the school began to see a turnaround. By the end of the year academic performance had increased and disciplinary problems had decreased. In June 2017, Due to the school's low‚Äìenrollment and poor academic performance, IPS decided that Arlington would close along with two other schools; Broad Ripple and Northwest High Schools after the 2017‚Äì2018 school year.IndyStar - IPS to close Arlington, Broad Ripple, Northwest high schools - June 28, 2017IPS superintendent recommends closures of Arlington, Broad Ripple and Northwest high schools - June 28, 2017 The school board decided Arlington would reopen as a middle school for the 2018‚Äì2019 school year.

Based in the U.S. state of Oregon, OFRI is publicly funded through taxes. OFRI asserts that it is dedicated to forestry issues, including improving public understanding of the state's forest resources and encouraging \\"environmentally sound forest management.\\" OFRI provides education, training and publications for forest landowners, students and teachers, and the general public. It produces research on forest science and current issues. OFRI's seven-member staff is located in Portland. History OFRI was created by the Oregon Legislative Assembly in 1991 and is funded by a dedicated forest-products harvest tax. It is governed by a 13-member board of directors who represent small, medium and large forest producers, small woodland owners, forest sector employees, academia and the general public. The Oregon State Forester appoints 11 members. The others are ex officio: the dean of Oregon State University College of Forestry and a public representative appointed by the president of the Oregon State Senate and speaker of the Oregon House of Representatives. Controversy A 2020 investigation by Oregon Public Broadcasting (OPB) and The Oregonian, the state's newspaper of record, revealed that OFRI has acted as \\"public-relations agency and lobbying arm for Oregon's timber industry.\\" According to this view, OFRI promotes the timber industry and suppresses dissemination of legitimate research conducted by reputable scientists. On August 31st, 2020 Gov. Kate Brown requested an audit of OFRI as a result of OPB's investigation. OFRI has not been audited since 1996. Secretary of State Bev Clarno will be conducting the audit. Board of Directors The Board of Directors consists entirely of representatives from the timber industry. The state forester appoints 11 dedicated individuals to a board of directors that governs the Oregon Forest Resources Institute. The state forester is charged by statute with soliciting nominations and appointing the following board members: nine representatives of producer classes, with three each from small (Class 1), medium (Class 2) and large (Class 3) producers; one member representing small woodland owners; and one representative for forest industry employees. Ex officio members required by statute include the dean of the Oregon State University College of Forestry and a public member appointed jointly by the president of the Oregon Senate and the speaker of the Oregon House of Representatives. Board members appointed by the state forester serve three-year terms. Current OFRI board members (as of January 2016) are as follows: Class 1: producers are defined by rule as those paying the harvest tax on 20 million board feet per year or less. Class 2: producers are those paying tax on more than 20 million per year but less than 100 million board feet. Class 3: producers pay tax on 100 million board feet per year or more. Small woodland owners: are defined as those who own between 100 and 2,000 acres of forestland and who have no direct financial interest in any forest products processing activity. Current members include: Matt Hegerberg - WyEast Timber Services, LLC Jennifer Phillipi - Perpetua Forests Company Quincy Powers - Powers Ranch Company Tyler Freres - Freres Lumber Company, Inc. David Fartwangler - Cascade Timber Consulting, Inc. Eric Schooler - Collins Timber David Hampton - Hampton Lumber Jim Hunt - Campbell Global, LLC Steve McNulty - Weyerhaeuser Audrey Barnes - Nickel Mountain, LLC Mike Sullivan - Association of Western Pulp and Paper Workers Ex Officio Member - Thomas Maness - Dean, Oregon State University School of Forestry Ex Officio Member - Randy Schild - Tillamook School District no. 9 Advertising Campaigns OFRI has purchased several prominent advertising campaigns in the state of Oregon benefiting the timber industry. These campaigns are paid for with taxpayer dollars. In 2015 OFRI spent $1.05 million in taxpayer funds. In 2016-2017 the advertising campaigns have focused on promoting a corporate website created by OFRI, http://oregonforestlaws.org/ . Landowner education OFRI provides workshops, publications and conferences focused on recent science and advances in forest management practices. Its programs are available to both large and small forestland owners. Student and teacher education OFRI's K-12 forestry education programs reach more than 100,000 students and more than 1,000 educators annually. Slanted against concerns about the environment, clean drinking water, and global warming, its Oregon Forest Literacy Program includes a forest education conceptual framework correlated with state education standards that offer educators guidance for developing industry-friendly classroom lessons related to forests. Student programs include classroom presentations, career events, publications, field tours and activities. Teacher training also includes support for workshops and conferences. OFRI manages the Rediscovery Forest, a forested area used for educational purposes and to demonstrate diverse Oregon wildlife habitat and forest ecosystems. The Rediscovery Forest is located in the Oregon Garden, in Silverton. Public education To increase public understanding about Oregon forests and their management, and to promote the interests of the timber industry, OFRI produces what it describes as \\"educational spots\\" aired on broadcast and cable television; print, radio and Internet advertising; and online newsletters. It offers a speakers bureau, and co-sponsors and supports conferences and forest field trips. Publications OFRI maintains a library of approximately 70 titles that includes special reports, fact sheets, research reports, pocket reference guides and career information, all available at OFRI's website. It publishes an annual report each year in the fall.

Engines The company specialized in hot air pumping engines. A hot air engine is an external combustion engine. All hot air engines consist of a hot side and a cold side. Mechanical energy is derived from a hot air engine as air is repeatedly heated and cooled, expanding and contracting, and imparting pressure upon a reciprocating piston. Early hot air engines In his patent of 1759, Henry Wood was the first to document the powering an engine by the changing volume of air as it changed temperature. George Cayley was the first to build a working model in 1807. The Reverend Robert Stirling is generally credited with the \\"invention\\" of the hot air engine in 1816 for his development of a \\"regenerator\\" which conserves heat energy as the air moves between the hot and cold sides of the engine. Technically, not all hot air engines utilize regenerators, but the term hot air engine and Stirling engine are sometimes used interchangeably. Rider's engine Rider engine The Rider style engine is an \\"alpha\\" engine which uses two separate cylinders. As air in the hot side cylinder heats, it expands, driving the piston upward. The crankshaft now moves the cold side piston upward, drawing the hot air over to the cold side. The air cools, contracts, and pulls the hot side piston downward. The cold side piston then pushes the cool air over to the hot side, and the cycle repeats. Ericsson's engine Ericsson engine The Ericsson style engine is a \\"beta\\" engine, which contains both the power piston and displacer within one cylinder. The cylinder has a hot end, within the firebox, and a cold end, surrounded by a water jacket. As the air is heated within the cylinder, the air expands, driving the piston upward. The displacer next moves downward, pushing the air from the hot side into the cool side of the cylinder. The air then contracts, pulling the piston downward. The displacer then moves the air from the cool side to the hot side, the cycle begins again.

An early variety made of rubber carpet underlay, pioneered by the yoga teacher Angela Farmer in 1982, was called a sticky mat. Before modern times, meditative yoga and hatha yoga were practised on bare ground, sometimes with a deer or tiger skin rug. Modern mats suitable for energetic forms of yoga are made of plastic, rubber, and sometimes other materials including hessian and cork, trading off cost, comfort, grip, and weight. The yoga mat has been called \\"One of the most ubiquitous symbols of yoga's commercialization\\".  History  In ancient times, yoga was practised in India on kusha grass, on hard earth without any cover, or on a rug of deer or tiger skin, as specified in the Bhagavadgita and the Shvetashvatara Upanishad as suitable for attaining enlightenment.Bhagavadgita 6.11: In a clean place he should set up a firm seat for himself, neither too high nor too low, with a cloth, a deerskin and kusha grass on top. Due to the scarcity and cost of such rugs, they are now rarely used even in India. File:Bharadwaja.jpgThe sage Bharadvaja seated on a deer skin.

Feet tended to skid on these surfaces, requiring strength just to stand still in a pose like Trikonasana. In 1982, while teaching yoga in Germany, Angela Farmer used carpet underlay cut to towel size during yoga classes; she returned home to London with the material. Angela's father, Richard Farmer, contacted the German padding manufacturer and became the first retailer of \\"sticky mats\\". The first purpose-made yoga mat was manufactured and sold by Hugger Mugger Yoga Products in the 1990s; the company initially imported Farmer-style mats, but finding that they began to crumble with use, developed their own more robust alternative. Types Yoga mats printed with alignment marks Yoga mats are normally around long and have a width of . Yoga mats range in thickness from lightweight to (standard) and up to for either high performance mats or soft mats for yoga therapy. Yoga mats are available in many colors and patterns. \\"Alignment mats\\" are printed with guides to proper alignment, helping the yogi to place his or her feet the right distance apart and accurately in line with each other. Some companies print custom images on mats, especially the more expensive ones. Some travel mats can be folded into a small square. The first commercially produced \\"sticky\\" yoga mats were made from PVC; they have a smooth surface, and tend to be cheaper. More recently, some supposedly \\"eco-friendly\\" mats are being made from natural jute, organic cotton, and rubber. PVC mats are the spongiest, resulting in more \\"give\\" when stepped on; fibre mats such as cotton and jute are the firmest. Jute mats are the roughest; \\"sticky\\" PVC mats give good grip, but some of the modern textured mats in other materials also grip well. Smooth mats provide the most grip, so are suitable for the more energetic styles such as hot yoga and Ashtanga vinyasa yoga; the trade-off is that they may be less comfortable and appear dirty more quickly. Mats with more texture can provide more padding, useful for styles such as yin yoga where poses are held for longer periods. Travel mats are thinner and lighter, but provide less padding. Yoga Journal asked five yoga professionals for their views on yoga mats. They varied widely in their brand preferences, some choosing the traditional \\"sticky\\" type, but they agreed that mats must not be slippery. A hessian mat reviewed by The Independent gave good grip and was both comfortable and attractive; its rubber underside made it stable on any surface, but somewhat heavy; a cork mat provided both good grip and an exceptionally warm surface with a pleasant texture, and the property of being to some degree self- cleaning. The best grip was given by a smooth latex mat; in the review's opinion, its 4 mm thickness both gave enough padding for yin yoga, and the stability for energetic yoga styles. The review noted that a circular mat was at first unfamiliar, but helpful for personal practice of poses such as PrasƒÅrita PƒÅdottƒÅnƒÅsana (wide stance forward bend) and sequences where a rectangular mat would have to be turned through 90 degrees at intervals; it was also ideal for demonstrating asanas to a class. In popular culture Dog in yoga costume complete with miniature yoga mat for the Carl Schurz Park Annual Halloween Howl, 2009, New York City The yoga mat has become the definitive symbol of modern yoga as exercise. The journalist Ann Louise Bardach wrote in The New York Times in 2011 that \\"precious few of the estimated 16 million supple, spandex-clad yoginis in the United States, who sustain an annual $6 billion industry, seem to have a clue that they owe their yoga mats to Vivekananda.\\" The yoga scholar Andrea Jain wrote in The Washington Post that \\"One of the most ubiquitous symbols of yoga's commercialization is the mat, which many consider a necessity to prevent slipping, to mark territory in crowded classes or to create a ritual space.\\" She noted that \\"committed adherents\\" could pay over $100 for a luxury mat. The yoga scholar Noora-Helena Korpelainen agreed that the yoga mat had a ritual function: every Ashtanga Yoga session \\"starts with opening a yoga mat, taking a straight standing pose (samastiti·∏•) and chanting a mantra. ...The practice ends with a mantra, relaxation, and rolling up the mat.\\" See also * Yoga brick * Yoga pants ReferencesExternal links * Category:Exercise equipment Mat Category:Yoga as exercise Category:Yoga ","title":"Yoga mat"},{"id":"13412782","text":"According to a consensus of historians, many adherents in the early Latter Day Saint movement practiced plural marriage, a doctrine that states that polygyny is ordained of God.

Structure Analysed by British social anthropologist Alfred Radcliffe-Brown in 1940, it describes a kind of ritualised banter that takes place, for example between a man and his maternal mother-in-law in some South African indigenous societies. Two main variations are described: an asymmetrical relationship where one party is required to take no offence at constant teasing or mocking by the other, and a symmetrical relationship where each party makes fun at the other's expense. The joking relationship is an interaction that mediates and stabilizes social relationships where there is tension, competition, or potential conflict, such as between in-laws and between clans and tribes. Extent While first encountered by Radcliffe-Brown in the 1920s, this type of relationship is now understood to be very widespread across societies in general. In West Africa, particularly in Mali, it is regarded as a centuries- old cultural institution known as sanankuya. Antithesis This type of relationship contrasts strongly with societies where so-called avoidance speech or \\"mother-in-law\\" language is imposed to minimise interaction between the two parties, as in many Australian Aboriginal languages. Donald F. Thomson's article \\"The Joking Relationship and Organized Obscenity in North Queensland\\" gives an in-depth discussion of a number of societies where these two speech styles co-exist.American Anthropologist, 37:3(1) pp. 460‚Äì490, 1935 The joking relationships which are most unconstrained and free are between classificatory Father's Father and Son's Son‚Äîwhich appears to be the same situation in the Plains cultures of North America.

He graduated from the University of Toronto School of Architecture in 1946. He designed hundreds of unique homes, stores, offices, and public buildings, and many of his designs from the 1950s and 1960s are still strikingly modern today. His working career spanned three decades, in which time he was also a popular member of Chatham city council. His dedication to his community made the profession of architecture synonymous with that of civic leadership and public service. Storey died suddenly on his way to work in 1975 at the age of 52. The Joseph Storey Architectural Conservancy celebrates his many contributions to his home town every summer with a walking tour of homes he designed.  Building a career  After graduation from university, Joe Storey worked for one year in Toronto in the office of John Land Architect. After winning $750 in a Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation competition, he returned to his hometown of Chatham, and at the age of twenty-four he established the practice of Joseph W. Storey, Architect in the fall of 1947. The reputation of the office was quickly established by Storey‚Äôs skilled translation of the functional clarity, simplicity, and elegant forms of modernism to the urban form of the then small town of Chatham. As Chatham doubled in size over the next twenty-five years, many of its new buildings found their origins in the office of Joe Storey. Landmark buildings of Chatham such as the Ursuline Convent, Ursuline Motherhouse Chapel and Ursuline College (1958‚Äì1962) the head office of Union Gas (1965, major addition in 1973), the Kent County Courthouse (1949), the Chatham YMCA (1962,) Kent County Municipal Building (1967), the Federal Post Office Building (1955), and the Chatham Civic Centre (1975) came from a close- knit dedicated core of talented people brought together by Storey. Bob Tyndall, Wally Stewart and Roger Duchene worked with Storey's firm from the early 1950s until Storey‚Äôs untimely passing in 1975. This team was joined by many other talented people through 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, such as architects and OAA members Douglas Hanley, Robert Steele, and James H. Jorden. Chatham City Hall, 1975 Joe Storey brought a level of design and technical excellence that was consistent not only to landmark buildings, but also to elementary and secondary schools, churches, band shells, senior citizen residences, industrial buildings, and to Storey‚Äôs favourite challenge, the single family home. Scores of modest ingeniously-planned and executed residences dot the neighbourhoods of Chatham. Examples of his work can also be found in Windsor (The Energy Conversion Plant, University of Windsor), London (Brescia University College), Sarnia (YMCA) and in many other small towns in southwestern Ontario. Although Storey practised architecture out of the spotlight of Toronto, his work was innovative and progressive. His design for the Federal Post Office building (1955) featured the first use of curtain wall in Ontario. One of Storey‚Äôs more interesting unbuilt projects of his career is his design for the conversion of four abandoned sugar beet silos on industrial lands into apartments. This idea and the search for investors carried over a number of years. The value of recycling our industrial heritage is well known today, but the silos were unfortunately destroyed after Storey‚Äôs death.  Ursuline College Chapel  Ursuline Chapel, Chatham Ont. The Ursuline Convent project began when Storey was thirty-two years old. It encompassed the designs for a major chapel, motherhouse, elementary and high school classrooms, and nursery school. Storey established a model here of translating the language of modernism to the traditional public and urban landscape of the small town. The architecture of the convent, known as The Pines integrated major works of art into the siting, the building, and their expressions. Storey maintained an excellent working relationship with the sisters of the Ursuline convent who were encouraging and adventurous clients, and subsequently recommended him highly to become the architect for a similar project for the Ursuline Religious Order in Lima, Peru. This project was prominently featured in both in the RAIC Journal and Progressive Architecture Magazine. The new buildings of the Pines in Chatham were sensitively sited with the nineteenth-century convent structures by making a series of connecting cloisters formed by both buildings and graceful covered walkways. This project has recently been identified by the Ontario branch of the international group for the Documentation and Conservation of the Modern Movement, to be included on a list of twenty-five examples of significant modern architecture in Ontario.  Civic contribution  In addition to the very full schedule of his professional life, Storey was an active member of the local Rotary Club, and also served as member of the Chatham City Council in the years 1956, 1957 and 1958. During that tenure, he brought the Planning Act to Chatham and instituted the first Chatham Area Planning Board. Storey also served on the Ontario Association of Architects Council representing the St. Clair Region of several years. In the latter years of his practice, he turned his artistic talents to photography, and pioneered innovative photographic techniques in presentation and design stages of his work that is commonplace today.  Death and descendants  Joseph Storey died suddenly on his way in to work from his summer cottage in Rondeau Provincial Park in 1975 at the age of 52. His career, although filled with uncountable achievements, was only in its middle stage, and the most mature years of his work were yet to come. The sudden loss of his professional skills and civic leadership was felt keenly. Joe Storey was married to Marjorie Sunnen Storey of Chatham (d. 2004) and is survived by his sons Tom Storey, principal of the planning firm of Storey Samways Planning Ltd., of Chatham, and Mark Storey, an environmental engineer in Vancouver, B.C., and daughters Charlotte Storey DuChene, a magazine editor and writer in the Kingston area, and architect Kim Storey, a partner in Brown and Storey Architects (Toronto) since 1981.

Dalton was a trustee of the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church in Boston and \\"leading light\\" of \\"Boston's best-known black abolitionists [who] were also dominant figures in the black churches.\\"  African celebration  Dalton was one of the marshals of the 1820 annual \\"African celebration\\", so named by newspapers, of the ending of the African slave trade by the United States and Great Britain. This was an important annual event that began about 1808, with participation from prominent African-American community leaders.  Prince Hall Freemason  Dalton joined the Prince Hall Freemasonry Lodge in 1825 to build a network who could improve the lives of African Americans. He was selected Grand Master of the lodge from 1831‚Äì1832 and again from 1863-1872. Dalton was recognized as an \\"eloquent senior warden\\" of the organization. He and abolitionist David Walker oversaw the publication of John T. Hilton's An Address, Delivered Before the African Grand Lodge of Boston, No. 459, June 24th, 1828, by John T. Hilton: On the Annual Festival, of St. John the Baptist (Boston, 1828).  Massachusetts General Colored Association  Several members of the Prince Hall Lodge met in 1826 and established the Massachusetts General Colored Association \\"to promote the welfare of the race by working for the destruction of slavery.\\" The elected officers were Thomas Dalton, President; William G. Nell, Vice President; and James G. Barbadoes, Secretary. Other association members included Walker Lewis and David Walker (abolitionist), who became the organization's spokesman and wrote the 1829 Appeal to colored and white people. In it he said: \\"Remember Americans, we must be as free as you are. Will you wait until we shall under God obtain our liberty by the crushing arm of power?\\"Walker, David. Walker's Appeal, in Four Articles; Together with a Preamble, to the Coloured Citizens of the World, but in Particular, and Very Expressly, to Those of the United States of America, Written in Boston, State of Massachusetts, September 28, 1829 (electronic version) Documenting the American South, University Library, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, p. 79.  New England Anti-Slavery Society  In January 1833, Dalton as president led a successful petition for the Massachusetts General Colored Association to join the New England Anti-Slavery Society founded by William Lloyd Garrison, editor of The Liberator. Together they organized Anti-Slavery conventions and speaking programs throughout New England. In 1844, the Massachusetts General Colored Association published Light and Truth by Robert Benjamin Lewis, the first history of the colored race written by an African American.Lewis, Robert Benjamin. Light And Truth; Collected From The Bible And Ancient And Modern History, Containing The Universal History Of The Colored And The Indian Race, From The Creation Of The World To The Present Time. Joining the New England Anti-Slavery Society provided greater participation by Boston's African-American community. = Background = Boston's African-American community has worked for educational opportunities since shortly after the American Revolutionary War; in 1787 Prince Hall petitioned the legislature for equal access to public schools. His and other people's efforts to gain access to schools were denied. Parents on Beacon Hill organized to hold classes for a school at the home of Hall's son, Primus Hall, starting in 1798. Ten years later the school was moved to the African Meeting House. Parents gained partial support from the city in 1812 for the school, but continued to press for a regular public school. In the 1820s the city government provided 2 primary schools for black children.Abiel Smith School, 46 Joy Street, Museum of African American History, Boston and Nantucket. Retrieved April 24, 2013. The Abiel Smith School was built in 1834 following the bequest of $4,000 by Abiel Smith, a white philanthropist interested in supporting black education. The primary and grammar school was the first building built as a public school for African Americans in the country. = Boston Mutual Lyceum = In the spring of 1833, the year before they were married, Thomas Dalton and Lucy Lew Francis were among a small group of women and men who formed the Boston Mutual Lyceum on West Central Street to sponsor educational lectures for the colored citizens of the Boston area. Thomas was treasurer and Lucy was one of the managers. = Infant School Association = Thomas Dalton, Charles V. Caples and George Washington founded the \\"Infant School Association\\", which was approved on February 20, 1836 by the governor of Massachusetts. The organization's purpose was \\"receiving and educating children of color preparatory to their entering higher schools,\\" setting up a kind of kindergarten. The act is chapter 9 of the 1836 state statutes. = School integration = Parents complained because school conditions and teacher quality was not maintained by the Boston School Committee. Children of color were excluded from Boston's high school and Latin school. The efforts to create a separate but equal school system in Boston failed.White, Arthur T. \\"The Black Leadership Class and Education in Antebellum Boston.\\" The Journal of Negro Education, 1973: 9. In the mid-1840s, through successful lawsuits, the towns of Nantucket and Salem were forced to integrate their schools. Dalton led seventy other fellow citizens in a renewed effort to gain access for their children into the white public schools of Boston. Together with William Cooper Nell, and attorney Robert Morris, they sent petitions imploring the Boston School Committee: \\"It is very hard to retain self-respect if we see ourselves set apart and avoided as a degraded race by others. Do not say to our children that however well-behaved their very presence is in a public school, is contamination to your children.\\" They said that black schools were not providing the same level of education as the multiple forms of white schools, including \\"primary, grammar, Latin and high schools.\\" Regarding attempts at school integration, Arthur T. White wrote: > ...black separatists sought to control the Boston \\"African\\" school > mastership. This attempt undermined a movement by black and white > abolitionists to integrate Boston's schools. From the black community, > integrationists John T. Hilton, a barber, and Thomas Dalton, a tailor, with > as many as eighty-eight others had petitioned the school committee three > times between 1844 and 1846. They earnestly requested that 'exclusive > schools be abolished' and that their children be allowed to attend schools > in their respective districts. Consistently refused, blacks boycotted in the > late 1840s, lowering African school attendance by 65%.

Finally in 1855, the Massachusetts legislature > reversed the Boston School Committee's policy by outlawing race as a > criterion for admission to a public school in the Commonwealth of > Massachusetts.\\"White (1973), \\"The Black Leadership Class...\\", p.10.  Final years Lucy Lew Dalton died of old age in Charlestown on April 12, 1865. At the time of her death, she and Dalton were living at 29 South Russell Street.Charlestown.

Kwantlen Park Secondary is named after the park beside which it is located. Approval was required from the Kwantlen First Nation in order to use their name. It ranked 25 out of 298 schools in the British Columbia and the Yukon according to the Fraser Institute Studies in Education Policy in 2006-2007. History In the 1990s, Board policy resulted in the restructuring of Surrey schools so that all secondary schools enrolled grades 8 through 12. Consequently, West Whalley Junior High was demolished in August 2002 and the replacement school opened in September 2002 on an adjacent site, as \\"√âcole Kwantlen Park Secondary\\". Len Shepherd Secondary and West Whalley Junior High were amalgamated, which resulted in the entire student populations and most staff being transferred to the newly built school. Previously available programs, French Immersion at West Whalley, and Inter-A at Len Shepherd, were also brought over to the new school. Academics Along with standard Ministry of Education offerings including law, social justice, band and fine arts, there are two Surrey School District \\"Choice Programs\\" hosted on this site. French Immersion (grades 8-12) and a one-of-a-kind program called Inter-A are provided here. Inter-A students in grades 7-12 work in cross-grade clusters at their own pace in mathematics, which shares a year-long approach to physical education and fine arts courses. Facilities Kwantlen Park boasts a well equipped \\"super lab\\" which may be booked by any of the three academic programs. There are strong Metal Work, Carpentry, and Info-tech programs. A thriving drama program is staged in a 200+ seat theatre. Grounds are shared with the adjacent park in a partnership with the City of Surrey and contain baseball diamonds, soccer and all-weather fields. There is a renovated playground and an outdoor swimming pool in the park behind the school.

Zwonitzer later discussed his speech on a radio program hosted by Joe Solmonese, president of the Human Rights Campaign and was picked up quickly by several bloggers, including Michael Petrelis, who posted the entire text of Zwonitzer's speech to the House Rules Committee on his blog. On May 6, 2007, Zwonitzer was awarded the \\"Uncommon Courage Award\\" by the Log Cabin Republicans, an organization lobbying for gays within the Republican Party, at its annual national convention in Denver. The award, which applauds Republican elected officials for displaying \\"leadership in fighting for basic fairness for gay and lesbian families,\\" was also presented to Michigan State Representative Lorence Wenke and New York Assemblywoman Teresa Sayward.

U.) is a premier Four Star public university in Purba Bardhaman, West Bengal, India. It was established by the West Bengal Government as a teaching and affiliating university on 15 June 1960 with six graduate departments and 30 undergraduate colleges spread over three districts that come under the jurisdiction of the university. The jurisdiction covers Birbhum district, Purba Bardhaman district and Hooghly district except Srirampore subdivision. The main campus is of 398 acres (approximately). The University has four academic campuses ‚Äî1) Golapbag Campus 2) UIT campus for Engineering. 3) Rajbati Campus 4) Tara bag Campus for Medical Education. It has been awarded Four Star status by NAAC under UGC, Govt. of India. This University is famous for Law , Management, Engineering & Medical Education. The university offers more than 30 undergraduate and 66 postgraduate courses. There are 227 Esteemed Faculties and 189 affiliated colleges (including degree colleges, B.Ed. colleges and private professional institutes). History The last maharaja of Burdwan, Udaychand Mahtab, left the entire property of Burdwan to the government of West Bengal after the zamindari system ended in the 1950s. The then chief minister of West Bengal, Bidhan Chandra Roy took the initiative of establishing a university at the premises of the palace of the maharaja. Thus the university was established in 1960. Sukumar Sen (ICS) was the first vice-chancellor. The university began with the humanities division, with the science and engineering courses included afterwards.List of State Universities, University Grants Commission The university had jurisdiction over Purulia district, Birbhum district, Paschim Bardhaman district, Bankura district, Purba Bardhaman district and Hooghly district except the Srirampore subdivision. Over the years, the university lost the jurisdiction over the districts of Purulia, Bankura and Asansol, Durgapur to local universities, namely Sidho Kanho Birsha University in Purulia, Bankura University in Bankura and Kazi Nazrul University in Asansol & Durgapur. Administration Burdwan University is an autonomous state university. The governor of the state of West Bengal is its chancellor. Daily administration is handled under the leadership of the vice chancellor, who is appointed by the governor on the recommendations of the government of West Bengal. The vice chancellor is assisted by the pro vice chancellor who is de facto a senior faculty member of faculty of engineering and technology. In the administrative structure, the highest body is the university court. It consists of members elected by the staff of the university from amongst themselves as well as alumni. Next in hierarchy comes the executive council, which takes all the decisions relating to day-to-day functioning. It consists of staff and student members from the three faculties. The student members of the faculties finding representation on the executive council are the chairmen of the three student councils of unions. The three faculties, in turn, have their own councils that are changed every four years and differ in their compositions. The Engineering faculty, for example, has members who are nominated either by the vice chancellor or are invited from the schools under the faculty. The Arts and Science faculties have member from the respective faculties. A common factor in each of the three is that each department is represented on the council by the head of the department and at least one other faculty member of the department. Outside these councils are the offices of the registrar, finance officer, controller of examinations, university engineer, faculty secretaries, placement coordinator, and deans of the three faculties and students welfare which are responsible for the administrative tasks delegated to them. Finally, at the departmental level are the heads of departments. Admission and academic faculties Burdwan University academic complex, South Gate For admissions to the Engineering faculty at the undergraduate level, students are admitted through the WBJEE, an entrance examination open to students from all over India. Unlike in a large number of states, there is no domicile quota in BU (or for other engineering colleges admitting students through the WBJEE). Postgraduate students in engineering are admitted through GATE. Admission to the Arts and Science faculties is by individual examinations for each of the departments at the undergraduate and postgraduate levels. Weight is given to marks obtained at the higher secondary level for undergraduate admissions and at the undergraduate level for postgraduate level. Distance education The University of Burdwan has a Directorate of Distance Education (DDE, BU) for conducting post-graduate studies in distance mode. This is for people (mainly workers) who cannot undergo post-graduate studies in regular (full-time) mode. The DDE was established in 1994. Courses of distance education in the university are approved by University Grants Commission (UGC) and the Distance Education Council. Library and centers The University has a \\"Central Library\\" including other Departmental Libraries. University Institute of Technology (UIT) University Institute of Technology (UIT) is a Government autonomous old professional engineering college under the University of Burdwan. It represents the faculty of engineering that was at National Institute of Technology, Durgapur since its inception. This college was inaugurated in 2001 by the then chief minister of West Bengal Shri Buddhadeb Bhattacharya. UIT is approved by the Government of West Bengal and All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE). UIT is a National Board of Accreditation (NBA) accredited institute. Admission in this college is done through centralized counseling by West Bengal Joint Entrance Examination Board. It is a NAAC accredited 'A' grade institute of the University of Burdwan.  Rankings  It was ranked 89th among the Universities of India by the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) in 2019. This University is ranked 3rd among all the Universities of West Bengal.

Many types of neutral fats are possible both because of the number and variety of fatty acids that could form part of it and because of the different bonding locations for the fatty acids. An example is a monoglyceride, which has one fatty acid combined with glycerol, a diglyceride, which has two fatty acids combined with glycerol, or a triglyceride, which has three fatty acids combined with glycerol. Neutral fats are usually found in the thigh and torso area of the body as padding and insulation to keep warm.  Triglycerides  Triglycerides are formed from the esterification of 3 molecules of fatty acids with one molecule of trihydric alcohol, glycerol (glycerine or trihydroxy propane). In the process, 3 molecules of water are eliminated. The word \\"triglyceride\\" refers to the number of fatty acids esterified to one molecule of glycerol. In triglycerides, the three fatty acids are rarely similar and are thus called pure fats. For example, tripalmitin, tristearin, etc. Sources * Biology 12: a student resource, R. Prior.

It was founded in 1902 when the Apostolic Nuncio to the Philippines offered ten Filipino nuns from the Augustinian Sisters of Our Lady of Consolation a house near the Basilica of San Sebasti√°n. The college is located beside the Centro Escolar University and across College of the Holy Spirit in the city's San Miguel district, where also Malaca√±ang Palace is located. Campus La Consolacion College Manila is in Mendiola Street, at the doorstep of Malaca√±ang Palace, and occupying a trapezoidal area of 2.8 hectares enclosed by the streets of Arlegui, San Rafael , C.A. Aguila and Mendiola. Within the vicinity there are other colleges and universities forming the \\"university belt\\" of Claro M. Recto Avenue and Legarda Street. With the completion of the Line 2 with stations at Recto and Legarda, La Consolacion College Manila is only minutes away from areas up north like Pasig, Marikina, and Quezon City. From the south, buses, fxs, and jeepneys find their route to the heart of Mendiola making the college accessible from any part of the metro. It is one of the Catholic schools administered by the Augustinian Sisters of Our Lady of Consolation (ASOLC). Aside from the Administration building, Mo. Consuelo Barcelo Auditorium, Gregor Mendel Science Center, and classroom buildings -- St. Augustine, Sta. Monica, Our Lady of Consolation, Kamalayan (which houses the college library), and the Mother Rita Building (also known as LCCM International Center) -- La Residencia 1 and 2 (dormitories), occupy the land area. Today, there are more than 3,500 students, faculty, and staff. History La Consolacion College Manila was founded in 1902 when His Excellency Msgr. Placido Chapelle, the Papal Nuncio, offered the first ten Filipino Augustinian Sisters a house at R. Hidalgo St., Quiapo near the Basilica of San Sebastian. Chapelle convinced the sisters, Agustinas Terciarias, to cease the operation of their asilo-colegio and to establish a defined school for women whose objective was to provide training and instruction to those intending to pass the civil service examination. The school was named Colegio de Nuestra Se√±ora de la Consolacion. Sor Clara del Santissimo Sacramento was the first directress of the colegio. The Filipino Augustinian Sisters who founded the school were the same group given the order to disband by the Father Provincial of the Augustinian Order in 1899 during the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War when the remaining Catalan Sisters, Sor Rita Barcelo y Pages and Sor Consuelo Barcelo y Pages, left for Spain. The Catalan Sisters were founding sisters of the asilo-colegio in Mandaluyong when they arrived in the country in 1883. After years of steady growth, the school caught fire in 1909 and was destroyed. In 1910, a new building rose in its present location. It was during this period that the school received the American government's recognition and a permit to include secondary course. As the first among private schools recognized in Manila, G.A. O'Reilly, superintendent of private schools, described it as \\"most proficient\\". During its 25th year, in 1927, the school started the expansion of its physical facilities. In 1937 the Junior Normal was opened. During the Second World War, Japanese soldiers occupied the school. Right after the war in 1945, the school played host to the offices of the Catholic Welfare Organization (CWO) and the Catholic Educational Association of the Philippines (CEAP). It also started conducting \\"abridged classes\\". A commencement exercise was held in November for the graduates of 1944-45 before the Junior Normal was reopened on December of the same year. 1945 was marked with two developments: It was the year when the school started accepting boys in the elementary level, and the school adopted La Consolacion College as its official name. The post-war period was characterized by physical and curricular expansion of the school. In 1947, the Junior Normal had its first set of graduates. The Music Department was recognized to confer diplomas and issue certificates in 1948. By 1951, the Secretarial Department and the combined Junior Normal and Home Economics were added. In 1952, the Office of the College Dean was established paving the way for bachelor's degrees. BSEd was offered in 1962 followed by BS in Commerce as well as other courses. In 1974, the school's Board of Trustees was instituted. When the school turned 75, the Mother Rita Barcelo Pastoral Formation Center (MRBPFC) was established as a non-formal educational unit geared towards community assistance. Two years after, in 1979, the school adopted the Catholic Schools' System Development (CSSD) while at the same time working on the Philippine Accrediting Association of Schools, Colleges and Universities (PAASCU) accreditation, which was eventually passed in 1981. The following year, Basic Education Scheme was also adopted. Computer Program was introduced to the College and Basic Education Department in 1985 and 1988, respectively. The 1990s opened the doors of LCCM to foreign academic and professional linkages. On the eve of its centennial, the school opened a dormitory, La Residencia, and the Kamalayan building which houses the college library, the multimedia, business and case rooms, SMART rooms, the school canteen, the offices of the Center for Technology and Curriculum Development (CTCD) and the School of Information Technology & Computer Studies. The school officially adopted La Consolacion College Manila as its name. In 2004, LCCM inaugurated the Gregor Mendel Science Center where the Research Center, Nursing Review Center, nursing and science laboratories, e-learning laboratories, etc., are to be found. Today, La Consolacion College Manila is composed of its College Department with its six schools -- Business and Accountancy, Arts and Sciences, Nursing, HRM and Tourism, Information Technology & Computer Studies, and Music -- and the Basic Education Department.

He was a member of the House of Representatives from 1903 to 1922 and from 1928 to his death, on both occasions representing the Division of Franklin in Tasmania. He represented five different political parties during his time in parliament, eventually seeing out his final term as an independent. Early life Born in Bream Creek, near Sorell, Tasmania, the son of Irish immigrants who ran the local school. Originally trained as a teacher, McWilliams became a journalist in 1877, rising to editor of the Launceston Telegraph in 1883. Marrying Josephine Fullerton in Melbourne on 19 October 1893, McWilliams's role as editor helped his stature in the local community enough to ensure his election to the Tasmanian House of Assembly for the electorate of Ringarooma in the 1893 election. An Australian rules football fan, in 1897 McWilliams help found the Southern Tasmania Football Association and remained a senior figure in football administration in Tasmania. McWilliams bought the Hobart-based Tasmanian News in 1896 and moved to Hobart shortly after, unsuccessfully standing for the seat of Glenorchy in 1900. Politics Switching to federal politics, McWilliams won the Franklin at the 1903 election as a Revenue Tariffist supporting the Free Trade Party on most economic issues. In parliament, McWilliams advocated strongly on behalf of farmers, investigated the possibility of introducing sugarbeet farming into Tasmania and helped found the Tasmanian meteorological bureau. He also supported giving women and ex-convicts the vote but opposed Federation, believing it should be delayed. In parliament, McWilliams, like almost all his fellow members, strongly supported the White Australia Policy, but opposed federal spending on issues such as the establishment of the High Court of Australia, a federal department of agriculture, a transcontinental railway and federal acquisition of the Northern Territory. As in state parliament, McWilliams was a staunch advocate on rural matters, supporting the timber industry and primary producers. Leader of the Country Party McWilliams as an MP After assisting in the formation of the Country Party in 1920, McWilliams was appointed as its first federal parliamentary leader.Graham, B. (1966) The Formation of the Australian Country Parties, ANU Press However McWilliams did not always see eye to eye with his party colleagues and at times voted against the wishes of the party. He was relieved of the leadership of the Country Party in April 1921 and lost his seat at the 1922 election. Later years McWilliams left the Country Party after losing the leadership, and unsuccessfully contested Franklin at the 1925 election as a Nationalist.

In April 1945 he was appointed commander of fighter wing Jagdgeschwader 51. Shortly after the end of the war the British wanted to evaluate the performance of the German Fw 190 D-13. At Flensburg, the British Disarmament Wing wanted to compare the fighter's performance against a Hawker Tempest. Squadron Leader Evans approached Major Lange and asked him to fly a mock combat against one of their pilots. Lange accepted, even though he had only ten flights in a D-9.Crandal 2000, p. 17. The mock dogfight was conducted at an altitude of 3,000 meters, with only enough fuel for the flight and no ammunition. The machines proved evenly matched. Major Lange assessed that the outcome of such a contest greatly depended on the skills of the individual pilot. At the time Major Lange was not aware that he was not flying a D-13, but rather a D-9. After the war Lange attended the University of Kiel and studied law receiving a doctorate in law (Dr. jur.) degree. In August 1950 he started his career working for the Gerling Insurance Group.

Early Life Maggie Boyle was born in the Battersea district of southwest London, and grew up in London's Irish community. Her father was a fiddle player from the Donegal Gaeltacht, and her mother a dancer. In addition to her father, her other main tutor was Oliver Mulligan, a singer from County Monaghan, resident in London. As a youngster Boyle joined the Fulham branch of Comhaltas Ceolt√≥ir√≠ √âireann, through which she won All‚ÄëBritain singing competitions. As a teenager Boyle performed with her brothers Kevin and Paul as The Boyle Family. Through the overlapping folk club and Irish music scenes in London she met Steve Tilston, a professional folk singer, and they married in 1984. Career In 1984, at the recommendation of Mike Taylor of the musical group Incantation, Boyle joined the live performance production company of Christopher Bruce's ballet Sergeant Early's Dream. Six musicians performed English, Irish and American folk songs at the back of the stage, while a dancer interpreted them at the front. Boyle toured the world with the company for several years. The 1994 CD version of the production featured Incantation plus the Sergeant Early Band, including Maggie Boyle and Steve Tilston. Boyle was a member of John Renbourn's group Ship of Fools (1988), which released one album on the Run River label, owned and operated by her then husband and fellow group member Steve Tilston. In 1992, Maggie formed the harmony group Grace Notes with Helen Hockenhull and Lynda Hardcastle. The trio enjoyed success in concerts and festivals throughout the country, and were particular favourites at the annual Whitby folk week. They made five albums, starting with Down Falls the Day (1993) and ending with 20 (2012), to celebrate Grace Notes‚Äôs 20th anniversary. Boyle performed most of the music used in the movie Patriot Games, based on Tom Clancy's novel of the same name. She also sang on the soundtrack of the movie Legends of the Fall (1994). In 2012, Boyle began a website-based travelogue-style project to capture performances and collaborations with various folk songwriters she admired. Entitled Kitchen Songs, it includes performances and duets with Ralph McTell, Jez Lowe, Pete Coe and Steve Tilston ‚Äì all recorded in their respective kitchens when she visited their homes. Also in 2012, Boyle released a solo album, Won't You Come Away, on Wild Goose Records with Paul Downes on guitar, mandocello and mandolin and Jon Boden on fiddle. She is mother to Joe Tilston, guitarist of the band Random Hand. Much of the Boyle family continue to make music today, including Ms Boyle's brother Kevin, who released his second CD since Bon Cabbage, to which Maggie contributed, in the summer of 2009. Kevin Boyle also continues to tour and record with his band, Le Cheile. Death Boyle died from cancer on 6 November 2014 in West Yorkshire, survived by her children and her partner.

It is set in New Mexico in the late 19th century, and concerns the clash between rich ranchers, whose cattle run freely on government-owned land, a prairie \\"sea of grass,\\" and the homesteaders or \\"nesters,\\" who build fences and try to cultivate the soil for subsistence farming. It is an epic portrayal of the end of the cowboy era in the American Southwest on the Great Plains. Against this background is set the triangle of cattle rancher Jim Brewton, his wife Lutie Cameron from St. Louis, and Brice Chamberlain, an ambitious local federal judge. Richter casts the story in Homeric terms, with the children caught up in the conflicts of their parents. The novel is narrated through the eyes of Hal, Colonel Brewton's nephew. Plot summaryReception The book was well received and contributed to establishing his reputation as a historical novelist. Adaptation The novel was adapted in 1947 as a film of the same name, directed by Elia Kazan and starring Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy. Disappointed with production decisions, such as the use of stock footage of the Plains rather than allowing the film crew to go on location, and overly refined costuming for Hepburn, Kazan was displeased with the film. He discouraged others from seeing it. But, it was popular, and the greatest moneymaker of the several Hepburn-Tracy films.  References  Category:1936 American novels Category:Alfred A.

Ferenczi linked 'the purely \\"autoplastic\\" tricks of the hysteric...[to] the bodily performances of \\"artists\\" and actors'.Steven Wainrib, \\"Autoplastic\\" Freud's only public use of the terms was in his paper \\"The Loss of Reality in Neurosis and Psychosis\\" (1924), where he points out that 'expedient, normal behaviour leads to work being carried out on the external world; it does not stop, as in psychosis, at effecting internal changes. It is no longer autoplastic but alloplastic '.Frued, On Psychopathology p. 224 A few years later, in his paper on \\"The Neurotic Character\\" (1930), Alexander described 'a type of neurosis in which...the patient's entire life consists of actions not adapted to reality but rather aimed at relieving unconscious tensions'. Alexander considered that 'neurotic characters of this type are more easily accessible to psychoanalysis than patients with symptom neuroses...[due] to the fact that in the latter the patient has regressed from alloplasticity to autoplasticity; after successful analysis he must pluck up courage to take action in real life'. Otto Fenichel however took issue with Alexander on this point, maintaining that 'The pseudo- alloplastic attitude of the neurotic character cannot be changed into a healthy alloplastic one except by first being transformed, for a time, into a neurotic autoplastic attitude, which can then be treated like an ordinary symptom neurosis'. Human evolution Alloplasticity has also been used to describe humanity's cultural \\"evolution\\". Man's 'evolution by culture...is through alloplastic experiment with objects outside his own body....Unlike autoplastic experiments, alloplastic ones are both replicable and reversible'.Kaoru Yamamoto, Too Clever for our own Good (2007) p. 7 In particular, 'advanced technological societies...are generally characterized by \\"alloplastic\\" relations with the environment, involving the manipulation of the environment itself'.C.

The concept of autoplastic adaptation was developed by Sigmund Freud, S√°ndor Ferenczi, and Franz Alexander. They proposed that when an individual was presented with a stressful situation, he could react in one of two ways: * Autoplastic adaptation: The subject tries to change himself, i.e. the internal environment. * Alloplastic adaptation: The subject tries to change the situation, i.e. the external environment. Autoplasticity, hysteria and evolution 'Hysterical individuals appear to be turned inward. Their symptoms, instead of presenting actions directed outward (alloplastic activities), are mere internal innervations (autoplastic activities)'. Freud, with 'his single-minded Lamarckianism', speculated that behind 'Lamarck's idea of \\"need\\"' was the 'power of unconscious ideas over one's own body, of which we see remnants in hysteria, in short, \\"the omnipotence of thought\\"'.Peter Gay, Freud: A Life for Our Time (London 1989)p. 368 and p. 647 As a result, among his immediate followers, 'Insight into this regressive nature of the phenomenon of conversion may be taken as a starting-point for speculation about the archaic origin of the capacity for autoplastic conversion...according to which evolution took place through the autoplastic adaptation of the body to the demands of the environment'. Cross-cultural autoplasticity 'Cross-cultural helpers have debated what has been called the autoplastic/alloplastic dilemma: how much should clients be encouraged to adapt to a given situation and how much...to change?

Transportation in Omaha, Nebraska, includes most major modes, such as pedestrian, bicycle, automobile, bus, train and airplane. While early transportation consisted of ferries, stagecoaches, steamboats, street railroads, and railroads, the city's transportation systems have evolved to include the Interstate Highway System, parklike boulevards and a variety of bicycle and pedestrian trails. The historic head of several important emigrant trails and the First Transcontinental Railroad, its center as a national transportation hub earned Omaha the nickname \\"Gate City of the West\\" as early as the 1860s.Mullens, P.A. (1901) Biographical Sketches of Edward Creighton and John A. Creighton. Creighton University. p 24. During a tumultuous pioneer period characterized by its centrality in proximity to the Western United States, transportation in Omaha demanded the construction of massive warehouses where frontier settlers could stock up and communities west of Omaha got food and supplies to build themselves with. Riverboats and stagecoaches jammed the riverside city with a variety of newcomers, prospectors and shady characters. Early Omaha also landed the Union Pacific Railroad headquarters, leading to its important place in national railroad lore. After quickly growing into a city, Omaha failed to pave its streets accordingly. A chaotic transportation system was highlighted by several miles of successful horsecar tracks; however, the city only ever had four miles (6 km) of cable car service. Several early suburbs were built on reliance of service from these lines, including Dundee, Benson and Kountze Place. In the early 1880s an extensive boulevard system was built to create a park-like atmosphere for drivers throughout the city. The Trans-Mississippi Exposition in 1889 led to the construction of many new transportation features, particularly the magnificent Burlington Station. In the 1930s the city's transportation system was marred by violent protests. Transit workers wanted to unionize, and with the main company's management against any effort to change Omaha's reputation as a non-unionized city. After the introduction of buses in the early 1950s, streetcars were closed down, and in the last years of the decade the city began construction on its components in the Interstate Highway System. Today Omaha's transportation system is growing with the city, and trails for bicycles and pedestrians, as well as public transportation, highways and parkways, and other innovations are being developed. The city has a section of the Lincoln Highway listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and there are more than of Interstate and freeway lanes, more than any other area in the state of Nebraska.O'Connor, M.

The Pony Express and Wells Fargo lines maintained offices in the city. Streets Omaha had terrible streets through the late 1880s, which caused many residents to believe the city was not progressing appropriately. This lack of responsiveness by the city government was caused by property owners throughout the city who did not want to pay for improvements.

The PET covers three areas: quantitative reasoning, verbal reasoning and English language. It is administered by the National Institute for Testing and Evaluation (NITE) and plays a considerable role in the admissions process. A score combining students' performance on the PET with the average score of their high school matriculation tests (aka Bagrut) has been found to be a highly predictive indicator of students' academic performance in their first year of higher education. The test may be taken in Hebrew, Arabic, Russian, French, or combined Hebrew/English. There are four test administration dates each year: April, July, September, and December (the dates vary depending on local holidays and on the start and end dates of the academic semester). It can be taken in Hebrew and Arabic on any of the four dates, and in Russian, French and combined Hebrew/English, on two of the four dates. The test results are valid for university admissions purposes for seven years. Purpose According to NITE, the sole purpose of the PET is to predict candidates' chances of success in academic studies. The test is used to assess all candidates on a standard scale. This scale, combined with the high school matriculation test results, allows the various admissions departments to rank the candidates applying to their institution. Extensive research shows that the PET scores can predict success in higher education more accurately than any other single tool. In addition, it has been shown that the combination of the PET and matriculation results has better predictive power than any other combination of existing screening tools. Structure The PET consists of nine sections, each of which belongs to one of the following domains: verbal reasoning, quantitative reasoning, and English. The first section, part of the verbal reasoning domain, is the writing task. It is followed by eight sections of multiple-choice questions ‚Äì two sections from each of the three domains and two \\"pilot sections.\\" Pilot sections look like regular test sections but are not included in the computation of the PET score. These sections are used for equating and standardizing between different test administrations and for assessing the functioning of items that will be used in future tests. The sections are built in such a way that it is not possible to know which are for \\"pilot\\" purposes, therefore the examinees must give all sections equal attention. NITE states that every PET may contain sections or items that were used in previous tests, and that new types of questions may appear in any of the domains, along with changes in instructions for solving them, in the number of questions in a section, and in the time allotted.  Writing task  The section that comprises the writing task is part of the verbal reasoning domain. Examinees taking the test in Hebrew have 30 minutes to complete this section and examinees taking the test in other languages have 35 minutes. Examinees are required to write an essay of at least 25 lines on a given topic. The essay should be written in an academic style with a clear and well-reasoned presentation and discussion of an argument. The writing task constitutes 25% of the verbal reasoning score and is rated on the basis of two dimensions ‚Äì language and content. The score for each dimension ranges from 1 to 6. The score for content relates to the quality of the arguments presented, as well as the quality and complexity of critical thinking demonstrated. The score for the language dimension relates to wording, writing style, and language level. These components are the basis for good academic writing, and candidates who do not have a sufficient grasp of them will find it difficult to present their knowledge in written form. Each examinee's writing task is evaluated by two independent raters. The final score for the writing task is a weighting of the four scores given by the two reviewers. In the end, the examinees receive one score for the verbal reasoning domain, and it includes the weighted score for the writing task. Therefore, the examinees cannot know the score given to them for the writing task.  Verbal reasoning  As of 2020, the verbal reasoning section in the Hebrew PET contains 23 questions (20, in other languages) and is allotted 20 minutes. The types of questions in the verbal section are: * Analogies ‚Äì This type of item examines three components of verbal ability: vocabulary, the ability to recognize a relationship between two words or phrases, and the ability to identify that same relationship in another set of words or phrases. * Critical Reading and Inference Questions ‚Äì These questions relate to various abilities: comprehension of a short text, inference (drawing conclusions from the text, identifying what argument weakens a conclusion presented in the text, and so forth), sentence completion, and more. * Text Comprehension Questions ‚Äì A complex text (usually a synopsis of an academic article) is presented together with a number of reading comprehension questions. There is a gradual increase in the difficulty level in the order of the questions, except for the text comprehension questions (which are arranged in the order in which the question topic appears in the text). As mentioned, the verbal reasoning score obtained by the examinees is the weighting of the score given for the section of multiple-choice questions together with that given for the writing task section. It is not possible to know the exact score of each. Quantitative reasoning As of 2020, the quantitative reasoning section contains 20 questions covering various areas of mathematics, such as geometry, algebra, percentages, averages, ratio questions, drawing conclusions from a diagram, and so on. The allotted time is 20 minutes. For the most part, the difficulty level of questions in the section increases ‚Äì with the more difficult questions appearing last. The mathematical knowledge required for the quantitative reasoning section is similar to that required for the high school matriculation examination in mathematics at the three-unit level ‚Äì the minimum level required for obtaining a high school matriculation certificate and for admission to academic studies. English As of 2020, the English section contains 22 questions and the allotted time is 20 minutes. This section tests the examinee's proficiency in the English language; there are three types of questions: * Sentence Completion ‚Äì This question type examines the vocabulary level of the examinee and the ability to infer meaning from context. * Restatement ‚Äì This item type consists of a sentence followed by four possible ways of restating the main idea of that sentence. Examinees are required to choose a restatement which best expresses the meaning of the original sentence. * Reading comprehension ‚Äì Two relatively long texts are presented, each of which is followed by several reading comprehension questions. * The difficulty level of the questions in each section of the section increases gradually, except for the reading comprehension section (where the questions are arranged in the order in which the question topic appears in the text). Scores Applicants can access their score by logging on to the NITE website within 45 days of the test date. The scores are also sent to the applicants separately by mail and forwarded to the major academic institutions in Israel ‚Äì Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Bar-Ilan University, University of Haifa, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Tel Aviv University and Technion - Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa. The scores will also be sent to any additional higher education institutions specified by applicants on their registration form. The report includes the following details: # The score in each of the three test domains: verbal reasoning, quantitative reasoning, and English. # The three final PET scores, based on different weightings of the three domain scores, The scores in the PET range from 200 to 800, and are a weighted average of the scores in the three test domains, with the quantitative and verbal domains each comprising 40% of the score and the English domain comprising the remaining 20%. The scores in each field individually range from 50 to 150, depending on the number of errors in that field, as well as other statistical calculations. The purpose of these calculations is to ensure the score is not affected by the test administration date chosen. As of October 2012, apart from the general PET score, two additional scores are calculated for examinees: The quantitative-oriented score is calculated as follows: 60% for the quantitative reasoning domain, while the verbal and English sections are weighted at 20% each. The verbal- oriented score is calculated as follows: 60% for the verbal reasoning section, while the quantitative reasoning and English domains are weighted at 20% each. Each academic institution can select which score to consider for admissions to their departments. In addition the English score is used to determine the English language level of the examinees and for placement in English courses at the appropriate level. The final PET score is a relative score. This means that the personal score reflects the ability of the examinee in the different domains relative to other examinees. The score distribution is roughly a normal distribution, with an average of 548 and a standard deviation of 108.2 (as of 2018). As usual in a normal distribution, as you move away from the average, the score becomes less common: according to NITE, in 2018, about five thousand examines (representing about 5.7% of all examines in that ) received a score of 701 or higher, of which only 3 achieved a score of 791 or higher. About 1,800 examines (constituting 3.2% of those who took the test in the same year) received a score equal to or less than 350.  Preparation  Familiarity with the test format and with the types of questions that appear in the test can benefit the examinees. Therefore, NITE recommends that examinees review item types and the various test instructions. For this purpose, NITE offers sample tests on its site. Also, as of February 2009, NITE is required to publish a test form after each test date. To help the students prepare for the test effectively, private companies throughout the country offer preparatory courses for the test. In early 2019, following public criticism and protest at the costs of these courses, the Ministry of Social Equality in collaboration with NITE launched a free online preparatory course for the Hebrew PET. According to a study conducted by NITE, examines who have prepared for the test with the help of a preparatory course have improved their score by only a few points compared to the score increase obtained by students who prepared on their own. In general, the score of those who take the test two or more times is higher than that of those who take the test for the first time. This phenomenon has several possible explanations, and does not prove that retaking the test necessarily leads to an improved score.  Other tests  In addition to the PET, NITE administers Hebrew and English language proficiency tests, which are used by the universities for admissions and for placement of applicants in language courses at the appropriate level. AMIR, AMIRAM ‚Äì English Proficiency Tests: These tests assess examinees' level of English and allow them to obtain a score in English without having to take the PET. The score given on these tests is comparable to the score given on the English section of the PET. YAEL, YAELNET ‚Äì Hebrew Proficiency Tests: These tests are intended to assess an examinees' proficiency in Hebrew and are used for placement in Hebrew language course at the appropriate level. Most institutions of higher education in Israel require a YAEL score as part of the entrance procedure for examinees who have taken the PET in a language other than Hebrew; or who were not required to take the PET and took high school matriculation tests (Bagrut) in a language other than Hebrew. An examinee is allowed to take the YAEL immediately following the PET (in which case there is no test fee). It can also be taken as a stand-alone test (usually intended for those whose mother tongue is not Hebrew).  Arguments Against the PET Requirement  Opposition to the PET as an admissions requirement is voiced by some who argue that examinees of certain socio-cultural backgrounds tend to be more successful than others. Also, it has been argued that the structure and content of the test may make it difficult for examinees with learning disabilities. Another claim is that the high cost of pre-exam preparatory courses pose an obstacle to candidates with financial difficulties, which means that candidates from a better socio-economic background have an advantage. The issue of the extent to which pre-exam preparatory courses contribute to success on the PET is a matter of debate, and according to a study by NITE, the advantage gained by such courses is negligible when compared to the results of students who prepared for the test on their own. This argument in any case holds less weight, given that there is now a free online preparatory course for the PET. In January 2014, the Minister of Education at the time announced the intention to cancel the PET and allow higher education admissions to be based solely on high school matriculation results. However, because of opposition from university deans (based on doubts regarding the soundness and reliability of matriculation results), the PET was not canceled and continues to be one of the major assessment tools in higher education admissions in Israel. Only candidates with exceptional matriculation results will be considered for admission without a PET score.  Admissions Without PET Requirement  In 2016, higher education institutions in Israel began publicizing the possibility of admissions without the PET requirement. In some institutions, admissions to certain fields of study would be possible based only on the matriculation scores. Another option was the Open University Transition program: students could take several courses at the Open University ‚Äì where matriculation and PET scores are not required for admission ‚Äì and, based on their achievements in these courses, could later transfer to other academic institutions. In some institutions, it was decided that admissions would be based on a candidate's achievements on online courses, weighed together with their matriculation scores.

Co-written by novelist Indra Soundar Rajan and produced by Padmini Ravi, herself a dancer, it stars Aditi Rao Hydari, in her Tamil film debut, in the lead role alongside Manoj K. Jayan, Hamsa Moily and Y. Gee. Mahendra. The film depicts the life of a Devadasi during the 1920s. Sringaram became highly critically acclaimed, winning three prizes at the 53rd National Film Awards and two Tamil Nadu State Film Awards, besides several screenings at various international film festivals, much before its theatrical release on 5 October 2007. Plot The story begins with a Bharathanatiyam dancer, Varshini, being invited to the national capital of India on the eve of India being declared a republic. The temple priest who has nurtured since her birth takes her to the Brihadeeshvara Temple to meet a temple dancer named Kama. The story then flashes back to the 1920s. The temple dancer is about to retire from her service as a dancer and has chosen her daughter Madhura as her descendant. The vassal of the Tanjavore Presidency is attracted to Madhura. In addition to being a temple dancer, Madhura has to satisfy the vassal's desires. Madhura is more interested in developing her art of dancing. Meanwhile, Shiva, a lower caste temple servant has awe for Madhura's art. He threatens the vassal for an attempt to murder by a rebellious group called \\"Vande Mataram\\". But things don't go so and Shiva is accused of lying. He is sent into an exile but eventually mixes with the same group \\"Vande Mataram\\". In order to broaden his prospects, the vassal asks Madhura to seduce the collector of Tanjavore through her art. Madhura rejects thus decision and disappears. Now, Kama, Madhura's sister, is chosen as the temple dancer. Learning the barbaric thoughts of the vassal, Kama chooses to elope like Madhura. She finds that Madhura is a part of the rebellious \\"Vande Mataram\\" group. Things become more complicated as the sacred thread from temple goes missing. Madhura is accused of stealing and the vassal orders her arrest. Shiva confesses to the policemen that he is the real accused but secretly tells Madhura where had he kept the sacred thread. Shiva is hanged to death for the charges of robbery. Madhura is pregnant and dies while giving birth to her child. The child is none other than Varshini herself. She is a look alike of Madhura. The story then comes to the present where it is revealed that the vassal has invited Varshini to the national capital. Kama tells Varshini that her mother's last wish was to be cremated with the holy temple fire. The film ends with Varshini, wearing the sacred thread, cremating her mother with the holy temple fire and dancing to pay homage to her mother's artiste.

The History and Present State of Electricity, with original experiments. London: Printed for J. Dodsley, J. Johnson and T. Cadell, 1767. Background Priestley became interested in electricity while he was teaching at Warrington Academy. Friends introduced him to the major British experimenters in the field: John Canton, William Watson, and Benjamin Franklin. These men encouraged Priestley to perform the experiments he was writing about in his history; they believed that he could better describe the experiments if he had performed them himself. In the process of replicating others' experiments, however, Priestley became intrigued by the still unanswered questions regarding electricity and was prompted to design and undertake his own experiments.Schofield, 141‚Äì44; 152; Jackson, 64‚Äì66; Uglow 75‚Äì77; Thorpe, 61‚Äì65. Priestley possessed an electrical machine designed by Edward Nairne. With his brother Timothy he designed and constructed his own machines (see Timothy Priestley#Scientific apparatus).W. D. A. Smith, Under the Influence: A history of nitrous oxide and oxygen anaesthesia, Macmillan (1982), pp. 5‚Äì7. Contents The first half of the 700-page book is a history of the study of electricity. It is parted into ten periods, starting with early experiments \\"prior to those of Mr. Hawkesbee\\", finishing with variable experiments and discoveries made after Franklin's own experiments. The book takes Franklin's work into focus, which was criticised by contemporary scholars, especially in France and Germany.Heilbron, J. L. \\"Franklin, Haller, and Franklinist History.\\" Isis 68, no. 4 (1977): 539-49. https://www.jstor.org/stable/230008. p. 545. The second and more influential half contents a description of contemporary theories about electricity and suggestions for future research. Priestley also wrote about the construction and use of electrical machines, basic electrical experiments and \\"practical maxims for the usw of young elecricians\\". In the second edition, Priestley added some of his own discoveries, such as the conductivity of charcoal.Schofield, 144ff. This discovery overturned what he termed \\"one of the earliest and universally received maxims of electricity,\\" that only water and metals could conduct electricity. Such experiments demonstrate that Priestley was interested in the relationship between chemistry and electricity from the beginning of his scientific career.Gibbs 28‚Äì31; see also Thorpe, 64. In one of his more speculative moments, he \\"provided a mathematical quasi-demonstration of the inverse-square force law for electrical charges. It was the first respectable claim for that law, out of which came the development of a mathematical theory of static electricity.\\"Schofield, 150. The book contains an account of the kite experiment of Benjamin Franklin, that has been taken as authoritative. Some details not found elsewhere are presumed to have been communicated by Franklin. The status of this account matters for the priority dispute over the experiment in which Franklin became involved. The focus on Franklin's experiments influenced the reception of his work in Europe. Priestley's famous text supported the distribution of Franklin's research, which helped it becoming one of the most important works on electricity in the late 18th century.Heilbron, J. L. \\"Franklin, Haller, and Franklinist History.\\" Isis 68, no. 4 (1977): 539-49. https://www.jstor.org/stable/230008. p. 545-546. Influence Priestley's strength as a natural philosopher was qualitative rather than quantitative and his observation of \\"a current of real air\\" between two electrified points would later interest Michael Faraday and James Clerk Maxwell as they investigated electromagnetism. Priestley's text became the standard history of electricity for over a century; Alessandro Volta (who would go on to invent the battery), William Herschel (who discovered infrared radiation), and Henry Cavendish (who discovered hydrogen) all relied upon it. Priestley wrote a popular version of the History of Electricity for the general public titled A Familiar Introduction to the Study of Electricity (1768).Priestley, Joseph.

Though early mass- produced torches were made of aluminum or other metals, the most familiar style of tiki torch consists of a bamboo stick with a container of flammable fluid at the top, and then a lit wick drawing from that container.  History  Tiki culture originated in the 1930s in California, at Polynesian-themed bars and restaurants like Don's Beachcomber in Los Angeles, which featured flaming torches fueled by propane gas as part of its decor. Torches, both gas and electric, became one of the hallmarks of the \\"tiki bars\\" that opened across the country in the following decades, and of the tiki culture that grew out of them. In the 1950s, a company in Wisconsin began producing aluminum torches for consumer use, obtaining a trademark for the \\"Tiki Torch\\" name. Tiki Brand, owned by W. C. Bradley Co. subsidiary Lamplight Farms, continues to produce its namesake torches, though other companies produce similar products that are also colloquially referred to as \\"tiki torches.\\" Popular materials used in manufacturing modern tiki torches include bamboo and metal. While tiki torches are usually intended as temporary fixtures, some are designed for permanent installation and may be connected to gas pipes for fuel. Citronella oil is used in some tiki torches to serve both as fuel for the flame and as insect repellent.  Political use  Tiki torches received media attention after the Unite the Right rally in 2017, when groups associated with the alt-right and white nationalist movements in the United States prominently carried lit bamboo torches as they demonstrated in Charlottesville, Virginia. Tiki Brand owner Lamplight Farms condemned the views of the demonstrators and the use of their products. Tiki-style torches have also been used by fascist groups outside the United States such as by the Grey Wolves political organization in Turkey, in marches commemorating Ottoman Empire military victories.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XABeA-MuMgM  Horticultural use  The name \\"tiki torch\\" has been borrowed as a nickname for at least two flower species: * Canna compacta * Tillandsia 'Tiki Torch' See also * Outdoor lighting * Polynesian culture *Outdoor candle References External links  * Category:Torches Torch ","title":"Tiki torch"},{"id":"13414170","text":"Benjamin Barnard Redding (January 17, 1824 - August 21, 1882) was a Canadian- born politician of California; after joining the gold rush as a young man, he served in the state house, as mayor of Sacramento, Secretary of State for California, and Fish Commissioner. He also worked as a journalist and editor in northern California and Sacramento. As a businessman, he worked as a land agent with the Central Pacific Railroad, which named the town of Redding, California after him. Biography Born in Yarmouth, Nova Scotia in 1824, Redding was educated at Yarmouth Academy. In 1840 at the age of 16, he immigrated to Boston, Massachusetts, where he worked as a clerk. He entered the retail grocery and ship chandlery business in 1843. In the 1840s he married Mary P. from Boston; their children were William Redding (born ca. 1848 in Massachusetts); J. Albert Redding (born ca. 1850 in Massachusetts). The family later joined him in California after his first mining work was finished. His sons George H. Redding (born ca. 1856; and Joseph D. Redding (born 1859 in Sacramento) were both born there. In 1849, Redding organized a company of young men and sailed from Yarmouth for the gold rush in California. They reached San Francisco on May 12, 1850. Redding went to the Yuba River diggings and afterward to the Pittsburg bar, working as a mining laborer. He subsequently was associate editor of the Shasta Journal, was employed in drawing up papers for the sale of claims, and acted as arbitrator. Having established a local reputation, Redding was elected as a member of the California State Assembly, 1853‚Äì1854, from Yuba and Sierra counties. During the session, he wrote for the San Joaquin Republican and Sacramento's Democratic State Journal, of which he was an editor and proprietor. His family joined him from Massachusetts when he could provide a more settled life, and his two younger sons were both born in California. In 1856, Redding was elected mayor of Sacramento. From 1863 to 1867, he served as Secretary of State, appointed by the governor. With a change in administrations, Redding left state government in 1868, becoming a land agent of the Central Pacific Railroad. When the Central Pacific reached Shasta County in the summer of 1872, the railroad company named the town of Redding, California, in his honor. In other public service, Redding was appointed a regent of the University of California to fill the unexpired term of Regent Frank M. Pixley, 1880-1882. He was reappointed in 1882. He was a member of the California Academy of Sciences, and of the Geographical Society of the Pacific. He was interested in all scientific work, especially in the paleontology of the coast. He collected numerous prehistoric and aboriginal relics, which he presented to the museum of the academy. He contributed a large number of papers to various California journals. He was also appointed as California Fish Commissioner, holding this office at the time of his death. Benjamin B. Redding died at age 58 of apoplexy (stroke) in San Francisco. His funeral service took place at the First Congregational Church on August 23, 1882, with a large number of friends and acquaintances present, including a delegation from the offices of the Central Pacific Railroad Company and the Academy of Sciences, besides a number of regents from the State University.

It was located between Blandford Forum and Bailey Gate on the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway. The station consisted of two platforms, a station building, signal box and shelters. The ‚Äòdown‚Äô platform is the station's original platform, which opened with timber booking office and waiting rooms on 1 November 1860. The platform was extended and a separate brick-built ladies‚Äô waiting room was provided in 1888. The concrete floor and fireplace you see today is the foundation of this building. During reconstruction of the station around 1900 when double track was laid, this platform was again extended to a total length of 300 ft. It then became the ‚Äòdown‚Äô platform for trains to Bailey Gate, Broadstone, Poole and Bournemouth (West). You can clearly see the different methods of construction where this platform has been extended. The ‚Äòup‚Äô platform is 300 ft long and was built during reconstruction of the station around 1900. It was used for trains to Blandford, Templecombe, Evercreech Junction (change for the Burnham-on-Sea branch) and Bath (Green Park). This platform opened on 29 April 1901 and was provided with a brick station building containing a booking office, waiting rooms and lavatories. The rear wall of this building still survives as it holds back the field behind the station. The foundations of the various rooms with the three fireplaces can still be seen today. History The station was opened on 1 November 1860 by the London and South Western Railway as part of the Dorset Central Railway, and later became part of the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway. The station was transferred to the Southern Railway at the Grouping of 1923, and became an unstaffed halt in 1934. Becoming part of the Southern Region of British Railways when the railways were nationalised in 1948, the halt was closed in 1956 as part of an economy campaign. Passenger trains continued to pass the site until the S&DJR; closed in 1966. The railway was still open until the closure of the goods terminal at Blandford in 1969 and later that year the track was lifted. Spetisbury Station Project The station site is currently being looked after by the Spetisbury Station Project Group The long-term ambition is to reconstruct the buildings as an information centre for the station and Somerset & Dorset railway.

Dumboluna produced its own events in the Lunatarium, but also collaborated with other promoters. However, to subsidize the high rent, equipment rental, security and other logistical fees, the collective also allowed promoters and event production companies to rent the space for one-off events. The Space The Lunatarium was located in a commercial building which also housed rehearsal studios, design studios and Yak Pak headquarters. During the week, the landlord rented the space to an electronics refurbishing company. During weekday evenings, Dumboluna allowed fire spinners to rehearse in the space for free in exchange for performances during events. To enter, attendees were led through a hallway that sat adjacent to a loading dock, then they were to take a freight elevator and ride it to the top floor (9 stories) of the building. The space itself measured at ., with . high ceilings, and had a raw and industrial aesthetic. The wall facing the East River was covered with windows, which allowed for a view of the Manhattan skyline and the Brooklyn, Manhattan, Williamsburg and Queensboro Bridges. Several months after the Lunatarium first opened its doors, a small side-room was constructed to be used as a secondary performance space. During the Lunatarium's final months on the top floor, the landlord made a unilateral decision to divide the space into smaller rooms to accommodate the electronics refurbishing company. Although the walls eliminated much of the echo that pervaded the formerly cavernous space and also allowed promoters to showcase more acts, attendees complained that the walls destroyed the original spirit and impact of the original space. As the notoriety of the Lunatarium and of the neighborhood increased, so did the rent. At the end of 2003, Dumboluna made an agreement with another landlord in the building and moved the Lunatarium to the bottom floor where it produced one-off events for almost one year. The space included a loft, loading dock (which was used as a live performance stage), and two outdoor areas‚Äîthe building parking lot and the garden space between the building and the river. Despite having an enviable outdoor space and view of Manhattan, the Lunatarium could not escape comparisons to the unique experience and expansiveness of the old space. Decor Due to its high ceilings and noncombustible brick walls and steel rafters, the Lunatarium became known as a fitting exhibition space for projections, large sculptures and pyrotechnics. Several art collectives made use of the space, constructing: inflatable plastic lounges (Anakin Koenig Airways); a giant see-saw and other carnival-style rides (Madagascar Institute); a bed with remote-operated flame throwing bed posts (Seal Arts); and, a life-sized version of Simon‚Äîbut with flame throwers, instead of colored lights (Seal Arts). Video projections and multimedia installations were provided by numerous video artists and VJs, including: Honeygun Labs, Larry Carlson, Mumbleboy, Mojo, Amoeba Technology, Funktaxi 1533, F144 and Squaresquare. Much of the furniture was either found or donated, filling the space with couches, mattresses, hammocks suspended from the steal rafters, and large mounds of fabric, supported by garbage bags stuffed with paper retrieved from the recycling plant located around the corner on Plymouth Street. Occasionally, art collectives left behind specially constructed furniture and decoration pieces (one notable item included a . tall volcano). An artist, known to everyone as \\"Al,\\" constructed the stage‚Äîa modular piece that could be split into two smaller stages, and the two bars‚Äîone of which was constructed out of wrought iron. Using steel pipes, he also helped build the racks of the coat check area. Dumboluna The core members of Dumboluna include founders, Sebastian Holzmeister (President), Mark Winkel (Vice President), and Micha Waschke, in addition to Rhiannon Erbach-Gruber (Musical Director) and Jacky Tran (Promotional Director), both of whom joined shortly after the collective was established. Featuring performance art, video, installations, costume themes, pyrotechnics, local and international music acts, they combined elements of New York's club, music and art party scenes. Dumboluna also aimed to maintain a democratic appeal through making stances against enforcing dress codes (but offered incentives to dress according to selected costume themes) and keeping cover charges and drink prices lower than most other New York City clubs. The members of Dumboluna made little money from the Lunatarium, mainly using any profits from an event to subsidize the venue or to pay off debts from a previous event. However, the members were given priority if they wished to work a paying position during an event‚Äîsuch as bartending, coat check or mailing list circulation. The budgetary constraints not only posed challenges to the financial viability of the space, but also to the execution of production and promotion of events. During the early period of the Lunatarium, the deposits required to secure use of the space often left Dumboluna in a scramble to gather funds at the last minute and allowing little time (in some instances, less than 4 days) to book, organize and promote an event. Legal issues The Lunatarium was shut down on January 11, 2002 by the New York City Social Club Task Force for fire code and other permit violations. Ironically, the charge that the Lunatarium violated New York City's controversial Cabaret Laws were dropped because the event in question was publicized as an ambient music event. Supporting evidence included video footage of attendees socializing, but not dancing, and promotional materials explicitly stating that the event would not showcase any dance music. The Lunatarium reopened on January 26, 2002, when one of Run DMC's last shows took place before the death of Jam Master Jay. Since reopening, the Lunatarium operated intermittently on a one-off basis until 2004. The members of Dumboluna have continued producing events in other locations since the Lunatarium's closure.
