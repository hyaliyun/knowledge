It is up to 5.5 m high. Most of the land is exposed sandstone, after the guano has been exploited in the 20th century. The island has a fringing reef, and the reef flat is narrow.

For many services, people have to go to Victoria, which is a difficult task. Economics The occasional villagers of Marie Louise Island used to poach eggs illegally on the island when the island was a base for the commercial exploitation of seabirds, especially the eggs of the sooty tern (Onychoprion fuscatus). recent years the island was made a reservation, and is visited once a year shortly by IDC members and scientists from Mahe. There are ruins on the island from the time of the poaching. Flora and fauna The terrestrial vegetation on the island is limited because of the high number of seabirds. The island is almost treeless and is covered by grasses and other low-growing plants. It has been identified as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports a breeding population of 430,000 pairs of sooty terns, and a large number of boobies. Green and hawksbill sea turtles also nest there. The island is also known for its rich fish life.

The larvae and pupae of Diamphidia produce a toxin used by San people as an arrow poison. The Finnish explorer Hendrik Jacob Wikar, who travelled in Southern Africa in 1773-1779, described the larvae as \\"poisonous worms\\". Hans Schinz was the first scientist to document the process by which the San people extract and use the poison. The adults and larvae of Diamphidia nigroornata feed on Commiphora angolensis.  Life cycle  Diamphidia nigroornata Adult females of Diamphidia nigroornata lay their eggs on the stems of Commiphora species and coat the eggs with their faeces which harden into a protective covering. As the larval instars develop, the pellets of their own faeces remain attached to their backs and posteriors.Chaboo CS, Grobbelaar E, Larsen A, Fecal Ecology in Leaf Beetles: Novel Records in the African Arrow-Poison Beetles, Diamphidia Gerstaecker and Polyclada Chevrolat (Chrysomelidae: Galerucinae) (2007) The Coleopterists Bulletin: Vol. 61, No. 2 pp. 297‚Äì309 The final instar sheds this faecal coat when entering the soil to pupate. The Diamphidia larvae burrow down for a depth of up to 1 metre in the sand under the food plant, where they may lie dormant for several years before going through a very rapid pupal phase.  Toxin  Diamphotoxin, the poisonous compound in Diamphidia, is highly labile, and has a low molecular weight. It is bound to a protein that protects it from deactivation. It causes an increased permeability of cell membranes, which, while not affecting normal ionic flow between cells, allows easy access to all small ions, thereby fatally disrupting normal cellular ionic levels.TF Jacobsen, O Sand, T Bj√∏ro, HE Karlsen, JG Iversen, Effect of Diamphidia toxin, a Bushman arrow poison, on ionic permeability in nucleated cells, Toxicon (1990) 28: 435-44 Although it has no neurotoxic effect, it produces a lethal haemolytic effect, and may reduce haemoglobin levels by as much as 75%, leading to haemoglobinuria.CY Kao, MJ Salwen, SL Hu, HM Pitter, JM Woollard, Diamphidia toxin, the bushmen's arrow poison: possible mechanism of prey- killing, Toxicon (1989) 27: 1351-66; accessed on ionchannels.org website  Parasite host  Diamphidia is parasitised by a carabid Lebistina beetle, the larva of which attaches itself to a mature Diamphidia larva, clinging to it until the Diamphidia has formed its cocoon, enclosing both host and parasite, and then feeding on its host's soft tissue.

The heaviest raid took place on the night of 14/15 March 1941, affecting the city centre, Beeston, Bramley and Armley. The city was subjected to other raids during the Second World War, but they were relatively minor; only the March 1941 raid caused widespread damage, including to the city's museum and its artefacts. Background Leeds is a large city in the industrial heartland of the West Riding of Yorkshire. The county's largest city, much of the region's economic, administrative and industrial activities were centred on Leeds which was also an important rail hub. Many industrial manufacturers around the city such as Avro at RAF Yeadon (now Leeds Bradford Airport) which produced Lancaster bombers, Kirkstall Forge, Barnbow munitions works and ROF Thorp Arch near Wetherby adapted their output for war work providing likely raid targets. Leeds had taken precautions, including building many public air raid shelters and large water tanks to be used for fire-fighting in the event of incendiary devices being dropped. 14‚Äì15 March raid Spotter and predictor operators at a 4.5-inch anti-aircraft gun site in Leeds, 20 March 1941 Beginning just after 9 pm on Friday 14 March 1941, around 40 bombers took part in the raid on Leeds; in all 451 were over Britain that night. Incendiary bombs were first dropped onto the city on the Friday night, later high explosive bombs were dropped on the Saturday. Targets hit in the city centre included the Town Hall, the city's museum (then on Park Row), Leeds New station (now Leeds City station), the Kirkgate Markets, the Central Post Office, the Quarry Hill flats, the Hotel Metropole and the area now occupied by the Inner Ring Road. Around 100 houses were destroyed, 4,600 sustained damage, and around 65 people were killed. Other nearby towns were also damaged in this raid. Huddersfield was damaged by bombers seeking the David Brown factory at Crosland Moor (at the time making parts for the Supermarine Spitfire), while central Castleford was also damaged by bombers seeking the Hickson and Welch chemical works and Ferrybridge power station. In total 25 tons of bombs fell on Leeds during the raid, a quarter of the 100 tons often used as the threshold for a \\"major raid\\". By comparison, that night in Glasgow 203 aircraft dropped 231 tons of high explosives, nearly ten times the amount dropped on Leeds, and 1,650 incendiary canisters, while in nearby Sheffield 117 aircraft dropped 83 tons of high explosives and 328 incendiary canisters. Owing to the censorship and secrecy during the war, the press did not mention Leeds by name after the raid, instead referring to it as a \\"North East Inland Town\\"; the frequent raids on Hull were often referred to as a raid on a \\"North East Coastal Town\\". German sources from the time claim raids on Glasgow, Leeds, Sheffield, Tilbury Docks, Plymouth and Southampton. The site of the former museum Cultural losses The bombing of the Leeds City Museum resulted in the losses of historic civic possessions including the destruction of a mummy and a tiger. Curator Herbert Ricketts described salvaging artefacts after the bombing as having \\"a dig in our own museum\\".https://maps.google.co.uk/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&oe;=UTF8&msa;=0&msid;=213440443617908386220.00049ae601cd196324bf6 Report on bomb damage (image two) The museum's front, dating from 1821, was also damaged and had to be taken down. A concrete front was built replace the destroyed Victorian facade. The museum closed in 1965 and was moved to the central library on the Headrow. The museum was demolished in 1966 and the site is now occupied by the HSBC bank. In 1999, the museum was moved from the library, and is now housed in the former Mechanics Institute on Millennium Square. Other historic buildings were superficially damaged. At certain sites, such as the town hall, shrapnel damage is still evident. Fighter and ground defence 31st (North Midland) Anti-Aircraft Brigade was responsible for anti- aircraft defence of West Yorkshire,10 AA Division at Royal Artillery 1939‚Äì45 and throughout the war years Leeds had anti-aircraft guns positioned throughout the city. There were many RAF airfields to the east of the city in the Vale of York, while most were home to bomber command units, RAF Church Fenton was the base of a fighter squadron. On the night of the main Leeds raid Junkers Ju 88 and Dornier Do 17 aircraft were shot down over Northern England, indicating these could have been the bombers used over Leeds. Unexploded bombs Following the raids, unexploded bombs have been found in the city including one in Potternewton Park in 2012. Unexploded anti-aircraft shells have also been found to the south and east of the city. Starting in September 1940, all unexploded bombs were to be logged in a detailed 'bomb diary', although the scheme was not at first initiated in Leeds. Tempest Road, where Harrison was sheltering during the raid Cultural influences The Tony Harrison poem \\"Shrapnel\\" relates to the raid on Beeston and the possibility of an act of heroism on the part of the bomber crews given the number of bombs falling on Cross Flats Park in Beeston as well as comparing the bombing to the bombings of 7 July in London, of which two of the perpetrators came from Leeds. Harrison, at the time a child, was sheltering in the cellar of a house on Tempest Road in Beeston.

The hermitage is notable for the intricately detailed cornerstones in black basalt coated in plaster, and painted in white. The stonework is primarily in the main facade and practically all of the area around the temple.  History  The Baroque era facade of the Chapel of M√£e de Deus at the turn of the century The walls of the old Fort of M√£e de Deus, on which the hermitage is built The primitive hermitage of the Alto da M√£e de Deus was erected under the initiative of Diogo Afonso da Costa Columbreiro, who resided near the site in the 16th century. The chapel was then built on the land of the former Fort of M√£e de Deus, which had been deactivated. During the First World War, the original temple was demolished in 1915, under the supposition that the site would be used as a landmark for attaching German U-Boats. The azulejo tile from the site was collected from the demolished site and housed in the Museum of Ponta Delgada. Sometime after the conflict (in 1925), many of the devout residents voted to reconstruct the chapel. Therefore, on 25 March 1925, the cornerstone was placed on the site of the old chapel, following a grande procession that left the church of S√£o Pedro and open-air mass celebrated by Father Herculano Augusto de Medeiros. In the interior, part of the cornerstone was enclosed in a glass box with a proclamation in Latin, then spoken by Father Ledo de Bettencourt at the ceremony. After the reading Father Jos√© Jacinto Botelho, from Furnas, read a speech that impressed the gathered crowd. The project followed the plans of architect Norberto Correia, in the Neo-Baroque style. Delays occurred during the Second World War, and in 1942, the hilltop of M√£e de Deus was occupied by a garrison of Portuguese troops, to watch the port of Ponta Delgada. The temple was finally concluded at the beginning of 1947, and delivered into the possession of the ecclesiastical authorities on 25 March, when the temple was consecrated by Father Jos√© Gomes, Ouvidor Eclesi√°stico. Architecture The decorative front facade of the church, with many of the elements that distinguish it Located in an isolated urban context, implanted on an elevated hilltop over the historic Fort of M√£e de Deus, with plastered walls, relatively close to the University of the Azores. The church's frontal access is marked by a basalt staircase of two flights, flanked by rectangular plinths, plastered and painted in white, caped by faceted pilars and two orders of plinths. The courtyard is covered in sod, and dotted by trees. A 19th century chapel, in the late Neo-Baroque style, identifiable by the proliferation of decorative elements. The structure alternately shows variations in the use of the carved lobes, concave cornices, the large number of pendants, false aprons and backs. The curved frieze that surrounds the large window and divides the body refers is an element of the Estado Novo era, with an inscription alluding to the patron. The hermitage consists of a polygonal plan with nave and left-hand bell-tower, with articulated volumes and differentiated spaces with tiled roofs. The facades are plastered and painted in white, with stonework running throughout, flanked by pilastered wedges, and rectangular plinths, topped with friezes and cornices. The main facade (which is oriented to the west) is decorated with a gable, cut and ornamented in spiral decoration, surmounted by cornices and Latin cross over double plinths. The main portal in a polylobial arch, includes several frames, flanked by two orders of pilasters and two columns built into the wall, surmounted by friezes over rectangular plinths. These plinths include inferior plinths supporting fragments of the portico and superior plinths with angular cornices, that extend until the corners, and pinnacles similar to balustrades. Between the portal and corners, are small backrests with the Portuguese shield. Over the cornices are quadrangular oculi, with circular frames of spiral and shell motifs with frieses, containing interlaced motifs and inscription, surmounted by volumous cartazes and shell with the monogram \\"AM\\" (MATER DEI, Latin for Mother of God).

The site of the church has probably been considered sacred since before the Christianization of Scandinavia. The oldest parts of the current stone church date from the first half of the 13th century when an earlier wooden church was replaced. The building was substantially altered during the 14th century with the construction of a new nave. Most likely, the intent was to rebuild the entire edifice, but this did not occur for unknown reasons. A group of large Gothic sculptures, currently immured next to the south portal of the church, was possibly intended for a new tower that was never built. These sculptures are among the most unusual Gothic works of art in Sweden. In the 19th century, when the chancel and the apse of the church had to be replaced due to structural damage, the congregation chose to rebuild them as similar as possible to the medieval building. The church belongs to the Church of Sweden and lies in the Diocese of Visby. Location and surroundings St√•nga Church lies in the middle of the old cemetery, which is surrounded by a wall. Two medieval lychgates probably served as entrances from the south and east until the 1860s when they appear to have been demolished. In 1924 an additional, larger cemetery was inaugurated north of the old cemetery. Several archaeological findings in the vicinity of the church, notably clothing objects from the 11th and early 12th centuries such as buckles, buttons and jewellery chains, indicate that the location was already being used as a burial ground prior to the construction of the church. Probably it was a pagan sacred site before the Christianization of Scandinavia. History Archaeological excavations show that a wooden church was built on the site toward the beginning of the 12th century, possibly even earlier. The wooden church was replaced with a stone church, Romanesque in style, during the first half of the 13th century. This first stone church consisted of a nave and a chancel with an apse. In the middle of the same century, construction started on the present tower which probably replaced an earlier, smaller tower. In the middle of the 14th century, the nave was demolished to make way for a new and larger Gothic nave. It was constructed by a workshop, known by its notname as , that worked on several churches on Gotland. At the same time that the nave was enlarged, the tower was also heightened. This reconstruction scheme appears to have been interrupted for some unknown reason. Several details indicate that ad hoc-solutions, not originally intended, were implemented to finish the work. Most obvious of these is the set of monumental Gothic limestone sculptures immured next to the nave portal in the south wall. These were clearly not intended for their current position. There are also gargoyles, now damaged, immured on each side of the chancel portal. Almost identical gargoyles exist in the churches of Dalhem, Gothem and √ñja, where they are placed in the tower. Probably the gargoyles were intended for the tower also in St√•nga. Furthermore, the entire nave appears to have been wedged in between the chancel and the tower, implying that a much larger nave was originally planned. It has consequently been suggested that the plans for the rebuilding of the church were originally much more ambitious and that the idea was to replace not only the Romanesque nave but also the chancel and possibly the tower. This would have amounted to the building of an entirely new, much larger Gothic church. The monumental sculptures which now are immured next to the main portal may have been intended for some other part of the projected church. But since the work had to be cancelled, they were simply placed where they could fit in. They may also have been intended for a completely different church, perhaps K√§llunge Church, on Gotland. Between 1864 and 1865, the choir and apse were also rebuilt, since they were at risk of collapsing due to structural damage. The congregation chose to rebuild them as closely as possible to their original form, while the old sacristy, north of the chancel, was built to new designs. Therefore only fragments of the Romanesque church remain visible. Apart from the extensive repairs carried out in the 1860s, the church has been renovated and repaired on several occasions. A major renovation was undertaken in 1929‚Äì30, led by the architect . In connection with this, archaeological research was conducted on the church. Another large renovation was undertaken 1962‚Äì63, this time led by the architect , in order to repair and renew the church. Among other things, the entire exterior was whitewashed anew. Architecture =Exterior= The main portal and adjacent sculptures The main construction material of St√•nga Church is grey limestone with more finely hewn limestone of differing shades as well as sandstone used in some details. Apart from the sculpted elements, the corners and the base of the church, the whole facade is whitewashed. The nave, like many Gotlandic churches, lacks windows facing north. The three windows of the apse and the one in the chancel are round-arched, while the nave has a single, Gothic pointed-arch window, with tracery, that is divided in two by a central limestone post. The tower likewise has a single Gothic window facing south, dating from the re-building during the 14th century. Medieval stained glass almost certainly decorated all the windows of the church originally, but no traces of it survive today. The five-storey tower is one of the tallest on Gotland, comparable only to the towers of Dalhem, Rone and √ñja churches. The church bells hang in the fourth storey. The first storey has two narrow openings, one of which may have been intended as an arrowslit. This would mean that the tower could have served as a refuge for the congregation in times of danger. The second storey has a larger, round-arched opening to the west, which was probably used together with a mechanical winch to bring items into the room behind it. Such an arrangement is known from Etelhem Church. The storage room in the tower may have been used as a tithe barn. Beginning with the fourth storey, there are bell openings. There are two of these on each side of the tower on the fourth floor and similarly on the fifth floor. Finally, above each of these, there is a single opening, one in each direction. Gothic in style, several of them have been repaired and have had their original tracery replaced. The tower is crowned by an octagonal wooden spire. It has also been repaired and renewed occasionally. The door in the main portal of the church is from the 19th century, but it contains decorative ironwork from an earlier, 14th-century door. There is also an iron rod attached to the door. This is a medieval measuring instrument with an inscription declaring that it is the correct length of one ell. Apart from the main portal, the church has an entrance in the west wall of the tower and one in the south wall of the chancel. The chancel portal, a copy of an earlier portal on the same location, dates from 1864. The tower portal is similar to the chancel portal, but larger. It is made of alternating reddish and grey limestone. It was repaired in the 1890s. Main portal capitals of the main portal The main pointed-arch portal of the church is made of grey limestone. The capitals of the pillars, the outermost posts of the portal, the tympanum and the wimperg are all decorated with sculptures. The tympanum contains a depiction of the Coronation of the Virgin, accompanied by the apostles John, Peter and Paul as well as John the Baptist. The eastern band of capitals, partially damaged, depicts scenes from the life of Mary while the western depict scenes from the childhood of Christ. The rectangular sides of the outer posts of the portal, facing south, are decorated with sculptures of four standing figures, probably saints. They are framed by aediculae. The wimperg, flanked by two pinnacles, contains a sculpture of the Resurrection of Jesus. The decoration of the portal and the adjacent sculptures date from the same time, around 1345‚Äì1360, and were probably made by the same workshop, but by different individual sculptors. Monumental sculptures Just east of the main portal several monumental limestone sculptures are immured in the church facade. Together with the decorated portal they constitute \\"one of the most remarkable ecclesiastical monuments on Gotland\\". The Swedish National Heritage Board describes them as \\"one of the most unusual works of art from the Middle Ages in [Sweden]\\". In their size and monumentality, the sculptures are unlike any other Gothic sculptures from the Nordic countries. These sculptures appear to be an incomplete set meant to display the history of the childhood and Passion of Christ. Additional sculptures were most probably planned but never executed. As noted above, the placement of the sculptures is equally not as originally intended. Apart from the awkward placement, it has been shown that they are anchored quite shallowly in the wall, further indicating that their placement is secondary. From bottom to top, the sculptures depict the Adoration of the Magi next to a sculpture of Mary and the infant Christ. Above this is a scene showing the Flagellation of Christ. The subject of the top sculpture is the Descent from the Cross. =Interior= The interior, viewed towards the chancel, with the rood cross hanging in the chancel arch The nave is divided into four bays, its vaults supported by a single pillar that is placed in the middle of the church. A wide chancel arch divides it from the chancel and the apse. Fragmentary remains of murals exist in the apse and in the ground floor of the tower. Among the furnishings, the baptismal font is the oldest, dating from the late 12th century. It is a richly decorated font made by the Romanesque sculptor known as Hegvald. Considered one of the best preserved fonts attributed to the sculptor, it is stylistically close to the baptismal fonts, also by Hegvald, in N√§r and V√§nge churches. The reliefs on the sides of the basin depict scenes from the New Testament, but also beasts and human figures. The Romanesque rood cross is made of oak which has been painted and gilded. Dating to around 1250, it is relatively complete and well-preserved with respect to other rood crosses, and it is still supported by its original pedestal, which is unusual. It depicts Christ on a ringed cross, the ends of which have the symbols of the Four Evangelists. A 15th-century wooden crucifix has been incorporated into the Baroque altarpiece which was made in the late 17th century in Burgsvik on Gotland. The wooden pulpit bears the date 1723 and the monogram of Frederick I of Sweden. The pews are probably from 1693. Current use and heritage status St√•nga Church belongs to within , itself a part of the Diocese of Visby within the Church of Sweden. St√•nga Church is an ecclesiastical monument, number 21300000002847 (sub-number: 21400000444078) in the buildings database of the Swedish National Heritage Board.

He was the deputy editor of the independent news outlet Novoye Delo (translated \\"New Business\\"). On 9 July 2013 at 7 a.m. Akhmednabiyev was shot outside his house in the Semender suburb of Makhachkala, Dagestan, Russia after his name was added to a hit list for being critical of local law enforcement, speaking out on human rights and abuse, and defending Muslims.  Personal  Before becoming a journalist, Akhmednabi Akhmednabiyev spent his time in the medical field. After being trained as a doctor, Akhmednabiyev qualified as a cardiologist. He practiced medicine in Karata, his native village, before moving to Dagestan. Throughout his journalistic career, Akhmednabiyev received numerous death threats. In May 2012, he received a threatening text message after covering a rally in Makhachkala about the murder of five people in Kizlyar two months earlier. Akhmednabiyev made the text publicly known and requested the head of the Russian Federal Security Service to investigate and find the senders.  Career  Akhmednabiyev served as the Deputy Editor of \\"Novoye Delo,\\" one of Russia's top local newspapers, for ten years. The publication is a weekly circulation that is critical of authorities and reports on alleged corruption within the government. Founded in the 1990s, \\"Novoye Delo\\" is highly respected by Dagestanis because of its political attitude and its criticism of authorities. Akhmednabiyev mostly covered stories regarding violations of human rights, and paid particular interest to cases of alleged torture and abduction by the police. Additionally, he wrote about local Dagestan politics. According to Akhmednabiyev's colleagues, his most recent stories focused on the leader of his native Akhvakhsky district, whom he wrote about with harsh criticism.  Death  Akhmednabi Akhmednabiyev died at the age of 54 from multiple gunshot wounds outside of his home in Semender. At 7:30 on the morning of July 9, 2013, a vehicle sped past and fired shots into Akhmednabiyev's car after he had gotten into it. The vehicle sped off and Akhmednabiyev died immediately. Akhmednabiyev survived a previous attempt on his life after assailants fired guns at him as they drove past his home on January 11, 2013. As opposed to classifying the incident as an assassination attempt, local prosecutor's classified it as a property damage case. After Akhmednabiyev's death, the case was reevaluated and added to the ongoing murder investigation after it was agreed both incidents were connected to his journalism career.  Context  In 2009, Akhmednabiyev's name was added to a hit list that was circulated around Makhachkala. The list included the names of eight other journalists, one of which was also shot to death in Dagestan in 2011. Those who wrote the list demanded revenge for the deaths of Russian police officers. Although authorities have never uncovered the authors of the list, rumors spread that the list was written by relatives of Dagestani police officers killed by members of extremist religious groups. According to one of Akhmednabiyev's colleagues at his publication, Akhmednabiyev's name was on the list because he was critical of law enforcement officials in his articles and the people who made the list assumed he was part of a religious group because he often defended Dagestan's Muslim population. Akhmednabiyev was the 17th journalist to be murdered in Dagestan since 1993.  Impact  Akhmednabiyev's death is one of the latest examples of the dangers Russian journalists face when speaking out on human rights. As a result, journalists will now have to self- censor their work more closely. Numerous murders of Russian journalists remain unsolved and according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), it has a negative effect on the media community. Publications, like Akhmednabiyev's \\"Novoye Delo,\\" are being threatened by Russian law enforcement with lawsuits and there have been numerous attempts to close them down. Dagestan has become known as the most dangerous place in Russia for a journalist to work, while Russia stands as the ninth most dangerous country for journalists with a reported 340 journalists killed since 1990 and only 20 percent of those cases investigated.  Reactions  On the day of Akhmednabiyev's death, more than 170 Russian journalists processed his body through the streets of Makhachkala. Each journalist wore a sign that read, \\"Who will be next?\\" in response to Russia's need to create protection for threatened journalists and to classify the crimes against them correctly. Dunja Mijatoviƒá, who acts as Representative on Freedom of the Media for the OSCE, condemned the murder of Akhmednabi Akhmednabiyev on July 9, 2013. She stated his death is a reminder Russia needs to do more to ensure and guarantee the safety of journalists. Ambassador Ian Kelly currently serves as the United States Representative to the OSCE. On July 11, 2013, Ambassador Kelly addressed the Permanent Council, one of the main regular decision-making bodies of the OSCE, at its weekly meeting in Vienna. In his statement, Ambassador Kelly noted that the United States strongly condemns the assassination of Akhmednabi Akhmednabiyev. He also made note that the United States remains deeply concerned with the attacks in the Russian Federation made against journalists. Both Mijatoviƒá and Kelly echoed praise for a statement made by the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation, who said an investigation of Akhmednabiyev's murder would be handled with the highest priority.

This principle is expressed in the following simple formula that is repeated hundreds of times in the Buddhist discourses: IdappaccayatƒÅ (specific conditionality), as expressed in the above formula, is identified as a key expression of the doctrine of pratƒ´tyasamutpƒÅda (dependent origination). Expression of pratƒ´tyasamutpƒÅda IdappaccayatƒÅ (this/that conditionality), as expressed in the this/that formula, is identified as a key expression of the doctrine of pratƒ´tyasamutpƒÅda (interdependent origination).

It used to actively serve the private planes of mining companies present in the area. The airport serves occasional chartered planes en route to the commercial and private resorts in the area. History Formerly owned by the Maricalum Mining Corporation, which shut down its copper mining operations in 1996, the airstrip was awarded to the City Government of Sipalay by a decision of the Regional Trial Court in Kabankalan, in the seat of Judge Henry Arles. In 2005, the City Council of Sipalay passed City Ordinance 2005-009 that laid down the expropriation of the property as an airport. The most notable guest to land in the airport was the private plane carrying then presidential candidate Gilbert Teodoro, while campaigning in 2010. Former hangar of Sipalay Airport Current use Most air traffic to the airport is controlled from Bacolod-Silay International Airport and usually hosts short flights from Bacolod or Dumaguete-Sibulan Airport. A resort diving facility uses the airport to service VIP guests from Bacolod or Dumaguete to Sipalay, and onward flights to Cagayancillo Airport in Palawan, using a 6-seater chartered Cessna.

Henryk Reichman, nom de guerre Henryk Ruminowski (June 14, 1914 ‚Äì May 7, 2004) was one of about 70 Jewish prisoners who survived the Holocaust after participating in the August 2, 1943 revolt at the Treblinka extermination camp in Poland. He reached Warsaw, where he participated in the resistance in the city, before it was liberated by the Soviet Union. After the war, in which he lost all his family but one brother, Rajchman married. The couple and his brother soon emigrated from Poland, first to France and then to Montevideo, Uruguay, where they later became citizens. There he was active in the Jewish community and helped establish the Museum of the Holocaust and the Holocaust Memorial, both in Montevideo. In 1980, Rajchman was contacted by the United States Justice Department through the consulate. He was among several survivors who testified against John Demjanjuk, by then a naturalized US citizen, who was suspected of having been a notorious Trawniki, or guard at Treblinka known as \\"Ivan the Terrible\\". His testimony contributed to Demjanjuk being prosecuted and convicted in Israel, but this was overturned on appeal. New records from Soviet archives raised questions about his identify. (Demjanjuk was later convicted of charges in Germany related to his documented service at the death camp Sobibor.) While living in Warsaw, Rajchman wrote a memoir in Yiddish about his time at Treblinka. It was published in Spanish in Uruguay in 1997 as Un grito por la vida: memorias (\\"A cry for life: memories\\"). In 2002 he was featured in a Uruguayan documentary, Despite Treblinka, interviewed as one of three survivors of the Treblinka revolt. In addition to other editions in Spanish, his memoir was published posthumously in 2009 in both France and Germany. An English translation was published in 2011 with a preface by noted writer and activist Elie Wiesel. Life Rajchman was born on June 14, 1914 in ≈Å√≥d≈∫. His mother died when he was young, and he was one of six children (four boys and two girls) raised by his widowed father. They struggled to make enough money to live. As tensions increased in Europe, he said good-bye to his brother Moniek in 1939, encouraging him to flee to the Soviet Union. After the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany that year, Rajchman and younger sister Anna joined the family in Pruszk√≥w, a small town in central Poland. The Jewish ghetto was created there in October 1940, and liquidated in February 1941. All Pruszk√≥w Jews were deported to the Warsaw Ghetto. With the work-permit issued by the Judenrat on German orders, Rajchman was sent to live and work in Ostr√≥w Lubelski, in eastern Poland. He was rounded up on October 10, 1942, along with other ghetto inmates, loaded onto a Holocaust train, and sent to Treblinka extermination camp. Upon his arrival there the following day, Rajchman was separated from his sister Anna (she died at the camp), and put to work with the Jewish Sonderkommando. He was ordered to cut the hair of disrobed women before they were gassed. Later he extracted gold teeth from dead victims at the Totenlager and disposed of thousands of their bodies, mostly by burning.

On August 2, 1943, Rajchman was among 700 Sonderkommandos who revolted against the guards. He was with some one hundred prisoners who escaped during this attack. The death camp was closed in October 1943. Rajchman had reached Warsaw, where he joined the resistance. He was among the 70 men from the revolt to survive through the end of the war. During his time in Warsaw, he joined the Polish Socialist Party and the underground resistance. On January 17, 1945 he was liberated by the advancing Soviets. Fourteen days later, he returned to his hometown of ≈Å√≥d≈∫, where most Jews had already been exterminated. His father and all siblings but Moniek had died in the war. He and Moniek happened to meet again in Poland, near where they had said good-bye. Rajchman married Lila in Warsaw in 1946. Together with Moniek, the three soon emigrated to France, and relatively soon to Uruguay, where they settled in Montevideo in their early 30s. Rajchman and his wife had three children together. They became active in the Jewish community of Montevideo, which included other European refugees. Rajchman was among the activists who helped gain founding of the Museum of the Holocaust and the Holocaust Memorial, both in Montevideo. In 1980, Rajchman (then age 66) was contacted in Uruguay by the American embassy. On March 12, 1980 he was interviewed by the Office of Special Investigations of the US Department of Justice about the Trawniki men, Treblinka guards drawn from Soviet prisoners of war. He went to the United States to testify against John Demjanjuk, who had been in the US for years and was a naturalized citizen. Demjanjuk was later extradited to Jerusalem and convicted by Israel in a war trial in . Rajchman was among witnesses who identified Demjanjuk as the Trawniki guard known as \\"Ivan the Terrible\\". He had failed to identify him from a wartime photograph, but identified Demjanjuk at trial. Rajchman's testimony contributed to Demjanjuk's conviction, although he was later released on appeal because new evidence about his identity was found in newly declassified Soviet archives made available to researchers. He was stripped of U.S. citizenship. and later extradited to Germany. There he was charged with other crimes related to his documented service at the death camp Sobibor. Lila Rajchman died in an accident in 1991. Rajchman died in 2004 in Montevideo, Uruguay, survived by their three children and eleven grandchildren.

It was first published in Spanish in Montevideo, as Un grito por la vida: memorias (\\"A cry for life: memories\\", 1997) by Ediciones de la Banda Oriental. (Additional Spanish editions were published in 2005 and 2009.) After Rajchman's death in 2004, three translated editions were also published posthumously. The memoir was published in French in 2009 by Les Ar√®nes under the title Je suis le dernier Juif (I am the last Jew). It was published in German the same year as Ich bin der letzte Jude. Treblinka 1942/43. It was published in English in 2011, as The Last Jew of Treblinka: A Memoir, with a preface by noted writer and activist Elie Wiesel. ;Documentary Chil (Enrique) Rajchman was featured late in life in the Uruguayan documentary film Despite Treblinka (2002), along with fellow survivors of the revolt, Kalman Taigman and Samuel (Schmuel) Willenberg, then living in Jerusalem. The film premiered at the 24th International Film Festival of New Latin American Cinema in Havana, Cuba.

It also reformed the law relating to the legal status of women in customary marriages, the financial consequences of a customary marriage and the dissolution of customary marriages, replacing the customary law with statutory provisions. The act was signed by President Nelson Mandela on 20 November 1998 but only came into force on 15 November 2000. Provisions All customary marriages which were valid under customary law when the act came into force, whether monogamous or polygamous, are recognised as marriages for all legal purposes. Marriages contracted after the act came into force are only recognised if they comply with the requirements imposed by the act. These requirements are that the spouses are 18 or older, that they both consent to the marriage, and that neither of them are already married under the Marriage Act or the Civil Union Act. The age requirement may be waived by the special written permission of the Minister of Home Affairs or her delegate. The spouses are obliged to register the marriage with the Department of Home Affairs within three months; for marriages which existed before the act came into force, there was a one-year period for registration. Both of these periods were repeatedly extended up to the end of 2010. However, a customary marriage is valid even if it is not registered, and there is no penalty for failure to register. The act declares that a wife in a customary marriage has equal legal status and capacity as her husband, including the ability to buy, own and sell property and the ability to enter into contracts. Previously, under customary law a wife had been regarded as perpetually a minor under the control of her husband (see also marital power). All monogamous marriages contracted after the act came into force are in community of property, meaning that all assets and liabilities belong to both spouses equally, unless an antenuptial contract is drawn up. If a man wants to contract a second simultaneous marriage he must apply to a court to approve a contract regulating the financial relationships between him, his current wife or wives and the new wife. The act states that the financial status of marriages that existed before the act came into force continues to be regulated by customary law; however in the case of Gumede (born Shange) v President of the Republic of South Africa and Others the Constitutional Court found this unconstitutional and determined that such marriages, if monogamous, are to be treated as marriages in community of property. The act applies the civil divorce law (the Divorce Act, 1979) to customary marriages, meaning that a customary marriage can only be dissolved by the High Court or a regional civil magistrate's court and only on the grounds of irretrievable breakdown of the marriage. The power of traditional leaders and other customary institutions to grant divorces is ended, but they may still mediate in spousal disputes before the legal divorce.

A nineteenth century Spanish cartoon satirizing political corruption Corruption in Spain describes the prevention and occurrence of corruption in Spain. In the early 21st century there are many political corruption legal processes in the post Franco young and independent judiciary, despite its senior judges being appointees of parliamentary committees. Transparency International rated Spain between 2001 and 2012. The average value for Spain during that period was 66.67 points with a maximum of 70 points in 2001 and minimum of 61 points in 2009 and (100 being no corruption). In 2011 it was rated 30th least corrupt country in the worldCorruption in Spain - still a problem. Recently the perception worsened, as of the Transparency International's 2017 Corruption Perception Index, the country ranks in the 42nd place out of 180 countries. Which ranks Spain with a similar corruption index as Cyprus or the Czech Republic. According to Politico, 1378 officials were prosecuted for corruption between July 2015 and September 2016. Political corruption is a large concern in Spain. Political corruption is defined as the action or inaction of one or more real persons managing public resources for their own or a third party's benefit to the detriment of all the citizens they should serve and benefit. Transparency International Global Corruption Barometer 2013 shows that the surveyed households consider political parties, Parliament and the judiciary the most corrupt institutions. In fact, the Spanish population considers corruption their second biggest problem, only eclipsed by unemployment. However, the occurrence of petty corruption is rare in Spain, according to the GCR report of 2015. Bribery is not widespread in business dealings in Spain, yet companies cite corruption as a business impediment. As suggested in Business Anti-Corruption Portal, anti-corruption strategies should be significantly strengthened at all levels of the government. One example could be to strengthen investigative and prosecution efforts and enforcing existing laws. Corruption in the tax administration is not an obstacle to business (GCR 2015-2016). Paying taxes has been made less costly by reducing the rates for corporate income, capital gain and environment taxes, and the time required to pay taxes is lower than the OECD countries‚Äô average (DB 2016). Spanish tax regulations represent a moderate challenge for foreign companies. Among Spain‚Äôs police forces, corruption is not widespread and there are only small isolated cases involving police corruption. The police services are considered reliable in protecting companies from crime (GCR 2015-2016), and the necessary mechanisms are in place to investigate and punish abuse and corruption in the police services. There are isolated reports of police corruption, but these are typically resolved effectively by the authorities (HRR 2014). Reign of Philip III of Spain The period 1598 to 1617 in which Francisco G√≥mez de Sandoval, 1st Duke of Lerma held the government on behalf of Philip III was one of the most notoriously corrupt of Spanish regimes. It was infamous because of the self-enrichment activities of his crony bureaucrat, Pedro Franqueza, his secretary, Rodrigo Calder√≥n, Count of Oliva and the Duke of Lerma himself. 19th century The Queen Regent Maria Christina of the Two Sicilies became famous for her involvement in shady deals that divided the people from the elite. Speculation in the production of salt, construction of railways and even the illegal slave trade, which also involved Ram√≥n Mar√≠a Narv√°ez, 1st Duke of Valencia. It was said that there was no industrial project in which the Queen Mother had no interest. Her fortune was estimated at 300 million Spanish reals. Francoist Spain The Nationalist military insurgents won the Spanish Civil War against the democratic Republican government. Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, Britain and the United States supported the rebel army and Francoist government in various ways and at various times, but never supported the Second Spanish Republic. During the war, agricultural and industrial production collapsed and the black market - called Straperlo in memory of the homonymous famous scandal \\\\- acquired great importance. Economic corruption, classism and nepotism were a basic feature of the Francoist Spain and was widespread. Political involvement in it up to the highest levels was absolute: in some cases due to the direct participation of high-ranking officials; in others, due to the protection that the strategists received from power. This took place in an atmosphere of total impunity. The repercussions of corruption were socially very serious: for the corrupt and their clientele it meant a rapid enrichment, while for most of the population it implied privations of all kinds: famine, ignorance, hunger, ruin and misery. Some of the majors cases were: * Lost children of Francoism * Barcelona Traction case * Case Matesa (in Spanish) * Reace case (in Spanish) * Sofico Scandal (in Spanish) The accession of Juan Carlos I (mentored by Franco from his childhood to perpetuate his legacy) to the Spanish throne saw the advent of a democratic state built on the foundations of the Spanish Constitution of 1978 operated by largely the same institutions that had formerly served Francoist Spain. After some three decades the younger 'democracy generation' of jurists began to investigate issues (in violation of the Pact of forgetting) that had been 'overlooked' by the early reformers in pursuit of creating a peaceful and lasting state which would adopt fully European values at some later time.  Corruption cases in the post-Francoist era  = GAL = In 1987 a judge in his early thirties, Baltasar Garz√≥n led an investigation which led to the conviction of a former (Socialist) Interior minister, who had adopted a clandestine policy of State terrorism via operations of the Grupos Antiterroristas de Liberaci√≥n (GAL), - a collection of criminal gangs who (formerly on the covert behalf of the Falange) were still fighting Franco's dirty war against the Basque separatist ETA movement. The case was vigorously defended and appealed, to the Constitutional Court of Spain where sentence confirmed by four votes to three, and later endorsed by the European Court of Human Rights = Rumasa and Nueva Rumasa = Rumasa (Ruiz Mateos SA) was founded in 1961 by the family of Jos√© Mar√≠a Ruiz Mateos. It originally exported wine to England. In 1983 it had become very large (allegedly because it was linked to Opus Dei) and so debt-ridden that it was nationalized by the socialist PSOE government of Felipe Gonz√°lez \\"in the public interest\\". At the time it consisted of more than 700 companies, with a staff that reached 60,000 people, with an annual turnover of about 350,000 million pesetas (more than 2,000 million euros). Eventually parts of the empire were re-privatized. The group, was originally rooted primarily in the wine sector, and diversified into banking. Its gradual but massive growth occurred through the acquisition of companies with financial problems so that it became a group of companies that (supposedly) supported each other. RUMASA was present in the following sectors: * Wine production: Bodegas (Wineries) including , , Bodegas Franco-Espa√±olas, Ren√© Barbier, Segura Viudas, Conde de Caral * Banking: including the banks , Jerez, , Exbank, AVA, Eurobank, Banfisa * Hospitality: The hotel chain \\"Hotasa\\" * Retail: 22 Department Stores \\"Galer√≠as Preciados\\" (since integrated into El Corte Ingl√©s) and Spanish luxury goods \\"Loewe\\". (now part of the Louis Vuitton, Mo√´t Hennessy LVMH group) Following the nationalization of his empire Ruiz-Mateos fled to London and started a series of legal cases to recover some of his seized assets. In 1985 he was arrested at Frankfurt airport and extradited to Spain. The Francoist-leaning Alianza Popular political party (now integrated into the Popular Party) failed to persuade the constitutional court to reverse the sequestration. The High court eventually received a total of 165 claims from Ruiz-Mateos, and eventually resolved a \\"fair price\\" settlement (although the family got nothing) Twelve years later in 1997 (shortly after the People's Party government of Jos√© Mar√≠a Aznar took power) the High court absolved Ruiz- Mateos from the criminal charges, and in 1999 also the civil actions, so that his bail bonds were returned. The family started a new company (Nueva Rumasa) with a \\"Busy Bee\\" logo that eventually comprised major brands, including: The Dhul Food Group, which include brands Cacaolat, Carcesa (which owns Apis conserved tomato products as well as Fruco tomatoes and tomato juice), Clesa dairy products, Royne ice cream, Chocolates Trapa. Wine and beverages include Los Conejos & Gab√≠n Garres liquors, rum, rum-punch, sherry, brandy, and other related products. The company claimed a total of 10,000 employees (the Trade union estimate was 6000) and net worth of almost six billions. It started a huge advertising campaign to attract private investors, and was reprimanded several times by the regulatory authorities, who also issued warnings to existing and potential investors. In 2011 the firm collapsed with a debt of 700 million Euros spread across some 23 banking institutions, private creditors and government agencies. Most of the debt arose from Dhul an Clesa, which together lost 434 million euros. In 2012 the founding father Jos√© Mar√≠a Ruiz-Mateos was arrested and has again spent time in prison on remand. He is essentially accused of operating a vast pyramid scheme (paying dividends to shareholders from fresh investments). Two of his sons who ran hotels in Andalucia are formal suspects in the ERE trial process. = Naseiro case = The so-called Naseiro case was a corruption investigation within the People's Party shortly after the arrival of Jos√© Mar√≠a Aznar to the party presidency in 1989. A magistrate in the Valencian Community issued an indictment against several members of the People's Party including the party treasurer Rosendo Naseiro and Angel Perales Sanchis, a representative for Valencia, for receiving illegal commissions for the direct awarding of projects and contracts. Because of the prominence of the accused, the case was heard by the Supreme Court of Spain but shelved for lack of evidence. Nevertheless, the defendants were still strongly suspected of misconduct and expelled from the Popular Party. = Privatisations = In 1997 the People's Party government of Jos√© Mar√≠a Aznar announced the sale of the nation's remaining minority stake (golden shares) in the Telef√≥nica telecommunications company and the petroleum group Repsol YPF. as well as in Endesa, Argentaria and Tabacalera, all major enterprises managed by people close to Aznar, and since been declared illegal by the European Union. This marked the beginning of a period of privatizations which has continued vigorously under PP administrations. A contested case being the Madrid region's public health service, in which the bidders are suspected of very close ties with the governing party, and in one case, run by a former regional health minister, Manuel Lamela. In 2012 privatized or 'externalized' health services contracted by the Madrid public health service cost the region, by some estimates, 345 million euros more than similar activities previously performed by that public sector organization itself. = G√ºrtel case = G√ºrtel is a huge case, code-named after one of its main suspects, construction businessman Francisco Correa. His surname translates to belt in English and to G√ºrtel in German. The case covers bribery, money laundering and tax evasion, and implicates a wide circle of powerful businessmen and top politicians (90 per cent of the whole party) in the People's Party who had gained an absolute majority in the national elections of Spain. The affair was first uncovered by the Spanish newspaper El Pais, whose researchers were awarded prizes for investigative journalism. Initial investigations were conducted in Madrid, Valencia & la Costa del Sol by the notable Spanish National Court Judge Baltasar Garz√≥n, an examining magistrate serving the Juzgado Central de Instrucci√≥n No. 5. Although Manos Limpias was party to the initial process, but as the case focussed on wayward politicians they brought an action against Garz√≥n for investigating Francoist atrocities, which caused delay and confusion for G√ºrtel as Garz√≥n was suspended for three years pending his eventual acquittal in February 2012, whereupon he was charged and convicted of a completely different crime connected to G√ºrtel: that of ordering the interception of communications between powerful construction company directors accused of bribing high officials and their lawyers, who were suspected of money laundering. His suspension is pending appeal at the European Court of Human Rights which have previously annulled a similar conviction On 1 June, Prime Minister Rajoy was ousted by a vote of no confidence after the verdict of the court.  Francisco Camps (PP party former) A part of G√ºrtel detached in 2009, known as the case of Francisco's suits (caso de los trajes), involved the president of the Valencia region Francisco Camps who allegedly accepted very expensive bespoke tailoring paid by corrupt businessmen. He was tried by jury in early 2012, and acquitted by a majority verdict. Similar allegations about the high-fashion handbags of the Lady Mayor of Valencia, Rita Barber√° Nolla, were dismissed. Camps resigned his presidency to fight his case, but remained a deputy of the Valencia government. Rita Barber√° (PP party former) remained in office, but took a beating at the following 2015 city elections. All council members from her list, but her, have been indicted for corruption in another case. She was a senator, and under Spanish law therefore only answerable to a higher court than the one which served those indictments. On April 21, 2016, the investigating judge requested her indictment for money laundering to the Tribunal Supremo. In November she died and therefore all her pending indictments and investigations were suspended.  Luis B√°rcenas (PP party former) The Gurtel case separated material relating to Luis B√°rcenas, at the time the treasurer of the conservative party. He subsequently accused his former employer of constructive dismissal Allegedly concessions for major public infrastructure works were obtained by major construction companies in exchange for secret corporate donations amounting to naked bribery during the period 1990 - which funds were kept or accounted-for in the so-called slush fund Barcenas then used this slush fund to pay extra salaries of between 5000 - 15,000 Euros to party leaders each month, including Spanish Government President Mr Mariano Rajoy and his deputy Mar√≠a Dolores de Cospedal. Spanish law prohibits senior politicians from receiving any income from sources other than the state institutions by which they are employed for defined official duties, and severely restricts political party funding and Political campaign donations. Large deposits of money amounting to some 38 millions of Euros were found in several foreign bank accounts operated by Barcenas or his agents, suggesting that he may have retained some bribery money for his personal gain. El Pa√≠s, the national center-left newspaper, published the so-called 'Barcenas papers' outlining some of the transactions for some of the alleged financial fraud. Its center-right rival, El Mundo, later published text messages of support sent by President Mariano Rajoy to Barcenas, indicating considerable personal friendship and moral support. On 27 June 2013 High Court Judge Pablo Ruz ordered former Popular Party (PP) treasurer Luis B√°rcenas held in custody without bail until his eventual trial. The judge set bail at 45 million Euro to cover his civil obligations, although the state prosecutor assessed these at a mere 12 million Euro. = ERE in Andalusia = (in Spanish Wikipedia) Employment contract severance conditions in Spain are regulated by law, and usually abbreviated to 'ERE' (expediente de regulaci√≥n de empleo). In 2001 the (socialist dominated) regional government of Andalusia presided by Manuel Chaves Gonz√°lez (later a Minister of State in the national government) gave support to a major commercial supplier of foodstuff (Mercavilla) which was considered to be both strategically important and financially failing. It provided grants for Severance packages and subsidised early retirement pensions as well as commissions for services related to such transactions. In 2008 the conservative opposition alleged that payments were made irregularly, and the Civil Guard presented evidence of a 'Reptilian Fund' as well as unjustified payments to persons who were not actually employed and excessive commissions to trade-union officials and company directors who managed the transactions. In consequence, there have been several resignations, probation and bail and even Remand (detention) orders, In August 2013 the long-serving regional president, Manuel Chaves resigned and handed power to his deputy in order to deal with the accusations. On 19 March 2013, as a result of police Operaci√≥n Heracles the examining magistrate, Mrs Mercedes Alaya ordered the arrest and detention of 20 people who had held significant positions in society. = Palma Arena = Palma Arena is a velodrome in Palma, Majorca which was allegedly constructed to an inferior specification at an exorbitant cost and with much money diverted to politically connected operators. The former president of the Baleares region, Jaume Matas (Partido Popular), received a six years jail sentence, and other aspects of the case are still under investigation. = N√≥os = The N√≥os case is a spinoff of the Palma Arena case. Instituto N√≥os was a Foundation (nonprofit) also known as Strategic Studies Association Sponsorship and Patronage and Noos Institute of Applied Research. Apparently it solicited and accepted huge payments from public bodies for major sports promotional activities which were either trivial or never started. Its directors were Diego Torres P√©rez and former handball star I√±aki Urdangarin, Duke of Palma the son-in-law of the Spanish King, who also ran a consultancy with his wife, the princess Cristina de Borb√≥n y Grecia. Powerful officials made strenuous efforts to keep the princess out of the case. In 2013 she accepted a position in Vienna, where she moved with the children of the marriage whilst her husband remained in Barcelona to answer charges. = Millet or Palau de la M√∫sica Catalana = In 2009 the director of the Palau de la M√∫sica Catalana in Barcelona, F√®lix Millet Tusell was accused of systematically raiding the coffers of this public body and confessed to embezzling 3.3 million euros. In 2012 he was placed on bail and the prosecutor sought six years imprisonment as well as massive fines. On 15 January 2018, a court in Barcelona ruled that the Democratic Convergence of Catalonia (CDC, now PDeCAT) had received ‚Ç¨6.6 million in illegal commissions from building firm Ferrovial (previously Grupo Ferrovial) between 1999 and 2009, in exchange for public works contracts. The scheme used the Palau de la M√∫sica Catalana concert venue as a front for false invoicing. Twelve people were jailed and fined millions. The former CDC treasurer Daniel Os√†car was sentenced to 4 years 5 months in prison and fined ‚Ç¨3.7 million for influence peddling and money laundering. F√®lix Millet Tusell was jailed for just under 10 years and fined ‚Ç¨4.1 million; his deputy, Jordi Montull, received a 7 year 6 month sentence and was fined ‚Ç¨2.9 million. Millet and Montull were the individuals who benefited most from the scam, as controllers of the Palau‚Äôs funds. = Bankia = Bankia is a Spanish bank which merged several failing financial institutions with largely conservative political direction. On 11 June 2012 the young political party Union, Progress and Democracy (UPyD) filed a lawsuit against the directors of Bankia and its main subsidiary for alleged fraud, misappropriation, falsification of financial statements in connection with corporate crime, mismanagement and scheme to alter the price of assets. The Indignant Protesters (M-15) raised 15,000 euros by crowd funding, and filed another lawsuit for false accounting and commercial fraud. Judge Fernando Andreu agreed to hear both complaints which called 27 defendants which included: Rodrigo Rato (President of Bankia, former conservative minister of Economy, and former head of the International Monetary Fund), Jos√© Luis Olivas (Deputy director of Bankia and former conservative president of the Valencia region), Angel Acebes (director of Bankia and former secretary general of the conservative party) and Francisco Verd√∫ (an experienced banker and sometime consultant to the construction industry). Also called as witnesses were a former Governor of the Bank of Spain, Miguel Angel Fern√°ndez Ord√≥√±ez, the president of the National Securities Market, , and the main author of the Bankia audit conducted by Deloitte, Francisco Celma. The court dismissed a request to extend the complaint to four additional Bankia directors who took office after the company was listed on the stock exchange.

It was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1979. History Adam Johan Gantz was born in Washington County, Pennsylvania on May 10, 1805 to Andrew and Margaret (Harn) Gantz. In 1817, Andrew bought 200 acres of land in Franklin County, Ohio at what is now the southwest corner of Hoover and Home roads. Adam married 16-year-old Catherine Pennix whose family was also from Washington County, Penn. on September 30, 1830. Two years later, he bought 100 acres of land and other property across Hoover Road and built the brick farm house. Today, the area is known as Gantz Park. The Gantz family lived in the house until the land around it was donated to Grove City as a park in 1973. The last Gantz family member to own the property was Blodwen Jones Gantz, widow of William B. Gantz, Adam's grandson. Blodwen Circle on the south edge of the park is named for her.Information/materials from Grove City Museum and Welcome Center Materials The farm house was made with materials found on the farm land.

He showed promising form as a two-year-old in 1986, winning three of his four races including the Lanson Champagne Stakes and the Champagne Stakes. In the early part of 1987 he survived an injury scare to win the 2000 Guineas and completed a rare double by winning the Irish 2000 Guineas two weeks later. He was beaten in his remaining three races and was retired to stud, where he had some success as a sire of winners. Background Don't Forget Me was a dark-coated bay horse with no white markings bred in Ireland. He was sired by Ahonoora, whose other offspring included The Derby winner Dr Devious. Ahonoora was a representative of the Byerley Turk sire line, unlike more than 95% of modern thoroughbreds, who descend directly from the Darley Arabian. Don't Forget Me's dam African Doll was a great-granddaughter of Circassia, an influential broodmare whose other descendants included Desert King and Frankel. As a yearling the colt was sent to the October sales at Newmarket where he was sold for 19,000 guineas. He entered the ownership of the County Cork-based businessman James Horgan and was sent into training with Richard Hannon, Sr.. Racing career =1986: two-year-old season= After finishing fourth behind Who Knows over a distance of six furlongs on his debut, Don't Forget Me recorded his first success in July 1986 when he won a seven furlong maiden race at Sandown Park Racecourse. In August he was moved up in class to contest the Group Three Lanson Champagne Stakes at Goodwood where he was ridden by Pat Eddery and started the 7/1 third favourite. Don't Forget Me led from the start and turned back several challenges in the straight to win by three quarters of a length from Midyan. In September at Doncaster Racecourse the colt was again partnered by Eddery in the Group Two Champagne Stakes over seven furlongs and started third favourite behind the Washington Singer Stakes winner Deputy Governor and the Gimcrack Stakes winner Wiganthorpe. As at Goodwood, Don't Forget Me took the lead from the start and in the closing stages he held off the challenge of Deputy Governor to win by half a length with Who Knows a length and a half away in third. The performance saw the colt considered a leading contender for the Group One Dewhurst Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse, but Hannon opted not to run him again in 1986. =1987: three-year-old season= Don't Forget Me began his three- year-old season in the Craven Stakes over the Rowley Mile at Newmarket in April, where he was matched against Ajdal the winner of the Dewhurst Stakes and the ante-post favourite for the 2000 Guineas. Ajdal took the lead a furlong from the finish and looked likely to win easily, but Don't Forget Me rallied strongly in the final strides to finish only three quarters of a length behind the winner. Over the same course and distance on 2 May, Don't Forget Me started at odds of 9/1 for the 181st running of the 2000 Guineas. The colt had suffered an injury to his hoof when losing a shoe on the journey to the course and was only cleared to run at the last moment after undergoing several hours of intensive treatment involving ice packs and a poultice. With Eddery partnering the Geoff Wragg-trained Most Welcome, the ride on Don't Forget Me went to the Scottish jockey Willie Carson, who was under instructions to pull the colt up if he showed any sign of lameness during the race. Carson went into the lead from the start and sent Don't Forget me down the centre of the wide, straight course. In the final quarter mile the colt was challenged on both the left and right but held on under strong pressure to win by a neck from Bellotto, with Most Welcome, Midyan, Ajdal (the 6/5 favourite) and Deputy Governor close behind. Most Welcome was subsequently disqualified by the racecourse stewards for causing interference. Don't Forget Me's winning time of 1:36.74 was the fastest electrically recorded time in the history of the race. Two weeks later Don't Forget Me, with Carson again in the saddle, attempted to become the second 2000 Guineas winner, after Right Tack in 1969, to win the Irish 2000 Guineas at the Curragh. He was opposed again by Ajdal and the two English-trained colts were made the 6/4 joint-favourites in a field of nine runners. As at Newmarket, Don't Forget Me established an early lead and responded well when challenged in the final furlong, winning by a half a length and a neck from Entitled and Ajdal. His victory was enthusiastically received, with hundreds of fans thronging the winner's enclosure and chanting the name of the winning jockey. Although the Derby was briefly considered as ha target, Hannon opted to keep the colt to the one-mile distance and his next race was the St James's Palace Stakes at Royal Ascot. He was ridden by Eddery after Carson received a seven-day ban for striking another jockey with his whip in a minor race at Bath Racecourse. He started the 10/11 favourite but finished fourth behind Half A Year, Soviet Star and Risk Me. After a break of two months, Don't Forget Me was sent to France for the Prix Jacques le Marois at Deauville Racecourse in August, when he was reunited with Carson. As usual, he attempted to lead all the way, but was overtaken in the closing stages and finished fourth to Miesque. On his only subsequent appearance, the colt was tried over ten furlongs on soft ground in the Champion Stakes at Newmarket in October. In a change of tactics, Carson attempted to restrain Don't Forget Me in the early stages, but he made no progress in the last quarter mile and finished sixth, eight length behind the winner Triptych. Assessment In 1986, the Independent Timeform organisation gave Don't Forget Me a rating of 120p, the \\"p\\" indicating that he was likely to improve. In the official International Classification he was given a rating of 117, ten pounds behind the top-rated Reference Point. In the following year's International Classification he was rated on 123, making him the eighth best three-year-old colt in Europe. Timeform awarded him a rating of 127. In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Don't Forget Me an \\"inferior\\" winner of the 2000 Guineas. Stud record In July 1987, Don't Forget Me was bought for IR¬£3 million by the Irish National Stud. He stood as a stallion in Ireland and was also shuttled to stand in Australasia during the southern hemisphere breeding season. He had some success as a sire before being exported to India in 1994. His last reported foals were born in 2003 and he died in March 2010 in India. His best winners included: *Irish Memory (bay horse, foaled 1989), won Tyros Stakes, Tetrarch Stakes *My Memoirs (bay horse, 1989), won Dee Stakes *A Smooth One (bay mare, 1991), won Princess Margaret Stakes *Insatiable (bay horse, 1993), won Brigadier Gerard Stakes, Prix Dollar, Blandford Stakes *Rudi's Pet (chestnut gelding, 1994), won King George Stakes, Vodafone Dash Pedigree References Category:1984 racehorse births Category:2010 racehorse deaths Category:Racehorses bred in Ireland Category:Racehorses trained in the United Kingdom Category:Thoroughbred family 1-k Category:Byerley Turk sire line Category:2000 Guineas winners ","title":"Don't Forget Me (horse)"},{"id":"40267750","text":"Pierre-Louis-Adrien de Montgolfier-Verpilleux (6 November 1831 ‚Äì 23 January 1913) was a French engineer who became a representative of the Loire in the National Assembly, and then a senator. He was responsible for various hydraulic works in the Loire department. In the last half of his life he was responsible for a major iron and steel company, making heavy armaments and railway tracks. Early years Pierre-Louis-Adrien Montgolfier-Verpilleux was born in Beaujeu, Rh√¥ne on 6 November 1831. He was grand-nephew of Jacques- √âtienne Montgolfier, the inventor of balloons. He married the daughter of the engineer Claude Verpilleux, adding her name to his. In 1851 he entered the √âcole Polytechnique, and in 1853 the school of roads and bridges. He became a 3rd class engineer in 1856. In 1856 he was appointed engineer to the department of the Loire with responsibility for building flood-control dams in the valleys of the Furens and Gien rivers. On 10 November 1858 he married Elizabeth, daughter of Jean Claude Verpilleux, at Rive-de-Gier. In 1859 he was appointed a 2nd class engineer. Montgolfier lived at Saint-√âtienne from 1861, and became director-general of the Saint Chamond Soci√©t√© des forges. At these two towns he undertook important hydraulic works. He was named a Knight of the Legion of Honor in 1865. On 5 January 1870 he became a 1st class engineer. Montgolfier directed construction of the Saint-Chamond dam, which was inaugurated in 1870. When the Franco-Prussian War broke out in 1870, Montgolfier was named commander of the 3rd mobile battalion of the Loire. In this position he took part of the defense of Besan√ßon. Politician Montgolfier was elected representative of the Loire in the French National Assembly on 8 February 1870, while still confined in Besan√ßon. Riots broke out at Saint Etienne in which the prefect of the Loire, M. de l'Esp√©e, died on 25 March 1871. On 27 March 1871 Montgolfier was sent as the government's extraordinary commissioner to restore peace, with full civil and military powers. The need had passed before he arrived. He was promoted to officer of the Legion of Honor on 12 March 1872. In 1874 the Compagnie des Hauts- Fourneaux, Forges et Aci√©ries de la Marine et des Chemins de fer was struggling in a difficult economy. Montgolfier was named general director. In 1875 Montgolfier was appointed Chief engineer of Roads and Bridges. In the 1876 elections Mongolfier was a candidate of the \\"Conservative Union.\\" On 30 January 1876 he was elected Senator of the Loire. Again he sat on the right. He voted in favor of dissolving the Chamber as requested by the Minister Albert de Broglie. After the cabinet fell on 16 May 1876 he was proposed as Minister of Public Works several times by Montgolfier. He lost his seat in the Senate in the election of 5 January 1879. Later years The Chateau Verpilleux-Montgolfier at the end of the 19th century Montgolfier retired from politics in 1879 and devoted himself to industry. In 1880 he became president of the Comit√© des forges. He became a member of the Saint Etienne Chamber of Commerce in 1887, and in 1888 was made president of the Chamber of Commerce. Montgolfier remained general director of the Compagnie des Hauts-Fourneaux for most of the rest of his life. When he took office in 1874 the annual sales turnover was 20 million francs, and at the end of his tenure it had risen to 80 million francs. He paid particular attention to the works at Saint-Chamond and Assailly, where he developed the special fabrications that brought fame to the factories. At Saint-Chamond he built a forge that could make 80-ton ingots, and he installed a great steam hammer with a 100-ton ram. He developed arms manufacture at Saint-Chamond, and also delivered large quantities of rails to major French railroad companies. In 1881 he founded the Forges du Boucau near Bayonne. The factory at Boucau was prepared when the Midi rail network decided to replace its iron rails with steel. Between 1887 and 1890 he built huge workshops which, among other products, made most of the land turrets that armed the eastern fortresses of France, and provided turrets to various foreign powers, particularly Romania. The forges also produced train shields and marine turrets. In 1908 Montgolfier was forced by illness to give up the general directorship, although he continued to live in Saint-Chamond and to take an interest in the company's affairs. He was a member of the Development Council of the National Conservatory of Arts and Crafts. He died on 23 January 1913 in his chateau at Saint-Chamond, Loire.

The nickname was coined as a result of the exhibition that took place in the Tower of David during that period. Instead of one artistic direction, this period was characterized by artistic works of conflicting styles, reflecting the worldview of the artists with regard to the social, political, and artistic reality within the Land of Israel and outside of it. Alongside the art created at ‚ÄúBezalel‚Äù, which was characterized by decorative motifs and the influence of ars nova, the young Land-of-Israel artists produced works of art that reflected a variety of modernist influences. Background: The Land of Israel at the Beginning of the 20th Century Tower of David in late 1920s Tel Aviv in the 1920s The variety of expressions and styles in the Land of Israel in the \\"Tower of David Period\\" reflects the historic and decisive division in the history of the Jewish people which preceded this period and continued through the days of the Yishuv, the body of Jewish residents in Palestine, before the establishment of the State of Israel, under the British Mandate. The Yishuv community had been caught up in an accelerated process of change since the First Aliyah in 1881. The aspiration of the elite groups of new immigrants was not just to settle the Holy Land and to implement an emotional and spiritual awakening there, like most of their predecessors from the ‚ÄúOld Yishuv‚Äù, but also to fashion it in their own image and identity; this included, according to their own consciousness, both old and traditional elements and new and revolutionary elements, intertwined in a unique ideological treatise. From the beginning of the 20th century, people of the Second Aliyah worked to change the status and situation of the Jewish community in the Land of Israel. The decisive compensation for their efforts came with the outbreak of World War I in 1914, and the events that followed in its wake: in 1917 the Russian Revolution took place and the Bolsheviks seized the government; the Ottoman and the Austro- Hungarian Empires dissolved into individual nations; and even the victorious Colonial powers, headed by Britain and France, began in effect a process of convergence. After the signing of the peace agreements, and as a result of them, a new world order prevailed; and in the Land of Israel, the British Mandate government slowly took root, beginning with the Balfour Declaration and the entry of the army into the Land of Israel, effecting a gradual occupation in 1918, the beginning of the military government, and later the civil government in 1920, and ending in the publication of the first ‚ÄúWhite Book‚Äù in 1922. The British in fact expressed support for the Zionist leadership, when they allowed delegations of the Zionist Commission and Hadassah to come to the Land of Israel and found the basis for declaring future Jewish sovereignty there; on the other hand they hampered aliyah to the Land of Israel and disbanded the Jewish Legion, which they had recruited during World War I, and in whom they had instilled with grand Zionist hopes. A mixture of voices could be heard in the years after World War I in the various Jewish communities, particularly in the battle among the militant members of the Zionist Movement. Advocates of religiosity and traditionalism, nationalism and modernism, liberalism and Communism all made use of the movement. All these streams found a place in the small Yishuv society in the 1920s, and the different utterances and artist directions were combined in them and influenced by them. The people of the Third Aliyah, from 1918 to 1923, were imbued with a wide-ranging revolutionary spirit, and they were engaged in a constant interchange with the Yishuv environment. However their influence was also a result of their numbers (by the end of the war the Yishuv numbered 56,000 people, and an estimate of the number of the many new Jewish immigrants, balancing out those who left, stood at 35,000)1\\\\. See: Yigal Zalmona, 100 Years of Israeli Art (Jerusalem: The Israel Museum, 2010), p. 51 (in Hebrew); Yehuda Erez, ed., Third Aliya Book (Tel Aviv: Am Oved, 1964) (in Hebrew) and in addition, to a large extent, because of the broad spectrum of new ideas they brought with them to the Land of Israel. Most of the new immigrants were from Eastern Europe, young, and with a belief in Zionism in all its varieties. Many of them, particularly the young and inventive among them, underwent a redesign of how they perceived their new Jewish and Hebrew world during the 1920s, while they were involved in Zionist labor like building roads and erecting buildings, and were undergoing the considerable suffering brought about by poverty, hunger, and the constant illnesses resulting from them. At the same time they were structuring their own personal identity, they also influenced the long-time residents of the Land of Israel who had preceded them: people who had come on the First and Second Aliyah and were members of the ‚ÄúOld Yishuv‚Äù. The Tower of David Exhibition: ‚ÄúThe First Culture War‚Äù in Israeli Art‚Äù The opening of exhibitions in the Tower of David in April 1921, expressed the aspirations toward founding a center for art in the Land of Israel. In spite of the fact that the exhibitions were supposed to include a representation of all the art being created in the Land of Israel, in reality the art of the Arab, Muslim, and Christian residents were presented primarily in a historical-archaeological framework. The Jewish artists, on the other hand, sought to present art that drew its inspiration not just from the Jewish historical past, but also from the movement of art and handicrafts that was grew out of European Modernism. This was most noticeable among the artists of ‚ÄúThe Jewish Artists Association‚Äù, who attempted to develop a ‚ÄúJewish ethic‚Äù. This group, most of whom were students of ‚ÄúBezalel‚Äù, organized exhibitions in the Tower of David. A number of exhibitions were organized, both in the Tower of David and outside of it, and most of the works exhibited in these exhibitions were influenced by the Post- Impressionists and the Expressionists. Reuven Rubin paints \\"Fruit of the Land\\" (central panel from the triptych \\"First Fruits\\"), 1923) One of the most important exhibitions was that of the works by Reuven Rubin, who mounted an exhibition in the Tower in 1924. Rubin exhibited new works that showed the transition from the influence of the Christian tradition to paintings brimming with the symbolism of the Land of Israel.4\\\\. Cf., Carmela Rubin, A Dream of a Place (Jerusalem: The Israel Museum, 2007), p. 13-37 (in Hebrew). Among the works that drew attention was the triptych ‚ÄúFirst Fruits‚Äù (1924), which received enthusiastic reviews by critics from various fields of culture such as Hayyim Nahman Bialik, Samuel (Schmuel) Hugo Bergman, etc. However the perception of Modernist painting that Rubin presented was not shared by all of the population. His album of woodcuts, ‚ÄúThe Godseekers (1923)‚Äù, which he sent to the High Commissioner, was rejected because the High Commissioner did not ‚Äúhave any liking for that population of art objects‚Äù.5\\\\. See: Reuven Rubin, cited in: Studio, No. 56 (September 1994), unnumbered pages (in Hebrew). Views like those held by Rubin kept spreading among the young artists during the first half of the decade. At the same time \\"Bezalel\\" art continued to honor the values of Classicism, Jugendstil (Art Nouveau), and eastern European Realism.See: Ofrat, Gidon, Art in Israel (Westview Press, 1998), p. 27. The works of the ‚ÄúBezalel‚Äù artists existed primarily within the space of applied arts, and they were characterized by the introduction of noncanonical branches of art ‚Äì such as decoration and design ‚Äì into high art in order to create a style\\".Yigal Zalmona, The Tower of David Days; First Cultural Strife in Israeli Art (Jerusalem: Tower of David, Museum of the History of Jerusalem, 1991). p. 15 (in Hebrew). But first and foremost the young artists began to be aware of the growing gap between ‚ÄúBezalel‚Äù and the international art world. One attempt to reject totally the world of Modernism can be seen in Boris Schatz‚Äôs closure of the Bezalel library because he was afraid the students would be negatively influenced by it.See: Benjamin Tammuz, The Story of Israeli Art (Masada Publishers, Tel Aviv, 1980), p. 38 (in Hebrew). In a critical article published in 1928, Agan wrote that as opposed to the people of ‚ÄúBezalel‚Äù, Modernist artists ‚Äúdraw the land of Israel with love and a desire to understand and grasp its colors and lines in accordance with the dominant trends in the modern art world‚Äù.9\\\\. Agan, ‚ÄúBezalel‚Äù Writings (Tel Aviv: January 12, 1928), cited in: Nurit Shilo-Cohen, Schatz‚Äôs Bezalel (Jerusalem: The Israel Museum, 1983), p. 231 (in Hebrew). By the end of the decade the principles on which Bezalel based its work had become irrelevant, because they were no longer suitable to the political and ideological conditions of Eretz Israel. Besides the criticism of the varying quality of the results of the ‚ÄúBezalel‚Äù workshops, the strengthening of left-wing elements in the Yishuv, increased the criticism of the use of national and religious symbols as the virtually exclusive expression of Jewish nationality. In 1929, the school closed after the Zionist organizations refused to support its activities any longer. Yigal Zalmona presented the confrontation between the ‚ÄúBezalel‚Äù people and the ‚Äúrebel‚Äù artists as a confrontation between the ‚Äúimmigrant‚Äù point of view and the ‚Äúnative‚Äù point of view. The ‚Äúold-timer‚Äù generation of ‚ÄúBezalel‚Äù insisted on creating a national art, which focused on the symbols of its Judeo-European past. In this way the artists expressed their wish to be integrated into the world of European art. The ‚ÄúBezalel‚Äù artists enjoyed the support of the European Jewish middle classes, and many of the orders for the art coming out of its workshops came from the Conservative and Reform Jews of the United States. The generation of modern students, on the other hand, saw the creation of a local Jewish culture as a central need, a point of view which coincided with spirit of Israel's Labor Movement. Many of them were influenced by the European vanguard, to whom they had been exposed in various frameworks, particularly in France. These artists, Tsalmona contended, wanted to create the reality of the Land of Israel of their time within the framework of the creative activity this vanguard.See: Zalmona, p. 49, 58. From Jerusalem to Tel Aviv ‚Äì The Development of the Center of Art of the Land of Israel The Bezalel Buildings, Jerusalem, 1909 The founding of ‚ÄúBezalel‚Äù in Jerusalem in 1906 created a center of art and culture in Jerusalem the likes of which had never before been seen in the Land of Israel. The ‚ÄúBezalel‚Äù people hoped to continue to develop the school as an artistic and ideological center for the country's inhabitants, and even for the Jewish inhabitants of the Diaspora. This was symbolized above all by the opening of the Bezalel National Museum in 1925, as a museum intended to be open permanently to the public. In these years the art of young artists from the Land of Israel was eliminated entirely from its exhibitions, which concentrated entirely on historical artistic evidence of the nationalist message appropriate to the ‚ÄúBezalel‚Äù dialogue Boris Schatz was promoting. By the middle of the 1920s, Bezalel's status in the eyes of the public had seriously deteriorated. A witness to this can be seen in the 1927 letter of Mordechai Narkis to Boris Schatz, in which he reports that Land of Israeli newspapers have eradicated the name of the Bezalel school from their articles.See: Gideon Efrat, Washington Crosses the Jordan (Jerusalem: Sifria Zionit, 2008), pp. 149-150 (in Hebrew). Parallel to Bezalel, at the beginning of the 1920s a group of independent artists who sought to cut all ties with the old establishment began to be active in Jerusalem. The establishment of the ‚ÄúAssociation of Jewish Artists‚Äù symbolized this more than any other phenomenon. In addition to the exhibits organized by the Association, private exhibitions were organized in various places in the city, such as ‚ÄúMenorah‚Äù (Joseph Zaritsky), Hotel Amdursky (Abraham Neumann), the Lamel School (Batya Leschinsky, Ariel Allweil), etc.See: Gideon Efrat, Washington Crosses the Jordan (Jerusalem: Sifria Zionit, 2008), pp. 145-153, 151-152 (in Hebrew). In contrast to Jerusalem, the rapid development of the city of Tel Aviv during this decade, especially during the years of the Fourth Aliyah (1924-1931), allowed the rise of a community of artists with a modernist orientation, far removed from the historical baggage of the Holy City. This group quickly rejected the centrality of Jerusalem as the center of art. According to Yona Fischer, the exhibit of modern paintings mounted in the School for Boys in Jerusalem in 1926 marked the end of the competition between these two centers.See: Yona Fischer, Migdal David: The Beginnings of Painting in Eretz- Israel (Jerusalem, The Israel Museum, 1968), unnumbered pages (in Hebrew). One of the first signs of artistic activity in Tel Aviv was the opening of a school of painting and architecture in 1923 in the home of Joseph Berlin on Gruzenberg Street.See: Batia Donner, From the Perman Collection of the Tel Aviv Museum (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv Museum of Art, 2002), p. 13 (in Hebrew). During this decade most of the major artists moved to Tel Aviv, especially those who returned from studying art in France and other places in Europe. Nevertheless, the ‚ÄúBezalel‚Äù approach remained popular in architecture and architectural decoration. This was reflected in the adaptation of the ‚Äúeclectic style,‚Äù in which many of the buildings in Tel Aviv of that period were designed. In most of them porcelain tiles were used, glazed in the Bezalel style, and reflecting the themes and the ideology and the decorative approach of that Jerusalem institution. One of the major donors to the visual arts in Tel Aviv was Yaakov Pereman, who was the entrepreneur behind the founding of the artists‚Äô cooperative ‚ÄúHa-Tomer‚Äù. In 1920 Pereman opened ‚ÄúThe First Art Exhibition in the Land of Israel‚Äù, at which various works were exhibited, including those of the artists of the cooperative. In 1921-1922 Pereman founded and managed Tel Aviv's first art gallery, called ‚ÄúThe Permanent Art Exhibition in the Land of Israel‚Äù in the exhibition hall in Neve Sha‚Äôanan.The hall was next to the trade school and opposite the Tel Aviv gate (what is now the corner of Nahalat Binyamin and Mohaliver Streets). In this gallery many modernistic works, which Pereman brought from Eastern Europe, were exhibited, along with modernistic works by Land of Israel artists and works by artists from the ‚ÄúBezalel‚Äù school as well. According to Batia Donner, ‚ÄúPereman‚Äôs gallery activity was both an augmentation of and an alternative to the ‚ÄòBezalel‚Äô activity\\".See: Batia Donner, From the Pereman Collection of the Tel Aviv Museum (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv Museum of Art, 2002), p. 25 (in Hebrew). Exhibition of \\"Modern Artists\\" in the Ohel Theatre in Tel Aviv On January 14, 1926, an exhibition entitled ‚ÄúExhibition of Modern Artists‚Äù opened in a shed of the ‚ÄúHa-Ohel‚Äù (The Tent) Theater. The poet Avraham Shlonsky gave a speech at the opening of the exhibition in which he suggested that the opening was a seminal event in the evolution of Jewish culture: ‚ÄúI recommend a substitute for God: the exhibition that is taking place in ‚ÄòHa-Ohel‚Äô. A new synagogue needs to be found; that is, in place of God, we'll be standing there. Let the poet be found in the sphere of the painter, and the painter in the sphere of the musician. And ‚ÄòHa-Ohel‚Äô can serve as a substitute for God in the synagogue of art.‚Äù This exhibition, and two additional exhibitions held in ‚ÄúHa-Ohel‚Äù before 1928, was perceived by Israeli art critics as the event that established the hegemony of Tel Aviv in the country's cultural life.See: Yigal Zalmona, 100 Years of Israeli Art (Jerusalem: The Israel Museum, 2010), p. 78 (in Hebrew). At the end of 1929, an exhibition of art by the group known as ‚ÄúEgged‚Äù (The Amalgamation), which took place in an apartment on Allenby Street in Tel Aviv, and which exhibited works by artists such as Sionah Tagger, Chana Orloff, Reuven Rubin, and others. Another exhibition held in Tel Aviv during this period under the name ‚ÄúMassad‚Äù (The Base\\") exhibited younger artists, including Aaaron Priver, Menahem Shemi, Israel Paldi, Avigdor Stematsky, etc.Batia Donner, From a Collection to a Museum, 1920-1932 (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv Museum of Art, 2002), pp. 20-21 (in Hebrew). Modernism in the Land of Israel During the 1920s During the 1920s many of the young artists in the Land of Israel were exposed to modern art. Only a small minority of the artists immigrated to the Land of Israel from Eastern Europe with a previous exposure to European avant-garde art. Others went for a limited period to study in Europe, primarily in France, which was considered the center of art at the time, but also in Germany and other places. The various modernist influences included postmodernist influences with regard to color and the way it is applied to the canvas, along with the moderating influences of Cubism and Expressionism, as well as a tendency to Primitivism. In contrast to the European artists, only a tiny minority of the artists in the Land of Israel leaned toward the avant-garde and the abstract in their works. The general mood demanded that they express the realistic experience of life in the Land of Israel, combining East and West in their work. Among the outstanding artists of the period was the sculptor Abraham Melnikov. Melnikov suggested a different lexicon of forms, taken from ancient Eastern art instead of the art forms imported from Europe, and in accordance with the reigning philosophy in Bezalel during the time of Schatz and Lilien. ‚ÄúFor generations‚Äù, Melnikoff wrote, ‚Äúthe Jews have been cut off from figurative art, and there are many reasons for this, but the main reason is that the foundations of European art are Greco-Roman [‚Ä¶] and whenever Athens was the Only source of European art, the Jews instinctively watched from the side‚Äù.Haaretz, December 18, 1925. \\"Land of Israel School\\", or \\"The Land of Israel Style,\\" was established by a group of artists who inserted into their works symbols of the reality of the Land of Israel, which could also be interpreted as mystical symbols. In their works we see depictions of the Land of Israel wilderness, full of desert foliage and images drawn from Eastern exoticism. Many of the depictions are of Arab or Middle Eastern figures, which are shown to have a direct connection with Land of Israel nature or with the Land of Israel of the Bible. In works such as \\"Woman Carrying a Sheaf\\" (1926) and \\"Resting at Noon\\" (1926) by Nachum Gutman, Middle Eastern figures working at nature-related activities are depicted. The style of the painting emphasizes their monumentality and sensuality. A similar style can be seen in the work of Israel Paldi, \\"Arab Sailors\\" (1928), which depicts a group of sailors in a fishing boat heroically fighting the waves. The composition of the painting, which reduces the view to the boat, also emphasizes the monumentality of the figures. Pinchas Litvinovsky's painting \\"Arab with Flower\\" (1926) combines a style that is modernist in the structure of its composition and its flat spaces, and romantic in its depiction of the Middle East and the Middle Eastern. In the works of Reuven Rubin we see, alongside the Middle Eastern figures, depictions of the way of life of the Jews of the Land of Israel as well. In his paintings such as \\"Sophie\\" (1924) or \\"Dancers of Meron\\" (1926), then tendency to flatness and decorativeness is very evident. In these works Rubin identifies Land of Israel Jewishness with Middle Eastern rootedness, as manifested by a large number of Yemenite or Arab figures, or by images of the Land of Israel landscape or foliage. Even in the 1920s this type of art was the object of criticism. Uri Zvi Greenberg, for example, rejected the symbolic depiction which could be seen in the works of many artists of the time. In Greenberg's view, these artists were simply providing illustrations for the literary subject ‚Äì the exotic Middle Easterner ‚Äì for whom the artist \\"dragged the Arab from the market and his donkey by the ear to the canvas\\".Uri Zvi Greenberg, ‚ÄúDraft of an article on an exhibition of Zaritsky in the Bezalel National Museum , Studio, No. 56 (September 1994), p. 6. The artist Chaim Gliksberg in 1923 also described the misuse of this motif by the artists: \\"Our paintings shocked the world, covered huge canvases, were illustrations painted in the decorative style without any attempt at solving artistic problems, since the main thing was the subject and the content: the external depiction of the Land of Israel. The canvas and the paint served only as the means to all this: it's no wonder that they considered everyone who put a pioneer, a camel, a donkey, or an Arab village on canvas, as an Israeli artist\\".Turim [Tel Aviv literary weekly, 1933-1935], 1933. Cited in: Tammuz, Benjamin, ed., The Story of Israeli Art (Givatayim: Masada Publishers, 1980), 49. One of the artists who rejected the symbolic representation of the Land of Israel was Joseph Zaritsky. His works during this period included a large number of watercolor landscapes in light colors. His artistic work gradually became more free in its style. In works such as ‚ÄúJerusalem Habashim Gate‚Äù (1923), you can still see a desire for a meticulous description of nature, but his later works show an expressive tendency in the creation of their composition; examples of this can be seen in the painting ‚ÄúHaifa, The Technion‚Äù (1924), or in the work ‚ÄúJerusalem, Nahalat Shiva‚Äù (1924), in which Zaritsky uses trees as an expressive device for dividing the format into distinct areas. The use of lines as a means of expression stands out also in his landscapes depicting the houses of Jerusalem or Safed of that era. Among the group of artists who were influenced by French Modernism we can see a combination of the influences of Cubism and realism. For example, in Sionah Tagger's painting, ‚ÄúThe Train Passing Through Neve Tzedek‚Äù (1928), the tendency to geometric description stands out in monochromatic painted surfaces which combine with a realistic depiction of the urbanity of the developing city of Tel Aviv. In the works of Chana Orloff and Arieh Lubin, perhaps more than in any other artists of the period, we can see the influence of synthetic Cubism and of the tendency toward the use of geometric forms.

In 2019 the Government confirmed that it \\"does not hold information about the identity of the donor who set up the Fund.\\" It has been suggested that the donor pledged the money as a response to a 1919 Financial Times editorial by then-Financial Secretary to the Treasury Stanley Baldwin, which suggested patriotic rich citizens voluntarily contribute towards paying the debt accumulated from World War I. The value of the fund has risen steadily in recent years, having been ¬£69,300,504 on 31 March 1989. On 22 May 2018 an application was made to the High Court by the Attorney General for the release of the National Fund for the purposes of reducing the National Debt. An original court date set for November 2019 has been pushed back to October 2020. The charity's 2019 financial statements revealed that the reason for the delay was that just before the November 2019 trial someone came forward \\"claiming to be the original benefactor's great-great-nephew, arguing that the original charitable gift has failed and that the funds be distributed to the original donor's estate.\\" In answer to a parliamentary question asked in the House of Lords in June 2020 by Baroness Hayter of Kentish Town, government minister Lord Keen of Elie stated, \\"It is now for the High Court to determine the individual‚Äôs claims and decide whether the terms of the charitable trust should be varied as sought by the Attorney General. If the Attorney General‚Äôs application is successful the money in the fund will be paid over to the National Debt Commissioners towards the reduction of the national debt.\\" Court intervention is required because, under the terms of the fund, its value must be left to accumulate until such time as it is sufficient to pay off the National Debt in full. With the UK's National Debt standing at ¬£1,891.8 billion in December 2019, the fund is equivalent less than 0.03 per cent of it, even though it has been accumulating for over 90 years.

It has also been covered by Johnny Cash, Everclear, Emily Loizeau, Crash Vegas, Gillian Welch, Trampled By Turtles, and Ian McNabb. History Young originally recorded a version of \\"Pocahontas\\" in the mid-1970s for his planned but unreleased album Chrome Dreams, and an early recording of the song is included on Young's 2017 release Hitchhiker. The same recording, with additional overdubs, was released on Rust Never Sleeps. Young may have been inspired to write the song after reading Hart Crane's 1930 poem The Bridge, which Young read in London in 1971. The seventeenth-century Indigenous heroine Matoaka (white name, Pocahontas) is a central character in The Bridge. Commentators over the years have noted the song's similarity to Carole King's \\"He's a Bad Boy.\\" Lyrics and music Rolling Stone contributing editor Rob Sheffield finds \\"Pocahontas\\" to be \\"an agonizingly lonely ballad.\\" The themes of \\"Pocahontas\\" include passage of time, travel through space and companionship. Rolling Stone critic Paul Nelson claims that \\"Young sails through time and space like he owns them.\\" The lyrics of \\"Pocahontas\\" primarily describe the massacre of an indigenous tribe by European colonizers. However, by the end of the song the lyrics have jumped to modern times, with a fictional meeting in the Astrodome between the narrator, Pocahontas (actual name, Matoaka) and indigenous rights activist actor Marlon Brando. Rolling Stone author Andy Greene describes the song as a \\"surreal journey through time from the 17th century\\" to modern times. \\"Pocahontas\\" begins with an image that evokes \\"a cold breeze whistling by\\": It then describes the massacre. According to music critic Johnny Rogan, Young describes the tragedy with restraint. The narrator appears to be in the middle of the situation with the word \\"might\\" in the lines \\"They killed us in our teepee,\\" but then undercuts that appearance with the lines \\"They might have left some babies/Cryin' on the ground.\\" Rogan discusses the disorientating effect of these lines. While the tragedy is described in the first person, the word \\"might\\" also creates a more disinterested tone. The listener is also unsure whether to be relieved that the soldiers might have shown some small degree of mercy to these babies, or whether to feel even greater anger that the defenseless babies were left to probably die slowly out in the open. According to Rogan, Young's \\"casual\\" delivery adds to the horror even more. The time period fast forwards, moving from the settlers massacring the buffalo to a bank on the corner in a single line, and then to the present day where the narrator sits in his room with an indigenous rug and a \\"pipe to share.\\" The following verse then provides a flashback, which Nelson calls \\"so loony and moving that you don't know whether to laugh or cry,\\" and challenges the listener to try to reduce that verse to a single emotion: Nelson and others have commented on the effect of the \\"bawdy pun\\" on sleeping with Matoaka to \\"find out how she felt.\\" Finally, in what critic Jim Sullivan calls \\"a biting surrealistic twist\\", in the last verse the narrator sits with Matoaka and Marlon Brando in the Astrodome discussing Hollywood. Young accompanies himself on acoustic guitar. Allmusic critic Matthew Greenwald describes the song as having a \\"strong folk/country melody. According to Greene, the melody borrows from Carole King's 1963 song \\"He's a Bad Boy.\\" Critical reception Rolling Stone critic Nelson describes \\"Pocahontas\\" as being \\"simply amazing, and nobody but Neil Young could have written it.\\" Music critic Johnny Rogan called the song \\"one of Young's most accomplished acoustic tracks from the period and a perfect example of his ability to mix pathos and comedy.\\" Author Ken Bielen calls it \\"a classic piece of music in Young's body of work. Bob Bonn of the Beaver County Times compared it unfavorably to Young's earlier song about European conquest of the Indians, \\"Cortez the Killer,\\" in that the lyrics do not match the \\"brilliant, melancholy and haunting\\" quality of the earlier song, nor is Young's guitar playing as evocative. But music critic Robert Christgau counters that due to the \\"offhand complexity of the lyrics...'Pocahantas' makes 'Cortez the Killer' seem like a tract.\\" Critic Dave Marsh claimed that Young \\"found an amusing new way to tackle his romanticized fantasies of the Indians.\\" Jim Sullivan of Bangor Daily News calls \\"Pocahontas\\" \\"the most intriguing song\\" of Rust Never Sleeps. A readers' poll conducted by Rolling Stone named \\"Pocohontas\\" to be Young's 6th greatest \\"deep cut.\\" Other appearances Live versions of \\"Pocahontas\\" were included on Young's 1993 album Unplugged and 1997 album Year of the Horse. Everclear covered the song on their 2008 album The Vegas Years. Emily Loizeau covered the song on her 2005 album L' Autre Bout Du Monde. Gillian Welch covered the song on The Revelator Collection. Johnny Cash, backed by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, covered \\"Pocahontas\\" on his 2003 posthumous album Unearthed. Allmusic critic Thom Jurek called Cash's version \\"visionary\\" and a \\"sage read.\\" Entertainment Weekly critic David Browne described it as a \\"quasi- psychedelic\\" take on Young's already surreal song.

History The clock tower The town hall was commissioned to replace an aging guildhall, located in the middle of the High Street, which had previously been the civic meeting place as well as the venue for the quarter Sessions which traveled around South Wales. Civic leaders found that the guildhall was restricting the movement of traffic in the High Street and decided to find an alternative venue: the site they selected was a building dating back to 1806 which had served as a prison or \\"House of Correction\\" but had fallen vacant when correctional activities were consolidated in Swansea. In 1824 it was reported that the \\"Plans and estimate of the expense attending the erection of a new Town Hall ... have been procured by the Revd.

Internally, there were two main committee rooms inside the building and a mayor's parlour equipped with a well which was used to provide water for prisoners. The design involved a broadly symmetrical frontage with five bays facing the High Street; the central bay featured a gabled doorway on the ground floor flanked by pilasters with a small rounded headed window on the first floor; the bay to the left had a tall round-headed window while the bay to the right had two smaller round-headed windows one above the other; the end bays featured smaller doorways with oculi above; a two-stage clock tower with a cupola was erected at roof level. The clock in the clock tower was donated by Edward Copleston, the Bishop of Llandaff.Notice on the face of the clock tower A war memorial commemorating local people who had died in the First World War was unveiled in front of the town hall in 1921.

A tributary of the Tuksuk Channel from the south, Bluestone is a north-flowing stream situated southeast of Teller. It was named in 1900 by Edward Chester Barnard, topographer of the United States Geological Survey. History After gold was discovered in the early summer of 1900, mining operations commenced. Gold was mined on Gold Run, Alder Creek (a Gold Run tributary), and on Bering Creek (a Right Fork tributary), while the Bluestone Placer Mine was established south of the U.S. government's Teller Reindeer Station, which had been in operation for about eight years. Settlements sprung up near and on Port Clarence, the larger being Teller, which, by autumn 1900, had a post office and a population of about 1,000. The Bluestone placer mines were located about from Teller with the trail between the two characterized as uphill, covered with moss, and \\"very poor walking for both man and beast\\". A second settlement on Port Clarence, Bering City, afforded ships closer proximity to the shore and was only from the Bluestone mines, but had only a fifth of the population of Teller, which was to the north. Placer mining operations have been noted at several locations in the river since 1969. Geography The headwaters of the Bluestone River form in a valley, where it drains the region between Grantley Harbor and the Bering Sea, an area known as the Bluestone region. The drainage is situated between the Kigluaik Mountains and Port Clarence. The area contains flat-topped hills. For about above the river's mouth, Bluestone traverses a rolling plateau with an elevation of . Here, the river valley is characterized as being broad, with flood plains measuring at least in width. Above this section of the river the valley contains a steep-walled canyon noting flat-topped mountains in height. The river's average gradient measures approximately per mile. Where the river valley broadens, it forks instead of expanding into a broad flood plain. The eastern branch, Gold Run, measures approximately in length (has the settlement at Sulivan ) and has a crooked course, traveling northwest before turning east‚Äìwest; Alder Creek is an eastern tributary (short length of ). The western split is known as Right Fork. It, too, follows a crooked course, traveling westward before turning to the east at the junction with Gold Run; Right Fork also has several tributaries. Geology The geological formations recorded in the river basin consist generally of a metapelitic sequence. Mafic intrusives have been noted in the locally metamorphosed zones. The Bluestone basin features mica and chlorite schists, beds of limestone, intrusive mafic masses altered to greenstone, and small quartz veins, particularly in the Gold Run Creek, a southern and eastern tributary of the Bluestone River. In some areas, minerals recorded are blueschist facies and retrograde greenschist facies. The geological age of these formations is conjectured as Paleozoic. Gold found on benches and in the main drainage was reported to be fine grained material and some nuggets were also recovered. The gold‚Äìbearing gravels were found to have cinnabar and platinum-group metals. Gold was also found in a tributary mining location on Skookum Creek.

Unfairness in elections encompasses all varieties of electoral fraud, voter suppression or intimidation, unbalanced campaign finance rules, and imbalanced access to the media. Unfair elections violate the right to vote, which is generally recognised as an essential element to a Deliberative democracy and representative democracy. History Although some form of elections have been held since antiquity, in every society until 1893, large number of people were excluded based on their status, particularly slaves, poor, women, people with different skin colour, and people without formal education. The first democratic election in the modern sense was the 1893 general election in New Zealand, when women won the vote at the age of 21 like men, property qualifications were scrapped, and restrictions on Maori people voting were discarded. In the United Kingdom, some form of representation in government had been guaranteed since the Magna Carta 1215, but only for a tiny elite, and potentially vetoed by the Monarch. The Monarch's power was eliminated following the Glorious Revolution 1688,See also Ashby v White (1703) 1 Sm LC (13th Edn) 253 right to vote cannot be interfered with by a public official. and then elections became progressively more democratic. As property qualifications were slowly phased out from 1832 to in 1918, women's suffrage became non-discriminatory in 1928,It was even asserted (wrongly) by one judge that it was a principle of the English constitution that women would not vote Nairn v The University Court of the University of St Andrews (1907) 15 SLT 471, 473, per Lord McLaren, it is \\"a principle of the unwritten constitutional law of this country that men only were entitled to take part in the election of representatives to Parliament.\\" and the last vestiges of double voting were abolished in 1948.See also Second Reform Act 1867 and Representation of the People Act 1883. In the United States, elections for the Federal government were administered in each of the states. Around half of all successful constitutional amendments since the Revolution of 1776 concerned elections and the franchise. Slavery was abolished in 1865, universal suffrage for men in the United States House of Representatives was achieved over 1868 and 1870, direct elections to the Senate secured in 1913, women won the vote in 1920, and poll taxes levied by the states were banned in 1964. Around continental Europe, there were different speeds of progress. France had granted universal suffrage for men after the Revolutions of 1848, but did not extend the vote to women until 1944. After the First World War in Germany, the new Weimar Republic's constitution of 1919 guaranteed universal suffrage, overhauling the German Empire's system of three voting classes that depended on wealth, and its exclusion of women. However, democracy was abolished again in 1933 by the Nazi regime until the victory of the Allies in World War II. In 1948, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights exhorted that \\"everyone has the right to take part in the government\\", that \\"the will of the people is the basis of the authority of government\\" and that \\"this will shall be expressed in periodic and genuine elections.\\" In the post war process of decolonialisation, more and more countries became independent from the crumbling European Empires, and many introduced elections of some form, though many countries' transition slid abruptly back into authoritarian regimes. The Soviet Union and countries behind the Iron Curtain had no free elections, until the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. After that a majority of countries around the world have moved toward democratic electoral systems, at least on paper. Aside from simply denying the vote by outright discrimination, or by curtailing the power of the democratically elected body, interest groups or governments seeking to usurp or hold onto power employed a variety of methods. An early case of electoral fraud was in an election to the county of Northamptonshire in England in 1768, when three earls spent more than ¬£100,000 each to buy votes from voters to win their seats.J Grego, A history of parliamentary elections and electioneering in the old days (1886) 226-28 Voter intimidation was widespread in the March 1933 German federal election, immediately before the Nazi party abolished Parliament's powers. Hitler had become Chancellor at the start of 1933 in a coalition agreement, and with control over the police, opposition party members and campaigners were beaten up and imprisoned throughout the voting process. As electoral systems became more mature, the focus of unfairness turned toward campaign finance and media bias. Almost every country in the developed world introduced limits on the amount that could be spent by any particular candidate in an election. The large exception was the United States, because a majority of judges on the US Supreme Court who were appointed by the Republican Party continued to strike down campaign finance limits as unconstitutional from 1976.Buckley v Valeo A majority of countries also have some form of media regulation, so that news coverage has to be impartial and accurate in its treatment of political issues. Regulation may also extend to who owns news and television organisations, so that the power to grant access information channels is not unduly limited.

He attended the City of London School and then Jesus College, Cambridge, where he took the classical tripos and then historical tripos. Career He spent two years at Nottingham High School for Boys. Later he joined the Board of Education in 1911 as a school inspector and later became Principal Private Secretary to the President of the Board of Education, Lord Eustace Percy. He continued in the Civil Service rising through the ranks.and remained in London during the Second World War. Part of his key work was incorporated into the 1944 Education Act working closely with R A Butler who introduced the Act in August 1944. He also developed an initiative that produced 35,000 additional teachers between 1945 and 1951, regarded as a considerable achievement. By the 1944 act the Board of Education became the Ministry of Education. It was expected that Wood would become permanent secretary, but this did not happen probably due to objections from Ellen Wilkinson, the Labour minister of education. Wood then left the ministry in 1946 succeeding Kenneth Vickers as Principal of Southampton University College. He led the University College to full university status in 1952, becoming its first Vice Chancellor. Acquisition of new buildings and equipment was a priority made difficult by considerable damage to the port of Southampton during the war. Halls of residence were provided for students and by 1952 student numbers had almost doubled. An institute of education was also established. He worked closely with Lillian Penson, Vice-Chancellor of London University, which awarded external degrees to Southampton students at the time. Wood retired as vice-chancellor but due to age at the end of the 1952 session. Personal life In 1922 he married Iris Cecilie and they had a daughter.

She served primarily in the Battle of the Atlantic as an ocean escort. She was named for Lethbridge, Alberta. Background Flower- class corvettes like Lethbridge serving with the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War were different from earlier and more traditional sail- driven corvettes. The \\"corvette\\" designation was created by the French as a class of small warships; the Royal Navy borrowed the term for a period but discontinued its use in 1877. During the hurried preparations for war in the late 1930s, Winston Churchill reactivated the corvette class, needing a name for smaller ships used in an escort capacity, in this case based on a whaling ship design. The generic name \\"flower\\" was used to designate the class of these ships, which ‚Äì in the Royal Navy ‚Äì were named after flowering plants. Corvettes commissioned by the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War were named after communities for the most part, to better represent the people who took part in building them. This idea was put forth by Admiral Percy W. Nelles. Sponsors were commonly associated with the community for which the ship was named. Royal Navy corvettes were designed as open sea escorts, while Canadian corvettes were developed for coastal auxiliary roles which was exemplified by their minesweeping gear. Eventually the Canadian corvettes would be modified to allow them to perform better on the open seas. Construction Lethbridge was ordered on 20 January 1940 as part of the 1939‚Äì1940 Flower-class building program. She was laid down by Canadian Vickers Ltd. at Montreal, Quebec on 5 August 1940 and launched on 21 November later that year. Lethbridge was commissioned 25 June 1941 at Montreal. Lethbridge had two major refits during her career. The first took place at Liverpool, Nova Scotia from 10 September until 10 October 1942. Her second refit took place at Sydney, Nova Scotia from January to March 1944. During this refit her fo'c'sle was extended. War service After arriving at Halifax on 4 July 1941, Lethbridge was briefly assigned to Sydney Force. In October 1941 she was transferred to the Newfoundland Escort Force and served with escort groups 24N, N16 and N17 during her time with them. Initially she escorted convoys from St. John's to Iceland however beginning in February 1942, the destination changed from Iceland to Derry. In June 1942 Lethbridge joined the Gulf Escort Force, escorting convoys from Quebec and Sydney. After her first refit at the end of the year, she was sent to New York to be placed under American command while escorting convoys from New York and Guantanamo. After that assignment was completed she was reassigned to the Western Local Escort Force (WLEF) in March 1943. Lethbridge remained with WLEF until the end of the war. Beginning June 1943, she was assigned to escort group W-3 and in April 1944, W-5. She remained with that group for the remainder of her service. Post-war service Lethbridge was paid off at Sorel, Quebec on 23 July 1945, after the war had ended. She was sold to Marine Industries that year. In 1952, Marine Industries resold her for conversion into a whale-catcher. In 1955 she reappeared as the Dutch-flagged Nicolas Vinke. She was later broken up in Santander, Spain in September 1966 by Recuperaciones Submarinas S.A.

The municipality is further subdivided into Districts governed by the municipal mayor (Norman Quijano as of 2012) and by a district board. There are seven districts in San Salvador, districts 1-6 and the Historic Downtown. District 1 District 1 has a total population of 118,325 as of 2009. The population is made up by 63,895 females and 54,430 males, giving the District a gender ratio of 1.17:1 (For every one male there are 1.17 females). The district is limited by the municipalities of Mejicanos, and Cuscatancingo on the north, by the Alameda Juan Pablo II on the south, on the east by the municipalities of Soyapango and Ciudad Delgado, and on the west by 25th Avenue North and 29th Street West. The District office is located on 2nd Avenue North and 23rd Street East. District 1 is home to the El Salvador National University (UES), the largest and only public university in the country, with campuses in San Salvador, and in other important cities in the country such as Santa Ana, and San Miguel. District 1 is also the home of the government center, home to the Ministry of Education, Ministry of Economy, Ministry of Governing, The Salvadorian Central Reserve, The Republic‚Äôs General Attorney, The Supreme Court, the Legislative Assembly and the Public Employee Pension Committee. Although all of the government offices are located in District One, the presidential palace is located in District 3, and the Presidential Residence is also in District 3. The National Sports Arena is located in District 1 as well. It is also home to some of the oldest San Salvador neighborhoods, such as Colonia La Rabida, Colonia Maga√±a, Colonia Layco, and others. Initially these neighborhoods were occupied by the upper middle class, but with the passage of time and the growth of the city, they are today lower middle class. District 1 is also home to the Colonia Medica or the Medical Borough, which is the largest center in the country for hospitals, clinics, and access to doctors. District 2 District 2 has a total population of 120,475 inhabitants as of 2009, making it the most populated District in San Salvador. It covers a total area of 11.16 square kilometers (4.5 square miles). The municipality is limited by, Mejicanos at north, La Mascota Creek, and The Alameda Manuel Enrique Araujo on the south, 25th Avenue North on the East, and West by the Picacho Hill. The district was originally started at the Colonia Flor Blanca and the Construction of the Metrocentro Mall in 1968, and it was not until the late 1970s when development there began in earnest. During its urbanization the district was intended to be the focal point for modernization in the municipality. Development was halted due to the civil war of the 80s, but began again as soon as the war ended in the early 90s. Today District 2 ranks as the second most important financial district of the city, and is home to mostly middle class residential neighborhoods. The district is also home to one of the largest financial centers, the CFG (Centro Financiero Gigante), which is made up of two towers and four business buildings. Major occupants of the CFG building include Tigo, Telef√≥nica, RED, Banco Azteca, Movistar, Stream Global Services, and the Israeli Embassy. District 2 is famously home to Metrocentro, the largest shopping mall in Central America, with a total of 190,000 square meters of space, and an average of 1.8 million monthly visitors, with a peak of an average 2.4 million visitors in December. The Metrocentro mall was remodeled in August 2012, and there are expansion plans for the first semester of 2013. District 2 is also home to Plaza Las Americas, or El Salvador del Mundo, as it is known locally; the plaza is located at one of the largest intersections in the city, where Paseo Escal√≥n, Constitution Boulevard, Alameda Manuel Enrique Araujo, and Roosevelt Avenue meet. The Plaza was remodeled in 2010 under the administration of Norman Quijano. Some of the largest neighborhoods in the district are Colonia Miramonte, Urbanizacion Buenos Aires, and Colonia Miralvalle. The Luis Poma Theatre is also located in District 2. Bird's-eye view of Monumento al Divino Salvador del Mundo plaza District 3 District 3 has a population of 51,325 inhabitants. Although District 2 was originally planned to be the economic center of the capital, today District 3 stands as the single most important economic and social district in San Salvador. It is bordered by Mejicanos to the north, Antiguo Cuscatl√°n to the south and the west, and by the Manuel Enrique Araujo Alameda to the East. It is currently undergoing a high-rise boom that started in 2007. District 3 is home to the World Trade Center San Salvador a complex of two 6-story buildings, a restaurant plaza (Plaza Futura), and the Torre Futura, a 99-meter (325 feet) high rise where companies such as Microsoft and Uber have offices. The World Trade Center is connected to the Crowne Plaza Hotel. Also, District 3 is home to most of the nightlife. The Escal√≥n Neighborhood holds the Galer√≠as Mall, a 5-story mall that was built around and on an old mansion and El Paseo Shopping Center, which houses mostly restaurants. There is also an endless number of restaurants located on the Paseo General Escal√≥n and in the Escal√≥n Neighborhood. The Zona Rosa and the Colonia San Benito are home to most of the embassies in San Salvador, the most expensive private bilingual schools, restaurants and international hotel chains such as Hilton Princess and Sheraton. Zona Rosa is home to apartment high rises, the most prominent ones being Alisios 115, La Capilla 525, La Capilla 515, La Capilla 370, Campestre 105 and Terra Alta. District 3 is also home to the National Anthropology Museum and the International Convention Center, the largest convention center in Central America. District 3 is composed of Colonia Escal√≥n, Colonia San Benito, Colonia Maqulishuat, and Escal√≥n Norte, which are predominantly upper and upper-middle-class neighborhoods. The Bicentennial Park on Jerusalem Avenue was inaugurated on November 5, 2011, under the first administration of mayor Norman Quijano, and it is the largest metropolitan park in Central America, with over . The district has many monuments, most notably the statue of Jesus Christ, El Salvador del Mundo, at the Plaza Las Americas. There are also many government buildings, including the Ministry of Public Works and the Ministry of Tourism, as well as the headquarters of corporations in the financial services sector, such as HSBC and AFP Crecer. District 4 District 4 has a total population of 68,465 inhabitants in an area of 12.36 km2. It borders District 2 in the north, District 5 on the east, District 3 on the West and the municipality of Antiguo Cuscatl√°n in the La Libertad Department in the South, and Southwest. District four is further subdivided into 7 neighborhoods, La Cima (I, II, III and IV), Colonia San Francisco, Lomas de Altamira and Colonia La Floresta. The district is mainly a residential district for the middle class. The most important landmark in the district is the Estadio Cuscatl√°n, with a capacity of over 45,000, is the largest soccer venue not only in Central America, but in the Caribbean as well. It was announced on November 16, 2007, that Estadio Cuscatl√°n would become the first soccer stadium in Central America and the Caribbean to have a large LED screen, on which spectators can view the action. The stadium was built in the early 1980s just before the beginning of the civil war, intended to jump-start an era of modernization in San Salvador, but development in the country ground to a halt during the twelve years of war. District 4 is also home to the Monumento Hermano Bienvenido a Casa, the monument was decorated with the artwork of the Salvadoran artist Fernando Llort. District 5 District 5 contains mostly middle-class and lower- middle-class homes, and also includes the National Zoo. The district borders San Marcos on the east. Many tourists visit this district for its eateries, particularly its numerous pupuserias, even though it has a relatively high crime rate. District 5 has many viewpoints which look out over San Salvador and other cities beyond, such as San Marcos, Mejicanos, and Ciudad Delgado. District 6 District 6, bordering Soyapango on the east and Ciudad Delgado on the north, is the smallest district in San Salvador. The neighborhood is middle-lower class, and is known to be dangerous. The most outstanding landmark is the San Jacinto Hill; the Old Presidential House was formerly located there.

It was originally known as the Home Delivery Network, until it acquired the B2B and B2C operations of DHL Express UK and thereafter, re branded itself as Yodel in May 2010. It is privately owned by the billionaire Barclay Brothers. History A Home Delivery Network lorry A Yodel delivery van in Tadcaster, North Yorkshire Home Delivery Network operated as the logistics division of Shop Direct Group, until it demerged in June 2008. It was formed by the merger of Business Express and Reality, the former Littlewoods and Shop Direct delivery companies respectively. Yodel has hubs at Shaw, Hatfield and Wednesbury. In December 2011, the London Evening Standard carried a story on reports of packages from Yodel being lost or not delivered on time for Christmas. Yodel said that there had been a great increase in December deliveries over the previous two years and that Yodel had delivered over twenty million packages that month, with 999 out of 1000 being delivered on time. In March 2012, the BBC's Watchdog consumer programme broadcast a segment highly critical of Yodel. In January 2014, Yodel was voted as the worst delivery service in the United Kingdom for the second consecutive year. BBC Watchdog says that it continued to regularly receive reports of bad service after the re branding to Yodel. In January 2014, Yodel was named the \\"worst parcel delivery firm\\" in a poll by MoneySavingExpert.com, of 9,000 people, with 78% of customers rating their experience negatively. Despite this, Yodel continues to be the delivery company of choice for many major retailers in the United Kingdom, largely due to the company's low prices. The company apologised in November 2015, after one of the firm's couriers had left a parcel on the roof of a customer's home.. In February 2016, Yodel was featured in a Dispatches investigation, which aired on Channel 4. The investigation was entitled Where's My Missing Mail?. The programme sent an undercover reporter to work at Yodel as a sorter. The investigation highlighted how parcels had been thrown onto conveyor belts and even thrown between staff members. In May 2019, Yodel announced it would spend ¬£15.2m on its fleet, to reduce the environmental impact of its delivery operations.

History =Formation= Incorporated on January 20, 1904, to succeed the Dalton Street Railway, actual construction began in Scranton on West Market Street in mid- March 1906. The approach was to incrementally build northward from Scranton to Binghamton, with the initial stretch ending in Dalton. Except for poles and power lines, the infrastructure work was largely completed a year later. After the 45-foot trolley cars from the Brill Company arrived and the power house started generating power, the first revenue car left Dalton at 5:00AM on July 1, 1907, and arrived at the terminal on Linden St. in Scranton shortly before 6:00AM. Service continued that year at 40-minute intervals in each direction. By the end of 1907, service was extended to Factoryville soon after the viaduct over the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad (DL&W;) in La Plume was installed. A highly anticipated branch to Lake Winola, built by Italian- Americans, opened Memorial Day in 1908. On April 1, 1912, the Scranton terminal moved from Linden St. to the Eagles lodge building on Wyoming Ave. During the summer of 1912, the trolley line reached Nicholson. Service commenced to Foster (also called Hop Bottom) on July 6, 1915. The final leg to Montrose was opened on August 16, 1915. The company intended to complete the line all the way to Binghamton, but those plans never materialized. Competition, primarily from increasing car and truck traffic on newly built highways, dashed that prospect. =Operations= Like other interurbans throughout the country, its heyday was in the 1910s. Passenger and freight service ran from the depot on Wyoming Ave. in Scranton, from 6:00AM until 11:00PM, every 30 minutes. Service to Lake Winola was run every 60 minutes, starting at 6:30AM, with the last return trip to Scranton leaving the lake at 10:05PM. The trip from downtown Scranton always began on the Scranton Railway line on Providence Road and N. Main Ave. until the trolleys reached Providence Square (the intersection of N. Main Ave. and West Market St.) At that point they traversed Northern Electric tracks up West Market St. to the city line. Beyond that point, it used its own private right-of-way. Electric power for the line was generated at the Brookside power plant in La Plume, near Dalton, with substations at Chinchilla and Foster. A large car barn was built next to the power plant in La Plume, and a smaller one near the substation in Chinchilla. It built two trolley parks with pavilions, roller coasters and carousels; one was in Clarks Summit, the other at Lake Winola. =Decline= Soon after the DL&W; Railroad completed the Pennsylvania Cutoff in 1915 to streamline its operations, it abandoned its old route between Clarks Summit and Hallstead. It then gave the roadbed to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for the express purpose of building a new highway. The road, called the Lackawanna Trail, was completed in June 1922 (it is today's US Route 11 between Clarks Summit and Great Bend). Since this new highway largely paralleled the route of the Northern Electric, it almost immediately began to siphon passenger and local freight traffic from the trolley line. A plan was developed to extend operations using buses in 1926. In May 1927, the company got approval for and started a small bus operation from Scranton through the Abingtons and Lake Winola to Tunkhannock, but kept the trolleys running the bulk of the operation. Scranton Mayor Jermyn threatened to shut down its trolley operation in the city several times in 1928 and 1929 due to its negligence in maintaining the tracks on West Market St. By 1930, the effects of declining ridership and the Great Depression came to a head. The trolley line was cut back from Montrose, at first to Nicholson, and then to Factoryville. The Lake Winola trolleys were completely discontinued in October, 1930, but the bus line continued to serve the area. The Brookside power plant was also sold that year to the Abington Power Company for much needed cash. By November 1930, the railroad entered receivership due to decreasing revenues, increasing maintenance costs and incompetent management. Company officials then wanted to proceed with the plan to completely replace the trolleys with buses, but it was not given license to operate the route (it went to Frank Martz Coach Company instead). Trustees planned to end operations on the line in June, 1931, and to scrap the line by October, 1931. Operations were actually suspended on July 20, 1931. The bus line stopped operating several days earlier, its buses having been repossessed by the Mack Truck Co. Before it was to be scrapped, a group of employees intervened and formed a cooperative to operate the line between Scranton and Factoryville. They began operations in mid-December 1931. =Abandonment= The City of Scranton and Commonwealth of Pennsylvania decided to begin extensive construction improvements on West Market St. to the city line in Leggett's Gap (also referred to as the Notch) in 1932. The city council insisted that the Northern Electric pay for the cost of realigning its tracks along the road, which was to be widened through the Notch. The railway cooperative could not afford the reconstruction costs and therefore could not comply. Scranton city officials then proceeded to tear up the rails and effectively blocked its trolleys from crossing the city line at Leggett's Gap on September 20, 1932. At 7:00PM the next day, the last trolley ran from the city line to Factoryville, abruptly and permanently ending 25 years of operation.

Although height is not the selling point of the tower, the tower at will be the sixth tallest tower in the world and will sport the third highest observatory in the world. Tallest towers in the world. Invisibility The tower is intended to have the ability to \\"disappear\\". The tower will have high definition cameras placed at three different levels on all six sides of the tower. The cameras will acquire real time images. These images will be processed and will be stitched into a monolithic image that will be projected by three sets of 500 rows of LED screens to the other side of the building, all in real time. Three projections at different heights on all three sections are proposed. The pitch of the LED decides the sharpness of the image - the shorter the pitch, the sharper the image will be. Different levels of illumination are used to achieve different degrees of 'invisibility'. Illustration of how the tower goes Invisible Because of the arrangement of the LED screens, the tower will appear invisible from only certain points distributed around the tower, ranging from near the tower to Seoul Bridge, about away. The screens will be so arranged that the tower will be visible from high altitudes, such as to airplanes and birds.

In addition to these primary routes, Montana has a large number of state highways and smaller secondary routes. Speed limits on these roads are generally posted up to 70 mph (113 km/h) along rural areas. =Vehicles= Vehicles themselves in Montana are required to display a Montana licence plate on the back and front by the Department of Motor Vehicles. Eight different primary plate designs have been issued since drivers were required to register their cars in 1913. Mass transit =Bus= The public transportation system in Montana is sparse as a whole, but several individual cities have local bus networks. Intercity bus service Across Montana, the bus network does not have a large amount of intercity routes but Greyhound Lines goes to 20 cities including Helena, Sidney and Bozeman, connecting passengers with journey frequencies of between once to five times per day. Essex Montana Rail Link freight haulage in 2005 Local bus service Some individual cities have their own bus network provided by a transit corporation. Missoula is served by ASUM Transportation and Mountain Line; The Mountain Line public transit system runs twelve services around the city and the University of Montana. It is indirectly controlled by the local government which have appointed members onto the board of the transportation district. Billings is served by MET Transit and Great Falls by Great Falls Transit. All four agencies run routes with fairly frequent schedules allowing commuters quick movement around different areas of the cities. =Railroads= Historically, the state was traversed by the main lines of east to west transcontinental routes: the Milwaukee Road, the Great Northern and the Northern Pacific. All passenger rail in Montana is provided by Amtrak. Twelve stations exist within the state. All along the line Empire Builder, they serve communities along the most northern section of Montana which carries on out either side into Idaho and North Dakota.

Origin It is believed that the invention apam balik or ÊõºÁÖéÁ≤ø is related to General Tso, who was a Chinese statesman and military leader of the late Qing dynasty.http://www.dartmouth.edu/~qing/WEB/TSO_TSUNG-T'ANG.html In 1855, the army of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom invaded the Fujian region and General Tso was appointed to lead an army to crush the rebels. To provide the soldiers with food without interfering the life of local people, General Tso decided to switch from the flatbread which was eaten together with spring onion and chilli sauce, to the pancake that used locally-sourced and mass-produced ground cane sugar and peanut as filling. The recipe for the pancake was spread throughout the Fujian region, especially in places around Quanzhou and later on throughout the whole Southeast China. It was also brought into countries in Southeast Asia by the Chinese Hokkien immigrants.https://web.archive.org/web/20141220061848/http://www.renminbao.info/305/15782.htm  Other names  The dessert is also known by various names in different languages, depending on the region. =Indonesia= More recent Indonesian terang bulan with various toppings. * Terang Bulan, (lit.:\\"bright moon\\") refer to the big round pancake, prior to folding, resembling the shape of a full moon, (in most of Indonesia) * Martabak Manis, lit: sweet murtabak (in Jakarta, Bandung including their surrounding areas; South Sumatra); * Kue Bandung (in Semarang, Central Java and its surrounding areas) * Martabak Bangka (in Medan, North Sumatra and its surrounding areas) *Apam Pinang (in West Kalimantan) * Hok Lo Pan (in Bangka); =Malaysia and Singapore= * Ban Jian Kueh (Hokkien) * Min Chiang Kueh (Mandarin, in Johor and Singapore) * Dai Gau Min (Cantonese, in Perak) * Chin Loong Pau (Cantonese, in Kuala Lumpur/Selangor) * Kap Biang (Hakka, in Sabah) * Apam Pulau Pinang (Malay, in Penang); * Kuih Haji (Malay, in certain areas) * Apong (Kelantan) * Peanut Pancake (Singapore) =Brunei= * Kuih Malaya (Malay, in Brunei), named after the place where it came from when it was still known as Malaya. =Hong Kong= * ÂÜ∑Á≥ï (Cantonese) * Á†ÇÁ≥ñÂ§æÈ§Ö (Cantonese) =Taiwan= * ÊõºÁÖéÁ≤ø (Hokkien) * È∫•‰ªîÁÖé (Hokkien) Description The pancake's batter is made from a mixture of flour, eggs, sugar, baking soda, coconut milk and water. The batter is cooked upon a thick round iron frying pan in plenty of palm margarine to avoid it sticking to the pan. Then other ingredients are sprinkled as filling; the most common or traditional is crushed peanut granules with sugar and sweetcorn kernels (available from cans), but modern innovations such as chocolate sprinkles and cheddar cheese are also available. Then, the pancake is folded (hence the name: \\"turnover pancake\\") and cut into several pieces. In Indonesia there is a smaller version made with smaller pan, they are called martabak mini or terang bulan mini. The texture of the apam balik can vary depending on the amount of batter and type of pan used, from one that is akin to a crispier form of crumpets to small thin light pancake shells that break when bitten (the latter is usually called apam balik nipis, 'thin apam balik'). There is a Peranakan variant, the apom balik, that closely resembles the Indonesian Serabi.

Located at 3 Church Street, it is situated just next to the Prudential Tower. It is a 30-storey office building development, which includes a 6-storey podium block on a plot of land. The development is a freehold Grade A office tower.  History  Samsung Hub was completed in 2005. Firms involved in the development included Chinese Chamber Realty Private Limited, Church Street Properties Private Limited, China Square Holdings Private Limited, CapitaLand Limited, and Samsung Corporation. It was formerly owned by CapitaLand, but the company soon sold the development to Ho Bee Group. The space in Samsung Hub is owned by the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry, its subsidiary, the Chinese Chamber Realty, and OCBC Bank. = Selling of stake = In 2007, CapitaLand announced that it was selling its stake in Samsung Hub to the Ho Bee Group for over $140 million. This works out to almost $1,400 per square foot, based on the net lettable area of about involved in the transaction. The space owned by CapitaLand comprises the lowest stack of office floors in the building - from the eighth to 15th floors (the first to seventh floors are used for car parking).  Architecture  AWP Pte Ltd were the Architects of the building. Due to its recent completion in 2005, the building exhibits a post-modern style of architecture, and is built mainly of glass and steel. Usage of quality building materials, such as the heat-strengthened, double-glazed and turquoise-tinted glass was applied during its construction. The light, elegant structure and luminous curtain wall system creates a modern distinct and deliberate contrast with its monolithic neighbours of glass and granite. The average size per floor plate of the building is about and it has a total lettable area of .  Tilting incident  On August 2002, a tilt on the building was detected by Samsung Corporation. The building sank 3 mm to 39 mm to one side between August and November 2002. Although this 0.1 degree tilt, caused by soil settlement, was minimal compared to 4 degrees for the Leaning Tower of Pisa, it could have adversely affected the building's structural stability, resulting in cracks or severe damage had it not been corrected. After discovering the tilt, Samsung immediately initiated rectification efforts. Micropiles were injected to redistribute the weight of the building and to correct the tilt. Owners of neighbouring buildings reassured tenants that their buildings were structurally sound, free from such problems, having been certified by the authorities as fit for occupation. It took a total of 2 years for the rectification work to be completed. Losses due to the construction delay were ameliorated by an agreement between the companies involved, ceding Samsung a portion of the space in the 30-storey tower. Samsung also made \\"improvements\\" to the building's facade.

It was a based upon the successful Remington Model 1875 and the lesser known Model 1888 with both revolvers having the same size, appearance, and the removable cylinder. The 1890 Remington single-actions kept the solid frame and similar styling of the 1875 model, but lacking the large web under the ejector rod housing and equipped with checkered rubber grips. Like the 1875 model, the 1890 was suitably made for metallic cartridges, but only issued in .44-40 caliber.  Overview  Remington entered the cartridge revolver market in 1875 when it introduced a big-frame, army-style revolver, a six-shooter to compete with the Colt Peacemaker. Ordinary citizens and Old West lawmen alike recognized the sturdy quality of the new Remington revolvers.Uberti Remingtons Changes made to the 1890 were an attempt to make it more similar to the competing Colt single-action pistols of the era. After the production of a few Model 1888 transition revolvers with -inch barrel, called the \\"New Model Pocket Army\\", Remington began production of the Model 1890 Single Action Army revolver. It was manufactured between 1890 and 1896 in very small numbers. It is one of the most sought-after of Remington handguns. Standard barrel length was inches or inches. Of the 2,020 produced, a handful of Remington 1890s saw service as side arms by Indian police on Western reservations.  Remington Model 1888 (transitional) single-action Army revolver  An intermediate (transitional) model of cartridge revolver was introduced in 1888 called the \\"New Model Pocket Army\\". Made in 1888 and 1889 only, total production was less than 1,000 units, made primarily with parts from 1875s and duplicate \\"batch/serial\\" numbers exist; however, assembly numbers were added and none have been found over the low 300s range. Nearly all are nickel, with less than a handful known manufactured in blue. Visually it is identical to the Model 1890, with the exception of the address on top of barrel. The caliber of the model was .44-40, with the left grip on many marked \\"44\\" or \\"44W\\". In a dealer catalog, the barrel is listed at inches, but examples have been found with -inch barrels. The ejector housing is visually identical to the Model 1890. New York sporting arms dealers Hartley and Graham assumed control of the E. Remington & Sons and renamed the company to Remington Arms Company in 1888, and it is possible that this model was assembled exclusively for them.  Modern reproduction  The Uberti 1890 revolvers are reproductions (but not exact copies) of the famous old Remington revolver, but chambered for more modern smokeless powder cartridges as the .357 Magnum. So, while it looks and feels like an old-west \\"cowboy\\" gun, it has metallurgy common to more modern revolvers. Like all weapons, the Uberti 1890 must be taken apart periodically for cleaning. Because it is a revolver with so few moving parts, however, disassembly in this case is limited to simply removing the cylinder from the main revolver body.

The era of the steam warship powered exclusively by coal was relatively brief, lasting from 1871 until 1914. Although the French ironclad Gloire and the iron hulled in 1860 both had funnels, the purpose was to provide additional speed in battle. Sails provided the main propulsion the rest of the time so, unlike , the first ship built without sails, these were not true steamships. Although much faster than sail the lengthy refueling or coaling required by steam ships brought considerable additional risk to the ship and hardship to the crew leading to the replacement of coal by oil. The fuel itself also required maintenance. Coal cannot be pumped and once loaded, it had to be continuously moved to ensure bunkers nearest the boilers were always full should full power be suddenly needed. These problems were sufficiently serious for the Royal Navy to build as an oil-fired ship despite the abundance of coal and shortage of oil in the United Kingdom. Necessity of nearby friendly ports HMS Majestic (1895) at a coaling station The replacement of sailing ships with steam led to a requirement for fuel to be widely available. Coaling a warship was a much hated, dirty and unavoidable task normally carried out in port with a collier alongside, during which time the ship was unable to fight and vulnerable to attack. Once coaling had started it continued day and night until complete. The denial of port facilities to the Russian Baltic Fleet, forcing them to overload themselves with coal, played a part in their defeat at Tsushima in 1905. Commander Semenoff describes the problems facing the fleet required to sail around the world with very few friendly coaling ports. His ship, the Borodino-class battleship Knyaz Suvorov, found all neutral ports closed, leaving it the choice of either coaling at anchor 3 miles of the coast‚Äîregarded as very risky or even impossible even in good weather‚Äîor carrying additional fuel. The Borodino class battleships‚Äîalready 2.5 ft lower in the water than designed and a cause for concern even carrying their designed maximum 1100 tonnes‚Äîtook on a total 2200 tonnes of coal. They even used the main deck and were regarded as potentially at risk of capsizing in a strong wind. The Suvorov coaled in 29 hours in tropical heat, the sailors keeping cotton wool between their teeth to avoid inhaling coal dust. Even so, Semenoff reckoned no-one could work for more than 20 minutes in the conditions. Vulnerability Warships caught coaling were stationary targets operating without power and the British battlecruisers in the Falklands in 1914 were fortunate that Admiral Von Spee missed a \\"golden opportunity\\" to attack them. United States Navy procedures The call to \\"Rig ship for coaling!\\" was an unwelcome announcement of a day of backbreaking work shoveling coal into canvas bags aboard a collier, hoisting those bags onto the warship, dumping the bags near the coal bunkers, and shoveling the coal into those bunkers. The following day was spent cleaning the warship of the black coal dust which had penetrated every crevice and corner of the ship including their living quarters and food supplies. Removing the coal dust clinging to their perspiring skin after coaling required each man to bathe sitting balanced atop the single bucket of fresh water he had been issued for the purpose. There were no showers. The deck was covered with nude sailors trying to avoid overturning his bucket while carefully washing himself over his individual bucket so the water flowing off his torso and extremities returned to the bucket for re-use. A shipmate might be asked to scrub another's back. Need for ship design changes In 1908, Rear Admiral Sir Christopher Cradock declared that expeditious coaling was essential for the efficiency of the Navy and lamented the fact that dockyards still hadn't changed ship design specifically to facilitate it. Noting that \\"the question of rapid coaling appears to me to have never been really studied, and even now it is in its infancy,\\" he said no detail should be left untouched to ensure completion in the quickest possible manner. Every single officer and man that can be spared, should get into the collier to dig out the coal. Other recommendations were that coaling was always done from the same side, that this was kept free of obstructions and that marks were made on the refueling collier so that it was easy to align the two ships in the best position. Using these techniques, the battleship broke records receiving 1180 tons at 289.2 tons an hour.  Provision of coal supplies  In Britain, the Severn Tunnel was constructed primarily to shorten communications between the South Wales coalfield and its high quality steam coal, down to the Royal Navy dockyards around Portsmouth. Work on the tunnel began in 1873 but, owing to problems with unexpected flooding, was not completed until 1886.

During the war he joined the Royal Observer Corps from 1939 to 1945. In 1941 Gray was hired as a stills photographer on Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger's One of Our Aircraft is Missing and a selection of these photographs was used to promote the film in Britain and America.

Preceded by the most well-preserved early stave church discovered in Sweden, the current church dates mainly from the 13th century. It contains sets of medieval murals as well as some medieval furnishings. It is part of the Diocese of Visby (Church of Sweden). History View of the interior towards the choir The current stone church in Hemse dates mainly from the 13th century. However, about a century earlier there was a stave church built at the same location. The surprisingly well-preserved stave church was found by chance under the floor of the stone church during a restoration in 1896, where the wooden planks of the church had served as an earlier floor. The wooden church, known as Hemse stave church, is the most well-preserved early stave church found in Sweden. There have been plans to erect a replica of the church somewhere near its original location. The stave church was probably replaced by the presently visible Romanesque stone church as it became too small for the congregation. The nave and choir were built first, and somewhat later the tower was added. During the aforementioned restoration the church was rather insensitively restored inside. A later restoration was carried out in 1962-63. Architecture The church is a relatively homogeneous Romanesque edifice. Inside, it is decorated by medieval murals. The oldest of these are in the tower, and depict centaurs assaulting the tree of life. Under it are two inscriptions in Latin. In the choir and the apse are depictions of the Last Judgment dating from the 14th century and in the nave, murals from the middle of the 15th century depicting the Passion of Christ and two saints: Saint George and the Dragon and Saint Martin. There is also a rune inscription on the western wall of the choir, a repetition of the futhark or runic \\"alphabet\\". Among the furnishings, the triumphal cross from the end of the 12th century is noteworthy. The baptismal font has a Romanesque foot but a later (14th century) basin.

Japan has always been drawn to California pop culture, especially lowrider car culture, and started exporting lowriders and Cal-Style VWs from Los Angeles during this time. Today the Los Angeles lowrider-influenced Cal-Style of vintage Volkswagens is very popular in Brazil, Belgium, Germany, England, Mexico, and Japan. Clubs today like The German Folks C.C., with chapters all over the world, and the Brazilian Folks, are dedicated to this style of building vintage Volkswagens. Specifications A Cal-Style VW was an all original VW, typically painted in factory colors; two tones were a no-no unless the vehicle left the factory that way. The vehicle was lowered all the way around, and it had all the chrome trim, bumpers, and subtle chrome lowrider-influenced accessories ‚Äì these were not restorations because the VWs were only 15 years old and did not need restorations yet. In the pioneer years of 1978‚Äì1984 when this style originated the Cal-Style VWs were never called the media-dubbed \\"Resto Cal\\", a term used by media outsiders today and is frowned upon by Cal- Style purists and originators. The Cal-Styles' lowrider details were highly influenced by the 1930s' and 1940s' lowrider \\"bombas\\" that the Cal-Stylers saw while growing up in their LA Latino neighborhoods. Wheels of choice for Cal- Style VWs were the rare 901 Porsche Fuchs alloys, Porsche Cookie Cutter Alloy and the 5-spoke EMPIs. Unlike the Orange County-originated de-chromed Cal-Look VW, the LA Cal-Style vintage VW was about style, and the wheels were fully polished or chromed for \\"bling\\". Chrome period-correct lowrider-influenced accessories like chrome vent wing shades, window rain guards, chrome knuckle guards, blue dot tail lenses, chrome headlight visors, chrome gravel guards and rear window venetian blinds were some of the Cal-Style cues that were adopted from the 1930s and 1940s Chevy ‚ÄúBombs‚Äù.

He was rated by Rivals.com and Scout.com as the No. 1 running back in the country and by Rivals.com as the No. 8 overall player in the Class of 2013. He played for the Michigan Wolverines football team from 2013 to 2015, gaining 898 yards and scoring seven touchdowns on 212 rushing carries. In January 2016, Michigan granted a transfer release to Green, allowing him to play for another program after graduating in the spring of 2016. High school career Green was born in February 1994 and grew up in Richmond, Virginia. He played high school football at Hermitage High School. He began his football career as a \\"chunky high school freshman\\" and a 268-pound, 5 foot, 8 inch lineman. Over the next two years, he shed more than 50 pounds working on his diet along with his parents, Chris and Fran Green. By his junior year in 2011, Green had become one of the leading running backs in the country, rushing for over 1,500 yards and 20 touchdowns. Interviewed by ESPN in May 2012, Green described his running style as follows: > \\"I was always downhill. If you look at my film, I'm not really a bounce guy. > I'm a one-cut-and-go, real straight, north-south runner and I have the speed > to kick it up in sixth gear. All that bouncing and shaking, I wouldn't say > that was me. If you're in the way, I'm going to blow you up. I'm not going > to try to shake you. At my school, they call me 'The Freight Train.' I like > that a lot. I'm going to run you over and let you know I'm here. I'm > coming.\\" As a senior, he rushed for 1,350 yards and 21 touchdowns. Recruiting Green was one of the most highly recruited players in the Class of 2013 ‚Äì the group of players graduating high school and entering college in the year 2013. Green was rated by Rivals.com and Scout.com as the No. 1 running back in the country and by Rivals.com as the No. 8 overall player in the Class of 2013. Rival.com recruiting analyst Josh Helmholt described Green as \\"a downhill runner, a between-the-tackles guy.\\"> In July 2012, Green attended The Opening (Nike Combine) in Beaverton, Oregon. By that time, he had received scholarship offers from 40 universities and had narrowed his list to 13 schools: Tennessee, Michigan, Oregon, Ohio State, Ole Miss, Virginia Tech, Auburn, Clemson, Alabama, Miami, Pitt, Oklahoma State and Oklahoma. In mid-January 2013, Green announced that he had narrowed his choice to three schools ‚Äì Auburn, Michigan and Tennessee. When Green called a press conference in late January 2013, it was web cast live by the Richmond Times-Dispatch. At the press conference, Green announced that he had verbally committed to play for the University of Michigan. He initially reached for a Michigan hat, then a Tennessee hat, and finally flipped a switch which prompted a screen to reveal a Michigan Wolverines football jersey. University of Michigan Green was the highest-rated running back signed by Michigan since 2006. Tom Luginbill on ESPN called Green's commitment \\"a defining moment for Michigan,\\" noting that he \\"fits with what Brady Hoke and the staff want not only the identity of the offense to be but the identity of their program ‚Äì physical, grind it out, pound away at you over the course of four quarters, wear you down. Derrick Green can wear down an opponent. He is physical. He's explosive. ... This is a guy they can build what they want their offense to be about.\\" =2013 season= In the weeks leading up to the 2013 season, ESPN rated Green as one of its five Big Ten Conference first-year players to watch, one its Top 10 future college football stars, and the running back on its pre-season freshman All-American team. Commentator Phil Steele even picked Green as his pre-season All-Big Ten running back. Others raised doubts as to whether Michigan head coach Brady Hoke would bench veteran Fitzgerald Toussaint in order to get Green into the lineup. During pre-season practice in August 2013, Green reported to camp at 240 pounds, raising questions about a 20-pound weight gain since his senior season in high school. Running backs coach Fred Jackson predicted he would be down to 230 pounds by the time the season started. Jackson dismissed concerns about Green's weight: \\"He's going to be as advertised. ... He's a big guy. Look at him from the back and the side, he's a huge human being.\\" After being held out of practice for a week following an undisclosed injury, Green found himself in competition with Fitzgerald Toussaint for the role as Michigan's No. 1 running back. Michigan offensive coordinator Al Borges described his approach to using Green: \\"Teach him the run game and then teach him the pass game in pieces so you can then be functional as you go. You can play a freshman running back as long as you don't inundate him with so much information that it becomes disinformation, you know. But I've had a bunch of tailbacks come in and play as freshmen and didn't give them too much. But by the fifth, sixth game of the season, they could handle all of it. Very few could handle it in game one.\\" =2014 season= Prior to the start of the 2014 season, Green was in competition with De'Veon Smith to become the Wolverines' starter at running back. In the opening game of the 2014 season, a 52‚Äì14 victory over Appalachian State, Green carried the ball 15 times for 170 yards, an average of 11.3 yards per carry. He also scored a touchdown and had a career-long run of 62 yards. De'Veon Smith also rushed for 115 yards in the game, as Green and Smith became the first pair of Michigan running backs to rush for over 100 yards in the same game since 2007. During the second week of the 2014 season, Green was held to 25 yards on 13 carries (1.9 yards per carry) in a 31‚Äì0 loss to Notre Dame. He rebounded in the third week of the season with 137 yards and two touchdowns on 22 carries (6.2 yards per carry) in a 34‚Äì10 victory over Miami (Ohio). On October 4, 2014, in a game against Rutgers, Green broke his clavicle in the fourth quarter. =2015 season= In 12 games during the 2015 season, Green had 47 carries for 157 yards and two touchdowns. On January 15, 2016, Michigan announced that it had granted a transfer release to Green, allowing him to play for another program after graduating in the spring of 2016. =2016 season= Green announced he was transferring from Michigan for the 2016 season.

Cradling is a process used in the restoration and preservation of paintings on wooden panel. It consists in mounting a grid of wooden slats to the back of a painting to create a reinforcement and preserve the flat paint surface. Slats in either the horizontal or vertical direction are permanently fixed to the back of the panel, whilst the secondary perpendicular slats remain loose, held solely in place by the upper row. This allows for a degree of movement in the panel, which may warp, subject to changing levels of dampness and atmospheric pressure. This procedure can often be found on Old Master paintings of the 16th and 17th centuries, when painting on wood and particularly oak panel was widely practiced. There are numerous reasons for choosing to cradle a panel. This can be done to piece back together a painting which has split and cracked over time. It can also be done to consolidate, preserve or straighten back a panel which may have warped. There are detrimental factors to consider before cradling a painting. It is an interventive procedure which may involve sanding the back of the panel in order to create a flat surface to affix the cradling. It is a non reversible procedure which alters the condition and state of a work of art, which triggers ethical issues. With many cradled paintings the sliding cradle members will get stuck due to the movement of the panel. This leads to much tension and cracks in the panel and permanent deformation. Applying a cradle to the back of a panel painting almost always leads to more severe structural problems depending on the climate in which the painting is kept and the way the planks of the panel were saw. Nowadays, in the modern world of conservation cradling a painting has been outdated and subject to criticism. Duke University and The University of Brussels have developed an art conservation tool that uses X-rays and algorithms to analyze the paintings. To better image the art piece, for it is of wood sections (cradles) the machine called Platypus or the computer math program sorts out the wood and finely visualizes the original art.

It flows through the Shuswap Highland region north of Kamloops. Its name in Secwepemcts√≠n is StÃÅyelltsecw√©tkwe. Name origin In 1828 Hudson's Bay Company fur trader Archibald McDonald named the mouth of the river barri√®re because rocks there were an impediment to navigation. Another possibility is that the name relates to fish traps placed across the river by the Secwepemc people. Course The Barri√®re River originates near Vavenby Mountain in the Shuswap Highland, south of Vavenby. It flows south into Saskum Lake, then continues south for some distance. It turns west and is joined by Fennell Creek. Bear Creek joins from the north just before the Barri√®re River empties into North Barri√®re Lake. Vermelin Creek and Harper Creek empty into the lake from the north. The Barri√®re River flows from the west end of the lake, turning south as numerous tributaries join, such as Birk Creek, Mack Creek, Slate Creek, and Sprague Creek. The East Barri√®re River then joins from the east and the Barri√®re River turns to flow west. The East Barri√®re River originates near the north end of Adams Lake and flows generally east, through East Barri√®re Lake before joining the main Barri√®re River. After its confluence with the East Barri√®re the main Barri√®re River flows west and southwest, between Barri√®re Mountain on the south and Mount Borthwick and Garrison Mountain on the north. It is joined by Leonie Creek just north of the town of Barriere. The river flows through the town and by the Simpcw North Thompson Indian Band \\"Barriere River 3A\\" Indian Reserve before emptying into the North Thompson River.Course information in part from History The Barri√®re River is part of the traditional lands of the Simpcw people, or \\"People of the North Thompson River\\", a division of the Secwepemc people. In the early 19th century the Barri√®re River was often difficult to cross by fur traders travelling the Hudson's Bay Brigade Trail between Alexandria and Kamloops. The trail ran along the east bank of the North Thompson River and required crossing the Barri√®re River.

La Stella made the Cubs' Opening Day roster, but only played in two games before straining his right oblique on April 10, 2015. While rehabilitating at the minor league level with the Tennessee Smokies, La Stella suffered another oblique strain. He came off the disabled list in August, and was sent to the Iowa Cubs of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League. On August 24, he was recalled from Iowa and rejoined the major league club. In limited time with Chicago, La Stella was used mainly as a pinch hitter, a role in which he excelled. To increase his versatility, La Stella began playing third base during the regular season. In 33 games, La Stella hit .269/.324/.403, and started at third base during the National League Wild Card Game against the Pittsburgh Pirates. After batting .295 for the Cubs in 2016, the Cubs optioned La Stella to Iowa on July 29, but he did not immediately report. The Cubs put La Stella on the temporarily inactive list. He agreed to report to Tennessee on August 17. Upon being recalled on August 31, La Stella stated that his refusal to report to the minors stemmed mainly from a lack of enjoyment for the game at the time of his demotion. In 74 games of the 2016 season, La Stella finished by batting .270/.357/.405 with two home runs and 11 RBIs. The Cubs won the 2016 World Series. La Stella had one at bat during the 2016 postseason.

On August 31, his 21st pinch-hit of the season, a single in the seventh inning in a game against the Philadelphia Phillies, broke the Cub record for pinch hits in a season previously shared by Thad Bosley and Dave Clark. The previous evening, La Stella had tied the record with a 2 run go-ahead home run against the Atlanta Braves. For the 2018 season, he batted .266/.340/.331 with one home run and 19 RBIs in 169 at bats. =Los Angeles Angels (2019‚Äì2020)= On November 29, 2018, the Cubs traded La Stella to the Los Angeles Angels for future considerations.

The Chaco brand also provides a variety of outdoor-influenced fashion sandals, shoes, flip-flops, boots and accessories. The flagship line of adjustable outdoor sandals are distinguished by the fact that they use a single strap which loops around the foot through the sole, and so can be adjusted to fit without any extra fastenings. They are available with a range of sole types and strap configurations, to suit various environments, and the company offers a repair service. History Mark Paigen was a white water rafting and fly fishing guide, and in 1989 he decided to create an outdoor sandal that allowed his feet to dry in the sun so he wouldn't end his days with wrinkled feet. His goal was to produce a sandal that also provided support to the foot. He created a pair of custom sandals that included a continuous pull-through strap of synthetic material and a buckle instead of velcro. The first pair of shoes was sold to a client who accompanied Paigen on a 3-day float. Paigen traced that person's feet on paper and built a custom pair for $30. By 1991, after making the shoes in a spare room in his house, Paigen began selling his products in a small shop in Glenwood Springs, Colorado. Customer feedback led Paigen to consult a pedorthist to improve the overall design of the shoe. After multiple changes, the sandal was ready to be put on the market. He decided to name the first sandal \\"Z/1\\" because his friend used a cheesy French accent and told him that the sandals were \\"Zee One!\\" The name had started as Gecko when the company first formed. They changed their name to Chaco, to be named after the Chaco Culture National Historical Park. A factory was established in the village of Paonia, Colorado, USA. In following years the products gained an international reputation and market. In 2008 the Paonia factory closed and production was moved to China. In 2009, the brand was acquired by Wolverine World Wide, the company that also owns Sperry Top-Sider, Merrell, and a variety of other footwear brands, and the Chaco facilities moved to the Wolverine base in Rockford, Michigan.  Philanthropy  = River Protection = Chaco is focused on the protection of rivers and riverside lands throughout the United States because rivers are the reason the sandals are being made today. Chaco has donated $10,000 to river protection organization American Rivers for its 5,000 Miles of Wild campaign, which aims to protect 5,000 new miles of rivers in the United States. = Bear Ears National Monument = After the suggestion was made to shrink Utah's Bear Ears National Monument, the Chaco company began to fight against the changes. Chaco created a limited-edition version of the Z/Sandal with 100 percent of the net proceeds being given to a pair of non-profit organizations that fight to protect the monument. This launch was a success. Paigen actually tested his first pair of sandals in what is now Bear Ears National Monument, so it hits close to home.

The shock had a surface wave magnitude of 6.5 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of VII (Very strong), killing 16 people and injuring 47. Seven towns were damaged, several buildings collapsed, and electricity was cut off in Laoag. Features like sand volcanoes and cracks formed during the quake.  Damage and casualties  The earthquake struck at 8:18 PM and surface wave magnitude of 6.5. It was the most powerful earthquake to strike the Philippines in seven years. Shaking lasted 20 seconds and damaged seven towns extensively, its greatest damage occurring near Pasuquin, Laoag, Sarrat, and Batac in the Ilocos Norte province. Early reports claimed that 17 were killed and 80 were injured, but these numbers were later revised to 16 and 47, respectively. A four-storey building collapsed, and the salesmen inside waited as long as 17 hours to be rescued; one man was rescued only to die in the hospital. Two or three other buildings also collapsed, including one filled with people in San Nicolas. Churches were damaged in Bacarra, Vintar, and Sarrat; the Sarrat church was the site of the wedding of Ferdinand Marcos' daughter Irene, and it toppled, destroying its altar and the orchestra loft from the wedding. A 300-year-old statue of Saint Monica fell apart, and its head landed on the ground intact. Electricity was cut off in Laoag, and downed a bridge elsewhere. Sand volcanoes and cracks as long as formed, and as it ruptured, soil liquefaction and landslides occurred. A tsunami was reported but never confirmed. Tremors also extended to Manila.  Geology  The earthquake occurred exactly seven years after the 1976 Moro Gulf earthquake, which measured 7.9 Ms and caused about 8000 deaths. PAGASA listed its magnitude at 5.7, but the United States Geological Survey still lists it at 6.5. It was assigned a Rossi‚ÄìForel scale rating of VII (Very strong tremor), indicating the potential to be damaging.  Aftermath  In the destroyed church in Bacarra, church members wrote notes asking God for forgiveness and believing it was his warning. Reports from Manila's radio stations claimed many casualties, and a news agency reported that there were at least 100 people trapped in a downed building. The wrecks of collapsed buildings were searched, and the dead were removed from the rubble. There were two aftershocks following the main shock.

He was the namesake of the Lex Arons, a law which disallowed members of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (, SPD) to teach at Prussian universities.  Life and work  Leo Arons came from a wealthy Jewish banking family in Berlin. His parents were Albert Arons (1826-1897), a partner in the prestigious private banking house Gebr√ºder Arons, and Clara Goldschmidt (1837-1867). In 1887 Leo Arons married Johanna Bleichr√∂der (1861-1938), a daughter of the banker Julius Bleichr√∂der (1828-1907). Arons' brother, the banker Paul Arons (1861-1932), married Johanna's sister Gertrude (1865-1917) a few years later. After taking his Abitur, Leo Arons studied chemistry and physics, earning a doctorate degree in Strasbourg in 1888. As a scientist he worked in the area of experimental physics. He developed the mercury vapor lamp (also called \\"Arons' tube\\"), which was later marketed by AEG as \\"Dr. Arons' mercury vapor lamp\\". In 1890 he became a Privatdozent at the Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universit√§t Berlin (now Humboldt University of Berlin). A year later he became the First Assistant in the Physics department, but resigned from this position in 1893. After that, he again worked as a Privatdozent. Via the land reform movement Arons came into contact with the SPD, which he joined in the early 1890s after some hesitation. As a member of the bourgeoisie he had particular reservations about the class struggle advocated by the party. The party's commitment to achieve its goals through legal means facilitated his entry. He subsequently wrote several articles for the party press. Within the party, he was on the reformists' side. He demanded the SPD's participation in the Prussian state elections and became an expert on the Prussian three-class franchise system. Since the 1890s he also attempted to unite middle-class social reformers and social democrats by organizing regular informal meetings, the Schmalzstullenclub (\\"Lard Bread Club\\"). He was a leading participant in the organization of the SPD's campaign for the general election of 1903. The press sometimes referred to him as the \\"Chief of Staff of the party for the election campaign.\\" From 1904 to 1914 Arons was a member of the Berlin City Council. His candidacy for the post of alderman failed, however. Besides the party Arons also supported free trade unions and the building association \\"Ideal\\", founded in 1907. Arons financed the first union hall in Berlin from his own assets, and small apartments for workers in conjunction with Ideal. From 1908, he increasingly withdrew from political life due to health reasons. He was a representative in the Berlin district of Neuk√∂lln, where the Aronsstra√üe was named after him in 1973 (called Leo-Arons-Stra√üe from 1926 and 1934, and Sackf√ºhrerdamm from 1934 to 1973).  Lex Arons  Soon after Arons became a member of the Social Democratic Party, Prussian authorities sought to remove him from his teaching post. The university department responsible for carrying out this procedure objected to this request several times. A majority of the conservative members defended the autonomy of the university against state regulations. Their argument was that university teachers were free in their political beliefs and also that a Privatdozent was not subject to state discipline. As Arons spoke at the Social Democratic Party's congress in 1897, Kaiser Wilhelm II said, \\"I will not tolerate Socialists as ... the teachers of our youth at the Royal universities.\\" This royal declaration pressured the Prussian government and the reluctant official responsible for higher education, Friedrich Althoff, to bring about a solution. Since the government had no right to directly intervene in the appointment of lecturers, a law was passed in 1898 that made a lecturer subject to state disciplinary authority. Since this law was tailored especially for Arons' case, it is called the \\"Lex Arons\\". This law was one of the attempts in the 1890s to prevent the further advancement of the Social Democrats with exceptional laws. The Lex Arons was only one of these laws that passed the parliamentary hurdle of the Prussian House of Representatives; the Revolution Bill (1894) and the Jail Bill (1899) failed to find majorities in the Reichstag. Arons was suspended on the basis of the Lex Arons. Due to fear of clashes with the concerned departments, Arons' was the only case in which the law was used. In public, and especially in the scientific community, the law sparked debates about the freedom of science. Immediately after the November Revolution, Arons was rehabilitated by the new government shortly before his death.  References  * * Thomas Nipperdey: Deutsche Geschichte 1866‚Äì1918.

Birman (born November 18, 1955) is a professor in the Department of Computer Science at Cornell University.  Research and publications  Birman's research is mainly concerned with scalability of distributed systems, security technologies, and system management tools employed in cloud computing. An ACM Fellow and IEEE Fellow, Birman was Editor in Chief of ACM Transactions on Computer Systems from 1993-1998. He is also the author of several books, most recently Reliable Distributed Computing: Technologies, Web Services, and Applications, published by Springer-Verlag in May 2007.  Virtual Synchrony, Derecho, and the Isis Toolkit  He is best known for developing the Isis Toolkit, which introduced the virtual synchrony execution model for multicast communication. Birman founded Isis Distributed Systems to commercialize this software, which was used by stock exchanges, for air traffic control, and in factory automation. The Isis software operated the New York and Swiss Stock Exchanges for more than a decade, and continues to be actively used in the French air traffic control system and the US Navy AEGIS warship. The technology permits distributed systems to automatically adapt themselves when failures or other disruptions occur, to securely share keys and security policy data, and to replicate critical services so that availability can be maintained even while some system components are down. Birman's research group at Cornell has created a series of open-source systems. Most recent among these is Derecho, a C++ library that provides Paxos in a form particularly well suited to modern datacenter networks, which run at very high speeds and can have extremely low node-to-node latencies. In such systems, it is important to adopt a protocol design that streams data as asynchronously as possible, and Derecho is unusual among data replication options in this respect: it uses a new \\"receiver-driven opportunistic batching\\" approach, whereby senders rarely need to pause when streaming high volume data.

A train wheel or rail wheel is a type of wheel specially designed for use on railway tracks. A rolling component is typically pushed onto an axle and mounted directly on a railway carriage or locomotive, or indirectly on a bogie (in the UK), also called a truck (in North America). Wheels are cast or forged and are heat-treated to have a specific hardness. New wheels are trued, using a lathe, to a specific profile before being pressed onto an axle. All wheel profiles must be regularly checked to ensure proper interaction between the wheel and the rail. Incorrectly trued, or worn out wheels can increase rolling resistance, reduce energy efficiency and may even cause a derailment. A railroad wheel typically consists of two main parts: the wheel itself, and the tire (or tyre in British English) around the outside. A rail tire is usually made from steel, and is typically heated and pushed onto the wheel, where it remains firmly as it shrinks and cools. Monobloc wheels do not have encircling tires, while resilient rail wheels have a resilient material, such as rubber, between the wheel and tire. Wheel geometry and flange Railway wheel flange (left) Tram wheel flange (right) Most train wheels have a conical geometry, which is the primary means of keeping the train's motion aligned with the track. Train wheels have a flange on one side to keep the wheels, and hence the train, running on the rails when the limits of the geometry-based alignment are reached, e.g. due to some emergency or defect. See Hunting oscillation. Some wheels have a cylindrical geometry, where flanges are essential to keep the train on the rail track. Wheel arrangement Wheels for road-rail vehicles The small rail wheels fitted to road-rail vehicles allow them to be stored away when the vehicle is in road-going mode. Wheels used for road-rail vehicles are normally smaller than those found on other types of rolling stock (such as locomotives or carriages). This is because the wheel has to be stored clear of the ground when the vehicle is in road-going mode - Such wheels can be as small as in diameter. In Australia, wheels for road-rail vehicles should comply with the requirements of AS7514.4, which is the standard for infrastructure maintenance vehicle wheels. Tire The wheels of many rail vehicles, especially steam locomotives and older types of rolling stock, are fitted with steel tires (or tyres in British English, Australian English and others) to provide a replaceable wearing element on a costly wheel. Tire installation Steel tire on a steam locomotive's driving wheel is heated with gas flames to expand and loosen it so it may be slipped over the wheel. Replacing a whole wheel because of a worn contact surface is expensive, so older types of railway wheels were fitted with replaceable steel tires. The tire is a hoop of steel that is fitted around the steel wheel centre. The tire is machined with a shoulder on its outer face to locate it on the wheel centre, and a groove on the inside diameter of the flange face. The inside diameter of the tire is machined to be slightly less than the diameter of the wheel centre on which it is mounted, to give an interference fit. The tire is fitted by heating to a controlled temperature, avoiding overheating. This causes the tire to expand. The wheel centre, usually already mounted on the axle, is lowered into the tire which is flange-side-up. The tire cools, and the retaining ring (a shaped steel bar rolled into a hoop) is fitted into the groove. Hydraulically operated rolls swage the groove down onto the retaining ring. The tire is primarily held in place by its interference fit. The shoulder on the outside and the retaining ring also keep the tire in place if the interference fit is lost. This is most often due to severe drag braking down a gradient, or due to an error in the machining. Removal of a worn tire is by machining out the retaining ring and heating the tire to relax the interference fit. Some steam locomotive wheels had tires bolted through the rim, or with a second smaller shoulder machined on the inside face of the tire. This shoulder was severely limited in size as it had to pass over the wheel centre for assembly. Tires of different designs were fitted to wheels with wooden centers (Mansell wheels in the UK) and to various other types. The use of tires is becoming obsolete. The utilisation of traditional freight wagons was often so low that tires never needed renewal, so it was cheaper to fit a one-piece (\\"monoblock\\") wheel. Monoblock wheels are lighter and offer better integrity as there is no tire to come loose. Modern flow-line repair lines are disrupted by the inspection of the wheel centre once the tire is removed, possibly generating extra rectification work, and the need to make each tire fit its allocated wheel centre. Monoblock wheels are now more economical. Causes of damage The most usual cause of damage is drag braking on severe gradients. Because the brake blocks apply directly on the tire, it is heated up, relaxing the interference fit. It is not feasible to fit the tire with such a heavy interference as to eliminate this risk entirely, and the retaining ring will ensure that the tire can only rotate on the wheel center, maintaining its alignment. In rare instances the rotation could be so severe as to wear the retaining ring down till it breaks, which could result in derailment. Severe braking or low adhesion may stop the rotation of the wheels while the vehicle is still moving, which can cause a flat spot on the tire and localized heat damage to the tire material. Tires are reasonably thick, about , giving plenty of room for wear. Worn tires or tires with flats are re-profiled on a wheel lathe if there is sufficient thickness of material remaining.

Education has also been identified as a social vaccine against contracting HIV. Research suggests a negative linear relationship between educational attainment (years of education) and HIV infection rate, especially the educational attainment of women and girls. The United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) aims to ensure all individuals, in and out of formal education, have access to comprehensive HIV education. UNESCO is a founding cosponsor of UNAIDS, and in conjunction with partner agencies UNESCO published the International Technical Guidance on Sexuality Education in 2018. This report provides evidence-based guidelines for developing and implementing comprehensive sexuality education curriculum for young people.  Availability of HIV/AIDS information  Education is a strong factor in improving population health by building in individuals the capacity to process and understand risks related to the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Poor information hinders individuals from analyzing their behavioural choices by masking potential health risks. Inadequate information becomes a risk factor for the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. The mischaracterization of HIV/AIDS as a homosexual disease has led higher status heterosexuals that participate in risky sexual behaviour to continue without considering the risk of infection. Data analysis collected in Sydney, Australia in 2007 found that within 236 adults, age 20 to 65, respondents were concerned about risks of HIV/AIDS transmitted through casual contact, leading to disapproval of homosexuality and drug use. In contrast, highly educated respondents were shown to be less likely to overestimate the possibility of HIV transmission through casual contact compared to respondents with a lower level education. In a 2011 study, 1 in 4 students aged 16 and above in England stated they had learned nothing about HIV/AIDS in school, even though learning about sexually transmitted diseases is compulsory for secondary school students in England and Wales. Attitudinal changes and education = Stigma = Stigma associated with those who have HIV/AIDS in Sub-Saharan Africa prevents many from getting tested. As formal education continues to change attitudes towards those living with HIV/AIDS, the reduction of stigma enhances prevention techniques. A 2016 study in primarily African-American faith-based organizations in South Carolina, United States found that education level was associated with lower levels of stigmatizing attitudes about HIV/AIDS. = Self-efficacy = A 2020 systematic review showed that financial education increased self-efficacy and lowered vulnerability to HIV in young people in low and middle income countries. In many of the studies in the review, financial education was combined with sexual health education and/or counselling. Impact on infection rate and other outcomes = Infection rate = In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the introduction of partially accurate information in Sub- Saharan Africa led to a decline in HIV rates among more educated, suggesting they may have the greater cognitive skill required to sift through the various levels of accuracy and mount a more effective response. Increased motivation needed to analyze personal risks and behavioural choices were increased by cognitive abilities enhanced by formal education, suggesting a direct correlation. A 2018 analysis of data from over 500,000 people in sub-Saharan Africa showed that secondary school completion for women was correlated with a lower likelihood of being HIV positive. However, primary school completion alone, without subsequent secondary school completion, is associated with a higher risk of being HIV positive than not completing primary school. This finding applies to both men and women. A 2018 review of studies on sub-Saharan Africa found evidence that support for girls' and young women's schooling is associated with lower rates of HIV infection. Types of support include cash transfers to families, educational support (such as school fees paid on student's behalf), savings accounts and microcredit, and vocational training. = HIV test uptake = In Zambia, a 2018 study of over 15,000 women of childbearing age found a strong correlation between educational attainment and uptake of HIV testing. Similar findings were reported in a 2020 study of 2660 women in Ghana. = Medication efficacy and mortality = A study of nearly 25,000 European patients who started combined antiretroviral treatment (cART) between 1996-2013 found that patients with fewer years of education had poorer responses to cART and lower survival. Critique Studies of the effectiveness of HIV education programs often rely on self-reported information about knowledge and behavior, leading to a possible social desirability bias if subjects report what they think the interviewer wants to think.The World Bank: Knowledge, Attitudes, and Behavior Related To HIV/AIDS Among Transport Sector Workers: A Case Study of Georgia. Encouraging Kenyan students to write essays on way of protecting oneself against HIV/AIDS led to increased self-reported use of condoms without an increase in self-reported sexual activity. There is no evidence to determine whether an increase in condom use by students corresponds to actual reduction in HIV/AIDS. Early research in Sub-Saharan Africa identified formal education as a risk factor, with more educated individuals being most likely to be infected. By the mid-1990s, education began to shift from risk factor to social vaccine. Some studies have found that educational attainment decreases girls' and women's vulnerability to HIV/AIDS, but does not affect or even worsens boys' and men's risk.

It offers grants to farmers to help develop environmentally sustainable farming methods that limit the contamination of nearby bodies of water. From January to July 2013, over ¬£11 million worth of grants had been issued. In addition to funding, Natural England offers free advice, farm inspections, and training programs to farmers.  Catchment Sensitive Farming  The goal of Catchment Sensitive Farming (CSF) is ultimately to improve the environmental impacts that farms have on our Planet. Farmers are advised by the CSF project, where they use trained, experienced staff to teach farmers about the methods that can be used. Farmers are taught about the following subjects: manure management, nutrient management, soil condition, pesticide management, and farm infrastructure. Catchment Sensitive Farming has teamed with four different organizations to help farmers: The Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board, the Professional Nutrient Management Group, The Rivers Trust, and The Voluntary Initiative. = The Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board = The Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board discusses soil management to increase productivity as well as decrease farming‚Äôs impact on the environment. If soil structure is sub-par, then crop growth is sub-par, and soil loss will enter rivers and streams polluting the environment. For proper management of soil these steps are necessary to take-assess the soil, soil sample, cultivation to improve soil, and protect the environment. To assess the soil health, and structure a soil pit is dug. Once the soil pit is dug the soil is sampled and analyzed. Information is collected in regards to nutrient content and pH of the soil, and micro nutrients are examined by broad spectrum analysis. The third step, cultivation and rotating the soil improves both soil structure and health. During cultivation and rotation the farmer‚Äôs must be educated on visual signs of compaction, and know when to cultivate arable soil. The final step for soil management according to The Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board is to minimize farmer‚Äôs impact ‚Äì reduce and prevent runoff through the use of banks, buffer strips and tramline management.  Victoria, Australia  In 2009, there was a study conducted on the effects of tillage on soil and water. The results showed the some farmers have on the environment. They found phosphorus and nitrogen levels were higher in cropped areas. This was because minimal tillage and full stubble retention increases nutrient concentrations in soil, this leads to run off, and leads further to increases in higher concentrations of nutrients filtering into water supplies. After the study, the results showed that the best method for farmers to use is a method of direct drilling combined with stubble retention in higher rainfall zones to better retain the nutrients rather than run off into the water supply = Professional Nutrient Management Group = Professional Nutrient Management Group provides assistance to farmers in regards to improving nutrient management through tools and resources. The management group known as Tried & Tested has a toolkit with nutrient, manure, and feed planning guidance. Inside this toolkit one would find a booklet with step by step how to farm, recording forms for comparison of fertiliser, a nutrient management glossary with all the terms, and planning/recording sheets for use of organic manures. The goal of this booklet is to explain nutrient management goals, help the individual farmer create a plan, show the farmer the most important questions that should be understood, explain how to calculate how much fertiliser is necessary, and help farmers understand how they are benefiting. = The Rivers Trust = The Rivers Trust and Catchment Sensitive Farming created Pinpoint to reduce water pollution created from farming. Pinpoint supplies training, and support to keep farmers up to date and informed on the methods for sustainability. They have a number of courses on the process of how to diffuse water pollution from our environment and agriculture, and courses on educating farmers on sediment- related problems. The Rivers Trust focuses heavily on why it is important to reduce diffuse water pollution from agriculture. Diffuse water pollution is created from many sources making it difficult to track. Run off has many sources like transportation, urban living, remnants of contaminated land; nutrients; pesticides, and sediment created by farmers. To best reduce diffuse water pollution from agriculture, farmers must be educated. Small steps can lead to a huge impact like moving their gate entrance to prevent field erosion, or separating clean and dirty water. = The Voluntary Initiative = The Voluntary Initiative works towards promoting safe Pesticide use. It is important when using pesticides to plan ahead, ensure proper application time, ensure proper application, and clean up properly. To plan ahead farmers should avoid erosion and run off, be certain to use pesticides from a trusted source, and be certain to fill pesticides away from drains and waterways. To ensure proper timing according to the Voluntary Initiative the sprayer should be checked for leaks on a regular basis, do not apply pesticides to dry cracked surfaces and saturated soils, and don‚Äôt spray within 48 hours of rainfall. This specifically allows for easier transportation of the pesticides into the water supply. To ensure proper application of pesticides avoid spills and splashes when filling the sprayer, make sure no pesticides get into the water supply, clean up any spills, and apply with care. The final step is to clean up when finished with the application. Spray wash on the crop and target area when finished, and clean off any mud or surfaces that could have come into contact with the pesticides before leaving the target area.

It is commonly found in Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei. The mold each has two plates that are clasped tightly together and attached to long handles for manipulating over a charcoal stove. The molds could be plainly flat, corrugated or etched with animal motifs such as fish, roosters and snails that are both auspicious and decorative.

Both semprong and sepit are known as almost identical wafers, with the different only in its shape; the roll-shaped is called semprong, while the triangular-folded shape is called sepit. Both variants are called as sapit or sepit in Malaysia and Brunei, regardless of its shape. Traditional kue semprong are hollow, the new variants however, might add fillings, such as chocolate or cheese. History and origin The kue semprong demonstrate colonial link between Indonesia and the Netherlands, as it commonly found in most of major cities in Indonesia.

Originally delivered to the Oregon Steamship Company, she was used on the Portland, Oregon-to-San Francisco, California route for many years. In 1879, the Oregon Railroad and Navigation Company became the Oregon‚Ä≤s new owners after purchasing the Oregon Steamship Company. Also included in this purchase were the steamships George W. Elder and City of Chester. While in O.R. & N service, Oregon served alongside SS Columbia, which made the first commercial use of Thomas Edison's incandescent light bulb.Jehl, Francis Menlo Park reminiscences : written in Edison's restored Menlo Park laboratory, Henry Ford Museum and Greenfield Village, Whitefish, Mass, Kessinger Publishing, 1 July 2002, page 564 Like Oregon, Columbia was also built by John Roach & Sons in Chester, Pennsylvania.Belyk, Robert C. Great Shipwrecks of the Pacific Coast. New York: Wiley, 2001. Print. Over time, Oregon's hull became breached after a number of incidents. Furthermore, the hull had been weighted with concrete to the point where she was considered unsuitable for service as a passenger liner. After operating as a cargo ship, she was laid up in 1894 at Portland. In 1899, the Oregon was re-qualified to carry passengers once more. She was sold by O.R. & N the same year.\\"May run to Cape Nome - San Francisco Call, Volume 86, Number 161\\". Archive. California Digital Newspaper Collection. 8 November 1899. p. 9. Retrieved 22 August 2013. Despite this, she was viewed as a cursed ship by her crew. On 26 December, 1899 she sank () in a collision in snow in the Columbia River at Coffee Rock 47 miles above Astoria, Oregon. Two of Clan McKenzie's crew killed, one injured. Her bow was damaged and she drifted ashore, later pulled off. The steamship appears as docked In Alaska at the time for the 1900 census.https://archive.org/details/soundex1900ak001/page/n2027/mode/1up The Oregon was owned by the White Star Steamship Company (not to be confused with the White Star Line) from around 1902 to 1905 . Around this time, Oregon was operating between Alaska and Puget Sound. On September 13, 1906, Oregon ran aground on the rocky shoreline of Cape Hinchinbrook, Alaska. At the time, there was no active lighthouse at Cape Hinchinbrook, although one was under construction. It is unknown whether poor navigation or reduced visibility caused the wreck. Shortly after the collision, the bottom of the vessel tore open and water began flooding the ship. Oregon became stuck on the rocks without any barrier from the open sea. After crew members began boarding the lifeboats without orders, Captain Horace E. Soule threatened to shoot any man attempting to steal one. This led to the crew obeying all further orders and a small party was sent off in a lifeboat to report the disaster in Valdez, Alaska. When the report of Oregon‚Ä≤s wreck reached Valdez, many ships set out to rescue the passengers and crew. Remarkably, all 110 remaining people on board the Oregon were rescued by the revenue cutter . Oregon however, was reported as a total loss.

His formal stylized name was √ári Maharaja Rake Sirikan √ßri Kame√ßvara Sakalabhuvanatustikarana Sarvanivaryyaviryya Parakrama Digjayottunggadeva. The Lanchana (royal seal) of his reign was a skull with a crescent moon called chandrakapala, the symbol of Shiva. Tradition mentioned King Kameshwara as a man of prowess and a strikingly handsome man. His name derived from Kama-ishvara, another name of Kamadeva, the Hindu god of love and desire. His queen consort √ári Kirana was also mentioned as a woman with extraordinary beauty. Kameshvara was the prince of Kediri, while √ári Kirana was the princess of Kahuripan. The royal marriage between Kameshwara and Kirana was celebrated as the reunification of Java, between Kediri (Panjalu) and Kahuripan (Janggala), marking the reunification of former Airlangga's kingdom. In 1130 Kameshwara was succeeded by his son, Jayabaya. In Smaradhana and Panji cycles During his reign, Mpu Dharmaja composed an adoration epic poem Smaradhana, in which the king was adored as the incarnation of Kamajaya, the god of love, and his capital city Dahana was admired throughout the known world. Kame√ßvara's wife, √ári Kirana, was celebrated as the incarnation of Kamaratih, goddess of love and passion. The story of royal couple has inspired the famous tales of love and adventure known as Panji cycle. Kameshwara was mentioned as Raden Inu (Hino) Kertapati, while his consort Sri Kirana was mentioned as Dewi Sekartaji. However, in this tales the kingdoms was curiously switched from the historical figure, Kirana was mentioned as the princess of Kediri, while Inu Kertapati was mentioned as the prince of Kahuripan (Koripan). The Panji tales spread throughout Southeast Asia as far as Siam as the tales of prince Inao or Egnao.  References  * Soekmono, R, Drs., Pengantar Sejarah Kebudayaan Indonesia 2, 2nd ed.

Early years A native of New Orleans, Richardson attended L. B. Landry High School in Algiers as a freshman on the junior varsity team. Richardson left New Orleans with his parents, Albert Joseph and Anita Richardson, during Hurricane Katrina in 2005.

It was in use from the beginning of the 16th or 17th century until 1966. History Established by Sephardic Jews during the Ottoman period, it also became the burial ground for Ashkenazi Jews after they arrived in Sarajevo with the Austro-Hungarian Empire in the late 19th century. It contains more than 3850 tombstones and covers an area of 31160 square meters. It has four monuments dedicated to the victims of fascism: a Sephardi one designed by Jahiel Finci and erected in 1952, two Ashkenazi ones, and one dedicated to the victims of Ustasha militants. =During war of the 1990s= The Jewish Cemetery was on the front line during the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and was used as an artillery position by Bosnian Serbs.

There had been some small square rooms, with door cases of good freestone: the rest of the building is of rough stone, cemented with clay. This place was probably ruined by fire: for I observed some melted lead, mixed with charcoal and several pieces of vitrified stuff. There is no history relative to it. It must be very antient, for on the top is the stool of a vast oak. The base of the rock is surrounded with a ditch, cut through it, leaving only a narrow pass to the fort.

This house was placed on a ridge of high ground, with views over Shropshire to the east and Montgomeryshire to the west. This house was modified in the mid 18th by the Earl of Hereford, but shortly afterwards the Earls fell on hard times and the House was let to a succession of tenants, one of whom was Sir James Bland Burges, the M P for Helston, in, Cornwall, who lived there between 1785 and 1789Peters, T. The Madness of King George III; Revelations by James Bland Burges of Nantcribba, Montgomeryshire, ‚Äò‚ÄòMontgomeryshire Collections‚Äô‚Äô, 97, (2009) 63-71 Eventually in 1863, the House and surrounding lands were sold to John Naylor, a Liverpool banker, who had already purchased two other Montgomeryshire estates: Brynllywarch in Kerry and Leighton Hall. It was probably at this time that the frontage of the house was lowered and altered. The house was largely destroyed in 1899 when the family who were living in it were at a ball in Welshpool.T Lloyd, Lost Houses of Wales, 2nd ed 1989, 36 The house, now known as Parklands, has subsequently been re-built, incorporating part of the stable block, while some of the walled garden survives. The Development of the Nantcribba Estate by the Naylors Nantcribba Model Farm and Farmhouse When the estate was acquired by John Naylor in 1863, he used the firm of architects Poundley and Walker, who worked from offices at Brynllywarch, Kerry, to design a new Model Farm and Farmhouse, a gatehouse on the B 4388 Montgomery to Forden Road and worker‚Äôs housing on the A490, Forden to Churchstoke Road.Naylor Estate maps and papers in the National Library of Wales. Particularly relevant is the survey by Poundley in the Harrison Mss, Vol 1(WlAbNL)004509315 The single-story gatehouse is in a whitish brick often used by the architect, David Walker, while the other buildings are in a reddish brick, some with stone rustication and Cefn stone facings which are typical of Poundley and Walker.J D K Lloyd, John Wilkes Poundley: A Montgomeryshire Architect, ‚Äò‚ÄòMontgomeryshire Collections‚Äô‚Äô 65, 1977,47-56 The model farm is laid out on the typical grid plan adopted by Poundley, and an axial row of buildings, which would have contained a drive shaft to provide a power source to adjacent yards. The layout is basically symmetrical, with a 2-storey central spine range running NE - SW, of approximately 12m span, containing the main straw barn, having 2-storey cross ranges of 6.5m span, 14 roof bays each side, set 2/3rds of the length to the SW, from which 2 single storey ranges spring at right angles, each with 7 open arches, and terminating in pens each with a small yard. The single storey ranges form 2 stock yards each side of the SW end of the barn range, designed for beef cattle. The spine barn range has 14 tensioned queen post-and-collar trusses NE of the cross range junction, and the cross ranges have haunched king posts and angled strut trusses. The large stockyard in the northern angle is paved with large stone sets, and is defined by a 7-bay carthouse on cast iron columns on its NE side, with a wide 6-roof-bay granary over. At right angles to the NW cross range, the large stock yard is enclosed by a further range, with stables for brood mares on the inner (yard) side, and for stallions on the outer face. The corresponding E angle contains the rick yard. Tall round-arched openings give access to the enclosed paved N yard, with similar arches forming a cross space in the great barn range. Access doors to the feeding walks are framed and battened, with some recessed ironmongery, and windows are of part louvred. The cattle yards between the SW wings are enclosed by stone coped brick walls. A stone shield with initials and date on the SW gable of the barn, and some bricks are impressed JN1874 for John Naylor. The lack of farm buildings on the NE sector, suggests that the layout was not completed. The effluent flow away to a very large holding tank beyond the SE end of the cross range, with distribution pipes leading to the fields, similar to the system used at Leighton.http://www.herwales.co.uk/her/hotlinks/listbuild/html/lb19566.htm The buildings are in the course of conversion into a housing scheme of 26 residential dwellings.Smith, C E , 2013 , Nantcribbau Farm, Forden, Powys, Archaeological Desk Based Assessment & Building Recording http://www.cofiadurcahcymru.org.uk/arch/cpat/english/cpat_interface.html References Category:Townships in Montgomeryshire ","title":"Nantcribba"},{"id":"40271312","text":"The Compagnie des forges et aci√©ries de la marine et d'Hom√©court (FAMH) (Company of marine forges and steelworks and of Hom√©court) was a French industrial enterprise that made iron and steel products for the French navy, army and railroads. It is often known as Saint-Chamond from its main location in Saint-Chamond, Loire. Origins In 1815 James Jackson, a manufacturer from Birmingham, England, set a steelworks near Saint-√âtienne at Trablaine. Jackson returned to England around 1823. His sons, naturalized Frenchmen, established an important steelworks at Assailly in 1830. In 1837 H. P√©tin and J. M. Gaudet, mechanics and forgers, set up shops at Saint-Chamond and Rive- de-Gier. In 1841 P√©tin et Gaudet introduced one of the first steam hammers at their works. Later they introduced innovations such as a mobile crane for moving large pieces around the works, and a hydraulic press. Starting in 1771 the Neyrand brothers became owners of several coal mines and ironworks in the valley of the Gier river. The company of Neyrand fr√®res et Thiolli√®re was formed in January 1845 to exploit an enlarged and modernized factory at Lorette. The partnership of Parent, Schaken, Goldsmid et Cie was formed on 28 February 1854 to acquire and exploit the forges of the Vierzon company located at Vierzon, Clavi√®res, Reblay, Bonneau and Courban√ßon. These four companies became one on 14 November 1854 when Jackson Fr√®res and P√©tin et Gaudet merged and combined with Neyrand-Thiolli√®re, Bergeron et Cie of Lorette, and Parent, Schaken, Goldsmid et Cie of Paris. The new company was called the Compagnie des Hauts-fourneaux, forges et aci√©ries de la Marine et des chemins de fer. The company, which engaged in extracting, processing and selling iron and coal was initially based in Rive-de-Gier. On 9 November 1871 it moved its headquarters to Saint-Chamond and became a limited company. The factories were mainly concentrated in the Loire basin, in Saint-Chamond and Assailly. Early years Share of the Comp. des Forges et Aci√©ries de la Marine et d'Hom√©court SA, issued 12. November 1915 Pre-1914 postcard of the works at Saint-Chamond, Loire In 1874 the Company was struggling in a difficult economy. Pierre de Montgolfier-Verpilleux was named general director. Montgolfier remained head of the company for most of the rest of his life. When he took office in 1874 the annual sales turnover was 20 million francs, and at the end of his tenure in 1908 it had risen to 80 million francs. He paid particular attention to the works at Saint-Chamond and Assailly, where he developed the special fabrications that brought fame to the factories. At Saint-Chamond he built a forge that could make 80-ton ingots, and he installed a great steam hammer with a 100-ton ram. He developed arms manufacture at Saint-Chamond, and also delivered large quantities of rails to major French railroad companies. In 1881 he founded the Forges du Boucau near Bayonne. The factory at Boucau in the Hautes-Pyr√©n√©es was created when the Midi rail network decided to replace its iron rails with steel. Between 1887 and 1890 he built huge workshops which, among other products, made most of the land turrets that armed the eastern fortresses of France, and provided turrets to various foreign powers, particularly Romania. The forges also produced train shields and marine turrets. In 1903 the company moved into the east and north when it acquired the assets of the Vezin-Aulnoye company, which included factories at Hom√©court in Meurthe-et-Moselle and iron mines at Hautmont in the north. The name was changed to Compagnie des forges et aci√©ries de la Marine et d'Hom√©court. World War I The Saint-Chamond (tank) showing the overhanging front hull and the later M.1897 75 mm field gun During World War I (1914-1918) the company built several different types of weapons, notably the Saint Chamond- Mondrag√≥n 75 mm gun which had been designed mostly by colonel Rimailho, the Saint-Chamond tank and the deficient Chauchat machine rifle. They also produced naval guns, such as the quadruple gun turret design for the unfinished s. Later mergers Destruction of the factories in 1985 In 1932 the company purchased the Neyrand et Cie company with a plant at Onzion, Loire. The company went through major changes after World War II (1939-1945). In 1950 the properties in the east and north were transferred to the Lorraine company SIDELOR, and the company returned to its focus in the Loire region. In 1952 it merged with the Compagnie des Aci√©ries de Saint-√âtienne to form the Compagnie des Forges et Aci√©ries de la Marine et Saint-√âtienne. In 1954 the company became a holding company, combining its industrial operations with the √âtablissements Jacob Holtzer and Usine de la Loire des Aci√©ries et Forges de Firminy to create the Compagnie des Ateliers et Forges de la Loire (CAFL). The company went through further transformations in 1961 by merging with Firminy, which had also become a holding company, to form the Compagnie des forges et aci√©ries de la Marine, Firminy et Saint Etienne. This became Marine-Firminy in 1968. That year SNCF Class A1AA1A 68000 production was over, and that signified the end of locomotive production of the company. In March 1970 the latter company merged with to form Creusot-Loire holding. 1973 oil embargo caused a steel crisis, and in 1974 French government nationalized the steel industry.http://www.wendelgroup.com/en/300-years-of-history_16.html Marine- Wendel was created by acquiring most of the industrial and commercial interests of the Lorraine company.

He is known for his work on the synthesis of novel materials of interest to several areas of physics and many interdisciplinary sciences. Biography Theodore Geballe was born and brought up in a Jewish family in San Francisco, California. His grandfather left the Province of Posen in Prussia to move to the United States in about 1870. He attended the Galileo High School in San Francisco, graduating in 1937. Geballe then travelled across San Francisco Bay to attend college at the University of California, Berkeley. While still an undergraduate student at Berkeley, Geballe worked in William Giauque's lab to accurately measure the specific heat of gold. In 1941, Geballe was called to active duty as an Army Ordnance Officer during the Second World War. Geballe served in Australia, New Guinea and the Philippines and was responsible for maintaining guns. After the war, Geballe returned to Berkeley as a graduate student of Giauque, receiving his PhD in chemistry in 1949 - the same year that Giauque won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. In 1952, he moved to Bell Labs in Murray Hill, New Jersey. While at Bell labs, he worked on studying transport properties in semiconductors at very low temperatures, and also on studying properties of unconventional superconductors. In 1967, Geballe joined Stanford University as a professor in the newly founded Department of Applied Physics as well as the Department of Materials Science and Engineering. Geballe was involved in research in the then-upcoming field of multilayered heterostructure materials. Geballe served as the head of the Department of Applied Physics at Stanford from 1975-1977, and was the director of the Center for Materials Research from 1978-1988. In January 2020, Geballe's 100th birthday was marked by a celebratory conference.Geballe's 100th birthday celebrations Awards and honours Geballe, along with Bernd Matthias won the 1970 Oliver E. Buckley Condensed Matter Prize awarded by the American Physical Society \\"for experiments that challenged theoretical understanding and opened up the technology of high-field superconductors.\\" Geballe also won the 1991 von Hippel award by the Materials Research Society, and was made a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1973. In 1989, he received the Bernd T. Matthias Prize. In 2000, the new Laboratory for Advanced Materials at Stanford was named \\"The Theodore H. Geballe Laboratory for Advanced Materials\\" in his honor. Personal life Geballe was married to Frances Koshland (1921‚Äì2019)Frances Geballe obituary, daughter of Daniel E.

The building is surrounded by a wire fence due to its dilapidation. The Queen Elizabeth Planetarium or Queen Planetarium is a former planetarium located in Coronation Park in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. It was the first planetarium in Canada, operating between 1960 and 1983. Designed by Walter Tefler and R. F. Duke, it was named to commemorate the visit of Elizabeth II in 1959. History In 1958 a proposal was put before Edmonton City Council to build a permanent civic memorial to mark the visit of Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip in July 1959. Originally there were three projects proposed on a 30.8 metre (94 foot) trilon, a three- sided equilateral prism, which would symbolize the three levels of government. Its likely design would have been as a three-sided obelisk, however, no plans or drawings were able to be located on the proposed structure. Another suggestion was a fountain, and the park itself. Alderman Frederick John Mitchell proposed that an observatory be added onto the list, which seems to have been at the expense of the latter two options, as neither of these items was mentioned again in subsequent documents. A third option was conceived of by S. Frank Page (Assistant Secretary and editor of Stardust, the newsletter of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada - Edmonton Centre) in approximately November 1958, when he suggested that a planetarium be constructed as he anticipated that city lights would interfere with an observatory. The planetarium project proposal was supported by the City Council in December 1959 and passed the Financial Committee in March 1959. In July of that year the Queen visited the site during her tour. A committee was formed consisting of Professor E. S. Keeping, Professor Gads, Franklin Loehde, F. Jersen, D. Rosenfield, and Earl Milton to put together a proposal for submission to the City Council. On December 21, 1959, H. J. McKim Ross of the Montgomery Branch of the Royal Canadian Legion made a motion that was passed unanimously supporting the project in principle. In March 1959 the planetarium proposal passed the hurdle of the finance committee with an estimated cost of $110,000. On Monday March 9, 1959 the proposal to construct a planetarium in Coronation Park was approved by City Council by a margin of seven to four. During the Queen's visit in July 1959 Mayor William Hawrelak made the following dedication speech in Coronation Park: ‚ÄúYour most gracious Majesty, we most humbly pray that you may be pleased to be assured of the sincere and enduring loyalty of the people of the City of Edmonton. Your devoted subjects desire respectfully to extend to your Majesty and to His Royal Highness Prince Philip, a most cordial and enthusiastic welcome to Coronation Park. ‚ÄúYou have now set foot on an area of Canadian soil that was named in honour of your coronation as Queen and Sovereign of the British Empire. ‚ÄúWe trust that the character of the welcome the citizens of Edmonton extend to you here will be in keeping with the spirit of your visit. ‚ÄúIn commemoration of this royal visit in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-nine, it is the wish of your loyal and devoted people to erect a building of masonry, brick, and stone at this location. A structure that will serve during the years ahead as a practical and pleasurable monument to perpetuate the memory of this great occasion. The aesthetic value of this Planetarium will soon give the development of the Canadian parkland, an additional beauty dedicated to the welfare and convenience of our citizens. May it always be in keeping with the spirit in which you come to us, friendly, warm hearted and sincere. ‚ÄúWe respectfully request of your Majesty‚Äôs permission to name this building The Queen Planetarium. In your presence today we humbly demonstrate our allegiance, our gratitude and our affection.‚Äù The official opening ceremonies were held on Thursday September 22, 1960. Mayor Elmer Ernest Roper dedicated the building, and a message of congratulations from the Queen's Secretary was read by Chief Justice C. J. Forward of the Alberta Supreme Court. Professor E. S. Keeping represented the University of Alberta and presented a sixty-eight pound fragment of the Bruderheim meteorite to the planetarium. The fragment was made the centre piece of the building's astronomical display. Also present was James Harrington of Leduc, Alberta, then president of the Edmonton Centre of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada. The first Director of the Planetarium was Ian McLennan, a member of the Edmonton Centre of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada. He served in this position from August 22, 1960 to October 31, 1965 when he moved on to become the director of Strasenburgh Planetarium in Rochester, New York. With the opening of the Queen Planetarium on September 22, 1960 it became the first such public facility in Canada. The second public planetarium on Canadian soil was opened February 11, 1966 in Montreal. During McLennan's directorship much of the work at the planetarium was done by volunteers of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada. Eventually though a full-time lecturer and receptionist had to be hired. McLennan was succeeded in his position by David Rodgers who took over on November 1, 1965; his short term of office lasted until July 31, 1966 when he was appointed as Director of the H. R. MacMillan Planetarium in Vancouver, British Columbia. During Rodgers‚Äô directorship the planetarium produced its most successful shows. The popularity of this attraction can be seen in the fact that the 25,000th person saw a show on July 4, 1966. In 1967 an attendance record of 33,500 was reached. Shortly thereafter the staff position of technician was added. The person hired for this position was William Cable. The next director was William Cable, who took over on August 2, 1967. During Cable's directorship the involvement of the Edmonton Centre of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada was reduced considerably. In addition attendance dropped from the 33,000 in 1967 to 12,500 in 1972. Cable left the planetarium in 1972. John Hault took over as director on January 5, 1973 and remained in the position until the planetarium closed on December 31, 1983. He then moved on to become the director of the Edmonton Space Sciences Centre (now Telus World of Science Edmonton). Gibbins, Howard. 2004. \\"Application to Amend The Register of Historic Resources in Edmonton.\\" Current status The Queen Elizabeth II Planetarium was designed to be the main focal point of Coronation Park. At the time of its construction, and for a few years afterward the planetarium was the only structure in Coronation Park. Coronation Pool was started in 1967 as a Centennial project and was opened in 1970. The Coronation Arena was opened in 1970, and the Commonwealth Lawn Bowling Club was constructed between 1975 & 1978\\\\. The planetarium was hampered by a seating capacity of only 65. It closed at the end of 1983 and was superseded by the adjacent Edmonton Space Sciences Centre, finished in 1983. The Edmonton Space Sciences Centre is now known as Telus World of Science. Since closing the planetarium has remained vacant, falling into a poor state of repair. In late 2004 two separate applications were submitted to the Historical Resources Development Board by Dale Nosko and Howard Gibbins. With the assistance of Mr. Robert Geldart these proposals were put forward to the board and passed by the Historical Resources Review Panel on May 31, 2005. According to Mr. Geldart, \\"They agreed that the Planetarium is worthy of being on the A list!\\" The next step was for the applications to go before the Edmonton Historical Board which happened in late June. They also agreed that the building should be added to the \\"A\\" list. The next, and last step was for the General Manager of the Planning and Development Department to pass the application which happened in late August. He subsequentially sent a letter to Community Services saying that The Queen Planetarium has been added to the \\"A\\" list of historic resources within the City of Edmonton. In November 2016, the city announced plans to restore the planetarium and grant it full heritage status, which it did in March 2017. The restored planetarium was originally scheduled to open by the end of 2019 in time for the 2020 International Planetarium Society Conference held in Edmonton in June, though the reopening was later pushed back to an unspecified date in the spring of 2020.

It was epitomised locally in the work of architects such as Miles Warren, Maurice Mahoney (Warren & Mahoney) and Paul Pascoe. Holmes engineered many of Canterbury's first modernist buildings including the Dorset Street Flats, the SIMU building, the Students' Association building at the University of Canterbury, and the Christchurch Town Hall. He also worked in Vanuatu (then called the New Hebrides) and the Solomon Islands engineering hospitals, schools, a Government House and a cathedral. Holmes was 49 when he died during construction of the Christchurch Town Hall.  Early years: 1920 to 1947  Holmes was born in Wellington on 16 October 1920 to Ivan Milo and Agnes Hay (n√©e Lyall). He attended Wellington College (New Zealand) from 1934 to 1938. He then started engineering studies at Victoria University College in Wellington in 1939 and transferred to Canterbury University College in Christchurch in 1940 where he completed a Bachelor of Engineering (Civil) in 1942. For the next four years Holmes lectured in civil engineering; his areas of expertise were Hydraulics, the design and theory of structures, and estimates and contracts. He was keenly interested in the standard of engineering education and was described as a \\"tower of strength\\" by his former student Robert Park, who went on to become a world-renowned earthquake engineer.  From academic to consultant: 1947 to 1956  In February 1945, he was awarded a Post-graduate Travelling Scholarship in Engineering, which he took up two years later. In May 1947, he boarded the SS Mahana to work his passage as a deck boy to England. In the interim, he had co-designed with Paul Pascoe a house in Christchurch for his widowed mother and had married Helen Jobberns, the elder daughter of Professor George Jobberns, the first chair of the Geography Department at Canterbury College. In London, Holmes landed a job as one of its first employees at the new London-based civil and structural engineering consultancy, Ove Arup and Partners, known for its work with modern architects, its designing of unusual structures and its development of new structural techniques and materials. In June 1952 the family boarded the R.M.S. Orontes, having made appointments at ports along the way for Holmes to receive treatment. When Holmes returned to the university in 1952 he was initially successful in juggling his university lecturing work with private commissions but by the mid 1950s his private work had begun to dominate and he was told by Harry Hopkins, Chair of Engineering, that it was time to choose. Holmes chose private practice and in 1956, at age 35, established what is now known as Holmes Consulting Group. Two years later he was diagnosed with angina.  Building a successful consultancy: 1956 to 1970  The new firm's first commission was for the Christchurch Airport Terminal. In 1958 Holmes worked on his first project with a young Miles Warren ‚Äì the Dental Nurses‚Äô Training School in Christchurch. Warren later recalled that meeting Lyall Holmes was one of the best things to come out of that project and was immediately impressed by the young engineer. The Holmes/Warren & Mahoney relationship continued until Holmes' death in 1970 and resulted in many important Canterbury buildings ‚Äì combining the architects' passion for the cutting edge modernist style with Holmes' enthusiasm for bold new construction methods and sophisticated seismic design. In his book Miles Warren ‚Äì An Autobiography, Miles Warren makes a point of sharing the credit for his success and fame not just with his less high-profile but \\"true\\" partner Maurice Mahoney but the engineer who helped make so many of their ambitious designs possible. \\"[Lyall] was a most creative structural designer and good friend who became an essential member of the team.\\" The relationship took a new turn in 1964, when the pair began designing buildings in the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu. Holmes, whose angina was now beginning to affect his stamina, found it easier to work in the warmer climate, and at the time of his death in August 1970 was hoping to build a house and office in Vanuatu to make his headquarters. During this period Holmes and Miles Warren initiated and designed College House, a hall of residence for students at the University of Canterbury.  Structural design breakthroughs  In the 1950s, Lyall Holmes was part of an engineering elite at Canterbury University that questioned whether standard building practices of the time were delivering buildings that could withstand a major earthquake,. Multi-storey buildings were then constructed using a reinforced concrete frame of columns and beams with brick infill panels. Holmes and his colleagues believed that in a major earthquake these rigid outer walls, which were poorly connected to the relatively flexible inner frame, would take the brunt of the seismic forces in a major earthquake, causing them to \\"shatter, fall and destroy the building.\\", As a practising engineer Holmes was now in a position to put some new ideas into practice and has been credited with starting the widespread use of concrete masonry in New Zealand by being the first to test the theory that stiff reinforced concrete walls should be used to take the major lateral earthquake forces, leaving the columns to carry only the vertical load or \\"dead weight\\" of the building, One of his most significant projects in this regard was Warren & Mahoney's Dorset Street Flats completed in 1957. This was New Zealand's first residential building made of reinforced concrete block ‚Äì a \\"pioneering\\" example of this construction method and seen as \\"one of the most important \\"Modern Movement\\" buildings in New Zealand (Clark,J & Walker,P, 2000). Three years later, Holmes' structural design for the Chapman Block at Christ's College, also designed by Warren & Mahoney, featured four cross-walls of load-bearing reinforced concrete block ‚Äì the first time this had been used in anything other than a domestic building in Christchurch. \\"Concrete beams and floor slabs spanning between the walls were all fair face concrete,\\" architect Miles Warren later wrote of the Chapman Block. \\"There was no plaster anywhere. The earthquake load in the opposite direction to the main walls was taken by a thick central fair face concrete shear wall.‚Äù Holmes took these new methods another step forward in the mid 1960s with the Warren & Mahoney- designed SIMU (South Island Mutual Union) building in Latimer Square. His breakthrough here was to place the service cores of stairs and toilets at each end of the building to create \\"stiff tubes\\" to take the major earthquake load ‚Äì the job of the outside walls and sparse central columns was now simply to hold the building up. ‚ÄúIt is all standard practice now, but it was innovative then,\\" Miles Warren wrote later. The Canterbury University Students Association building, completed in 1967, was another Warren & Mahoney design that featured Holmes' structural design. Described at its opening as a \\"skeletal encrustation\\", the building was, Miles Warren later recalled, a \\"construction tour de force\\" using exposed pre-cast concrete and pre-stressed post-tensioned beams and columns. ‚ÄúIt went beyond the [Building] Code\\" said renowned earthquake engineer Robert Park. One of the buildings Lyall Holmes is most remembered for is the one that was still being built when he died. The Christchurch Town Hall was a landmark building of its time ‚Äì the first completely new town hall to be built in New Zealand for 50 years and one that has been said to have influenced international architecture \\"like no other building in New Zealand\\" (Cairns, 2012). Lyall Holmes worked in an era termed by Australian critic Robin Boyd the \\"engineering of excitement\\". Sadly many of the landmark buildings engineered by Lyall Holmes in the 1950s and 1960s were deemed uneconomic to repair in the catastrophic Christchurch earthquake of 22 February 2011.

In the 9th century Moravians gain control over neighbouring Nitra and founded the realm of Great Moravia, ruled by the Mojm√≠r dynasty until the 10th century. After the breakup of the Moravian realm the Moravian tribe was divided between the Duchy of Bohemia and Principality of Hungary.

After the Anglo-Zulu War of 1879, Zululand had been partitioned into 13 sections which were parceled out to individual chiefs. To stem the chaos which erupted, Cetshwayo was restored as Paramount Chief, but civil war broke out in Zululand and his son Dinuzulu, succeeded him after his death 1884. The young king was placed in the care of the Usuthu faction who established a refuge for him in caves located in the Ceza Forest. Dinuzulu eventually defeated his rival Zibhebhu with Boer aid and was installed as king The Boers then claimed the land they had been promised for their services and, Dinuzulu believing they wanted too much, appealed to the British for help. Instead, the British annexed the whole of Zululand and Dinuzulu retaliated in 1887 by mounting attacks against Zulus loyal to Britain and trying to drive white traders and missionaries out of Zululand. The authorities in Natal appealed to the Cape for help and, in 1888, 2000 British troops were sent to Eshowe to mount operations against Dinuzulu, who was besieging a fort at the mouth of the iMfolozi River. Six hundred men under the command of Major McKean, of the 6th Royal Dragoons, and a young officer called Robert Baden-Powell, marched to relieve the fort, which occurred with little trouble. Baden-Powell was detailed to track down Dinuzulu and eventually found him and his followers sheltering in caves on Ceza mountain. The Zulus managed to escape during the night before the attack and fled into the Transvaal Republic. Dinuzulu realised that he could not win against the British and surrendered to them some time later. Hospitals Ceza hospital is a Level 1, District Hospital. It is in a local hospital - central Ceza, has a nursing school training enrolled categories and a bridging course. Ceza Hospital has 160 usable beds plus 12 lodger mother beds.

Formed by a group of businessmen from Eagle Lake, the short-line railroad was intended to bring the area's sugarcane to market. In 1902 a disagreement between two of the railroad's chief promoters proved deadly. By 1904 the line was in operation from Sealy to Matagorda on the Gulf of Mexico. That year the company's stock was bought by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway and the line continued operations under lease to the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway starting in 1905. By the 1920s, the local sugarcane industry collapsed but the railroad was saved by the discovery of two nearby sulphur mines. In 1948, the Cane Belt was merged into the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway. In the 1990s most of the original line was abandoned after the last sulphur mine closed. By 2013, only a small portion of the line south of Bay City was operating as part of the BNSF Railway. Founding In Eagle Lake, one-time Cane Belt right-of-way along FM 102 near the Lakeside Cemetery is still used as a Union Pacific siding. A circle of Eagle Lake businessmen and farmers applied for and received a charter for the Cane Belt Railroad on March 10, 1898. The area was a major producer of sugarcane and the railroad was desired to ship sugar and other local crops to market. The men who signed the charter were president Captain William Dunovant, vice president William T. Eldridge, secretary treasurer Thomas Boulden, directors Perry Clark, Osburn Green, E. P. Newsome and John W. Thatcher, and board members Rudolph Greenbaum, Frank P. Herbert and William Jasper McGee. Operating capital was $15,000 and headquarters were located in Eagle Lake. The original charter stipulated that the railroad would run from Lakeside to Bonus where Dunovant owned a large sugarcane plantation. In Eagle Lake there were connections with the San Antonio and Aransas Pass Railway and the Galveston, Harrisburg and San Antonio Railway. The new railroad immediately bought of existing track from Lakeside north to Eagle Lake from the Galveston, Harrisburg and San Antonio Railway. The line was completed to Bonus on November 11, 1898. The original charter was amended on June 7, 1899 to extend the line northeast to Sealy where it would connect to the Missouri, Kansas and Texas Railway and the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway. The amendment also called for an extension of the line from Bonus south to \\"tidewater on the Gulf of Mexico\\" at Matagorda. The company shareholders approved issuance of $1.2 million of bonds for of track. In 1900 the northeastern extension arrived at Sealy. Construction crews on the southern extension reached Wharton on June 30, 1899.Osborn (1998), p. 308 A major servicing facility was established at Lane City in 1901. The town was named for Jonathan Lane, then president of the Cane Belt Railroad. Cattleman Abel Head \\"Shanghai\\" Pierce offered a $20,000 bonus if the line reached Bay City by July 1, 1901. By a sustained effort, the railroad builders reached Bay City with more than six hours to spare. Pierce died in 1900 but his estate paid the bonus. The line eventually stretched from Sealy to Matagorda and the full line was in service by June 30, 1904. What became known as the Bonus Loop was built to connect with the 9,000 acre farm owned by Eldridge to the west. Meanwhile, Dunovant had 27,000 acres in cultivation south of Eagle Lake. Most of this land was devoted to rice farming which was pioneered in the area by Dunovant. But in 1901, Dunovant harvested 2,000 acres of sugarcane while Eldridge harvested 1,000 acres.Osborn (1998), pp. 306-307 The main railroad line ran along present-day Farm to Market Road 102 between Eagle Lake and Wharton. The Bonus Loop left the main line at Bonus, approximating the path of Farm to Market Road 2614. Then it ran north along Anderson and Calhoun Roads before turning east to reconnect with the main line just south of Lakeside. Violence and sale State marker relates the history of the Lakeside Sugar Refinery. In 1901 Dunovant built a sugarcane refinery at the Cane Belt Railroad's Lakeside station. The strategically located facility was capable of producing 100 tons of sugar per day. At first the railroad was profitable, with $20,000 net profit in 1901. But the next year the company began to suffer from uneven cash flow and construction debt. A dispute over management of the railroad between Dunovant and Eldridge proved fatal. On August 11, 1902, Dunovant boarded the San Antonio and Aransas Pass Railway at Simonton. Eldridge, who was already aboard the train, immediately emptied his revolver into Dunovant and then smashed the gun down on his victim's skull. Dunovant, a Confederate veteran of the American Civil War who lost his left arm at the Battle of the Crater and who had previously threatened to kill Eldridge, did not survive the encounter. Before Eldridge could be brought to trial, Dunovant's partisans tried to exact revenge. On October 4, 1902, W.T. Cobb fired a shotgun blast at Eldridge but missed. Cobb was later acquitted.Osborn (1998), pp. 310-311 On June 6, 1904, one of Dunovant's brothers-in-law, W. E. Calhoun fired a bullet through Eldridge's right lung from ambush but his intended target survived. Eldridge was tried for Dunovant's murder in November 1904 but found not guilty based on his plea of self-defense. A few weeks later Eldridge found that Calhoun was a passenger on the same train and gunned him down also. In January 1907 Eldridge was tried for Calhoun's murder at Bellville and acquitted again. Eldridge left the area and became partners with Isaac Herbert Kempner who founded the Imperial Sugar Company at Sugar Land. He died in Houston in 1932.Osborn (1998), pp. 312-313 Amid all this turmoil, the Cane Belt Railroad came close to bankruptcy. On November 11, 1903, the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe bought the railroad for $1.6 million, including $850,000 for stock and $750,000 for outstanding bonds. On April 11, 1905, the Texas Legislature passed a law allowing the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe to lease or sell the Cane Belt Railroad to its subsidiary, the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe. That railroad agreed to lease the Cane Belt on July 1, 1905. 1905 to 1948 In Thompsons, part of the old Cane Belt right-of-way (right) is used to bring coal to the W A Parish power plant. The modern BNSF connecting line goes to the left across the road. Several events caused the downfall of the local sugarcane business. Sugarcane required an enormous amount of manual labor to cut and load into wagons. Since the local population could not meet the demand for workers, the planters leased convicts from the Texas penitentiary system. In 1898 about 700 prisoners were harvesting sugarcane. Mutinies among the convict crews occurred because of the harsh conditions in the cane fields. Molasses imported from abroad and sugar beets grown in the United States proved to be cheaper to convert into sugar. In 1910 the Texas legislature passed a law forbidding the leasing of convicts on humanitarian grounds. In December 1911 there was a hard freeze which destroyed half of the sugarcane crop. The Lakeside sugarcane refinery closed in 1911 and in 1918 its machinery was sold to a producer in Jamaica. By the 1920s the local sugarcane crop dwindled to insignificance.Osborn (1998), pp. 309-310 A caboose sits on the old Cane Belt right-of-way at FM 102 and Branch St in Wharton. However, as sugarcane shipments fell off, rice shipments on the railroad increased substantially. But the economic salvation of the railroad proved to be the discovery of sulphur deposits at Gulf Hill near Matagorda in 1917. The Gulf Hill mine was opened in 1919 and sulphur shipments were soon a large part of the railroad's traffic.Osborn (1998), p. 314 In 1926 the Texas Railroad Commission determined the value of the Cane Belt Railroad at $2.5 million though evidence hinted that the real value may have been nearly $3.5 million. In the 1920s, another sulphur mine was found near Boling. On February 1, 1928, the Cane Belt asked the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) for permission to build a new line from Lane City to Thompsons. Previously, the sulphur was shipped to Sealy before it could connect to a rail line to Galveston. Construction of the new branch would shorten the rail distance to Galveston by .Osborn (1998), pp. 315-316 Rejecting a competing bid, the ICC granted the Cane Belt the right to build the line by June 30, 1931 and the new track was rapidly laid. The Gulf Hill mine played out in 1937 but by this time the Boling mine was shipping large quantities of sulphur.Osborn (1998), pp. 317-318 By the 1930s the volume of agricultural traffic on the Cane Belt had steeply declined. In 1939, the railroad applied to the ICC to shut down the Bonus Loop from Bonus to Eldridge, the site of Eldridge's one-time plantation. The application was granted and service stopped on September 16, 1940. The Eldridge post office closed two years later. By this time shipments of rice, livestock, oyster shell for road surfacing and other freight began to fall. Sulphur was the backbone of the railroad. In 1945, in addition to 3,824 bales of cotton, the Cane Belt shipped 17,789 carloads of sulphur, 1,613 of oyster shell, 1,122 of petroleum products, 354 of rice and 82 of fruits and vegetables. The only fatal wreck during World War II claimed the lives of two brakemen when a train ran through an open switch. In those days brakemen earned $0.82 per hour. In the years after the war a train crew's workday usually started at Sealy at 6:45 am and ended at Matagorda at 10:45 pm. The crews stayed overnight in bunk cars at Matagorda and began the return journey the next day. Each train typically carried an engineer, fireman, conductor and two brakemen. During harvest season a third brakeman was added to the crews. Cane Belt service was unpopular and the more senior workers of the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe usually opted to work on the Galveston main line. Passenger service was included on the Cane Belt by attaching a car to the end of the trains. In December 1948, the Cane Belt was absorbed by the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway and the railroad ceased to exist. Post merger The Santa Fe Trail follows the old Cane Belt Railroad right-of-way in Wharton. As the local highways improved, more freight was carried by trucks, cutting into railroad traffic. Passenger service between Sealy and Matagorda on the former Cane Belt line was ended on March 12, 1956. The Railroad Commission permitted the abandonment of the Matagorda station in 1967 and the tracks were removed. Demand for sulphur decreased beginning in the 1950s. The great sulphur mine at Newgulf near Boling stopped production in 1993. In the 1990s almost the entire line was abandoned and the track removed.Osborn (1998), p. 304 In 1995 Southeastern International Corporation (SEI) acquired the line from Bay City to Wharton. Up to that time, outbound rail traffic consisted of grain shipments while inbound traffic was mostly chicken feed and chemicals. On April 14, 1999, SEI petitioned the Surface Transportation Board to remove of track from milepost 42.24 in Wharton to milepost 54.00 near Lane City. SEI complained that rail traffic dropped significantly in 1997 and that BNSF rates increased in 1998, forcing the company to incur a $117,081 loss. On August 2, 1999 the petition was approved, subject to environmental limitations. On October 4, 2004, the BNSF Railway applied to the Surface Transportation Board to abandon of the line from milepost 66.95 at Bay City to milepost 54.00 at Cane Junction and from milepost 0.00 at Cane Junction to milepost 7.94 at Newgulf. BNSF argued that there had been no rail traffic for two years. The assessment noted that there were four ballast deck frame trestle bridges on the Newgulf extension, all built in 1930. In addition, there were four open pile trestle bridges between Cane Junction and Bay City, all built between 1912 and 1922. By 1998, the only part of the old Cane Belt system that still served rail shippers was south of Bay City. In that year, the Celanese Chemical and Lyondell Petrochemical companies shipped approximately 10,000 railcars through Bay City from their facilities.Osborn (1998), pp. 318-319 In 2013, other short fragments of the original line existed as sidings at Eagle Lake and Thompsons.See the Eagle Lake and Thompsons photographs. A portion of the Cane Belt right-of-way that ran through Wharton has been converted into the Santa Fe Trail.

The section from Kronprinsessegade to √òster Voldgade follows the walled north-eastern margin of Rosenborg Castle Garden and the next section, from √òster Voldgade to the intersection with Farimagsgade, named S√∏lvtorvet (English: \\"Silver Square\\") although it is little more than a busy street junction, separates Copenhagen Botanical Garden from √òstre Anl√¶g. History Like the other streets in the area, S√∏lvgade originates in the masterplan for New Copenhagen which was created in 1649. The street was one in a series of streets in the Nyboder neighbourhood that were named after minerals. All of the other streets have now disappeared. The original street only ran from Adelgade to the East Rampart at present day √òster Voldgade. St. Ann's Graveyard was from the beginning located at the northern end of the street, opposite Rosenborg Castle Gardem. St. Ann's Rotunda, which had commenced construction in 1640 but never been completed, was blown up in 1668. Still known as St. Ann's Graveyard, the site was then used as a drill ground until it was finally built over with buildings such as the Gold House, the Stocks House and S√∏lvgade Barracks which was completed in 1771. The extended S√∏lvgade in 1898 with S√∏lvgade Barracks on the left When Copenhagen's fortifications were decommissioned and removed in the 1860s, S√∏lvgade was extended all the way to The Lakes. The first Fredens Bro, the bridge at the end of the street, then a relatively narrow wooden structure, was built in 1878. It was replaced by the current, broad embankment in 1977. S√∏lvtorvet S√∏lvtorvet was created in connection with the establishment of Stockholmsgade in the 1880s. The new buildings for the College of Advanced Technology (now DTU) opened on the square in 1890. It was built to a design by Johan Daniel Herholdt, who had been teaching at the institution from 1860 to 1875. The institution later moved to a new building on √òster Voldgade in the 1930s. In the 1940s, when Adelgade and Borgergade underwent extensive urban renewal, S√∏lvgade saw another extension, now in its other end, to Borgergade. The Parks Museums There are currently plans to build a new home of the Natural History Museum along the Botanical Garden's boundary on S√∏lvgade, incorporating the former College of Advanced Technology's old complex as well as the Museum of Geology at the other corner. The Natural History Museum and the National Gallery are together with a number of other museums in the area around Rosenborg Castle Garden, Botanical Garden and √òstre Anl√¶g collectively called The Park Museums. The other museums in the collaboration are the David Collection in Kronprinsessegade, the Hirschsprung Collection in Stockholmsgade and the Danish Film Institute in Gothersgade. Notable buildings and residents The most prominent building in the street is S√∏lvgade Barracks, a large Baroque complex completed in 1771 to a design by the French architect Nicolas-Henri Jardin. One of the two main wings is visible from Rosenborg Castle Garden. Built in 1847, S√∏lvgade School at No. 16 was Denmark's first public school. It was designed by Peter Heinrich Christoph Hagemann. The Holmblad House at No. 38 was built by Jacob Holmblad in 1776. No. 22 is (from 1831) and No. 30 (from 1853) and No. 34 (from 1834) are also listed.

A prominent professor of the Japanese language, he was nicknamed \\"Razak- sensei\\" by friends and university students. Biography Abdul Razak was born on 7 July 1925, in Penang, British Malaya. In 1943, Abdul Razak, along with two other Malaysian students were chosen to study in Japan for a degree in education. Abdul Razak spent one year at the International Student Institute in Tokyo beginning in 1943. He then transferred to Hiroshima, where he planned to study for four years. = At Hiroshima = In 1945, Abdul Razak was a 19-year-old student attending Hiroshima Bunn University, which is now part of the present-day Hiroshima University, as part of the \\"Greater East Asia Co- prosperity programme.\\" He had been in Hiroshima for just seven months at the time of the atomic bombing. Abdul Razak was at a university lecture in a classroom on 6 August 1945, when the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima just 1.5 km from his location. Abdul Razak lost consciousness as the building collapsed on top of him and awoke to massive destruction. He and another classmate, Yura Halim of Brunei, managed to survive the aftermath of the bombing. A third Southeast Asian student, Hasan Rahaya, who became an Indonesian politician, also survived. Razak, Halim, and Rahaya were the only Southeast Asian students to survive the Hiroshima bombing. Abdul Razak was the sole Malaysian survivor of the bombing. (The Japanese government has recognised approximately 1,760 foreigners as survivors of the Hiroshima atomic bombing, the majority of whom are Korean.) Two other Malaysian students who had been studying with Abdul Razak, Nik Yusof and Syed Omar, died in aftermath of the bombing. Abdul Razak was forced to abandon the city and suspend his studies in the aftermath. They and other survivors waited in the open for ten days before they were found and brought to Tokyo for medical treatment. = After the war = Abdul Razak became a professor of Japanese studies and strong proponent of the Japanese language and culture. In 1982, Abdul Razak was appointed the head of Malaysia's Look East Policy by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. He also created the Japanese language program for the Centre of Preparatory Education at Institut Teknologi Mara, now known as the present- day Universiti Teknologi MARA in Shah Alam. Abdul Razak taught intensive courses on the Japanese language and culture to thousands of Malaysian students, including many who studied abroad in Japan. In 1995, Abdul Razak was awarded the Japan Foundation Special Prize in a ceremony attended by Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko. The attendance of the Emperor and Empress at the ceremony was regarded as a rare honour. In February 2013, Abdul Razak received an honorary doctorate from his alma mater, Hiroshima University, for his efforts to promote positive Japan‚ÄìMalaysia relations and dedication to the Japanese language and culture. Two other foreign Hiroshima survivors also received honorary doctorates at the ceremony with Abdul Razak: the former Chief Minister of Brunei Pengiran Yusuf Abdul Rahim who was 91 years old at the time, and Hasan Rahaya, a former member of the People's Consultative Assembly of Indonesia, who was also 91 years old at the time of the ceremony. Abdul Razak, Yusuf and Rahaya were all the sole survivors of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima from their respective countries. = Death = Abdul Razak died at Kuala Lumpur Hospital in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, on 18 July 2013, at the age of 88. Abdul Razak, who was a resident of Taman Kamariah, Gombak, Selangor, was survived by his three children, including the former Vice-Chancellor of the Universiti Sains Malaysia, Professor Tan Sri Dato' Dzulkifli Abdul Razak. He was buried in the Muslim Cemetery in Taman Ibukota in Setapak, Kuala Lumpur.  Appearances  Abdul Razak and one of his university students, Othman Puteh, co-wrote a book titled Debu Hiroshima (\\"Ashes of Hiroshima\\"), based on Abdul Razak's recollections of the bombing and information he had collected on Hiroshima since the 1940s. Debu Hiroshima was published by Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka in 1987. Abdul Razak was also interviewed for an NHK documentary on survivors of Hiroshima, Japan In My Mind (Heart), which first aired in Japan on 6 August 1988.

Nakajima was born in Yokohama. His father Baron Nakajima Nobuyuki was from K≈çchi Prefecture, was the first Speaker of the House of Representatives of Japan and Japanese ambassador to Italy. Nakajima initially entered Meiji University, but left without graduating, and obtained a degree from the Higher Commercial School (the predecessor to Hitotsubashi University) in 1897, obtaining a position at the Tokyo Stock Exchange on graduation. In 1899, he became secretary to Prime Minister Katsura Tar≈ç and in 1906 served as secretary to Prime Minister Saionji Kinmochi. In 1907, Nakajima went to work for the mining consortium Fukukawa Kogyo. He helped establish Josai University in 1918. In 1920, Nakajima was instrumental in joining Furukawa Electric, Fuji Electric, Yokohama Rubber and a number of smaller companies into the Furukawa Consortium, one of the 15 largest zaibatsu in pre-war Japan. In 1927, he was an influential member of the Deliberation Council within the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, pushing for increased compilation of industrial statistics, loans to small and medium businesses and export industries, and the adoption of the metric system.Johnson, Miti and the Japanese Miracle, page 102 In 1932, Nakajima joined the Saito Makoto administration as Minister of Commerce and Industry. In 1921, on viewing a wooden statue of Ashikaga Takauji at the temple of Seiken-ji in Shimizu-ku, Shizuoka, Nakajima had contributed a haiku poem to a literary magazine. He commented that the official educational policy vilifying Ashikaga Takauji as a traitor to the nation for his betrayal of Emperor Go-Daigo should be re-evaluated. The article was discovered by ultrarightists and militarists eager to find leverage to embarrass and to bring down the Saito administration. Nakajima was called before the House of Peers, where he was browbeaten by retired General Baron Takeo Kikuchi and others, who forced his resignation on 2 February 1934, a date making the 600th anniversary of the Kemmu restoration.Mass. The Origins of Japan's Medieval World, page 323 In 1937, Nakajima was one of 16 officials arrested on trumped- up charges of corruption in the Teijin Incident. He was subsequently cleared of all charges after a lengthy trial, but withdrew from public service after this event.Mitchell, Political Bribery in Japan. Page 73 After the surrender of Japan, Nakajima emerged from seclusion to become chairman of the Japan Trade Association in 1950. In 1955, he became president of the radio company, Nippon Cultural Broadcasting. He died at his villa in Hayama, Kanagawa in 1960. He was posthumously awarded the Order of the Rising Sun, 1st class.

Remy (born September 7, 1978) is an American career criminal who pleaded guilty to the murder of his girlfriend, Jennifer Martel. He is the son of former Boston Red Sox player and current Red Sox broadcaster Jerry Remy. Remy previously worked for the Red Sox's security staff, but was fired after a Major League Baseball investigation implicated him in steroid use. Early life Remy was born in 1978 to Jerry and Phoebe Remy. Due to his struggles with dyslexia and aggression, Weston public schools paid for Remy to attend the Gifford School, a special education program for students with learning or behavioral problems. He was allowed to play after-school sports at Weston High School, but behavioral problems revoked his privileges. On January 25, 1996, Jerry Remy called the Weston police, because he was worried that his son was harassing an ex-girlfriend. The ex-girlfriend and her father considered obtaining a restraining order, but were concerned that Jared Remy would retaliate if they did. He also allegedly threatened her new boyfriend. After this incident, Remy was sent to Florida, where his father was covering Red Sox spring training. Upon his return, Remy began dating Tiffany Guyette, who also attended the Gifford School. When he was nineteen, and Guyette was fifteen, she became pregnant. According to Guyette, Remy was verbally abusive and belittled her weight gain during her pregnancy. He also attempted to shove her out of a moving car. On January 18, 1997, Remy allegedly led a group of teens that assaulted a fifteen-year-old friend of Guyette's in Franklin, Massachusetts. The boy was later found by police incoherent and lying on a staircase. Although he recovered from his \\"life-threatening head injuries\\", his relatives described his cognitive function and mood as permanently altered. At the age of twenty-two he died by suicide with a firearm. In September 1997, Remy's son was born. Personality Remy was described by his psychologist as exhibiting impulsivity and having overly aggressive responses. He also had \\"a profound difficulty distinguishing his feelings\\". The psychologist requested Remy to take anti-anxiety medication, but Remy refused. A neighbor of Remy and Jennifer Martel described him as \\"very controlling\\" and quick-tempered. Martel's grandfather said that Remy had been degrading Martel for years. Legal troubles and restraining orders On August 7, 1998, Remy was arrested on charges of domestic violence and malicious destruction of property after he assaulted Guyette while she held their child, and damaged her car. On October 21, Judge Gregory C. Flynn of the Waltham District Court granted a \\"continuance without a finding,\\" ( also known as \\"CWOF,\\"), meaning that Remy was required to make an admission to allegations that would support a finding of guilt on the record, following which he was placed on probation. If he violated his probation he could be found guilty and sentenced, but if he successfully completed his probation the case would be dismissed and no formal finding of guilt would ever be entered on his record. Remy was ordered as conditions of his probation to attend counseling, check in regularly with his probation officer, and stay out of trouble for one year. On October 9, 1999, just two weeks before his probation was set to end, Remy became enraged after learning that Guyette was spending time with one of his old high school friends, Erik Jackiewicz. According to Guyette, Jackiewicz, and Dedham District Court court records, Remy drove to Jackiewicz's Norwood apartment, and smashed a beer bottle over his head. Once again, Remy was let go with a CWOF, despite violation of his previous \\"CWOF.\\" In 2000, Remy moved into an apartment with his new girlfriend, and a roommate who was a friend of his from the Gifford School. On March 25, 2000, Remy's roommate requested a restraining order against Remy. He said that Remy had barged into his place of employment, blamed him for his latest breakup, boasted of having a gun, and threatened to kill him. The roommate decided not to complete the request for a restraining order, but instead asked police to tell Remy to leave him alone. He also told police that they could find steroids in Remy's closet. The police went to the apartment and, with Remy's consent, searched his closet. Inside, they found a gym bag containing \\"several hunting knives\\", and a baggie holding nine uncapped syringes, but no drugs. On April 3, 2000, Remy called Waltham police and asked for help with an unwanted person report. Officers arrived to the scene and found Remy \\"yelling and screaming\\" at his mother through her car window. Remy grew more belligerent, and when an officer approached Remy to ask him a question, Remy elbowed him in the stomach area, and told him to \\"fuck off\\". He was arrested and charged with disturbing the peace. On April 4, 2000, Remy's girlfriend filed a criminal complaint against Remy for making threats. According to her, Remy repeatedly called her that weekend to profess his love for her and threatened to \\"kill her if they don't get back together\\". She did not appear in court, and Remy's attorney, Peter Bella, had the case referred out for a magistrate's hearing. The hearing was rescheduled four times before being dismissed. On May 3, 2000 he was charged with possessing a hypodermic needle. In 2000, Guyette was granted sole custody of her and Remy's child, and Remy was not allowed to take the child out alone. According to her attorney, the court-appointed guardian that investigated the child's welfare found that \\"Jared was not doing what the court asked, that his parents were enabling him, and that Tiffany was the better parent\\". On January 21, 2001, Remy called Guyette and asked if he could take their son to a birthday party for the child of his new girlfriend. Guyette refused, and Remy threatened to kill her and her boyfriend. Guyette filed a restraining order against him that day. The case went to trial on June 1, 2001. Guyette was prepared to testify, and the prosecution asked for three months in jail with three months suspended. Although Remy admitted to threatening Guyette and the judge, Neil Walker, admitted that probation did not seem to be working for Remy, the case was continued without a finding of guilt on condition that Remy remain in counseling and not violate the law further. (Guyette lost custody in 2007, after the Remys prevailed in a second case, brought at a time Guyette was in another abusive relationship.). On April 9, 2001 he was charged with striking a man with a bottle. In 2001, Remy began dating 21-year-old Waltham mother, Ryan McMahon. At least eight times during their relationship, police reported claims that Remy harassed, threatened, or physically abused her. In restraining-order affidavits, she alleged that Remy was using steroids, cocaine, painkillers, marijuana, and alcohol. She refused to testify against Remy, which made prosecution difficult. On September 18, 2002, Remy was charged with threatening to kill her. On July 3, 2003, McMahon told police that he had threatened to kill her several times over the preceding week, and then confronted her at work, where he punched her in the back. He was arrested on July 4. He quickly posted bail, and as soon as he was released, he used his cell phone to call McMahon and threaten her, which resulted in additional charges. On July 7, Judge Gregory C. Flynn released Remy on a $500 bail, paid by his mother, Phoebe Remy, on the condition that he move back into his parents' home and observe a curfew keeping him indoors from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. while awaiting trial. On December 19, 2002, Remy's ex-roommate filed restraining order against him after Remy allegedly attacked him and his father. On March 7, 2003, Remy was charged with hitting one of McMahon's closest girlfriends in the head with a bottle in a bar. In July 2004, Remy was charged with assault and battery with a dangerous weapon after he hit McMahon in the face with a cordless phone. His mother, Phoebe, posted his bail, again worth $500. On August 2, 2004, Remy was charged with vandalism after McMahon found him cutting up her clothes and pictures with scissors. He was released on a $500 bail with the agreement of the prosecutors, who insisted that Remy should find a job. Remy was hired by the Red Sox to work as a security guard at Fenway Park. On November 7, 2005 police responded to a domestic disturbance at Remy's home in Waltham, Massachusetts. Police stated that Remy had grabbed McMahon by her hair, dragged her down the stairs, threw her to the ground, threw a cell phone at her, and kicked her in the back, stomach, and face. She was beaten so badly, that she suffered a broken nose, a bloodied lip, and had a welt around one eye. She was taken to Newton-Wellesley Hospital. Remy was arrested at his father's home in Weston, Massachusetts, and charged with assault, battery, and resisting arrest. Remy admitted to police that he had \\"slapped her around\\", but dismissed the likely consequences as just \\"another year of probation\\". At his arraignment the next morning, Remy ignored the restraining order against him, and walked up to McMahon, accusing her of cheating. When she forced him to look at her bruised face, he put his head down, blamed \\"the Anadrol\\", and said that he was sorry, and that he was going to miss her. On November 10, 2005, Remy was charged with violating the restraining order. Judge Flynn remanded Remy to jail, as he deemed it necessary for McMahon's safety. Six days later, McMahon returned to court and asked to have the restraining order lifted. Remy's attorney requested Remy to be released and allowed to resume living with McMahon on the conditions they pursue couples counseling and Remy work on his anger management, but the judge ruled against it. While in jail, Remy was said to have traded his father's autograph in exchange for favors, such as having his back shaved. Remy later pleaded guilty, and received two years' probation. After his release from jail, Remy returned to his job at Fenway Park. On January 31, 2011, Remy was charged with driving with a suspended license. Steroid use and dismissal from Red Sox In September 2003, Remy was leaving Waltham District Court, where hearings on three of his cases were held, when a police officer observed him shouting loudly into his cellphone. The officer performed a background check, and discovered that Remy was driving with a suspended license. The officer pulled him over, and when police towed Remy's car, they found needles and steroids inside his backpack. Remy was charged with driving with a suspended license, as well as illegal possession of drugs and hypodermic needles. In 2004, Remy began working at Fenway Park as a security guard. He typically worked day shifts, guarding gates and searching the bags of guests who toured the park. He also served on the 2004 World Series Trophy's security detail during its travels around New England. In 2007, Remy and another security guard, Nicholas Alex Cyr, were reprimanded for taking boxes of World Series jackets. In July 2008, the Massachusetts State Police confiscated a vial of Anadrol from Cyr's car. He told police that he had purchased the steroids from Remy. Remy denied being the supplier, but acknowledged being a steroid user. Both men were suspended and questioned about whether the drug was being used by Red Sox players. Remy and Cyr were both fired in September. Assault and murder of Jennifer Martel In 2007, Remy met Jennifer Martel, a 22-year-old Taunton, Massachusetts native, who was casually dating one of Remy's co-workers. Martel initially described her relationship with Remy as a fling, but she unexpectedly became pregnant, and the two moved in together. In September 2008, Martel gave birth to the couple's daughter. In 2009, Remy and Martel became engaged. However, Martel cancelled the engagement, and told her mother that she would never marry Remy. During her last few years, Martel was unhappy, and told her mother that she was planning to leave. On August 13, 2013, Remy got into an argument with Martel. The argument escalated, and Remy pushed her into a bathroom mirror. Remy was arrested and charged with assault and battery with a dangerous weapon. Shortly after, Martel obtained an emergency restraining order. On August 14, Remy was arraigned in Waltham District Court. He pleaded not guilty. The Middlesex County District Attorney's office recommended that he should be released on his personal recognizance, and he was released by the judge with a bail warning and a no- abuse order. Martel elected not to have the restraining order extended. According to Martel's mother, her daughter did not extend the restraining order at the request of Remy's mother. On August 15, Waltham police were called to Remy and Martel's home after multiple calls to 911 reported a stabbing. Neighbors witnessed Remy assault Martel and one of them unsuccessfully attempted to pull him off her. Detectives stated that there was a long, protracted struggle in the home that went through the kitchen, stairway, living room, and onto the patio, where Remy pinned Martel down, and stabbed her multiple times. According to the police report, Martel had stab wounds to her shoulder and neck. She was found without a shirt, and a blue cloth covering her face. Their daughter was in the residence at the time of the attack, and was unharmed. Remy was arrested at the scene. On August 16, Remy was arraigned in Waltham District Court on charges of murder and assault. He pleaded not guilty, and was ordered held without bail. September 24, he was indicted by a grand jury on charges including murder, assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, and violating a restraining order. On October 8 he pleaded not guilty and was ordered held without bail. On October 6, 2013, Remy gave his first interview since his arrest to Boston Herald reporter Laurel J. Sweet. Remy denied that he murdered Martel, calling the idea that he killed her \\"ridiculous\\" and stated \\"I loved her, I still love her.\\" He also stated that he would not contact his daughter while in prison and that he hoped his parents would receive custody of her because they have greater financial means. He called his parents \\"very good people\\" and said that \\"none of this is their fault\\". On May 27, 2014, Remy pleaded guilty to the murder of Jennifer Martel and other indictments, and was given the mandatory sentence of life in prison without a possibility of parole. =Custody of daughter= Remy and Martel's daughter was taken by officials from the Massachusetts Department of Children and Families and placed in foster care after Remy was charged with murder. Martel's parents moved from Virginia to Massachusetts for the trial and to apply for custody of their granddaughter. Remy's parents, Jerry and Phoebe Remy, also applied for custody and a trial was scheduled. On March 24, 2014, the Martel and Remy families announced that they had come to an agreement that would end the custody battle. The girl would live with the Martels and the Remys would have visitation rights. The families did not specify which members of the Martel family the girl would live with. It was later reported that Arianna was living with Brian Martel Jr., his wife, and their young children. = Assault charges while awaiting trial = On April 3, 2014, Remy allegedly assaulted a fellow pre-trial detainee at the Middlesex Jail in Cambridge. Following the incident, Remy was moved to a separate area of the facility, where he could not have contact with other detainees. He was charged with assault and battery with a dangerous weapon. Remy was accused of throwing scalding water in the detainee's face before beating him with his fists, a green plastic chair, and a bar of soap. After the attack, Remy stated \\"I did what I had to do-I got a child molester\\". =Confinement= Remy is serving his life sentence at the medium security MCI-Shirley in Shirley, Massachusetts.

Schuenke Chair Emerita in Philosophy at Marquette University. Before her appointment at Marquette, she was the Lincoln Professor of Ethics at Arizona State University, and before that she was at Fordham University. She has also previously held visiting appointments at Washington University at St. Louis, the University of South Florida, and the Catholic University of Leuven. In 2002, Walker was awarded the Cardinal Mercier chair at the Catholic University of Leuven, and was the first woman ever to hold the chair. Education and career Walker (born Margaret Urban) received her bachelor's in philosophy from the University of Illinois at Chicago in 1969. She went on to receive her master's in philosophy from Northwestern University in 1971, and her doctorate in philosophy, also from Northwestern, in 1975. Walker was a member of the Philosophy Department at Fordham University for 28 years before moving to Arizona State University from 2002 to 2010 (where she received the Defining Edge Research in the Humanities Award in 2007), and moving to Marquette University in 2010. She retired in May 2017. She held visiting appointments at Washington University at St. Louis, the University of South Florida, and the Catholic University of Leuven. During her second visiting appointment at the Catholic University of Leuven, she was the first woman to hold the Cardinal Mercier Chair in Philosophy. She also was a Laurance S. Rockefeller Fellow at Princeton University's Center for Human Values from 2003 to 2004. Research areas Walker's recent research has focused on repairing moral relations after wrongdoing, especially in relation to political violence. She has contributed to research projects with the International Center for Transitional Justice on gender and reparations and truth commissions. She was drawn to this area through her earlier work, in which she focused on the effects of social inequalities on the way morality is understood in ethics and everyday life. Some of her earlier research focused on developing a social differences-focused approach to ethical theory. She strongly defends the view that although moral understandings are inextricably linked to the historical and social practices that they derived from, that those historical and social practices not only can be, but must be critically assessed.

It has gained attention as one of the programs exposed by Edward Snowden. It is mentioned as part of the PRISM program, and in other documents. The screen captures show that the program is a web-based application accessible through an intranet, Internet Explorer 6 is shown in one sample. The tool has the ability to query at least one database, NYMROD, which appears to be a database of names. The screen captures suggest that tool has the ability to filter by nationality (it is possible to enter multiple nationalities), location, and \\"target extension\\" (the given example is \\"D Diplomatic\\"). The analyst is also able to enter a classification string, and include a declassification date, in the sample given: 20320108 is code for January 8, 2032. There is a category labeled \\"Intelligence Purpose Information,\\" in which the analyst is able to select a geopolitical area, topic and subtopic. The screen captures suggest that the tool gives the analyst the option of suggesting how often to forward new intelligence, and enter a reason for any higher priority requests. The tool has the ability to build queries regardless of whether the target's name is known. The target may be a person, but that may not always be the case. The analyst must enter a short justification, and select a foreignness factor. Foreign factors include: \\"person is a user of storage media seized outside the US,\\" \\"the person has indicated that he is located outside the US,\\" \\"In direct contact w/ tgt oversees, no info to show proposed tgt in US,\\" among others. The presence of a ZIP code field on one of the released screen captures suggests that the tool may have the ability to collect within the United States, and not be limited to foreign intelligence gathering. There is a field for \\"Special Authorization,\\" presumably for targets that the analyst needs special approval to select, such as US persons, or foreigners presently located within the US. The screen captures suggest that the tool requires the analyst to enter a start and end date for the authorization, and a separate end date for the targeting itself to cease.

History of Wynnum The Bulimba Division was one of the original divisions created on 11 November 1879 under the Divisional Boards Act 1879. On 4 January 1888, the No. 2 subdivision of the Bulimba Division was separated to create the new Kianawah Division. On 17 March 1892, there was an alteration of boundaries. The Pritchard's Road land and gravel reserve (100 acres) were transferred from Kianawah Division to Balmoral Division. The Grassdale Estate land was transferred from Kianawah Division to Bulimba Division. Kianawah Division was renamed Wynnum Division on 3 November 1892. In 1902, the Local Authorities Act 1902 replaced all Divisions with Towns and Shires, creating the Shire of Wynnum on 31 March 1903. On 31 November 1912, the Shire of Wynnum was proclaimed the Town of Wynnum. In 1925, the Town of Wynnum was amalgamated into the City of Brisbane.

Krumrei (born 1956) served as adjutant general of Illinois, that is the adjutant general of the Illinois National Guard. Historically, he is the 38th person to serve as Illinois' adjutant general. Military career Appointed by Governor Patrick Quinn in 2012, Krumrei was the first chaplain to head any state‚Äôs National Guard. The appointment was immediately questioned by Lieutenant Colonel Grant Winsor Speece, a chaplain retired from the Minnesota Army National Guard, who asserted in a letter to the editor that \\"it is inappropriate for a military chaplain to serve in a position of command\\".). However, many who personally knew Krumrei supported the appointment. Although reared in a religious home, Krumrei delayed baptism. Then, because of influence by Christians in the Wisconsin Army National Guard, of which at the time he was an enlisted soldier, Krumrei was baptized in 1977. Krumrei has explicitly stated his positive impressions of the skills of women who serve in military roles. He swore in Alicia Tate-Nadeau, Illinois' first female Brigadier General. Immediately before his appointment as adjutant general, Daniel Krumrei was minister of the Parkway Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) in Springfield, Illinois. He retired from the National Guard on July 4, 2015. A retirement ceremony was held on August 7, 2015. He was succeeded by Brig. Gen. Richard J.

The chameleon has green to light yellow coloration and has a dark transversal band when it is stressed. This species has a very low casque in comparison to other chameleons. Sexual dimorphism C. tarzan males exhibit a brown to blackish casque and necks while females have a green to light yellow casque and neck. Females have a less pronounced rectangular rostral profile than males in the species. Geographic range and habitat C. tarzan is endemic to central east Madagascar. This chameleon is found in forest fragments outside of Tarzanville, Province Moramanga, Madagascar. Reproduction C. tarzan is oviparous. Conservation Madagascar has been subject to rampant fragmentation of forest habitats. Areas in Madagascar that are major protected areas suffer from forest fragmentation because of poor governance and subverted judicial control. The increase in forest fragmentation has created habitats that are not suitable for large mammals and some species of birds. This has made some flagship species of the island, like lemurs and some species of birds, to find refuge in non-fragmented forests. Biologists have named C. tarzan a flagship species because of its colorful appearance and because the area lacks other flagship species from Madagascar. Biologists are using this species to try to support and purpose significance in conservation of fragmented forests in Madagascar.

Unveiled during a Samsung Unpacked event in Berlin, Germany on September 4, 2013, the device serves as a companion for all Samsung Galaxy smartphones and tablets which run Android 4.3 or newer; it was released on September 25, 2013. Originally released as an Android-based device, Samsung replaced the operating system with Tizen through the May 2014 software update. The Gear's successor, the Gear 2, was released on April 11, 2014.  History  = Development = The development of the Galaxy Gear came in the midst of a push towards the growing smartwatch market; Samsung's main competitor Apple had been the subject of rumors suggesting an upcoming watch product, while the Kickstarter-backed Pebble (which reached mass-market availability in July 2013) has been credited with creating mainstream interest in the concept. Lee Young-hee, vice president of Samsung's mobile business, revealed in July 2013 that the company had been working on a watch for a long time, and referred to it as a \\"product for the future\\". In August 2013, Bloomberg reported that \\"two people familiar with the matter\\" claimed Samsung would introduce a smartwatch, tentatively known as the 'Galaxy Gear', on September 4, 2013 during a Samsung Unpacked event prior to the IFA consumer electronics trade show in Berlin. Samsung was also expected to unveil the Galaxy Note 3 phablet during the event as well. In an interview with The Korea Times published on August 27, 2013, Lee Young-hee stated that the Galaxy Gear would \\"enhance and enrich the current smart mobile experience in many ways\\", would \\"lead a new trend in smart mobile communications\\", and \\"add meaningful momentum to the mobile industry. = Release = Samsung officially unveiled the Galaxy Gear on September 4, 2013, with a release date set for September 25, 2013 (although its release in the United States and Japan would be delayed into October). Some wireless service providers, as an incentive, have also offered the Galaxy Gear as part of a bundle with the Galaxy Note 3. To promote the Galaxy Gear, Samsung released two television advertisements, \\"Evolution\\" and \\"A Long Time Coming\\". Both ads showcased historical depictions of smartwatch-like devices in popular culture (including those seen in Dick Tracy, Star Trek, The Jetsons, Predator, and Inspector Gadget), with the tagline \\"After all these years, it's finally real.\\" Samsung Galaxy Gear's watch design was exclusively leaked to VentureBeat reporter Christina Farr by an unnamed source several days prior to its Berlin release on September 4, 2013, generating widespread global interest.https://venturebeat.com/2013/09/01/this-is-samsungs-galaxy-gear- smartwatch-a-blocky-health-tracker-with-a-camera/  Specifications  = Hardware = The Galaxy Gear is powered by a dual-core, 1,600 MHz Exynos 4212 system-on-chip, that was scaled back to one core, 800 MHz to help save battery life, and contains a 320-pixel-wide square-shaped Super AMOLED touchscreen display with a pixel density of 277 ppi. Its band contains a 1.9-megapixel camera with a back-illuminated sensor, auto-focus, and 720p video recording, along with a speaker and two noise-cancelling microphones. The Galaxy Gear also includes 4 GB of internal memory, 512 MB of RAM, an accelerometer, and a gyroscope. The device contains a 315 mAh battery; the device itself does not contain a charging port and must be placed inside a special Micro USB-equipped charging case, which also contains an NFC tag that is used for the initial setup of the device. The Galaxy Gear is designed to IP55 specifications with dust resistance and protection from short-term exposure to water jets. To communicate with a host device, the Galaxy Gear uses Bluetooth Low Energy. As only Android 4.3 and later offer native support for Bluetooth LE, only the Galaxy Note 3 and Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition, the first Samsung devices to ship with 4.3, were supported by the Galaxy Gear on launch. Shortly after the release of the Galaxy Gear, Samsung began rolling out Android 4.3 updates for its other recent devices, such as the Galaxy S III, S4 and Note II, to ensure Galaxy Gear compatibility. = Software = A Galaxy Gear in its USB charging cradle, displaying a digital clock The Galaxy Gear uses an Android-based operating system with a minimalistic interface and gesture-based navigation. To pair the watch with a smartphone or tablet as its host device, the user must first install the Gear Manager app. An NFC tag located inside the charging case is used to download the app. Gear Manager uses Bluetooth to coordinate the pairing process and further communication with the device. It can also be used to configure the device's settings (such as the clock display's color and appearance), and to manage and install apps via Samsung Apps. Notifications can be synced from the host device and displayed on the Gear's screen when received; a preview of a notification's content is displayed on the watch itself, while the Smart Relay feature allows users to open content displayed on Gear on their smartphone or tablet. S Voice can be used for basic voice commands and voice dictation for certain apps. Phone calls can also be answered and placed from the watch (the dialer is launched by swiping up on the clock display), while the \\"Find My Device\\" tool can be used to locate the watch with a phone or tablet, or vice versa. The camera app can take photos, or record videos up to 15 seconds in length. Photos and videos can be stored to the device's internal storage, or immediately transferred to the user's phone or tablet. Users can also record up to 5 minutes' worth of voice memos. A media controller for music or video being played by the phone or tablet is also provided. While it is possible to sideload other Android apps on the device over Android Debug Bridge (ADB), their usability is impaired by the small screen, and an inability to access the Internet directly. On May 30, 2014, Samsung released the version 2.2 firmware update for the Galaxy Gear through its Kies desktop software. The update replaces the Android-based operating system of the device with the Tizen-based operating system of its successor, the Samsung Gear 2. The new software, among other improvements, provides improved performance and battery life, a voice-controlled camera, and a standalone music player that can play tracks stored in the device's internal storage.  Reception  The Galaxy Gear received generally negative comments from critics. The design of the Gear itself was met with mixed reactions; although considered high quality, the incorporation of components directly into its strap was criticized for making it inflexible (and thus making the device hard to wear comfortably). The Gear was also criticized for the limited functionality of its apps, along with its initially inconsistent notification system. As an example, critics pointed out that the Android IMAP/POP3 email client was able to display full notifications with message previews on the Galaxy Gear, while Gmail was only able to display an icon and directed users to open the message on their phone instead. These limitations surrounding notifications were addressed in the Galaxy Gear's first firmware update, which allows all apps to display notifications with previews on the Galaxy Gear. On the topic, The Verge remarked that \\"as with industrial design, software engineering isn't among Samsung's strengths, and the results on the Gear are a painful mix of unreliability and inadequacy.\\" The ability to answer phone calls on the device was praised for its convenience and good call quality (drawing comparisons to Dick Tracy), while its camera was also praised for having unexpectedly decent quality for its megapixel size. The device's reliance on Samsung Galaxy devices with specific versions of Android was also criticized, along with its poor battery life, which was considered more comparable to a smartphone than a watch. In an infographic posted in September 2013, TUAW compared the Galaxy Gear to the sixth-generation iPod Nano (which attracted unofficial watchband accessories due to its similarly square form factor) considering the three-year-old MP3 player to be a \\"better, cheaper [smart]watch\\" than the Galaxy Gear because it is not dependent on a \\"host\\" smartphone or tablet, and contained a larger number of features than the Galaxy Gear (including the ability to, primarily, store and play music from the device itself). = Sales = The Galaxy Gear performed poorly in terms of commercial sales; in late October 2013, it was reported that at least 30% of the Galaxy Gear watches sold by the U.S.-based chain Best Buy were being returned by unsatisfied customers. In November 2013, Reuters reported that company sources claimed that 800,000 Galaxy Gears were sold worldwide; however, the Korean news agency Yonhap disputed the report, believing that the numbers actually referred to units shipped and not units sold.

The home originally housed up to 16 young people in the mid 1990s but over time the number reduced to 8 by 2011. Inglewood Front Building Closure In May 2013 Children's Services decided that the home should be closed and open 3 smaller homes in its place. =New Criteria For Residential Provision = Leeds City Council stated criteria that residential provision had to meet to remain open, these were; * Homes should as far as possible replicate family life. They should be small and set within local communities. Homes should be part of the community and contribute to community life * All homes will be run based on restorative practice principles * Except in exceptional circumstances, children's homes should not be seen as permanence option * Children must have an individual and clear care plan, placement plan and personal education plan which supports their development * Children must be supported to participate in their own plans, in the running of the home and in service development * Children should be encouraged to develop positive interests and participate in a range of activities.http://democracy.leeds.gov.uk/documents/s69738/Childrens%20Home%20Review.pdf In the Children's Services Scrutiny Board report they gave this conclusion about the future of Inglewood based on the new criteria for children's homes. Inglewood children's home is in a very large home in Otley, built on a difficult to manage footprint at the end of a cul de sac with sheltered housing for the elderly.The home does not fit with the principle of smaller group homes and therefore the long term plan is close the home and reinvest resource into a smaller home at a time when the demand for residential places as a whole has sufficiently reduced or when smaller homes developed with environments and neighbourhoods are available. http://democracy.leeds.gov.uk/documents/s69738/Childrens%20Home%20Review.pdf =Closure Aftermath = The home officially ceased to be a Children's Home as of 31 August 2013 but staff were deployed there until 19 September 2013.http://democracy.leeds.gov.uk/mgConvert2PDF.aspx?ID=69738 All the staff and young people at the home were relocated although it was reported that one cleaner was made redundant and had to find work outside of Leeds City Council.http://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/news/local/otleynews/10636907.Inglewood_Children_s_Home_at_Otley_to_close/ The children at the home said ' the closure was disruptive.'http://www.wharfedaleobserver.co.uk/letters/opinion_our/10643454.End_of_an_era_for_Inglewood/ http://www.wharfedaleobserver.co.uk/news/10643461.Otley_children_s_home_to_close_this_weekend_after_114_years/ In 2014 Roy Walker the Service Delivery Manager for Residential Services in Leeds City Council had confirmed the plans to replace the home with 3 smaller homes has been scrapped due to funding.

Controversy Inglewood Children's home over its duration had hundreds of calls out to the police regarding children continually absconding from the site. The home had violent crime, vehicle crime and countless amounts of damage amongst thefts. Elderly residents nearby lived in fear they described due to noise and damage to their homes.

The Galaxy Note 4 was unveiled during a Samsung press conference at IFA Berlin on 3 September 2014 and was released globally in October 2014. It is the successor to the Samsung Galaxy Note 3. Its subsequent model, the Samsung Galaxy Note 5, was unveiled on 13 August 2015.  Specifications  = Hardware = Note 4 features advanced S Pen with more features Note 4 is the first Galaxy Phone to feature adaptive fast charging capability (up to 15 Watts).  Display  The Samsung Galaxy Note 4 features a 2560√ó1440 Quad HD (‚ÄúWQHD‚Äù) Super AMOLED 5.7-inch display with 2.5D damage-resistant Gorilla Glass 4 and provides a pixel density of 515 ppi (pixels-per-inch).  Chipsets  The Note 4 came in two variants, one powered by a 2.7 GHz quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 805 chipset with Adreno 420 GPU, the other powered by Samsung's ARMv8-A Exynos 7 Octa SoC with two clusters of four cores; four Cortex-A57 cores at 1.9 GHz, and four Cortex-A53 cores at 1.3 GHz, which is the same processor cluster sold for the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 in markets that mostly use or only have 3G (such as HSUPA and HSPA), and/or '2G', such as unaltered GSM and CDMA networks, similar to how the Galaxy Note 3 is sold. The phone has metal edges with a plastic, faux leather back.  Connectivity  Both devices that use 4G, LTE/LTE-A and Hybrid 4G-LTE Networks were only sold in Canada, Australia, the U.S., the United Kingdom (for some carriers), Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and South Korea, which have widespread 4G LTE Markets, or are solely 4G/LTE/LTE-A dependant such as Canada and Denmark, which did not use any 3G or older networks, except for HSUPA (Used as a fall back network should the signal strength be weak due to being underground or in the middle of a building), as well as HSPA+, which is a 3G network, though considered by some to be the Original 4G.http://www.Rogerswireless.ca Rogers uses LTE-A (150 to 200mb/s) in the 10 largest cities in Canada, however can drop down to HSPA+ during low coverage. Also, Wind Mobile uses only the fallback networks of HSPA+ and HSUPA, due to its cheaper cost, and speeds closer to the maximum because of their low usage. The GPU in charge in the Exynos chipset is the Mali-T760. The Chinese variant utilizes the TD-LTE and TD-SCDMA Plus Network.  Storage  Both variants came with 3GB of LPDDR3 RAM and 32GB of internal memory that can be expanded using MicroSD-XC cards.  Design  The Note 4's back-cover has a strong resemblance to the Note 3, with a faux leather texture (although without the simulated stitching). Note 4 has a new aluminum frame design, bearing resemblance from the Samsung Galaxy Alpha. Criticism has been aimed at the lack of IP67 certification (water and dust resistance), which was present in Samsung's other flagship, the Galaxy S5, released half a year earlier.  Stylus  Like the predecessors, the Note 4 also includes a stylus pen, branded S-Pen, incorporated into the design. Samsung touted new S-Pen features including tilt and rotation recognition but these features were either not implemented or not supported. The WACOM digitizer has been upgraded to be able to distinguish between 2048 pressure sensitivity levels, twice as much as the predecessor. The Scrapbook feature introduced on the Galaxy Note 3 has been extended by a so-called Intelligent Selection feature that allows for optical character recognition of highlighted screen areas.  Battery  The Note 4 also incorporates a user-removable 3,220mAh lithium-ion battery for the global model and a 3,000mAh non-removable lithium battery variant for the model sold in China. The global model is the last Samsung Mobile flagship to be equipped with user-replaceable battery.

This version has been criticized for poor battery life. A further update to 5.1.1 is available, depending on the wireless carrier. Most Note 4 devices can also be updated to Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow, bringing Android features like Android Doze (a feature introduced in Marshmallow that saves battery life) and greater control over app permissions to the device. The Note 4 TouchWiz UI was also evolved featuring the home screen icon pack known from the Galaxy S6 and also features new S Pen features known from the Galaxy Note 5 such as the new Air command menu design with custom shortcuts and Screen-off memo. However, the UI is still very similar to the previous UI and slightly similar to the S6 UI, but most of the TouchWiz UI resembles the original UI for the Note 4. = Camera = Rear of Note 4 featuring Camera, Flash and Heart Rate Monitor The main (rear-facing) camera is a 16 Megapixel (5322√ó2988) autofocus camera with 16:9 aspect ratio image sensor (Sony Exmor RS IMX240)Review of the Samsung Galaxy S6 camera by GSM Arena ‚àí Mentions that the Galaxy Note 4 uses the IMX240 image sensor type., featuring Smart OIS (Optical Image Stabilization + software image stabilization), being the first mobile phone of the Samsung Galaxy Note series and the first original variant Samsung flagship phone to feature an optically stabilized rear camera. It allows optically stabilized 4K (2160p) video recording at 30 fps, 1080p video recording with 30 fps and 60 fps (Smooth Motion) options and also 120 fps slow-motion video recording in 720p resolution. An option for 1440p video has been added in the camera software. Digital zoom is allowed up to eight times, twice as much as on the S5 and Note 3. The secondary (front-facing) camera is a 3.7 MP camera with an f1.9 aperture that can record 2560√ó1440 QHD videos and capture wide-angle pictures. The Galaxy Note 4's front camera is the first front camera in any mobile phone that is able to record videos at 1440p (WQHD) resolution. After the LG G3, the Galaxy Note 4 is the second mobile phone to be able to record optically stabilized 2160p (4K) video. Samsung Galaxy Note 4 review ‚àí Page 8: Camera  Sales  Samsung Galaxy Note 4 was released around the start of October 2014 and was available in most major markets by the middle of October. The first regions to receive the device were South Korea and China where it gained huge popularity. In the first month only, the Galaxy Note 4 reportedly sold 4.5 million units, which is a little less than its predecessor, the Galaxy Note 3, which was able to report 5 million sales in the first month after release. Samsung says that sales of the Note 4 were lower than those of the Note 3 at launch because the Note 4 was initially unavailable in some major international markets due to manufacturing issues, delaying release until early November in markets including the United Kingdom and India.  Plug-in for Samsung Gear VR  Only Snapdragon variants of the Samsung Galaxy Note 4, sold by US and European mobile carriers, may be plugged into the Samsung Gear VR headset, which was created in partnership with Oculus VR.  Reception  The phone was met with critical acclaim. When the Note 4 was released in late 2014, DisplayMate measured the performance of the display and said it was the best performing smartphone display ever tested and raised the bar for display performance. Note 4s were used to film Cai Lan Gong, the world's first feature film shot with a smartphone at 4K resolution.  Successors  The Samsung Galaxy Note 5 (branded and marketed as Samsung Galaxy Note5) is an Android phablet smartphone developed and produced by Samsung Electronics. The Galaxy Note 5, along with the Galaxy S6 Edge+, was unveiled during a Samsung press conference in New York City on 13 August 2015. It is the successor to the Samsung Galaxy Note 4. The phone became available in the U.S. on 21 August 2015. In the United Kingdom, the successor to the Note 4 is the Samsung Galaxy Note 8, because the Note 5 was never released there, there never was a Note 6, and the Note 7 was withdrawn due to battery hazard. However, the Note 8 has neither a replacable battery, nor a custom colour case window, nor a 16 Megapixel camera. With the S Charger View case, user-replaceable battery, Micro SD-XC-expandable storage and 15 Watts of charging performance, the Note 4 still performs well 6 years after release. = White background by default = On the Galaxy Note 4 (since Android 4.4.4), and also the S4, Note 3 and S5 (Android 5.0 update), the default theme of the user interface software utilizes white backgrounds with black text instead of vice versa (as previously), which defeats the main benefit of AMOLED displays, which is power saving for darker pixels. Additionally, white backgrounds shorten the lifespan of AMOLED panels significantly and could cause additional eye strain, especially in dark surroundings, even at minimum screen brightness.

History In 1920 the two most successful clubs in the western region of Par√° were the Santa Cruz and Uni√£o Esportiva da Congrega√ß√£o Mariana. By its names already indicated if they were associations connected to the religious movement of the Catholic Church, founded by the priest Frei Ambr√≥sio Phillipsenburg, of the order of the smaller brothers. The Uni√£o Sportiva was an extremely strong team, able to fight against its great and traditional opponent of the time, the Santa Cruz. However, the young movement that collaborated with the Uni√£o Sportiva team, which grew daily with athletes who wanted to play in the club, motivated a group of young people to form a new team that really took care of the needs and paid homage to the illustrious sportsman Frei Ambr√≥sio. On October 30, 1929, the team of the S√£o Francisco was founded, with the purpose of honoring the school founded by the great Santareno footballer of the time, Frei Ambr√≥sio. The founding of the S√£o Francisco Futebol Clube was the event of the year in Santar√©m and a remarkable way in the history of the sport of the region, since the newly formed team was the best athletes in the city. After many training in the school camp of the same name, the first game was finally scheduled. It was the first presentation of the already well-assembled and organized football team, which was called: S√£o Francisco Sport Club (first name of the club). The club's first colors were black and white with horizontal stripes. This fact was registered in the history, due to the lack of option in the local commerce, that did not present other colors available to commercialize. Premised by the circumstances, there was no preference for colors. They used those available. Supporters S√£o Francisco is one of the most popular teams in the interior of Par√°. In 2010, the club with the biggest crowd in Santar√©m, created the Socio-Supporter program, its first program of relationship with the supporter. A year later, the program continues to grow its membership, improving its structure, seeking new partnerships and offering more and more recognition to the main partner of S√£o Francisco, the Fan-Partner. An active, passionate and committed partner, the S√≥cio-Torcedor Azulino is a fundamental collaborator of the club, and receives more and more exclusive benefits, either through discount or exclusivity. Rivalries S√£o Francisco biggest rival is S√£o Raimundo. Stadium S√£o Francisco play their home games at Est√°dio Jader Barbalho. The stadium has a maximum capacity of 17,846 people.

Along with Hyundai's USA manufacturing plant in Montgomery, Alabama called Hyundai Motor Manufacturing Alabama, Hyundai has total of 19 manufacturing plants globally.  History  Hyundai's automotive history in America started in 1968 when Hyundai trained with Ford Motor Company. Then in 1985, Hyundai established its US headquarters in Garden Grove, California, while the Hyundai American Technical Center, Inc. was established in Chino, California. The First car to be exported to the United States was the Hyundai Excel. Hyundai Motor America began selling cars in the USA on 20 February 1986, with a single model, the Hyundai Excel. The Excel was offered in a variety of trims and body styles. That year, Hyundai set a record of selling the most automobiles in its first year of business in the United States compared to any other car brand; total sales in 1986 were 168,882. Initially well received, the Excel's faults soon became apparent; cost-cutting measures caused reliability to suffer. With an increasingly poor reputation for quality, Hyundai sales plummeted, and many dealerships either earned their profits on repairs or abandoned the product. At one point, Hyundai became the butt of many jokes (i.e. Hyundai stands for \\"Hope you understand nothing's driveable and inexpensive\\") and even made David Letterman's Top Ten Hilarious Mischief Night Pranks To Play In Space: No.8 ‚Äì Paste a \\"Hyundai\\" logo on the main control panel. In response, Hyundai began investing heavily in the quality, design, manufacturing, and long-term research of its vehicles. It added a 10-year or 100,000-mile (160,000 km) powertrain warranty (known as the Hyundai Advantage) to its vehicles sold in the United States. By 2004, sales had dramatically increased, and the reputation of Hyundai cars improved. In 2004, Hyundai tied with Honda for initial brand quality in a survey/study from J.D. Power and Associates, for having 102 problems per 1000 vehicles. This made Hyundai second in the industry, only behind Toyota, for initial vehicle quality. The company continued this tradition by placing third overall in J.D. Power's 2006 Initial Quality Survey, behind only Porsche and Lexus. Hyundai is ranked number 4 in World's Most Admired Companies under the motor vehicles section of CNN, after BMW (Bayerische Motoren Werke), Volkswagen and Daimler in 2011. Hyundai continues to invest heavily in its American operations as its cars grow in popularity. In 1990, Hyundai established the Hyundai Design Center in Fountain Valley, California. The center moved to a new $30 million facility in Irvine, California in 2003, and was renamed the Hyundai Kia Motors Design and Technical Center. Besides the design studio, the facility also housed Hyundai America Technical Center, Inc. (HATCI, established in 1986), a subsidiary responsible for all engineering activities in the U.S. for Hyundai. Hyundai America Technical Center moved to its new 200,000-square-foot (19,000 m2), $117 million headquarters in Superior Township, Michigan (near Ann Arbor) in 2005. Later that same year, HATCI announced that it would be expanding its technical operations in Michigan and hiring 600 additional engineers and other technical employees over a period of five years. The center also has employees in California and Alabama. Hyundai incorporated a new manufacturing facility, Hyundai Motor Manufacturing Alabama, in April 2002. The new plant in Montgomery, Alabama was completed during 2004, at a cost of $1.7 billion. Production started in May 2005. It employed more than 3000 workers in 2012. Currently, the plant assembles the Hyundai Elantra, the Hyundai Sonata, and the Hyundai Theta engine. It is Hyundai's second attempt at producing cars in North America since Hyundai Auto Canada Inc.'s plant in Quebec closed in 1993. Hyundai Motor Group California Proving Ground in the Mojave Desert (satellite image) Hyundai America Technical Center completed construction of its Hyundai/Kia proving ground in California City, California in 2004. The 4,300-acre (17 km2) facility is located in the Mojave Desert and features a 6.4-mile (10.3 km) oval track, a Vehicle Dynamics Area, a vehicle-handling course inside the oval track, a paved hill road, and several special surface roads. A 30,000-square-foot (2,800 m2) complex featuring offices and indoor testing areas is located on the premises as well. The facility was built at a cost of $50 million. An aerial view can be found here. In 2003, Consumer Reports, based on complaints about 2002 model new cars that in general are less than one year usage, ranked Hyundai's reliability tied with Honda's; however, J.D. Power and Associates put Hyundai's 2002 vehicles below the industry average according to its annual Initial Quality Survey, which looks at problems in the first 90 days of ownership. In 2006, J.D. Power and Associates' quality ranking, overall the Hyundai brand ranked 3rd, just behind Porsche andLexus, and beating longtime rival Toyota.[32] But Hyundai's ranking fell to twelfth in 2007. However, in 2009, Hyundai was the Highest Ranked Non- Premium Nameplate in the J.D. Power and Associates Initial Quality Study.[34] In the 2007 Strategic Vision Total Quality Awards, Hyundai Motor leads the most vehicle segments in Strategic Vision's Total Quality Index, measuring the ownership experience. They attempt to measure more than just the number of problems per vehicle. Hyundai tops in Strategic Vision Total Quality Awards. For the first time ever, Hyundai has risen to share the position of having the most models leading a segment. three models with the top Total Quality Index (TQI) score in their segments, including the Hyundai Azera, Entourage, Santa Fe. In 2007 at the New York International Auto Show, Hyundai unveiled its V8 rear-drive luxury sedan called the Concept Genesis to be slotted above the Azera in the Hyundai line-up. This concept made its American debut in mid-2008. The Genesis reintroduced rear-wheel drive to the Hyundai range following a long period of only producing front-wheel drive cars. In 2007 at the Los Angeles International Auto Show, Hyundai unveiled its second rear- drive concept car, the Concept Genesis Coupe, will be Hyundai's first sports car due to make its debut in early 2009. In 2008, Hyundai Santa Fe and Hyundai Elantra were awarded 2008 Consumer Reports \\"top picks\\". The magazine's annual ratings, based on road tests and predicted safety and reliability are considered highly influential among consumers.The Hyundai Elantra was Consumer Reports' top-ranked 2008 vehicle among 19 other compacts and small family cars, beating out the Honda Civic, Toyota Corolla and Toyota Prius. In 2008, at the North American International Auto Show, the production version of the luxury & performance-oriented Hyundai Genesis sedan made its debut, dealerships will have the Genesis as soon as summer 2008. In 2008, at the New York International Auto Show, Hyundai debuted its production version of the performance-oriented rear-driveHyundai Genesis Coupe, slated to hit dealerships in early 2009. On 6 January, Hyundai reported sales of December 2008 fell to 24,037, from 46,487 in previous year and sales for the year dropped 14%, a day after the company launched 'Hyundai Assurance' in order to spark sales amid tough economic conditions. In 2009, Hyundai announced the five-door hatchback variant of the Elantra compact sedan will carry the name Elantra Touring when it goes on sale in the spring as a 2009 model. In 2009, the Hyundai Genesis luxury sedan was named 2009 North American Car of the Year, the first for Hyundai. The Genesis has received a number of well- recognized automobile awards worldwide. It also won the 2009 Canadian Car of the Year after winning its category of Best New Luxury Car under $50,000. The Hyundai's V8 Tau engine in the Genesis, which develops 375 hp (280 kW) on premium fuel and 368 hp (274 kW) on regular fuel, received 2009Ward's 10 Best Engines award. In 2009, 4 models from Hyundai and two from Kia, earned the Top Safety Award by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS). In 2009, Hyundai/Kia vehicles were named as \\"least expensive vehicles to insure\\". Hyundai/Kia vehicles were the least expensive to insure and occupied the 'top five' least expensive slots, said Insure.com. In 2009, according to a preliminary report from the Environmental Protection Agency published in November 2009, which is based on 2009 pre-model year production projections provided by automakers,Hyundai, at an average of 23.4 mpg-US (10.1 L/100 km; 28.1 mpg-imp), is the second most fuel-efficient automaker in America, after Honda's combined U.S. fleet of Honda and Acura models at an average of 23.6 mpg-US (10.0 L/100 km; 28.3 mpg-imp). In 2010, a Consumer Reports reliability survey ranked Hyundai (including Kia) as the fourth-best automaker. The ratings reflect the performance, comfort, utility and reliability of more than 280 vehicles that the magazine recently tested. In 2010, the Hyundai Equus made its North American debut at the North American International Auto Show In January 2012, the Hyundai Elantra was named the North American Car of the Year at the North American International Auto Show, selling more than 200,000 cars since the model's redesigned debut. In a move consistent with its plans to create a performance pedigree, the upwardly mobile Hyundai announced in August 2015 that it would launch a new high-performance brand called \\"N.\\" The N brand is so named because Hyundai's research and development center is based in Namyang, South Korea. Though the company celebrated N's launch at the 2015 Frankfurt auto show, it did not disclose details at that time about any future performance vehicles that would wear an N badge.

The original line-up was Owen Bolwell on bass guitar and lead vocals, Andrew Briant on lead guitar, and Stanley Paulzen on drums and lead vocals. Briant left in 1991 and the band name was changed to Tlot Tlot. Their 1995 single, \\"The Girlfriend Song\\", reached the ARIA Singles Chart Top 100 and was nominated for Best Pop Release at ARIA Music Awards of 1995. The group issued four albums, A Day at the Bay (1991), Pistolbuttsa'twinkle (1992), The Live Set - Volume 1 (1993) and Fashion Takes a Holiday (1995), before disbanding in 1997.  History  Tlot Tlot formed in Melbourne in 1986 as alternative rockers, Man in the Wood, with Owen Bolwell on bass guitar and lead vocals, Andrew Briant on lead guitar, and Stanley Paulzen on drums and lead vocals. Their debut release was a 7-inch single, \\"Rain\\" in 1989, followed by an eight- track extended play, Thumper, released in 1990, which included \\"Rain\\". The single and 12\\" EP were produced by Aka Setkya and Malcolm Dennis for the Manhole Productions label. All the tracks were co-written by Bolwell and Paulzen. The songs on Thumper were much darker than other Tlot Tlot songs. In 1991, Briant left Man in the Wood and the group were renamed as Tlot Tlot. This band name was taken from the Alfred Noyes poem, \\"The Highwayman\\" (1906). As well as the name change, the music style changed from Man in the Wood's dark and depressing post punk to a more poppy style of music with light- hearted and humorous lyrics. Tlot Tlot's first release was a 14-track cassette album, A Day at the Bay, in December 1991.In 1992 they issued their first CD release, Pistolbuttsa'twinkle. The title is also from \\"The Highwayman\\". It was closely followed by a single, \\"Old Mac\\", which peaked at No. 5 on the 2XX Independent chart in April 1993. Their track \\"Birthday\\" appeared on the various artists compilation, Live at the Empress. In 1993 Tlot Tlot issued a compilation album, Pistolbuttsatwinklea'twinkle, which combined material from Pistolbuttsa'twinkle and A Day at the Bay. Later that year they followed with another album, The Live Set - Volume 1, which contained previously unreleased tracks and new recordings of older ones. The following year, Paulzen formed a side project called Fred Astereo with Briant. In 1995 they signed to EMI and issued a single, \\"The Girlfriend Song\\" in February, which reached the ARIA Singles Chart Top 100. N.B. The HP column displays the highest peak reached. At the ARIA Music Awards of 1995 it was nominated for 'Best Pop Release'. In May of that year, they supported Things of Stone and Wood at the ANU Bar. They released their next studio album, a covers album entitled Fashion Takes a Holiday, in July that year. The album contained covers of Depeche Mode's \\"Just Can't Get Enough\\" and the Romantics' \\"What I Like About You\\". The band also produced and co-wrote Merril Bainbridge's debut album The Garden that year, which received worldwide success. \\"The Girlfriend Song\\" appeared on the Collision 4 various artists compilation in 1996. A new track entitled \\"When We Were Young Stars\\" appeared in April 1997 on another compilation, A Minute or Less, on Candle Records. On 19 July that year, they supported Sydney band the Simpletons at the Punters Club.https://groups.google.com/forum/#!search/%22tlot$20tlot%22$20%22candle$20records%22/aus.music/P_uSaYs296k/MJ4lfFnEOioJ Tlot Tlot split up later that year. Bolwell co-wrote Merril Bainbridge's second album Between the Days, while Paulzen formed Ruck Rover with longtime collaborator Robert Clarkson and former Things of Stone and Wood member Michael Allen in 1998. Paulzen and Bolwell both produced Clarkson's EP Beautiful Girls and Beautiful Boys in 1991. Ruck Rover split up in 2004, and Paulzen resurrected his old Tlot Tlot side project Fred Astereo, who released two albums before splitting up. He is now in a band called the Sublets. Bolwell is no longer producing music. He has been married to Bainbridge since 2003. They have two children. He currently works for Bolwell as Marketing Director.The Bolwell website When Tlot Tlot played live, Bolwell and Paulzen played guitars and sang to pre-recorded backing tracks that contained keyboards, drums, bass, and samples. The backing tracks were played from a CD player, similar to They Might Be Giants' use of a tape player in live performances before 1992. Bolwell operated the CD player. Occasionally, the backing track would often misfire, playing before the band were ready. One such misfiring can be heard in a bootleg of the song \\"Old Mac\\", recorded live in Tasmania on 13 September 1992. Shortly after Bolwell brings the backing tape under control, Paulzen says \\"See what happens if we don't operate our own CD machine\\". Like They Might Be Giants, Tlot Tlot maintained a \\"sing-a-long line\\" at the phone number 61-3-419 0451 (later to become 61-3-9419 0451). The number is now owned by Quest Apartments.PDF of an advertisement for a Quest Apartments property, with 03 9419 0451 listed as a fax number. As well as the songs from their albums, they played many unreleased songs at their gigs. Many of these songs have since been re-recorded by Ruck Rover and Fred Astereo.

Development The new cartridge was developed based on previous lessons learned from the development of the Night Fighting Weapon System. It was intended to offer improved lethality over 9mm and 5.56mm rounds in subsonic loads for use in CQB and suppressed weapons with a range of 300 meters. The Musang is a \\"Wildcat cartridge\\" inspired by the .300 Whisper concept and made from components already produced or procured by the Government Arsenal. It uses a 5.56√ó45mm NATO cartridge case, necked-up to accept a Cal .30M2 flat base bullet, a 7.62mm boat tail bullet, or a Sierra Match King bullet for an overall cartridge length equivalent to that of the 5.56x45mm NATO. The cartridge can be loaded for either subsonic or supersonic muzzle velocities. Much like the 300 AAC Blackout, the Musang cartridge can be loaded into STANAG magazines (with 25 rounds able to fit into a standard 30-round M16 magazine) and requires only a barrel change to be used on an AR-15. The cartridge is used on the Government Arsenal's 10-inch barreled Musang PDW, which is based on the M4/M16 platform.

The deity of the shrine is the fierce form of Bhadrakali. Kalarivathukkal Bhagavathy is considered as the mother of the ancient martial art Kalarippayattu and hence the name. The shrine is administered by Malabar Devaswom Board and classified as Category A Temple of the board. Kalarivathukkal has come from the word Kalari Vaatilkal. Legend The holy shrine is one of the Devi temple triads of the erstwhile Chirakkal Kingdom. The other two being Cherukunnu Annapoornashwari Temple and Tiruvarkadu Bhagavathy Temple(Madayi kavu). The mythology says that Annapoornashwari came from Kasi to Chirakkal in a boat along with Kalarivatukkalamma and Madayikkavilamma who were her mates; to see the Krishna Temple and never returned. The Chirakkal Kings were the successors of Kolathiris' who in-turn was the direct descendants of the Mooshika kings. Mooshika of North and Ay of South were the oldest dynasties of Kerala. The Ay dynasty eventually became extinct but the Mooshika was able to sustain. The later name of Mooshika Raja was changed toKolathirippad. The Kolathiris' relocated their capital from Ezhimala to Chirakkal near Valapattanam river. The temple was once owned by Vadakke illam and was acquired by Chirakkal Kovilakom. Temple Architecture The temple is in traditional Kerala architecture style. The temple design is Rurujith Vidhanam(Kaula Shakteya Sampradaya) where in there are shrines of Shiva, Sapta Mathrukkal, Ganapathy, Veerabhadra and Kshetrapalakan(Bhairava) in 4 sanctums. The main deity is facing west. The shrine of Shiva is facing East, Shrine of Sapta Mathrukkal (Maathrushaala) facing North and the Shrine of Kshetrapalaka (Bhairava) facing East. The Maathrushaala has idols of SapthaMathrukkal (Brahmani, Vaishnavi, Shankari, Kaumari, Varahi, Chamundi, Indrani), Veerabhadra and Ganapathi. Every morning after the rites the Sacred Sword is taken to the Mandapam adjacent to the Maathrushaala and taken back in the evening after the rites. The main idol is made of KaduSarkaraYogam so for performing rites and rituals a Archana bimbam of Devi is used for rites and ablutions. The temple is opened throughout the year, in morning there will be Usha Pooja, at noon Pantheeradi Pooja and in evening Shakti Pooja Theyyam Theyyam is a religious ritualistic art-form conducted in Temples and Kavu in North Malabar. The shrine being the family deity of Kolathiri conducts the last Theyyam commencing the Theyyam period of a year.

A resident of Bella Vista, she was initially elected to the House in 2006 and assumed her position in January 2007. Family background A member of the Blackfeet tribe, Hutchinson was born into a military family in New Bern in Craven County in eastern North Carolina. As a child, she lived in twenty-nine different locations. She holds a master's degree in education from the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville. Employed as a professional mediator by DJ Consulting, she is a non-denominational Christian. Her son, Jeremy Hutchinson, is a former state representative who has served since 2011 in the Arkansas State Senate from a district in Little Rock. Timothy Chad Hutchinson, Jeremy's twin brother from Springdale, previously served with his mother in the state House. The twins were born in 1974 in Kansas City, Kansas. A third son, Joshua Luke Hutchinson (born 1978) resided in 2013 in Keller, near Fort Worth, Texas, and was formerly a resident of Rogers, Arkansas. Tim Hutchinson, Donna Hutchinson's former husband, from whom she was divorced in 1999 after twenty-nine years of marriage, served from 1997 to 2003 as the first Republican U.S. senator from Arkansas since 1879, two years after the close of Reconstruction. In 2000, a year after the divorce from Donna, Tim Hutchinson married in a private ceremony his former staffer and state director, Randi Fredholm, who is fourteen years his junior. She had left Hutchinson's employ in 1998 to attend law school. Hutchinson asked his sons not to attend the wedding out of respect for their mother. He called the collapse of his first marriage an \\"intensely personal thing.\\" In 2002, Tim Hutchinson was unseated by former Democratic Senator Mark Pryor. Tim and Randi Hutchinson are employed by the Dickstein Shapiro firm, he as senior advisor and she as an attorney, and the couple resides in Alexandria, Virginia. As a congressional wife from 1993 to 1999, Donna Hutchinson had remained in Arkansas. Tim Hutchinson had filed for divorce on grounds that the couple had lived apart for more than eighteen months, the requirement for an uncontested divorce in Arkansas. Her former brother-in-law, Asa Hutchinson, is a Republican former member of the United States House of Representatives for Arkansas's 3rd congressional district and former Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration. In 2014 he was elected as governor of Arkansas. Prior to his election to the U.S. Senate in 1996, Tim Hutchinson had preceded his brother as representative for the Third Congressional District. Political career Representative Hutchinson served on the Arkansas House Education Committee and was the chairman of the Subcommittee on Vocational-Technical Institutions. She was assigned to the House State Agencies and Governmental Affairs Committee and the Joint Budget Committee. For a time, she chaired the Arkansas Legislative Women's Caucus. Representative Hutchinson sponsored legislation designed to (1) protect children from registered sex offenders, (2) further define the criminal act of voyeurism, and (3) ascertain that the legislature receives information on highway funding prior to each regular session and eacg fiscal session. In 2012, Hutchinson ranked 89 percent on the Arkansas Freedom Scorecard, which measures the votes cast by legislators in regard to issues relating to economic freedom, educational reform, \\"good government,\\" personal liberty, small government, and tax/budget policy. Only ten members of the House at that time ranked higher on the survey than did Hutchinson. Hutchinson considered educational issues the most vital to Arkansas because 60 percent of the state budget is earmarked for schools and universities. In an interview with Progressive Arkansas, she explains her concerns: > We are ranked one of the highest states in students attending college, but > the lowest in students graduating. Our education system shuffles students > through the process without giving them an adequate education to be > successful ... I am not advocating all students enter college, but they > should be prepared for a job. We have a huge problem when 25 percent of our > students entering college -- not just graduating from high school, but going > on to college -- must be given remediation in reading! We have conducted > interim studies for two years; we understand the problems and hope to have > bills which will correct them. These will not be easy bills to pass. ... We > have not been getting our money's worth. Education is about the students, > not the adults running the system, but those adults will be determined to > keep the status quo. In 2010, Hutchinson sponsored legislation to ban K2, a synthetic drug often likened to marijuana. K-2 is placed on materials such as incense that are dried and smoked. In her last election in 2010, Hutchinson defeated an Independent, candidate, Jim Parsons, by a wide margin. Ineligible to seek a fourth term in the House in 2012, she was succeeded in a reconfigured District 98 by fellow Republican John Burris of Harrison in Boone County, previously the representative from District 85.

In the New Testament =Christian= The word Christian is used three times in the New Testament: Acts 11:26, Acts 26:28, and 1 Peter 4:16. The original usage in all three New Testament verses reflects a derisive element in the term Christian to refer to followers of Christ who did not acknowledge the emperor of Rome. =Disciple= Disciple is common in the Gospels and Acts, and is the \\"characteristic name for those who gathered around Jesus during his ministry\\". It is also frequently used in the Book of Acts but not in the New Testament epistles. =Brother= The term brother occurs in verses like . The King James Version renders the plural form used here as \\"brethren\\", while modern English versions have \\"brothers\\" (ESV) or \\"brothers and sisters\\" (NIV). The term comes from the theological concept of adoption, which says that believers are made part of God's family, and become his children. The use of \\"brother\\" as a designation for Christians has become restricted to members of religious communities (the Catholic sense), or as an honorific for pastors (often used in Baptist churches). =Saint= The Epistle to the Ephesians is written to the \\"saints at Ephesus\\" (). In the New Testament the word is used to refer to Christians generally, but Robert S. Rayburn notes that \\"the name survived as a general title for Christians only through the second century.\\" Rayburn suggests that the \\"juxtaposition of sainthood and martyrdom\\" in may have resulted in the word becoming an \\"honorific title for confessors, martyrs and ascetics.\\" In Orthodox and Catholic teachings, all Christians in heaven are considered to be saints, but some are considered to be worthy of higher honor, emulation, or veneration, with official church recognition given to some saints through canonization or glorification.Bebis G The Saints of the Orthodox Church at Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America, New YorkCatechism of the Catholic Church (Second Edition) =Believer= Belief in Jesus is a central aspect of Christianity. Rayburn notes that verses such as \\"substantiate its technical use as a title for Christians\\". =Follower of the Way= In the Book of Acts, Christianity is referred to as \\"The Way\\". The NIV renders Paul's words in Acts 24:14 as \\"I admit that I worship the God of our ancestors as a follower of the Way, which they call a sect.\\" Rayburn suggests that this was a Christian self- designation, although it did not survive as a title. =Friend= Rayburn notes that the phrase \\"the friends\\" (hoi philoi) occurs in and , but that it is uncertain whether this means \\"Christians in general or merely actual acquaintances\\". Rayburn goes on to note that the designation was used by the Friends of God and the Religious Society of Friends. =Nazarene= The title \\"Nazarene\\" is used once in the New Testament to refer to Christians, in , where Tertullus calls Paul \\"a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes\\". In rabbinical and contemporary Israeli Hebrew, Notzrim is the general official term for Christians. =The elect= In Colossians 3:12 Paul calls Christians \\"the elect\\". \\"Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering...\\" In later Christianity =Christ follower= \\"Christ follower\\" (rather than \\"Christian\\") has become the preferred self-designation for many people associated with the emerging church. =Messianic Jews= Adherents of Messianic Judaism will generally call themselves \\"Messianic Jews\\" rather than \\"Christians\\".

The MK 115 was chambered for a 5.5 cm round (in common with a few other late-war German designs), but used a partially combustible cartridge, leaving only the base of the cartridge to eject.

Accessed August 18, 2013 History The Metropolitan West Side Elevated Railroad began service in 1901, as the third elevated railway company in Chicago (after the South Side Elevated Railroad and the Lake Street Elevated). The Met was the largest elevated operation to date, with 4 branches leading to Chicago's West Side (and suburbs further west after that) connecting to a downtown trunk line. It was also the first electrified elevated railroad (the South Side and Lake used small steam engines). Most trains headed to the Loop, but as the Loop was often over-capacity during rush hour, a new terminal at Fifth Avenue/Wells Street was used. The line mostly operated concurrently with the Chicago Aurora and Elgin Railroad (CA&E;), who started sharing tracks with the Met Elevated in 1902. The interurban trains all terminated at Wells Street; no CA&E; trains ever travelled around the Loop. In the early years, the line expanded greatly, following the route taken by the CA&E; while the Garfield originally only extended to 48th Avenue, the line was soon extended to 52nd Ave/Laramie, and finally to Des Plaines Avenue; the Westchester branch was added in 1926, but it was really just a transfer of local service between CA&E; and the Chicago Rapid Transit Company. =Replacement= Even when the Met was being built, there were plans for a large boulevard on the West side of Chicago. In the 1920s and 1930s, as Chicago city planners started designing future superhighways, it became obvious that one of the best routes for a future high traffic East-West superhighway was through what was then known as Congress Street. Chicago's future transit plans were also intertwined with Chicago's plans for highways; a No.2 subway was to run under Milwaukee Avenue and Dearborn Street, turning westward under Congress Parkway and connecting to an elevated line on the expressway median heading to the West side suburbs. This line opened in 1951 as the Milwaukee‚ÄìDearborn subway and connected to the Logan Square Branch, rerouting traffic away from the Metropolitan Main Line and partially replacing it; Garfield and Douglas trains still followed the Met into the Loop. The second part of the project was the Congress Expressway, which would have a \\"L\\" line running through its median; many parts of the new expressway were to be built directly in the Garfield Park right-of-way, requiring demolition of a large portion of the line. A set of temporary tracks were placed slightly north of the right-of-way to allow for construction to continue on the Congress Expressway and the construction of temporary stations at Des Plaines Avenue and Ridgeland Ave. By 1955, while the Garfield and Met Main were still a major part of the \\"L\\" system, the vast majority of the stations on the line had already been closed and demolished; the Westchester branch was abandoned 4 years earlier, ending CTA train service west of Des Plaines. Initially, some of the previously closed stations were served by the CA&E; after CTA ended service, but the interurban, already financially bleeding due to the rise of the automobile, ended service to downtown Chicago on September 20, 1953 due to the new temporary track routing - terminating at Des Plaines, where a CTA transfer was required to continue further downtown. Commuters, favoring a direct route offered by the Chicago & North Western to downtown instead of an inconvenient two fare two-way transfer, rapidly abandoned the CA&E; in droves, causing the CA&E; to shut down abruptly at noon on July 3, 1957, stranding riders. The brand new Congress Branch opened on June 22, 1958 and connected to the Milwaukee‚ÄìDearborn subway, replacing and closing down the last remnants of the old Garfield Park and Metropolitan Main Line. =Legacy= While the Congress Line opened in the summer of 1958, the permanent right of way was only finished from Austin to Halsted; permanent infrastructure was not finished to Des app aines until spring 1960. After being somewhat split apart into several different lines due to construction, the remnants and successors of the Metropolitan West Side Elevated Railroad were combined into one line once again as the Logan Square branch, the oldest part of the Met, was routed to downtown through the Milwaukee‚ÄìDearborn subway, splitting off into the Congress and Douglas branches depending on train. The new line, the Milwaukee-Congress-Douglas, was rapidly expanded further north from the original terminus of the Logan Square branch; 10 years after the final Congress tracks were laid down, the new line was extended to Jefferson Park in February 1970. In March 1980, construction of the final extension to O'Hare station began, with the final section opening in September 1984. In 1993, the line was color-coded and became the Blue Line. The Metropolitan Main Line and the Garfield Park Line were the only branches that the CTA had ever replaced completely wholesale on the same right of way (many replacement stations on the Congress Line are parallel in location to their former Garfield/Met counterparts; some, like UIC-Halsted, were built directly next to the older station, to the point where period photos often show the old and new stations side by side.) This means that very little of the original Garfield Line remains, as demolition of the old line was extremely rapid and small parts such as signage were tossed into the scrap pile. The only surviving station of the Garfield branch, now known as Forest Park, was completely rebuilt several times. The Franklin Street Substation at the original location of the Wells Street Terminal remains as the only standing structure from the Metropolitan Main Line.

The storm was the eighth named storm and third hurricane of the annual hurricane season. Originating as a tropical wave off the coast of Africa on September 4, the cyclone tracked a general westward path for much of its initial stages as it gradually intensified, reaching tropical storm intensity shortly after development and then hurricane intensity a day later. After reaching a longitude roughly equal to that of the Lesser Antilles, the hurricane began to curve northward on a parabolic track, bringing it near Bermuda at peak intensity as a Category 4 hurricane on September 13\\\\. Afterwards, the hurricane began to accelerate northeastwards and weaken. The waning tropical cyclone grazed Cape Race before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone on September 15; these remnants persisted for an additional day. Despite never making landfall, the tropical cyclone disrupted numerous shipping lanes and inflicted damage on Bermuda and Newfoundland. In the former, the hurricane brought winds in excess of , downing power lines and felled trees. Property damage also resulted from the strong winds. Overall damage on the island totaled $400,000. After passing west of Bermuda, the tropical cyclone tracked across numerous shipping lanes. Two ships, the Leicester and Gaspar, encountered the hurricane and became stricken in open waters. Though most people were rescued from both ships, six people perished on the former while one died on the latter. Beginning on September 15, the hurricane tracked east of Newfoundland, producing heavy rainfall on land. The precipitation flooded roads and caused streams to overflow, inundating additional areas. On the island, two people were killed. Overall, the hurricane caused eight fatalities. Meteorological history On September 3, the tropical wave from which the resulting hurricane would develop from was detected just off the coast of western Africa near Dakar. This marked the second consecutive year in which a tropical cyclone could be traced back as far east as Africa. In HURDAT ‚Äì the official database for tropical cyclones in the North Atlantic dating back to 1851 Atlantic hurricane season ‚Äì the area of disturbed weather is estimated to have organized into a tropical storm by 0600 UTC the following day. Over the course of the succeeding week, the tropical cyclone moved in a general westward direction as it gradually intensified, reaching hurricane intensity by 0000 UTC on September 5 and then attaining the equivalent of a modern-day Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane scale at 0600 UTC on September 8\\\\. Up until this time, its existence and trek across the central Atlantic was only inferred, however, aircraft reconnaissance detected and as such confirmed the existence of the tropical cyclone the following day while the hurricane was situated approximately east of Antigua. Operationally, however, the reconnaissance flight significantly underestimated the winds of the tropical cyclone, with estimates of tropical storm-force winds at the storm's center. Thereafter, the hurricane began curving northward as it continued to intensify, reaching the equivalent of a modern-day Category 3 hurricane ‚Äì a major hurricane ‚Äì by September 11\\\\. Two days later, the storm strengthened further into a Category 4 hurricane. As no reasonably quantifiable strengthening occurred afterwards, this also marked the storm's official peak intensity as maximum sustained winds were analyzed at . However, aircraft reconnaissance estimated wind speeds of at least at roughly the same time frame. The storm's northward recurvature caused it to track just west of Bermuda late on September 13. Afterwards, a weakening trend began as the hurricane tracked northeastward into more northerly latitudes. By September 15, the storm had been downgraded to minimal hurricane intensity. After passing south of Cape Race later that day, the hurricane transitioned into an extratropical cyclone, and continued to track northward until it was last noted by 1800 UTC the next day near Greenland. During the storm's twelve-day trek, the hurricane tracked approximately , roughly equidistant to the distance between New York City and London. Preparations and impact =Central Atlantic and Bermuda= As the hurricane traversed the Central Atlantic, the United States Weather Bureau indicated that the storm would not be a threat to continental land masses due to its isolated position. However, ships in the storm's vicinity and to the northwest of the hurricane were advised caution. Other shipping lanes in the forecast path of the hurricane were also warned. After recurving in the direction of Bermuda, the British overseas colony was advised to begin prompt precautionary measures against storm surge and strong winds, which were expected from the hurricane. Aircraft from the United States Air Force and Navy stationed in Bermuda were sent to airfields in the United States to avoid the hurricane, while a Navy task force of twelve ships including the escort carrier USS Mindoro (CVE-120) were dispatched from the island. The U.S. naval operating base moved boats from exposed areas into safer parts of the base. Similar precautionary measures were undertaken by the British naval operating base. On Bermuda, the hurricane brought sustained winds estimated between , with higher gusts. A minimum pressure of 958 mbar (hPa; 28.30 inHg) was recorded, though a lower pressure may have occurred on the island as the barometer had been falling at the time. The strong winds downed power lines and felled trees, littering insular streets with debris. As a result, power outages occurred and loss of telecommunications was reported. Radio stations based on the island went silent due to the power loss. An emergency backup power generator at King Edward Memorial Hospital was used to restore electrical power to the facility. However, oil lamps were still used in place of any form of electrical lighting. Several slate roofs were torn from their buildings from the strong winds. Heavy rainfall associated with the hurricane flooded long stretches of roadway. Some roads were blocked and rendered impassable by the rainfall. At the local harbor, six vessels were inundated by the strong offshore wave action. Overall, property damage on the island was estimated at $400,000. =Mid-Atlantic and Newfoundland= After sweeping past Bermuda, the Weather Bureau continued to advise caution to shipping lanes in the storm's proximity. Two coastal railway steamers destined for a Newfoundland port were delayed as a result of the approaching storm. All flights headed for Torbay Airport were suspended until the storm's passage. Before affecting Newfoundland, however, the hurricane impacted numerous shipping lanes in the open Atlantic. The freighter Leicester, which had departed from London and was headed for New York City, was caught in the hurricane late on September 14 while situated roughly southwest of Cape Race, Newfoundland. As weather conditions deteriorated, the ship began to list, and as such the crew abandoned the ship late the following day. The American steamship Cecil N. Bean and the Argentinian steamship Tropero both assisted in rescue operations and rescued 39 crew members. However, six other remained unaccounted for and were presumed dead. The Portuguese fishing schooner Gaspar was also caught in the storm roughly off of Newfoundland, and although initial reports presumed that it had already sunk, the United States Coast Guard indicated that the ship was in no need of assistance. However, the ship was still abandoned and 41 crewmen were rescued, though one person was lost. Much of the effects from the hurricane on Newfoundland occurred on September 15 and continued until September 18\\\\. With winds equivalent to that of a Category 1 hurricane, the cyclone brushed east of the island, bringing extensive flooding. Offshore, a ship estimated winds in excess of off of Grand Bank. Precipitation peaked at a record at Fort Pepperrell. In St. John's, train traffic was effectively halted because of the hurricane. Silt kicked up by the strong winds covered railroad tracks in the southern portions of the city, while heavy rainfall flooded several city streets. Similar problems occurred in Avondale. The nearby Rennie River overflowed its banks, inundating adjacent land. The urban flooding damaged adjacent infrastructure. A three-year-old girl died on September 16 after a landslide triggered by the rain filled the first floor of her home. This was the only death associated with the hurricane on the island. In Holyrood, the local highway was washed out in areas. A small trestle with two concrete abutments were swept off into the adjacent bay. Another road leading to Cape Saint Francis suffered wash outs as deep as . Small bridges were also damaged, and some were washed away. As with the Rennie River, the Waterford River also overflowed its banks due to excessive recharge, and as such inundated 13 homes. Another river near Kilbride overflowed, flooding adjacent plots of land and tearing apart pavement. In this manner, several roads were rendered impassable and were cut off to traffic.

This was done in order to counter the English and French corsairs who preyed on the Spanish treasure fleet. They proposed to create a series of strategic bases between the Bahamas and the Antilles and the creation of an associated armada. Towards this purposes, they ordered the creation of new warships.

He received a master's degree in communication sciences from the same university and pursued a doctorate concerning political and social sciences at Marmara University, becoming a Docent in 2007. =Journalism= Akdoƒüan began his journalism career after receiving work experience at Milliyet, he was awarded for news reporting, research and studying as well as formatting during the H√ºrriyet Foundation Young Journalists competition in 1991. He has worked at Yeni ≈ûafak, Star, ƒ∞√ß Anadolu, Milli Gazete as well as numerous magazines such as Nehir and Yeni Zemin. He later served as the advisor responsible for the press for Ministers of State. =Early political career= Akdoƒüan served as the Director of Education, Culture and Public Relations at the Municipality of Pendik, a district in ƒ∞stanbul. He became a member of the Justice and Development Party (AKP) and became an advisor for the party leader (at the time Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan). He became a Member of Parliament representing Ankara's first electoral district at the 2011 general election and was re-elected in June 2015. Chief Advisor to the Prime Minister Akdoƒüan was well known for being one of the most influential contributors to shaping the Justice and Development Party's political ideology and outlook. He published his book Muhafazak√¢r Demokrasi (Conservative Democracy) in July 2004, discussing the AKP's declared ideological placement. Deputy Prime Minister Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan was elected President in August 2014, after which serving Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoƒülu was elected as AKP leader soon after. In the new government led by Davutoƒülu, Akdoƒüan was appointed as Deputy Prime Minister of Turkey, serving alongside B√ºlent Arƒ±n√ß, Ali Babacan and Numan Kurtulmu≈ü. Akdoƒüan's close relations to Erdoƒüan fuelled speculation that Davutoƒülu would take a submissive approach while Erdoƒüan continued to pursue his political agenda despite the Presidency being a largely ceremonial office. In the new cabinet, Akdoƒüan mainly focussed on the Solution process with Kurdish separatist militants.

It was Idriess' first novel and was semi-autobiographical, although he invented the love interest at the insistence of the publisher.Interview with Ion Idriess\\", ABC Plot Jack Burnett decides to go prospecting on an uninhabited island in the Barrier Reef with a friend. The friend goes mad and tries to kill Jack. Jack discovers some opium stashed away by Japanese smugglers. Jack is rescued and sells the opium to a Chinese merchant in Cooktown. In Cairns, Jack runs into the Japanese smugglers, but manages to escape with the help of a woman he has fallen in love with. Background The book was based on a true incident that happened to Idriess. In 1923 he was marooned on Howick Island in Queensland with a friend he had gone prospecting with. The friend had a war injury which sent him mad and he tried to kill Idriess. Idriess kept a diary of his time on the island and used it as the basis for the book. He sold it to a publisher in 1925. Idriess fictionalised the story, including a subplot about opium smuggling. Reception The book was not received particularly well. 1938 Edition Idriess rewrote the book after he had achieved acclaim with his other writings.

She was the Head Athletic Trainer for the Los Angeles Dodgers in Major League Baseball from 2012 to 2013, and was the first female head athletic trainer in the major American professional sports leagues.  Early life  Falsone grew up in Buffalo, New York. She graduated from Daemen College with a bachelor's degree in physical therapy and earned a master's degree in human movement science from the University of North Carolina. She obtained board certifications as a Clinical Specialist in Sports Physical Therapy, a Certified Athletic Trainer, and a Strength and Conditioning Specialist. Career Falsone spent seven years working for Athletes' Performance Institute (API), a private fitness facility catering to professional athletes, before she was hired as the team physical therapist for the Los Angeles Dodgers in October, 2007. While based out of the Phoenix area with Athletes' Performance Institute, Falsone worked with major leaguers, including Curt Schilling, and reportedly traveled to Boston multiple times to complete his physical therapy in 2005. She worked closely with API founder Mark Verstegen and credits him with her early development. She retained the position of Director of Physical Therapy for API when she joined the Dodgers. = Los Angeles Dodgers = When Falsone was hired by the Dodgers in late 2007 (to start in the 2008 season), she became the first female team physical therapist in Major League Baseball history. Falsone spent three seasons with the Dodgers as physical therapist, from 2008‚Äì2010, and traveled with the team. She treated several players recovering from injury during that period, including Rafael Furcal and Andre Ethier. She also participated in a Dodgers-sponsored paid baseball clinic teaching strength and conditioning for the public and was cited in media reports about Tom Brady's 2008 injury discussing recovery from ACL surgery. In a pre-season team-building exercise in February 2008, Falsone played the part of American Idol judge Paula Abdul in a performance modeled after the show, called \\"Dodger Idol\\". During the 2011 season, Falsone returned to Phoenix and API full-time, but remained a consultant for the Dodgers. In October 2011, it was reported that Falsone would be hired as the Dodgers' Head Athletic Trainer for the 2012 season, to replace Stan Conte in the wake of his promotion. She retained her position as SPI's Vice President of Performance Physical Therapy and Team Sports. ESPN commentator Curt Schilling, a prior patient of hers, stated \\"I can't imagine anyone more equipped to get that position, both from an intelligence perspective and the makeup of her personality... She was destined for this.\\" Falsone's philosophy as head trainer includes a heavy emphasis on prevention, what she calls \\"prehab\\", rather than solely providing treatment. Falsone is the first female head athletic trainer in any major American professional sports league. Along with assistant athletic trainer Nancy Patterson, she also became part of the only pair of female athletic trainers in the same staff in American professional sports history. Falsone has stated that she has not encountered disrespect from players due to her gender, and that she has been able to build good working relationships with them. She refrains from entering the clubhouse while players are dressing. Much was made of the historic nature of her hiring; Falsone herself noted that she was overwhelmed by the outpouring of support from the public, while also saying that \\"it's surprising it's taken until 2011 for this to happen\\". Falsone has been the subject of several profiles in recent years, including a segment with Erica Hill on the Today and a segment on the NBC Nightly News. While she has faced gender-based criticism, mostly on the Internet and social media, Falsone has also been surprised by the number of young female fans she has who see her as a role model. Falsone came under some criticism from fans due to the large number of high-profile of injuries in the first half of the Dodgers' 2013 season, but there has been no indication that the training staff's methods were at fault or that her job was in danger. Several players, including Ethier, Jerry Hairston, and Mark Ellis, and manager Don Mattingly praised her skill and sensitivity in media reports. On October 21, 2013, Falsone announced that she would be leaving the Dodgers to pursue other opportunities.

It is one of seven regions of the World Surf League. History =Creation of the WSL= Founded in 1989, the WSL Australasia was formed to promote professional surfing in Australasia. Its objective is to equally benefit Australasian surfers, sponsors and event promoters alike.  WSL Membership  Membership to the WSL is only available to individuals.  WSL Australasia Sanctioned Tours  Rules =Judging= In contests surfers will be scored on a scale of 0.1 to 10.0, these scores will be broken up into increments of one-tenth. The following scale can be use in order to relate descriptions with the score: *0‚Äì1.9 = Poor *2.0‚Äì3.9 = Fair *4.0‚Äì5.9 = Average; *6.0‚Äì7.9 = Good *8.0‚Äì10.0 = Excellent =Judging criteria= Judges will base the previous score on how successfully surfers display these following elements in each wave: *Commitment and degree of difficulty *Innovative and progressive maneuvers *Combination of major maneuvers *Variety of maneuvers *Speed, power and flow Some of these elements may be more or less important base on the surfing conditions and the surfing area. This criterion is also different then in longboarding competition. All of this is focused on creating some type consistency that can be seen throughout the many different events. The events themselves are previously declared QS 1,000 - QS 10,000 events; among other things this ranking shows what numbers of judges which are required at the event. QS 1,000 - QS 3,000 Qualifying Series events are required to have a six judge panel with four judges on each heat. A QS 4,000 - QS 6,000 Qualifying Series event requires seven judges with five of those judges on each heat. At QS 5,000 - QS 10,000 Qualifying Series events there are only allowed to be 3 judges from any one region. This is then limited to two at any world championship events. All events also require an WSL approved head judge who has the ability to make corrections to errors or any other events that may have affected the results. = Rules = There are many rules out in the water which all revolve around the idea of right of way. A surfer has right of way if he or she is closer to the area where the wave is breaking, this is more commonly referred to as having the inside position. If another surfer takes off in front of the surfer which has the inside position then interference will be called and penalties will be enacted. In most circumstances it does not matter who stood up first but who has the inside position.WSL Rule Book 2015 A surfer can also be found guilty of inference if they catch more than their maximum number of waves in a heat and that this takes away from the other competitors ability to catch waves. A competitor is also not allowed to interfere with another competitor‚Äôs paddling and maneuvering for a wave. The rules of right-a-way vary slightly with the type of break. Point Breaks will always have a consistent direct of what is inside, that is the person further up the line will have right-away. In a single peak situation where there is both a left and a right two people are able to be on the wave at the same time provided that one goes left and one goes right and that neither crosses the path of the other to go one direction. If this does happen then the surfer who stood up first will get the right-a-way. On a multi peaked wave where the wave eventually comes together both peaks can be surfed until the surfers come together, when they do the surfer who stood up first has right-a-way and the other must maneuver to get off the wave without interrupting the other surfer. In a one-on-one competition priority can be declared by the Head Judge. Once the person with priority has paddled for a wave priority is then turned over to the next person until that person does the same. The person with second priority can paddles for waves as long as it does not interfere with the other person and will only lose their priority if they catch a wave. A surfer who has already taken off or obtained possession of a wave maintains this position until the end of their ride. If another surfer takes off on the inside of this surfer then this person does not obtain priority and is considered to be snaking. If this surfer does not hurt the other surfers ride then both people can be scored based. If the judges determine that the snaking did interfere then the person will be penalized. Interference penalties are called by the judges and must have a majority to be declared an actual penalty. Interferences are shown as triangles on the score cards in various different ways depending on when or where in the heat they were made. If three or more waves are being scored then one wave will be dropped off the score card. If only the top two waves are being scored then 50% of the second best scored wave will be taken off. If a surfer has more than one then 50% of the best waves score will be taken off also. The surfer who has been interfered with will be allowed an additional wave to their maximum as long as it is within the time limit. If a surfer interferes more than twice in a heat then they must leave the competition area.

Description  They are generally made from carbon steel or stainless steel. Stainless steel belts are corrosion resistant and provide excellent surface quality. Stainless steel belts are used primarily in the chemical, food, rubber, plastic, wood, and laminate industries. Carbon steel belts are energy efficient and ideal for applications necessitating radiant heating of products or in high-temperature applications that might exceed the annealing temperatures of stainless steel belts also carbon steel belts can more evenly distributed heat since most stainless steel alloys are comparatively poor heat conductors. Carbon steel belts are used primarily in food processing, transport, and bake ovens. Textured Steel is also a commonly found belt material. The main purpose of using textured steel material is for its non-stick capabilities. This works well in the laminate industry.  Single Belt and Double Belt Systems  There are two main systems with steel belts the single belt system and the double belt system. The single steel conveyor belt systems tend to be designed for products in the form of pastilles, flakes, strips, or sheets. Single sided products. The Double Belt System offer simultaneous processing of top and bottoms of products. Many applications can benefit from a double belt conveyor system, including chemical, rubber, laminate, or composite material processing operations. Types  =Ground = Normally, ground stainless steel belts delivered with surface roughness from Ra 0,4 Œºm down to 0,1 Œºm and with well-rounded edges. Ground steel belts are leveled and straightened to obtain optimal flatness and straightness and can be supplied in open lengths, with the ends prepared for welding on site, or in endless condition with a welded joint. =Perforated= Perforated steel belts enabling the drying media, for example hot air, to be transferred 'through' the steel belt, so that the air is in contact with all parts of the product on the belt. Normally, all manufacturer are offers perforated belts with five standard perforation patterns which cover ring most requirements. A broad range of other patterns, with a minimum hole diameter of 0.8 mm (0.03 in.) and different spacing, can be provided to suit specific applications. =Polished= Super-mirror-polished stainless steel belts for the production of different types of thin film and ceramic sheets. The belts are available in thickness from 0.60 to 2.00 mm (0.02362 to 0.0787 in.) with thickness variation less than or equal to 80 Œºm. Polished steel belts are delivered endless or as open-length belts. =Seamless= Seamless steel belts suitable for the production of high-quality plastic foils and films such as optical film and packaging film. Its normally with thickness ranging from 0.03 to 0.60 mm (0.012 to 0.23 inch). Seamless steel belts are suitable for machines with narrow drum diameters using wide belts. =Solid= Solid stainless steel belts are, as standard, delivered in cold-rolled condition with a mill finish of Ra < 0,4 Œºm and have well-rounded edges. Carbon steel belts are, as standard, delivered in a hardened and tempered condition with a mill finish of Ra < 0,4 Œºm and have well-rounded edges. Solid steel belts are leveled and straightened to obtain optimal flatness and straightness and it will be supplied in open lengths, with the ends prepared for welding on site, or in endless condition with a welded joint.  Material  In both cases the material is a special grade for carbon or stainless steel specifically designed for use as a steel belt, with the material specially alloyed or treated to have improved properties such ductility, strength, thermal conductivity etc. depending on the application.  Sizes  Steel belts are available in a range of sizes ranging typically from 400 mm wide x 0.6 mm thick to around 3,000 mm wide x 3.0 mm thick. There are special applications that may use belts of narrower and thinner or wider and thicker size, but these are not common. The length of the belts are typically in the range 10 m to 100 m long, however it is theoretically possible to produce a belt of unlimited length by joining of shorter belts sections.  Usage  =Food industry= Usually steel belts used in food industry are hygienic, easy to clean, reliable and versatile in use. They are used for various application include cooking, steaming and drying of meat and vegetables, freeze drying of instant coffee, casting of caramel and candy, forming of chocolate droplets, and many more. =Chemical industry= In this sector, continuous stainless steel belts are an integral part of continuous production processes. Unlike conveyor belts used purely for transportation purposes, steel belts used in this industry serve as media for transferring heat and/or pressure. Applications for steel belts in the chemical industry include casting, polymerizing of resins, waxes, para fins and many other substances. =Transportation= Steel belts helps to move the finished product or raw material. Steel Belt also help in parcel sorting systems, transporting of bottles, bulk loads, bricks, machinery parts and the like. Straight tracking, high abrasion resistance, and dynamic fatigue strength are crucial when transporting bulky material or unit load. Extremely high operating speeds cause a high number of load cycles and create severe operating conditions. Steel belts are made to match these extreme requirements. =Wood processing= Steel belts play an essential role in modern, continuous production processes for wood based panels (WBP) such as particle boards, OSB- and MDF boards, where they serve as heat and pressure transfer media at the same time. As the steel belt surface has a direct influence on the final panel surface quality, this application imposes high demands on steel belts regarding thickness uniformity and surface finish.  Advantages and disadvantages =Cost= Compared to other materials like a plastic belt, the steel belt is more expensive. However, the steel belt has an advantage overall because the Steel Belt is not a petroleum based material. The Steel Belt production prices per linear foot is less expensive compared to a plastic belt. Furthermore, the Steel Belt has a low cost of process compared to the plastic belt. =Durability= Steel belts can withstand sustained exposure to extremes of temperature, hostile environments, and vacuum. Many are engineered to withstand permanent stresses such as bending, and the heating and cooling process. A variety of alloys may be used, each with its own resistance to chemicals, humidity, and corrosion. Engineers generally select a belt material based on physical properties, availability, and cost. =Maintenance= Usually, the Steel Belt's maintenance on Steel Belt conveyor system. The steel belt conveyor system including the resolving of belt tracking problems, changing of spares and consumables. =Ease of repair= Normally, a steel belt will deform over time. The steel belt's curvature can be flattened by using various methods.

Tyson went on to kick an unprecedented 1,203 goals during a twelve-season career with the Cardinals, but their rise from winning only six matches in 1931 was due to the development of second-year defender Max Tetley, the discovery of a third pre- war Cardinal stalwart in Norm McDiarmid, brother of star ruckman Jack, plus further outstanding youngsters Jim Morgan and Bob Dalziell.Atkinson, Brian; It's a Grand Old Flag: a History and Comprehensive Statistical Analysis of the West Perth Football Club 1885-2007, p. 54 It also saw a continuation of the first player drain from the WANFL to the VFL with the loss of Subiaco's Brighton Diggins and Bill FaulSpillman, Ken; Diehards; The Story of the Subiaco Football Club 1896-1945, pp. 124-128 resulting in the Lions missing the finals for the first time in nine seasons, a remarkable record for scoring accuracy by Old Easts in slippery conditions, and a longtime record total of suspensions ‚Äì the last of which was for twelve weeks and ended his career ‚Äì to \\"Nails\\" Western, who had been recruited by Claremont-Cottesloe from East Perth to add toughness and vigour but played little because of his reports.Casey, Kevin (1995); The Tigers‚Äô Tale: the origins and history of the Claremont Football Club; Claremont Football Club; p. 26.

His next two matches were for West Zone in the Duleep Trophy. He took his best first-class match figures of 10 for 111 (5 for 55 and 5 for 56) against South Zone in the semi-finalSouth Zone v West Zone 1972‚Äì73 and a few days later took his best innings figures of 7 for 72 in the final against Central Zone,West Zone v Central Zone 1972‚Äì73 giving West Zone the trophy. He took only one wicket when West Zone played the touring MCC in Ahmedabad in a match dominated by batsmen and spin bowlers, and finished the 1972‚Äì73 season with seven wickets in a narrow loss to Tamil Nadu in the semi-final of the Ranji Trophy. He took 54 wickets at 19.44 in the season. Wisden noted that \\"P.M. Salgoancar [sic] (Maharashtra), the country's new hope in medium-fast bowling, showed splendid improvement ...\\"P.N.

Opening the bowling with Madan Lal, he took 5 for 42 and 2 for 79 against Sri Lanka in the second unofficial Test in Colombo, which India won after the first of the two matches was drawn.Sri Lanka v India, Colombo 1973‚Äì74 He was not included in the Indian team that toured England in the first half of the 1974 season. India lost all three Tests by large margins. Relying almost entirely on spin, the Indian attack was ineffective on pitches favouring pace and seam, and took only 24 English wickets. Wisden commented: \\"Probably the Indians would have benefited from including Salgoankar [sic], of Maharashtra, easily the quickest bowler in the country and who, as it happened, came to England later for coaching at A.R. Gover's school.\\"Dicky Rutnagur, \\"India in England, 1974\\", Wisden 1975, p. 301.

She is College Professor of Distinction in the Philosophy and Women and Gender Studies departments at the University of Colorado, Boulder and Distinguished Research Professor at the University of Birmingham in the United Kingdom. She was one of the first people to introduce feminist concerns in to philosophy. Education and career Born in Sheffield, England, Jaggar earned a bachelor's degree in philosophy at Bedford College, University of London in 1964 and a master's degree in philosophy from the University of Edinburgh in 1967. She completed her doctorate in philosophy from the State University of New York (SUNY), Buffalo in 1970. During her career, Jaggar has held appointments at SUNY Buffalo, Miami University, the University of Cincinnati, the University of Illinois at Chicago, the University of California, Los Angeles, Rutgers University, Victoria University of Wellington, the University of Oslo, and the University of Birmingham. From 1994‚Äì1997, she was director of the Women‚Äôs Studies department at the University of Colorado at Boulder. She later served as Graduate Director and Associate Chair of the Philosophy department at the university from 2004‚Äì2008. From 2007‚Äì2014, she worked as a Research Coordinator at the Centre for the Study of Mind in Nature at the University of Oslo in Norway. A founding member of the Society for Women in Philosophy, she was instrumental in the creation of the field of feminist studies, and taught what she believes to have been the first feminist philosophy course ever offered.

She has published several articles identifying \\"how global institutions and policies interact with local practices to create gendered cycles of vulnerability and exploitation\\" and its influence on policy. She has helped develop a new poverty measure that evaluates how gender influences and is impacted by poverty. Her work has been hugely influential, with Rosemarie Tong and Nancy Williams suggesting in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy that \\"If ethics is about human beings' liberation, then Alison Jaggar's summary of the fourfold function of feminist ethics cannot be improved upon in any significant way\\" and Jaggar's texts being considered classics. Selected publications Jaggar has authored a large number of widely cited papers, most notably \\"Love and knowledge: Emotion in feminist epistemology\\", published in 1989. Jaggar has also acted as co-editor for the first issue of Telos, and was a co-founder and associate editor of Hypatia: A Journal of Feminist Philosophy from 2006 to 2008.
