It offers visitors a glimpse of both natural and cultural history, and traces the historic footprints of the U.S. Army Base, Fort Schwatka, located at the Ulakta Head on Mount Ballyhoo. The fort, 800 miles west of Anchorage, the nearest large urban center, was one of four coastal defense posts built to protect Dutch Harbor (crucial back door to the United States) during World War II; Fort Schwatka is also the highest coastal battery ever constructed in the United States. The other Army coastal defense facilities were Fort Mears, Fort Learnard, and Fort Brumback.Harbor Defense of Dutch Harbor at Fortwiki.com Engineers designed the concrete observation posts and command stations to withstand earthquakes and 100 mph winds. Although today, many of the bunkers and wooden structures of Fort Schwatka have collapsed, the gun mounts and lookouts are among the most intact in the country. In 1996, the United States Congress designated this a National Historic Area as a way of educating future generations both about the history of the Aleut people, and the role the Aleutian Islands played in the defense of the United States in World War II. It is owned and operated by the Ounalashka Corporation but as an affiliated area of the National Park Service receives funding and technical assistance for development and preservation. History and culture of the Aleut people The Unangan or Aleut people (as they came to be called) were once quite plentiful in their native corner of Alaska. But within 45 years after Russian contact, their number plummeted to a mere few thousand‚Äîthe population had become decimated by warfare, epidemics, starvation and the exploitation of Russian fur traders. The Russian monarchy attempted to enforce fair treatment, but it was not until the arrival of the Russian Orthodox Church in the 1800s (decade) that the Aleuts' rights were argued in Russian courts. The Russian Orthodox Church did much to alleviate the ills of colonization. Churches became the most prominent village structure and the focus of community life. Aleuts served as lay readers. They formed choirs, practicing the Orthodox liturgy in their own Aleut tongue. The Church became a sanctuary, its icons representing a spiritual dimension transcending the often harsh realities of life. The Russian Orthodox faith remains a dominant force in modern Aleut culture. The present day Church of the Holy Ascension of Christ, built in 1895, is a National Historic Landmark. In 1996, the World Monuments Watch‚Äîa highly selective listing that includes India's Taj Mahal‚Äîdesignated the church's 250 religious icons one of the world's 100 most endangered sites. After the purchase of Alaska by the United States in 1867, the Aleut found themselves classified as \\"Indians\\" and made wards of the government. Some Aleut worked fox and sheep farms for wages, others became construction workers or longshoremen, but almost all still looked to the sea for sustenance. The Aleuts' hardships lasted for over two centuries, culminating finally in the forced evacuation from their homeland during World War II. This was when the unique geography of the Aleutian Islands‚Äîthe link between east and west‚Äîagain played a pivotal role in the area's history. World War II At the outbreak of World War II, the Imperial Japanese Naval Base of Paramushiro lay only 650 miles southwest of Attu Island, the westernmost island in the Aleutian chain. Both the Attuans and the Aleutian Islanders in general were wary of their proximity to this Japanese installation. \\"Some day they (will) come to Attu,\\" predicted Attuan Michael Hodikoff. On June 7, 1942, Japanese forces invaded the United States by attacking and occupying this small island along with Kiska as part of the Aleutian Islands Campaign, initially a diversion for the Battle of Midway. This changed forever not only the lives of the 42 Attuan villagers taken as prisoners-of-war, but the Aleut people as a whole. In response to this Japanese aggression, U.S. authorities evacuated 881 Aleuts from nine villages. They were herded from their homes onto cramped transport ships, most allowed only a single suitcase. Heartbroken, Atka villagers watched as U.S. servicemen set their homes and church afire so they would not fall into Japanese hands. The Aleuts were transported to Southeast Alaska and crowded into \\"duration villages.\\" Conditions were harsh as there was no plumbing, electricity or winter clothes. Camp food was poor and the water was tainted. Medical care was inadequate, and pneumonia and tuberculosis were rampant. In mid-1942 through mid-1943 Dutch Harbor was a submarine base, allowing short-ranged S-boats to patrol in Japanese home waters. By mid-1943 many more long-range submarines (such as the Gato-class) were built. These were based elsewhere, and the S-boats were withdrawn for use as training submarines.

Residing in Denmark since 1962, she returns to Canada annually to conduct speaking and reading tours and to teach drawing and head- sculpting workshops. She has published eleven collections of poetry, five novels, and three volumes of drawings. She specializes in drawing premature infants and \\"infants in crisis\\". Early life, education, and family Heather Spears was born in 1934 in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The daughter of Robert and Dorothea Spears, she was born to her father's second wife and has two brothers and a step-sister. She began drawing at the age of 5. She received her formal training at the Emily Carr University of Art and Design in Vancouver and the University of British Columbia. After graduating from university, she traveled on an Emily Carr Scholarship to study art in Europe for two years. There she met a fellow Canadian, Leonard \\"Lenny\\" Goldenberg, a ceramist. They married and had three sons. Bornholm In 1962, the family moved from Canada to Denmark for a year so Goldenberg could study Danish pottery- making. They lived on the island of Bornholm, which had a large tourist trade. The family remained in Denmark from a combination of \\"poverty, put-it-offness and apathy\\", remaining in the country even after the couple divorced. Spears learned Danish but continued to speak English at home. She studied anatomical drawing at the Panum Institute and Arabic at the University of Copenhagen. After her children grew up, Spears began returning to Canada annually to conduct reading and speaking tours, and teach drawing and head-sculpting workshops. Work=Poetry Spears published her first book of poetry, Asylum Poems and Others, in 1958. Canadian literary critic Northrop Frye called it \\"[a] most disconcerting and haunting little book\\". Her poems are generally classified as \\"non-genre\\". She often combines poetry and art, as in her books Drawings from the Newborn, The Panum Poems, and Required Reading, which present both poems and line drawings, and Line by Line, which depicts drawings of Canadian poets along with sample poems. Her poem \\"The Danish Portraits\\" lyricizes the thoughts of a painter on his relationship to his portrait subjects. Novels Spears has written a science fiction trilogy about conjoined twins, and a crime fiction novel. Drawings To support her children as a single parent in Bornholm, Spears sold oil paintings and drawings, and also taught. She catered to the summer tourist trade by sketching individual and family portraits. At first she had difficulty drawing babies' faces, so she honed her skill by sketching infants in a local hospital at night. She became fascinated by premature infants, a subject she had not learned about in her anatomy classes, and produced many pencil and chalk drawings of preterm infants in the neonatal intensive care unit. She also studied infant muscle structure and began modeling babies' heads in clay. Later she traveled to maternity and neonatal intensive care wards in hospitals in North America, England, Sweden, and the Middle East, to sketch women in childbirth and critically ill newborns. Spears began accepting private commissions from parents to draw their stillborns and babies who had died after birth. She was invited to serve as artist-in-residence at the Dalhousie University medical school in Halifax, Nova Scotia, in 1998. During her time there, she produced about 50 drawings of babies and older children at the IWK Health Centre. In 2016, she mounted an exhibition at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford called \\"Drawing the First Breath\\", showcasing sketches of more than 100 childbirths and 25 neonatal infants that she had drawn over the previous three decades. Spears also taught head-sculpting and exhibited her sculptures. In addition to her infant portraits, Spears has sketched dancers, musicians, athletes, and lecturers. She also does courtroom drawings. Among the cases she has documented are the Reena Virk murder trial and the Midwifery Trial. In spring 1989, during the First Intifada, Spears spent six weeks in the Palestinian National Authority to draw children injured in the conflict. She funded her trip with $1,000 in grants from the Canadian Council of Churches and a peace fund in Denmark. Spears produced 300 pencil and chalk drawings of wounded children in hospitals, surgeries, refugee camps, West Bank villages, and military courts. A diplomat helped her take the drawings out of the country. She published 75 of the drawings in a paperback book titled Drawn from the Fire ‚Äì Children of the Intifada, which includes an Arabic-language explanation of how each child was wounded. Spears has given slide presentations of the drawings before schools and peace groups to initiate discussion of the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict; however, her public school lectures are often cancelled after complaints by parents that her presentation lacks \\"balance\\". Spears owns the Galleri Upper Canada in Copenhagen. Memberships Spears holds memberships in the League of Canadian Poets, Writers' Union of Canada, and SF Canada; the Society of Authors; and Tegnernes Forbund, the Danish Graphic Artist's Federation. Awards and honours Spears has won three Pat Lowther Awards ‚Äì for her 1986 poetry collection How to Read Faces, her 1988 poetry collection The Word for Sand, and her 2000 book of drawings Required Reading: A witness in words and drawings to the Reena Virk Trials, 1998‚Äì2000. The Word for Sand was also the winner of the Governor General's Literary Award for Poetry. In 2016, Spears received a Naji Naaman Literary Prize (honour prize for complete work). Personal life Spears is divorced from Leonard Goldenberg (born 1937), a native of Montreal, with whom she had three sons. One of their sons, Daniel Goldenberg (born 1960 in Canada), is a self-taught artist living and working in Copenhagen. The University of British Columbia is the repository for the Heather Spears archive.

His explorations of 1893‚Äì1895 were important in declaring Canada's sovereignty over the Arctic, and eventually defining the border between Quebec and Labrador. He was born in Montreal, Quebec, and attended McGill University, graduating in 1882. He moved to Ottawa, Ontario to work as a surveyor and explorer with the Geological Survey of Canada. Low was recognized by senior officials for his excellent work and handed a series of scientific assignments in the North. Although his career is dotted with distinguished work, Low is perhaps best remembered as the commander of a 1903-04 Dominion expedition to declare Canada's authority over the Arctic, a journey that resulted in a bestselling book, The Cruise of the Neptune. In 1906, he was appointed director of the Geological Survey of Canada. In 1907, he became the first deputy minister of the Department of Mines. He retired from the department in 1913. He died in Ottawa in 1942. Low was also an athlete, and he played ice hockey for two famous teams, the McGill University Hockey Club, considered the first organized hockey club in the world, and the Ottawa Hockey Club. In 1883, he played goaltender for the victorious McGill Hockey Club in the 1883 Montreal Winter Carnival. The championship is considered the first Canadian championship. After moving to Ottawa in 1883, he was a founding member of the Ottawa Hockey Club, formed within weeks of the 1883 tournament. In 1884, he would return to the Montreal Winter Carnival tournament as Ottawa's goaltender and shutout McGill. He was a member of the Ottawa Hockey Club until 1889. Aplowite, which is a transparent, pink-coloured cobalt mineral, is named in his honour.

He won silver medals in the individual road race and the team road race. In 1914, after he retired from racing, he established a bicycle manufacturing business (F.H.Grubb) in Brixton, London. By 1920 manufacturing had moved to Croydon and then in 1926 to Twickenham. In 1935 FHG Ltd was established in Wimbledon but by 1947 the F H Grubb name was back in use. Two years after his death the business was bought by Holdsworth, which used the Freddie Grubb brand until around 1978. Cycling career Born in Kingston, Surrey in 1887, Freddie Grubb was a leading rider when cycle-racing in Britain was limited to time-trials and track racing. A writer said of him in 1910: \\"Since August Bank Holiday he has been the most talked-of cyclist in Great Britain... and it is safe to say that no man since Harry Green has shown more brilliant promise\\". Grubb was teetotal and a vegetarian.Sykes, Herbie. (2013). Maglia Rosa 2nd Edition: Triumph and Tragedy at the Giro D'Italia. Bloomsbury Publishing. p. 23. He rode for the Vegetarian Cycle and Athletic Club. He broke the 100-mile time-trial record in 1910 on a fixed-wheel bike with no brakes. The Vegetarian club historian, Peter Duncan, said: \\"He has no brakes; traffic was so light he saw no need for them.\\" Riding a fixed wheel, or direct gearing between the pedals and the back wheel, would have given him limited braking but not enough for an emergency stop. Grubb rode the distance in less than five hours. The distance had already been ridden in less than five hours by \\"Goss\\" Green during a record attempt from London to Brighton and back over 104 miles; his finishing time showed he had ridden 100 miles in less than five hours but he was denied the 100-mile record because he had not been timed at that distance.The Bicycle, 15 July 1942, p6 Grubb's ride was the first to be formally timed. Grubb set a record for 12 hours in the Anerley event near Liverpool in 1911. The organizers had set a course of 210 miles, further than they expected any rider to go. It had to be extended to allow Grubb to ride 220.5 miles. The second rider, Charlie Davey, also beat the club's plans and finished in 215.5 miles. Grubb set a record of 351 miles for a 24-hour time-trial on the track. It was broken by Henrik Mor√©n with 375.6 miles in 1912. Grubb's 5h 9m 41s for London to Brighton and back stood for 14 years. He rode a Triumph bicycle with a reinforced frame to withstand his style of forcing round big gears. He won two silver medals in the Olympic Games in Stockholm in 1912. He turned professional in 1914. Cycling reported: Grubb was considered for the New York, Paris and Berlin six-day races. He rode briefly on the continent, starting in the 1914 Giro d'Italia before returning disillusioned. The venture ended his cycling because rules denied professionals the right to ride again as an amateur. Cycle trade Grubb opened a cycle business in Brixton, south London, in 1914 but the First World War started. Peter Duncan said: Grubb opened another shop after the war, with money from his clubmate Charlie Davey. Grubb went into partnership with Ching Allin in 1919, forming Allin & Grubb of 132 Whitehorse Road, Croydon. The two split in a row over cycle design. Allin & Grubb became A. H. Allin and began selling Davey cycles rather than Grubb. The cycle-trade historian Mick Butler, who called Grubb \\"not a very likable character\\", said:Quick release wheels can be attached and detached faster than the nut and bolt of other wheels, an advantage when changing a punctured tyre during a raceCycling historian Mick Butler also noted that the earliest reference for 'quick release wheels' that could be verified was Cycling, 4 March 1920 p XVI. An advert declared Grubb Racing Cycles ‚Äì with the simplest quickest form of quick release wheels ‚Äì Allin & Grubb, 132 Whitehorse Road, Croydon. The same issue of Cycling also contains an advert for 'F.H.Grubb, 250 London Road, Croydon', (just around the corner from Allin & Grubb) which goes on to state \\"no connection with any other firm\\" so it would seem they had already parted company or all was not quite well. Butler added: Grubb opened another business under his own name in London Road, West Croydon, in 1920 and by 1924 had a shop at Robsart Street, Brixton. In 1934 Grubb advertised that his business was in liquidation. He then opened another company, FHG, at 147a Haydons Road, Wimbledon, with 20 staff from the former venture. Grubb died on 6 March 1949, aged 61, in north-east Surrey and his family continued the business. The Holdsworth company bought the Grubb name in 1952.

As he was the sole compiler for 68 years, the crossword itself became known as \\"the Crosaire\\" by metonymy. It is a cryptic crossword, in contrast to the \\"Simplex crossword\\" which soon came to be published alongside it. Crozier's pseudonym \\"Crosaire\\" is a play on his own surname and crosaire, the Irish for \\"crossroads\\". He retained an idiosyncratic approach to compilation; his crosswords never came to conform to the standards developed in Britain by \\"Ximenes\\". The day he died saw puzzle No 14,120 published; The Irish Times crossword editor estimated there were a year's worth of his puzzles remaining to be published. He was born in Dublin and educated at Castle Park preparatory school in Dalkey and Repton School in England. He graduated from Trinity College, Dublin in 1940. He worked in administration at the Guinness Brewery in St. James's Gate. He was introduced to editor Bertie Smyllie at an Irish Times party in a Dublin pub on Christmas Eve 1942, where he mentioned his hobby of compiling crosswords. Smyllie commissioned him and the first Crosaire was printed on 13 March 1943. Initially it appeared weekly on Saturdays, with Wednesdays added in 1950, Tuesdays in 1955, and a daily puzzle from 1982. In 1948 Crozier emigrated to Southern Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe, to work as a tobacco and maize farmer in Sinoia, now Chinhoyi. He found farming difficult and the meagre income from his puzzles was important. In the 1962 Southern Rhodesian general election, he stood for the United Federal Party in the Gwebi constituency, losing to Rhodesian Front candidate James Graham, 7th Duke of Montrose. From 1963 to 1989, he taught at St George's College in Salisbury, now Harare. His puzzles were often delivered to Ireland through visitors from abroad to avoid the vagaries of the Zimbabwe postal system. He travelled to Dublin in 1993 for the 50th anniversary of his first puzzle, during which he appeared on The Late Late Show and at a forum for 400 fans chosen by lottery. He died at his home in Nyanga, aged 92. A memorial service was held at St George's College, attended by his three sons. Roy Earle (using the pseudonym Mac An Iarla) took over as the compiler of the Crosaire following Crozier's death, with his crosswords appearing between Monday, 24 October 2011 and Saturday, 9 June 2012.

Campbell, 461 U.S. 458 (1983), is a United States Supreme Court case concerning whether the United States Secretary of Health and Human Services could rely on published medical-vocational guidelines to determine a claimant‚Äôs right to Social Security benefits.  Background  In 1978, the Secretary of Health and Human Services promulgated regulations in order to implement the statutory definition of disability. People who were disabled were separated into two groups: those who could not perform any gainful work and those with less severe impairments. For this second group, the Secretary promulgated guidelines to examine whether the claimant could perform either his former work or some less demanding employment by creating a matrix that evaluated four factors that had been identified by Congress: physical ability, age, education, and work experience. Information was also compiled about what jobs were available. Carmen Campbell claimed she had a back condition that kept her from working at her former job as a hotel maid. Ms. Campbell had been born in Panama, and though she had limited ability to speak and write English, she could read and understand English fairly well. The administrative law judge in her case found that by using the guidelines, there were a significant number of jobs that existed that Ms. Campbell could perform and concluded that she was not disabled. Ms. Campbell's case was appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit which reversed the decision, saying that the guidelines did not provide evidence that specific alternative jobs existed, and that the determination that Ms. Campbell was not disabled was not supported by substantial evidence as required by the Social Security Act.  Opinion of the Court  In an opinion delivered by Justice Powell, the Supreme Court reversed the Second Circuit, saying that ‚Äú[w]here the statute expressly entrusts the Secretary with the responsibility for implementing a provision by regulation, review is limited to determining whether the regulations promulgated exceeded the Secretary‚Äôs statutory authority and whether they are arbitrary and capricious.‚Äù The Court decided that even where an agency's enabling statute expressly required that it hold a hearing, the agency could rely on its rulemaking authority to determine issues that didn't require case- by-case considerations. The court held that the Secretary‚Äôs reliance on the guidelines were not inconsistent with the Social Security Act, nor were they arbitrary and capricious. Justice Brennan concurred but pointed out that the record contained very little evidence about Campbell's ability to do \\"light work.\\" Justice Marshall dissented essentially on the same grounds.

He played fullback for the University of Iowa in 1942 and 1946 and for the Los Angeles Rams from 1947 to 1951. He helped lead the Rams to three consecutive National Football League championship games from 1949 to 1951, played for the 1951 Los Angeles Rams team that won the 1951 NFL Championship Game, and was selected to play in the inaugural 1951 Pro Bowl. He was the Rams' all-time leading rusher at the end of his playing career with the team. He concluded his professional football career as a member of the Dallas Texans in 1952. Iowa A native of Dubuque, Iowa, Hoerner was a state track champion while attending Dubuque High School. He also led Dubuque to Mississippi Valley Conference championships in 1939 and 1940 and was twice selected as an All-Iowa player. He enrolled at the University of Iowa in 1941 and played for the Iowa Hawkeyes football team as a sophomore in 1942. He ran 88 yards for a touchdown against Fritz Crisler's 1942 Michigan Wolverines. In May 1943, Hoerner was inducted into the U.S. Army. After missing three years due to war-time service, including service overseas in the field artillery, Hoerner returned to the Iowa Hawkeyes football team in 1946. Los Angeles Rams Hoerner was drafted by the Los Angeles Rams and played for the team from 1947 through 1951.\\"PASSINGS: Dick Hoerner, John A. Ferraro\\" Los Angeles Times 15 December 2010 After he signed with the Rams, the Los Angeles Times touted his potential: \\"When you find a 6-foot, 4-inch, 220-pounder that can move, you have something. But when you run across one who is downright fast, can handle himself like a 160-pounder and can kick and pass to boot, they you have Lester (Dick) Hoerner, the Los Angeles Rams' great fullback prospect.\\" As a rookie in 1947, he was sidelined by a broken foot in an October 1947 game against the Chicago Cardinals. In 1948, Hoerner was the Ram's leading rusher with 354 yards and average of 4.7 yards per carry that ranked 4th in the NFL. In a November 1948 game against the New York Giants, he tied a club record with three rushing touchdowns and was described as \\"unstoppable.\\" Hoerner also played linebacker for the Rams. In December 1948, the Los Angeles Times wrote that Hoerner was a \\"6 foot 4 inch speedster\\" and \\"a murderous line backer.\\" In June 1949, Hoerner signed a 1949 contract with the Rams. The Los Angeles Times reported that he was both the fastest man on the team and \\"by far the hardest hitting.\\" The Times noted that Hoerner had been \\"coveted by more rival National Football League clubs than any other member of the Los Angeles Rams.\\" He helped lead the Rams to the 1949 NFL Championship Game, led all fullbacks in rushing during the 1949 NFL season and ranked among the league's leaders in rushing yards (6th, 582 yards) and yards from scrimmage (7th, 795 yards). In 1950, Hoerner helped lead the Rams to their second consecutive NFL championship game. He scored 11 touchdowns, the second highest total in the NFL, and was selected to play in the inaugural 1951 Pro Bowl. He also totaled 827 yards from scrimmage in 1950, with 381 rushing yards and 446 receiving yards. In November 1950, Frank Finch of the Los Angeles Times wrote: \\"Many stars have twinkled for the Rams this season, but none more brilliantly than Dick Hoerner. Off the field the 220-yard Ram fullback wears glasses, but on the field he wears a mean expression with a disposition to match.\\" In the 1950 NFL Championship Game, Hoerner scored two touchdowns and accounted for 86 of the Rams' 106 rushing yards, but the Rams lost in a close game to the Cleveland Browns by the score of 30‚Äì28. After the 1950 season, the Los Angeles Times wrote that, although he had been dogged by injuries in 1947 and 1948, \\"the giant Hoerner has been probably the hardest running fullback in the league since.\\" In his final year with the Rams, Hoerner helped lead the 1951 Rams to the NFL championship as part of the Rams' famed \\"Bull Elephant\\" backfield along with Paul \\"Tank\\" Younger and \\"Deacon\\" Dan Towler. Hoerner rushed for 569 yards in 1951, ranking 7th in the NFL. He also averaged 6.1 yards per carry, the 4th best average in the league, and scored a touchdown in the 1951 NFL Championship Game against the Cleveland Browns. Tank Younger, who in 1949 became the first NFL player from a historically black college, recalled that Hoerner pitched in unselfishly to help Younger learn Clark Shaughnessy's offensive system, even though they were both competing for the same position. Interviewed in 1970, Younger noted, \\"I used to go up to Dick's room every afternoon to study the offensive formation and the terminology. Dick helped me a great deal.\\" After five seasons with the Rams, Hoerner was the team's all-time career leader with 2,020 rushing yards. He also held the Rams' record for most rushing attempts in a season (455 attempts in 1949) and ranked second in team history in touchdowns scored in a single season behind Elroy \\"Crazy Legs\\" Hirsch. Dallas Texans In June 1952, Hoerner was traded to the Dallas Texans as part of an 11-for-1 deal that sent Les Richter to the Rams. The trade was described as \\"unquestionably the biggest shift of pigskin personnel in National Football League history.\\" When Hoerner returned to Los Angeles as a member of the Texans, he expressed his desire to prove that the Rams had erred in trading him: > \\"Hoerner gladly would sacrifice his right arm all the way up to the armpit > to squash a few Rams and score a couple of touchdowns by way of informing > the Ram high command that they were plain loco when they cut him loose. And > as an added incentive to make his personal crusade, the terrible-tempered > neo-Texan has all the warm affection for his old backfield coach, J. Hampton > Pool, that a cobra has for a mongoose.\\" The Texans compiled a record of 1‚Äì11‚Äì0 in 1952, and Hoerner rushed for 162 yards and a career-low 2.9 yards per carry. After only one season, the Dallas Texans moved to Baltimore to become the Colts, and Hoerner signed in the spring of 1953 with the Detroit Lions. However, Hoerner retired from football in July 1953 before appearing in any regular season games with the Lions. Later years After retiring from football, Hoerner went into business in Southern California where he specialized in turning around struggling businesses, taking them \\"out of the red and into the black.\\" Hoerner died in December 2010 at age 88 after suffering a stroke. He was survived by his wife, Kathy, daughters, Cecilia Hoerner, Leslie Hoerner, and Louise Hubbard, five grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.

He served as Bishop of Dodge City from 1960 to 1976, after which he served as an auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of Kansas City in Kansas (1976‚Äì1986). At the time of his death, he was the oldest Catholic bishop in the United States. Biography One of eight children, Marion Forst was born in St. Louis, Missouri, to Frank and Bertha (n√©e Gulath) Forst. An uncle and two brothers were also priests. He learned to serve as an altar boy in the first grade, and by the time he was in fourth grade he was teaching other boys how to serve. He studied at Kenrick Seminary in Webster Groves, and was ordained to the priesthood by Archbishop John J. Glennon on June 10, 1934. He then served as a curate at Blessed Sacrament Church in Denver, Colorado, until 1936, when he returned to Missouri to serve at Queen of Peace Church in Glendale. He was a curate at St. Theresa Church in St. Louis (1943‚Äì1946) before serving as a chaplain to the United States Navy from 1946 to 1949. He became rector of St. Mary Cathedral in Cape Girardeau in 1949, and was named vicar general of the newly erected Diocese of Springfield- Cape Girardeau in 1956. On January 2, 1960, Forst was appointed the second Bishop of Dodge City, Kansas, by Pope John XXIII. He received his episcopal consecration on the following March 24 from Bishop Charles Herman Helmsing, with Bishops Mark Kenny Carroll and Leo Christopher Byrne serving as co- consecrators. Between 1962 and 1965, he attended all four sessions of the Second Vatican Council, which he described as \\"the paramount event of all [his] episcopal years...[and] the best thing that happened to the church in the 20th century.\\" During his tenure, he established several new offices and ministries in the diocese, including Catholic Social Service, the Office of Religious Education, Family Life Office, Religious Education for the Handicapped, the Southwest Kansas Register diocesan newspaper, Office of Mexican American Affairs, and the Youth/Young Adults Office. He was an opponent of denying federal aid to private schools, which he believed was \\"a smoke screen\\" designed \\"to get rid of these schools.\\" After sixteen years as head of the Diocese of Dodge City, Forst retired due to poor health on October 16, 1976. He was named Auxiliary Bishop of Kansas City in Kansas and Titular Bishop of Scala by Pope Paul VI on the same date. He remained in this capacity for ten years, when he resigned both posts on December 23, 1986. Forst later died at Olathe Medical Center, aged 96. At the time of his death, he was the oldest Catholic bishop in the United States; Archbishop Peter Leo Gerety assumed that distinction upon Forst's death.

The characters can be assorted on the board and can be picked separately and then typed. A Chinese typewriter is a typewriter that can type Chinese script. Early European typewriters began appearing in the early 19th century. However, as the Chinese language uses a logographic writing system, fitting thousands of Chinese characters on the machine needed much more complex engineering than typewriters using a simple latin alphabet, or other non-logographic scripts.Jing Tsu, \\"Lin Yutang's Typewriter,\\" in Sound and Script in Chinese Diaspora (Harvard University Press, 2010; ), pp. 49‚Äì79. An ordinary Chinese printing office uses 6,000 Chinese characters. Chinese typewriters, and similar Japanese typewriters invented by Kyota Sugimoto, which use kanji adopted from the Chinese writing system, started to appear only in the early 20th century. There have been at least five dozen different versions of Chinese typewriters, ranging from sizable mechanical models to sophisticated electric word processors.  Hou-Kun Chow Tong-Zhi typewriter  Hou-Kun Chow, inventor of the first Chinese typewriter Hou-Kun Chow (), a mechanical engineer in Shanghai, is credited with inventing the first Chinese typewriter in 1916. His typewriter utilized 4,000 characters. He had studied in the United States like several other Chinese who also contributed to the development of Chinese typewriters. Chow first thought about the practicality of a Chinese typewriter in Boston, while he was inspecting American typewriters as a student of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. His efforts were initially hindered by a lack of technical assistance in Shanghai. Chow considered it impossible to build a Chinese typewriter with separate keys for each Chinese character. The solution was a mechanical typewriter using a revolving cylinder to fit Chinese characters on the machine. They were ordered by radicals and number of strokes on the cylinder, in a manner similar to Chinese dictionaries. This design however proved heavy, the machine initially weighing at and an improved version at about . Chow expected his typewriter to be used in Chinese offices where multiple copies of documents would be required to be made, and by Chinese living in foreign countries due to their lack of access to the services of skilled writers familiar with Chinese characters. Wanneng and Flying Pigeon typewriters Chinese typewriters made in Japan entered the market in the 1920s, with the Wanneng () brand, introduced by the Nippon Typewriter Company in 1940 during the Second Sino- Japanese War, becoming the de facto standard.https://www.lrb.co.uk/v40/n05/jamie-fisher/the-left-handed-kid After Japan's defeat and the subsequent nationalization of typewriter companies by the Communist government, locally made models based on the Wanneng continued to dominate the market, particularly the Double Pigeon ().  Ming Kwai typewriter  Ming Kwai typewriter invented by Lin Yutang as it appears in the United States patent The Ming Kwai typewriter is an electromechanical typewriter invented and patented by Lin Yutang. The patent, No. 2613795, was filed on April 17, 1946 by Lin, and was issued by the United States Patent and Trademark Office on October 14, 1952. One of Lin's intentions was to help modernize China. Lin called his design the \\"Ming Kwai\\" typewriter and promoted it as \\"The Only Chinese Typewriter Designed for Everybody's Use\\". The two Chinese characters \\"Ming kwai\\" () means \\"clear\\" (as in understandable) and \\"quick\\". Lin had a prototype machine custom built by the Carl E. Krum Company, a small engineering-design consulting firm with an office in New York City. That multilingual typewriter was the size of a conventional office typewriter of the 1940s. It measured . The typefaces fit on a drum. A \\"magic eye\\" was mounted in the center of the keyboard which magnifies and allows the typist to review a selected character. Characters are selected by first pressing two keys to choose a desired character which is arranged according to a system Lin devised for his dictionary of the Chinese language. The selected Chinese character appeared in the magic eye for preview, the typist then pressed a \\"master\\" key, similar to today's computer function key. The typewriter could create 90,000 distinct characters using either one or two of six character- containing rollers, which in combination has 7000 full characters and 1,400 character radicals or partial characters. The inspired aspect of the typewriter was the system Lin devised for a Chinese script. It had thirty geometric shapes or strokes (somewhat analogous to the elements of a glyph). These became \\"letters\\" by which to alphabetize Chinese characters. He broke tradition with the long-standing system of radicals and stroke order writing and categorizing of Chinese characters, inventing a new way of seeing and categorizing. The typewriter was not produced commercially. According to Lin's daughter, Lin Tai-Yi, the day she was to demonstrate the machine to executives of the Remington Typewriter Company, they could not make it work. Although they did get the machine fixed for a press conference the next day, it was to no avail. Lin found himself deeply in debt. In 1947, Lin paid income taxes owed to the Internal Revenue Service and went to work in Paris for UNESCO.  Cultural and technological impact  Between the 1930s and 1950s, Chinese typewriters had a political implication, as they were used in mass-production of leaflets and pamphlets. The typewriters also gained popular appeal and changed Chinese office work. According to Thomas Mullaney, it is possible that development of modern Chinese typewriters in the 1960s and 1970s influenced the development of modern computer word processors and even affected the development of computers themselves. In the 1950s, typists came to rearrange the character layout from the standard dictionary layout to groups of common words and phrases. Chinese typewriter engineers were trying to make the most common characters be accessible at the fastest speed possible by word prediction, a technique used today in Chinese input methods for computers, as well as in text messaging in many languages. This arrangement was called the lianxiang (‚Äúconnected thought‚Äù) layout, similar to predictive text and sped typing speeds from about 20 words per minute to around 80. Chinese typewriter has become a metaphor for absurdity, complexity and backwardness in Western popular culture. One such example is MC Hammer's dance move named after the Chinese typewriter in the music video for \\"U Can't Touch This\\". The move, with its fast paced and large gestures, supposedly resembles a person working on a huge, complex typewriter. The Chinese typewriter was ultimately eclipsed and made redundant with the introduction of computerised word processing, pioneered by engineer and dissident Wan Runnan and his partners when they formed Stone Emerging Industries Company () in 1984 in Zhongguancun, China's \\"Silicon Valley\\". The last Chinese typewriters were completed around 1991. Stone developed software based on Alps Electric custom made 8088 based hardware with a Brother Industries dot matrix printer, distributed by Mitsui, to print Chinese characters and released the system as the MS-2400.

In the poem Wordsworth castigates the English people as stagnant and selfish, and eulogises seventeenth-century poet John Milton. Composed in 1802, \\"London, 1802\\" was published for the first time in Poems, in Two Volumes (1807). Structure and synopsis Wordsworth begins the poem by wishing that Milton were still alive, for \\"England hath need of thee.\\" This is because it is his opinion that England has stagnated morally by comparison to Milton's period. To this end, Wordsworth pleads for Milton to rather messianically \\"raise us up, return to us again; / And give us manners, virtue, freedom, power.\\" In the six subsequent lines (the sestet) following the first eight lines (the octave), Wordsworth explains why Milton could improve the English condition. Milton's soul, he explains, was as bright and noble as a star and \\"dwelt apart\\" from the crowd, not feeling the urge to conform to norms. Milton's voice resembled \\"the sea\\", \\"pure as the naked heavens, majestic, free\\". Furthermore, Milton never disdained the ordinary nature of life, but instead \\"travel[ed] on life's common way\\", remaining happy, pure (cheerful godliness), and humble (taking the \\"lowliest duties\\" on himself). \\"London, 1802\\" reveals both Wordsworth's moralism and his growing conservatism.Phillips, Brian.\\"London, 1802\\". \\"SparkNote on Wordsworth's Poetry\\". Retrieved on 17 August 2007. Wordsworth frequently sought to \\"communicate natural morality to his readers\\" through his poetry. In this sonnet, he urges morality and selflessness to his readers, criticising the English for being stagnant and selfish, for lacking \\"manners, virtue, [and] freedom.\\" But he also refers to \\"inward happiness\\" as a natural English right, or \\"dower,\\" and asks Milton to bestow \\"power\\" as well as virtue on the English. These are among Wordsworth's \\"few explicitly nationalistic verses‚Äîshades, perhaps, of the conservatism that took hold in his old age.\\" While it is common, and perhaps correct, to equate nationalism with conservatism in the modern era, it is hard to suggest that nationalism functioned that way in the Romantic context. The kind of nationalism Wordsworth proposed in the poem had something of a revolutionary nature to it. Wordsworth himself implies in a footnote to the poem that it could be read in such a manner, \\"written immediately after my return from France to London, when I could not but be struck, as here described, with the vanity and parade of our own country . . . as contrasted with the quiet, and I may say the desolation, that the revolution had produced in France.\\"Norton Anthology of English Literature. Eighth Edition, Volume 2. (2006) p.319 footnote 6 The moralism and nationalism of the poem occur simultaneously with and perhaps are the occasion for a call to overthrow the current social and political order, as had recently been done in France. Whether or not Wordsworth wanted the poem to be interpreted in such a way can and is called into question later in his note. Themes include morality, humanity, nature/the natural environment. He then tells Milton that his \\"soul was like a Star,\\" because he was different even from his contemporaries in terms of the virtues listed above. The speaker tells Milton that his voice was like the sea and the sky, a part of nature and therefore natural: \\"majestic, free.\\" The speaker also compliments Milton's ability to embody \\"cheerful godliness\\" even while doing the \\"lowliest duties.\\" As stated above the speaker on several instances refers to Milton as a celestial being. Analysis \\"London, 1802\\" is a Petrarchan sonnet with a rhyme scheme of abba abba cdd ece. The poem is written in the second person and addresses the late poet John Milton, who lived from 1608‚Äì1674 and is most famous for having written Paradise Lost. The poem has two main purposes, one of which is to pay homage to Milton by saying that he can save the entirety of England with his nobility and virtue. The other purpose of the poem is to draw attention to what Wordsworth feels are the problems with English society. According to Wordsworth, England was once a great place of happiness, religion, chivalry, art, and literature, but at the present moment those virtues have been lost. Wordsworth can only describe modern England as a swampland, where people are selfish and must be taught about things like \\"manners, virtue, freedom, power.\\" Notice that Wordsworth compliments Milton by comparing him to things found in nature, such as the stars, the sea, and \\"the heavens.\\" For Wordsworth, being likened to nature is the highest compliment possible.

Notable Maverick programmes include the health brand Embarrassing Bodies, the make- over shows 10 Years Younger and How to Look Good Naked, and the documentary series Stephen Fry: Out There and Growing Up Down's. Maverick is particularly well known for its multiplatform projects: developing apps, websites and YouTube channels in conjunction with its TV content. In 2007, Maverick was bought by independent production and distribution company All3Media. Maverick has offices in Birmingham, London and Los Angeles. Television shows Maverick Television mainly produces factual and factual-entertainment shows.  Embarrassing Bodies  Embarrassing Bodies is a reality medical series broadcast by Channel 4. It is presented by a team of doctors who look to help people with 'embarrassing' body parts and so de-stigmatise medical conditions. Each series has its own health awareness agenda. In July 2014, the seventh series of Embarrassing Bodies began airing.  Operation Ouch!  Operation Ouch! is a factual entertainment show for kids about the human body. It is presented by identical twins Dr. Chris and Dr. Xand Van Tulleken and broadcast on CBBC.  Growing Up Down's  Growing Up Down's is a one-hour documentary which follows a theatre troupe of young adults with Down's as they put together a touring production of Hamlet. For TV critic Keith Watson, the acting troupe was 'in the perfect position to relate to 'the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune. Growing Up Down's was produced and directed by William Jessop, the brother of Tommy Jessop who plays Hamlet, and broadcast by BBC Three in February 2014.  The Model Agency  The Model Agency is a seven part observational documentary series that follows the dramas of Premier Model Management, a world-famous model agency based in London. The series sought the insights of both agency staff and the models signed with them. It covered such events as the attempts to launch the careers of two new models during New York Fashion week and the agency's preparation for London Fashion Week. In the final episode, Premier staff reflect on their experiences of being caught up in the 2010 Blood Diamond scandal; Carole White, Premier's co-founder, also reflects on her relationship with Naomi Campbell, who first signed for the agency. Channel 4 claims that The Model Agency was filmed by a multi-camera documentary rig that was used in a commercial environment for the first time. The series was broadcast by Channel 4 in February‚ÄìApril 2011.  Chrisley Knows Best  Chrisley Knows Best marks Maverick's first major American TV series; it broadcasts on the USA Network. Chrisley is a reality TV series that follows the lives of multi-millionaire Todd Chris, his wife Julie and their family.

Born This Way  In 2015, Channel 4 is set to broadcast Born This Way, a series in which Dr. Dawn Harper and Dr. Ravi Jayaram investigate the medical and behavioural causes for the conduct of children brought to the show by worried parents.  TV titles =Multiplatform Headed by Dan Jones, Maverick's multiplatform products and innovations have won 4 BAFTAs, an Emmy, 5 Royal Television Society Awards, 2 Broadcast Digital Awards, 2 British Interactive Media Association awards, and a World Media Award. Multiplatform refers to the distribution of content across a range of media outlets and also to the development of the content for each of those outlets. Maverick's involvement with the project A Field in England is a good example. The film was distributed in cinemas, on TV, online and on DVD, all on the same day in July 2013; the film was developed alongside an online \\"Digital Masterclass\\" which included extra videos, unedited rushes, available production documents, a crew who's-who list, a step-by-step guide to the advertising poster's development, commentaries from the creative team, a glossary of terms and a historical A-Z of the film's setting. As a result of these additional online developments, the film was able to be used both as entertainment content and as a very thorough educational resource for film- makers in training.  Apps  Maverick Television has launched a number of apps for download and use on tablets and smart phones. In conjunction with the TV series Embarrassing Bodies, Maverick has launched a suite of health apps: My HealthChecker, My MoleChecker, My SelfChecker, My RiskChecker and My MindChecker. In various way, the apps allow users to test their health, better positioning them to know whether they need to change lifestyle, visit a doctor or relax about what they perceive as symptoms. The data, collected anonymously, is also used to better inform researchers about public health trends. In addition to these medical tester apps, Maverick released a game app in 2014 in association with the same TV series called Angry Boils. Maverick developed Reverse The Odds, a free puzzle game, with Chunk Digital for Channel 4. the game is a partnership with Cancer Research UK and Zooniverse. The smartphone game aids in the work of Cancer Research UK by analysing real cancer slides as they progress through the game story. The more people play the game, and the longer they play for, the more Cancer Research UK's scientists are helped. In April 2015 the game won the 'Digital Program: Children & Young People‚Äô category in the 2015 International Digital Emmys at MIPTV‚Äôs Opening night festivities in Cannes. The game was nominated in the Digital Creativity category of the 2015 Television Craft BAFTAshttp://awards.bafta.org/award/2015/tvcraft as well as being on the official Shortlist for the 2015 Cannes Lionshttp://www.canneslionsarchive.com/winners/entry/569502/reverse-the-odds and winning Best Game and Best Content Partnership at the Broadcast Digital Awards 2015.http://www.broadcastdigitalawards.co.uk/winners2015 Since it launched in October 2014 over 3 million slides have been analysed by players across the globe. The game was highlighted as an example of best practice by Baroness Martha Lane-Fox as part of the 2015 Dimbleby Lecturehttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b05p9tvt on BBC One.  Social Media  Maverick has also developed TV content best suited to the uptake of social media. Was It Something I Said?, a comedy panel game, was the first TV programme derived solely from a Channel 4 online commission. The content for the questions was based around quotations provided to the show by the users of the website Quotables while the game could also be played via Twitter where the questions for the panel were also uploaded for Twitter users to answer without leaving their social media stream. Users of the Quotables website could contribute to the content of the panel show while users of Twitter received a scorecard which in turn led to online extras, such as extra videos from host David Mitchell. Finally, funny moments from the show were released in GIF form through Tumblr for re-blogging. Mahagonny was a project for Sky Arts designed to run alongside the opera run of Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny at the Olympia Theatre, Dublin. Maverick created a parallel-running storyline with two new characters which unfolded across a range of social media websites and fictional webpages.  Fresh Meat Unlocked  Fresh Meat Unlocked and Fresh Meat House were developed to provide additional digital content for fans of the Channel 4 comedy-drama series Fresh Meat. Fresh Meat Unlocked provides access to the characters' smartphones in tandem with the narrative developments of the series so as to enhance those storylines.  Embarrassing Bodies Online  \\"Embarrassing Bodies Online\\" is a BAFTA-winning interactive website which offers a host of health information through networked video, games, applications as well as through easy-to-understand guides. The website has generated over 250 million page views from 25 million users; its videos have received 10 million views on the website (and a further 100 million views through YouTube).  YouTube channels  Maverick has developed a number of YouTube channels: The You Generation ‚Äì The You Generation is a global online talent hunt, fronted by Simon Cowell and featuring a number of YouTube stars and celebrities.

Like his brothers, Christopher and Frank, Felix was educated at Haverford College and enjoyed a Rhodes Scholarship to Oxford, England. He obtained a Guggenheim Fellowship to study the League of Nations in Geneva, Switzerland, which resulted in his book The Society of Nations (1933) and a Ph.D. from the Brookings Institution.

The game is the sequel to cult video game ToeJam & Earl, released in 1991. The game concerns two alien protagonists, ToeJam and Earl, both of whom have escaped from Earth, where they had crash landed. After returning to their home planet of Funkotron, the duo discover a number of antagonistic Earthlings have stowed away on the spacecraft and are wreaking havoc across the planet. The player must hunt down these Earthlings and imprison them in jars before sending them back to Earth. The game's platform format was a departure from the original ToeJam & Earl, a treasure hunt game with randomly generated levels, inspired by the game Rogue. Creators Greg Johnson and Mark Voorsanger originally began designing a game built on the concepts of the original, but changed to a more generic type of game due to a lack of support for their vision on the part of Sega. The game was critically well received, with reviewers praising the graphics, soundtrack, fluid action and two-player mode. It was also a commercial success, but fans of ToeJam & Earl were disappointed and confused by the radical change in direction. Since its release, ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron has been criticized for being too sharp a departure from the first game, and some later reviewers felt that the developers had been more interested in the publisher's wishes than the fans. Johnson and Voorsanger have stated they regret moving away from their prototype sequel in the vein of ToeJam & Earl. Research has suggested that a significant minority of fans favor ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron as the best in the series.Levi Buchanan, ToeJam & Earl Favorites, IGN, Jan 20, 2009, Accessed Apr 19, 2009 Together with its predecessor, the game comprises one of the Mega Drive's \\"key exclusive franchises\\", which eventually spawned a third installment in 2002, albeit a commercial failure with mixed reviews. ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron was re-released in 2007 for the Wii's Virtual Console, receiving mixed reviews. The game was released on PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade alongside its prequel in November 2012. In August 2014, ToeJam & Earl 2 was listed on GamesRadar at #10 on \\"Best Sega Genesis/Mega Drive games of all time\\". Plot The game follows on the events of the first game, in which funky aliens ToeJam and Earl crash landed on Earth. After managing to rebuild their spaceship and returning safely to their home planet of Funkotron, the duo soon learn that a bunch of Earthlings had stowed away on their craft and have now invaded Funkotron. With the humans spreading panic across the planet's citizens, even scaring the source of all funk, Lamont the Funkapotomus, away to another dimension, it is up to ToeJam and Earl to clean up the mess they've made and send all the Earthlings they brought with them back to where they came from.Kristan Reed, Virtual Console: SEGA Mega Drive, Eurogamer, Jan 23, 2007, Accessed Apr 8, 2009 Gameplay ToeJam (right) and Earl (left) leap over an antagonistic Earthling (below Earl). Unlike its predecessor, Panic on Funkotron is a side-scrolling platform game in which up to two players play as ToeJam and Earl as they travel across Funkotron to capture antagonistic Earthlings that had stowed away. Players accomplish this by using a radar to locate an Earthling's proximity (some Earthlings may be hidden in the environment) and attack them with jars in order to trap and collect them. Once all Earthlings have been found, the player can move on to the next level. Players can collect presents containing various bonuses, such as super jars, radar scans, and teleporting moves. Coins can be used with parking meters to trigger events in the environment or participate in minigames such as Jam Outs and Fungus Olympics. Players can also enter gateways leading to the Hyper Funk Zone, where the player must avoid obstacles in order to earn more presents. Hidden throughout the game are ten objects belonging to Lamont the Funkapotamus; collecting all of which will earn the player the best ending upon completion.ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron , GameZone, July 31, 2009 Development The game is the sequel to ToeJam & Earl, a treasure hunt game inspired by computer game Rogue and featuring randomly generated levels. After the success of the original game, Johnson Voorsanger Productions began work on a sequel in 1992. The developer spent three to four months building on the original mechanics, adding elements such as indoor areas and additional terrain types, though the randomly generated levels were removed. The plot of this prototype would see ToeJam and Earl \\"return to Earth to stage a rap concert, only to find they've lost their CDs\\" which would form the basis of the game's treasure hunt.Travis Fahs, Funkotronics 101, IGN, Jan 15, 2009, Accessed Apr 17, 2009 According to the Johnson and Voorsanger, the game would feature \\"more default items\\" for the characters to \\"use all the time\\", new items and characters, and more detail and secret areas allowed by the fixed (rather than randomly generated) levels. The game employed a larger development team than the first installment and was originally projected for a Christmas 1992 release, and titled ToeJam & Earl 2.\\"Jammin' out with Mark Voorsanger and Greg Johnson\\", Sega Visions, May/June 1992, pp. 38-39 Sega however conferred that they did not \\"understand\\" the game and though the \\"decision was still ultimately with Johnson and Voorsanger\\", the developer started work on a more generic side-scrolling platform game, a concept to which Sega had been more receptive. The increased size of the game's cartridge over the original allowed for greater graphical detail. The soundtrack, including the original theme, was remixed and given a more layered quality. Reception and legacy The game was met with considerable anticipation, positive reviews and commercial success according to IGN, with GamaSutra also recalling a positive critical reaction.Alistair Wallis, Playing Catch Up: ToeJam & Earl's Greg Johnson, GamaSutra, Nov 16, 2006, Accessed Apr 17, 2009 A contemporary review in the Chicago Tribune called it a \\"beautifully designed game\\", as well as praising the Herbie Hancock-inspired soundtrack and non-violent action.Eugenia C. Daniels, \\"Funkotron Game is Hip and Blood-Free\\", Chicago Tribune, Jun 24, 1994, p. 78 The Washington Times also gave a positive verdict, stating: \\"This is one of the funniest games we've ever seen.

A ToeJam & Earl game for the Sega Dreamcast was canceled, but a third instalment, ToeJam & Earl III: Mission to Earth, was eventually released for Microsoft's Xbox in 2002. The game returned to the concepts of the original game, but generated mixed reviews and poor sales. Since its release, ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron \\"has developed a negative reputation as a selling-out of a daring design\\". With hindsight, Johnson and Voorsanger have stated they regret moving from the prototype sequel to a side-scrolling platform game, though Johnson maintains \\"ToeJam & Earl 2 was a very original side-scrolling game\\". Johnson has further asserted that Toyoda Shinobu, who had been Sega's Vice President of Development, \\"admitted that it was probably a mistake on Sega's part to jump to a side- scroller\\". A survey by IGN found that a majority of the franchise's fans favored the original ToeJam & Earl as the best game in the series; however, a significant minority of respondents preferred ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron at 28%.

In May 2006, he wrestled against Eugene in Las Vegas in a match that aired on WWE Heat. After helping Bruce and Ross Hart promote some rural Stampede Wrestling events in Alberta in 2006, Nicholson began promoting for himself in 2007 under the Wrestling Supershow, and later Great North Wrestling banners. The Bad News Allen Tribute Show in May 2007 was his first event, in which Hannibal defeated Abdullah The Butcher in the main event. Nicholson continued to promote events in Alberta and Ontario, and also promoted TNA's December 2007 Canadian tour. In May 2009, Nicholson attended a WWE tryout camp in Tampa, Florida.

The wrestlers agreed to do this (with the other talent encouraging them) to get out of regular training for that day.

Nicholson's claims are supported in this video by many WWE legends including \\"Superstar\\" Billy Graham and The Honky Tonk Man. In July 2011, Nicholson filed a $6.5 million lawsuit against Abdullah over the incident, claiming it had caused WWE to rescind his contract.

Its plot follows a young woman in 1981 who begins prostituting herself and consequently finds herself in a precarious situation after beginning a sexual relationship with one of her customers. Plot In 1981 Leila Murray works as a receptionist in a motel. She begins to offer sexual services to customers in exchange for money. As she explores her sexuality, she discovers within herself an attraction towards semi-rough sex. One of her customers, Gary Jensen, beats her during their first encounter. When he returns to apologize, she accepts and begins to see him again. When one of Leila's other customers gets too rough, Leila flees to Gary's room to seek his consolation and protection. His gentle treatment of her encourages her growing trust in him. Leila's only confidant, outside of Gary, is a little girl that plays around the inn. The girl lives in an unhappy home, where her parents fight constantly. One day, the girl's Uncle Andy takes the child and her mother Bonnie on a roadtrip. In the midst of this trip, the little girl discovers that her mother and her Uncle Andy are having an affair. Meanwhile, Leila has grown very close to Gary, who begins to represent an escape from her passionless marriage and dead-end job. She stops charging him for sex. Despite momentary misgivings about his intentions, his passion convinces her to turn away from her life. She steals the money from the inn, and gives it to Gary, along with her savings acquired through her sexual services of the inn's clients. Together, they drive away in his car to his cabin in the woods. Once there, she is informed by one of Gary's friends that he is a pimp, and that his intention is to sell her services to his friends. Trapped, with no money or means of transportation, she is raped and beaten by a group of men invited by Gary. In the midst of her trauma, her mind turns back to the day in her childhood when her Uncle Andy had taken Leila's mother Bonnie out on a roadtrip and killed Bonnie in a fit of jealousy, right in front of the child Leila. It is thus revealed that Leila 'is' the little girl to whom she had been talking throughout the film. The little girl's broken home life holds the key to Leila's grown-up sexuality. After Leila is raped, one of the men takes pity on her and helps her to escape Gary's cabin. Gary and the men form a search party and comb the woods to find her. The little girl, Leila's child self, appears to Leila to inform her that Gary intends to kill her and that she must fight for her survival. When Gary finds Leila, he is distracted by the distant screaming of the little girl that he can't see, and Leila takes the opportunity to run off and flee to safety in the arms of her friend and co-worker Millie, who had been searching the woods for her, as well. Thus Leila turns her back on Gary and acknowledges the previously-suppressed memories of her past.

Intended as a replacement for the Beriev Be-12 amphibian and the land-based Ilyushin Il-38,Gordon, Sal'nikov and Zablotskiy 2006, p. 49. the project was suspended after only one prototype had been manufactured, with the second one 70% completed, due to the breakup of the Soviet Union.Gordon, Sal'nikov and Zablotskiy 2006, p. 66. The project was later revived and an order has been placed by the Russian Navy. Development The maiden flight was unplanned; during a high-speed taxi test, the airplane became airborne and ran out of runway, with the crew being forced to continue the takeoff. The subsequent flight and landing went without further incident, but the test crew were downgraded from their duties afterwards, despite having saved the aircraft. On 5 September 2008, the deputy commander of Russian Naval Aviation Maj.Gen. Nikolai Kuklev, announced that the A-42 is to be adopted as a main SAR and anti-submarine aircraft of the Russian Navy, and a provisional contract for four SAR-outfitted aircraft has been awarded to the company, with deliveries to start in 2010. All four aircraft were expected to be in service by 2013. The aircraft were to replace the Russian Navy's aging fleet of Be-12 and Il-38 currently in service. On 3 September 2019, the Russian Navy announced an order for three A-42 aircraft, which would probably use two Progress D-27 propfans as the powerplant and have increased range to 9300 km. An estimated service entry date was not provided, though.

Life He was born of Marrano parents at Trancoso, near Celorico, in the province of Beira, Portugal in 1603 or 1604 and died at Verona in 1683. He was an older brother of Abraham Miguel Cardoso. After studying medicine, philosophy, and natural sciences at Salamanca, he settled as physician at Valladolid in 1632, but was soon called as chief physician (physico mor) to Madrid. While there he published in 1632 a lecture on Vesuvius and on the causes of the earthquake, and in 1635 a treatise on the color green, which he dedicated to Isabel Henriques, who was celebrated in the academies of Madrid for her intellect, and who lived later in Amsterdam. In the latter year he also composed a funeral discourse for Lope de Vega, which was dedicated to the Duke de Sessa, and a treatise on the uses of cold water, printed in 1637, and dedicated to King Philip IV of Spain. Fernando (his Marrano name) left Spain, probably to escape from the Inquisition, and went with his brother Miguel, who had also studied medicine, to Venice, where both openly embraced Judaism, Fernando changing his name to \\"Isaac.\\" After a short stay in Venice he settled in Verona, where he remained until his death, highly honored by Jews and Christians. Works Aside from the works already mentioned, Cardoso published a comprehensive treatise on cosmogony, physics, medicine, philosophy, theology, and natural sciences, printed at Venice in 1673 under the title Philosophia Libera in Septem Libros Distributa, and dedicated to the doge and senate of that city. In this work, which critically discusses the various philosophical systems, he appears as a decided opponent of the Kabbalah and of the pseudo-Messiah Sabbatai Zevi, although his brother Miguel was an adherent. Isaac also ridiculed the kabbalistic, Pythagorean doctrine of the transmigration of souls. This \\"learned, God-fearing physician,\\" as he is designated by the pious Moses Hagiz (Mishnat Chakamim, p. 120a) defended his coreligionists in his great work, Las Excelencias y Calunias de los Hebreos, printed in 1679 at Amsterdam, and dedicated March 17, 1678, to Jacob de Pinto. In ten chapters he emphasizes the \\"excelencias\\" (distinguishing features) of the Jews, their selection by God, their separation from all other peoples by special laws, their compassion for the sufferings of others, their philanthropy, chastity, faith, etc.; and in ten other chapters he refutes the \\"calunias\\" (calumnies) brought against them; viz., that they worship false gods, smell badly, are hard and unfeeling toward other peoples, have corrupted Scripture, blaspheme holy images and the host, kill Christian children and use the blood for ritual purposes. This work, which was celebrated by the rabbi J. Brieli of Mantua in a Hebrew sonnet (\\"Otzar Nechmad,\\" iii. 167), was sent by Cardoso soon after its appearance, July 23, 1679, to the rabbi Samuel Aboab in Venice, asking for an opinion. Aboab answered July 31, thanking him for the splendid gift. In another letter to Aboab, December 24, 1679, he gave his views on the derivation of some Spanish words from persons mentioned in the Bible. According to De Barrios, Cardoso also published Varias Poesias (1680).

It lies within the Wendron Mining District of the Cornwall and West Devon Mining Landscape World Heritage Site. Its features include underground guided tours through ancient tin mine workings, a museum of industrial heritage, mining equipment and Cornish social history, a scheduled ancient monument and riverside gardens. It opened in 1972 as Wendron Forge and was later known as Ha'penny Park. After an ancient tin mine was discovered on the site it was renamed after Winston Graham's Poldark novels and the BBC television series that was first broadcast in 1975. The mine was researched by A. K. Hamilton Jenkin, an authority on Cornish mining history, who attributed it to Wheal Roots which had been active in the 18th century. The original owner, Peter Young, sold Poldark Mine in 1988 following which it passed through two owners and declined in popularity. It went into administration for the second time in 2014, and in that year was bought by David Edwards who had been involved with the Ffestiniog Railway and the Llechwedd Slate Caverns in Wales. He said he hoped to keep Poldark Mine as an open-air museum and heritage centre. History of the tourist attraction=Purchase and early history The Greensplat beam engine in 2008 The museum and mine now known as Poldark Mine started life in summer 1966 when Peter Young, a Royal Marine, purchased the local smithy, Wendron Forge, in an auction in the hamlet of Trenear, while on weekend leave.Fyfield-Shayler 1979, pp.4‚Äì5. Young quickly acquired about three acres of adjoining land which were separated by a large furniture store which was formerly a dairy and originally part of the Wendron Consols mine.Fyfield-Shayler 1979, p.6. He spent the next few years purchasing and repairing agricultural and industrial machinery, though his intention was to run a business selling etchings that he designed and produced on site.Fyfield-Shayler 1979, pp.6‚Äì7. The site was opened to the public in June 1971 as Wendron Forge after the level of the flood-prone ground was raised, facilities were constructed and about six working machines and engines were installed to interest visitors.Fyfield-Shayler 1979, pp.8‚Äì9. In 1972 a 30-inch beam engine was acquired from the now vanished village of Greensplat where it had been pumping 500 gallons of slurry a minute from a depth of 240 feet at a china clay pit near St Austell. The engine was the last to work in commercial service in Cornwall when it was stopped in 1959. The engine dates from 1850 when it was built for the Bunny tin mine. It took eight months in 1972 for a team of volunteers under the direction of engineer Peter Treloar to erect it at Poldark Mine. By spring 1973 the engine was operating on compressed air.Fyfield-Shayler 1979, pp.9, 12. In the 1980s the attraction became known as \\"Ha'penny Park\\". After Peter Young The entrance to the site in 2007 Peter and Jose Young retired to Spain and sold Poldark Mine to John McLeod who ran it until it was placed in receivership in 1999. In 2000 the property was purchased by a company set up by Richard Williams who was reported to have \\"put all of his efforts into developing this into one of the most atmospheric tourist underground mine experiences in Europe\\". At this time one of the attractions was Evening 'Ghost Tours'; the site was licensed for the holding of civil weddings; and it was twinned with the Llywernog Silver-Lead Mine in Wales. Following Williams' death in 2012, the attraction again declined in popularity until it went into administration in 2014. Early that year the property was put up for sale, with a guide price of ¬£350,000. It was purchased by David Edwards who had been involved with the Ffestiniog Railway and the Llechwedd Slate Caverns in Wales, and work to repair and restore the mine commenced immediately: it reopened in May 2014. History of tin extraction around the site The site lies in the valley of the River Cober on the Carnmenellis granite outcrop. The river valley was once extremely rich in tin ore because of the extensive erosion over geological time of a great depth of overlying sedimentary rocks which contained many ore-bearing lodes. Pebbles and grains of the heavy ore collected in the river gravels and sands, eventually leading to the rich tin-bearing grounds that were found near the surface of most of the river valleys flowing from the granite. Evidence that this abundance of ore was first recovered and processed in ancient times is shown by the Trenear Mortar Stone, near to the entrance of Poldark Mine. It is an outcrop of granite which has at least 17 hollows in its upper face in which tin ore would have been crushed by hand, using stones. Although impossible to date precisely it is believed to have been in use during the later prehistoric period (c.2000BC to 43 AD). It is the only known example of such a mortar in south-west England and was designated as a scheduled monument in 2009. The first mechanised tin stamping mill in Duchy land, and possibly in the whole of Cornwall, is recorded at Trenere Wolas (present-day Lower Trenear) in a document confirming that it was held by John Trenere, a freeman, in 1493.Brooke 1994, p.31. By 1650 the industrial buildings recorded at Trenere Wolas had expanded to a crazing-mill, two stamping-mills and a blowing house.Brooke 1994, pp.31, 42. The mine workings discovered in the 1970s were attributed by A. K. Hamilton Jenkin to an old tin mine known as Wheal Roots, which had probably been worked between about 1720 and 1780. By 1856 it had become part of the Wendron Consols mine and is shown on the surface plan of that mine as 'old men's workings' meaning that it was at that date considered a very old mine. The mine was worked using horses and water wheels to power all the machinery and to pump water from it. In the museum there are the remains of an early 'rag and chain' pump used before the days of steam to raise water from mines and which was found when the mine was rediscovered in the 1970s. The pump consisted of a series of wooden pipes made from tree trunks and through which a large endless chain was pulled. The chain had rags tied to it at intervals which when pulled up through the pipes lifted the water out of the mine. In the mine at Horse Whim Shaft the granite on the side of the shaft has been worn smooth by the rubbing of the kibble against it, this shaft is over 200 feet deep and its further depths remain unexplored. In the Museum a large cast and wrought iron kibble recovered from the main shaft can be seen, it dates from the 18th century when the mine was active in tin production. During the 19th century the site was occupied by the main dressing floors of Wendron Consols mine.Brooke 1994, pp.32, 60. This was where the tin ore was crushed and purified. When tin prices fell in the late 19th century many mines closed, although there is a record of 1893 indicating that a stream-work was still active at Trenear at that date.Brooke 1994, p.64. In the media The author of the Poldark books Winston Graham gave permission to use the title as the name of the mine. He launched some of his books at Poldark Mine, including the last Poldark book in 2002, a year before his death. Actress Angharad Rees, who had the leading role of Demelza in the 1970s BBC TV costume drama Poldark was a regular visitor to the mine and gardens up to the time of her death in 2012.

The station was started by Radio New Zealand (which at the time was known as the National Broadcasting Service) in 1949. The original callsign was 1XN and the station was originally known by this name, the callsign was later changed to 1ZN. The station originally broadcast on 970AM in Whangarei (callsign 1ZN), Kaikohe on 1220AM (callsign 1ZE) and Kaitaia on 1440AM (callsign 1ZK). On air the station later became known as Radio Northland. The station is located on Bank Street, Whangarei. In 1978 after the AM band in New Zealand was changed from 10 kHz spacing to 9 kHz spacing the Whangarei and Kaitaia stations moved to 1026AM and the Kaikohe station moved to 1215AM. In 1993 Radio New Zealand rebranded many of their heritage stations as Classic Hits. For Radio Northland the station became known as Classic Hits Radio Northland. The station was later renamed to Classic Hits Northland. In July 1996 the New Zealand Government sold off the commercial arm of Radio New Zealand, which included, among other things, the Classic Hits branded stations. The new owner was The Radio Network, a subsidiary of APN News & Media and Clear Channel Communications, which operated as a division of the Australian Radio Network. In 1998 Classic Hits Northland was reduced to just 4 hours of local programming between 6 and 10 am 7 days a week. Outside this time nationwide shows based from Auckland took over, and the network announcers simply called the station Classic Hits. The breakfast show was shortened to a 3 hour show in 2012 on all Classic Hits stations. In 2001 Classic Hits Northland began broadcasting on 96.0FM in Whangarei in addition to the original AM frequencies. The 1026AM frequency in Whangarei was later replaced with network station Newstalk ZB, however the AM frequencies in Kaikohe and Kaitaia continued to broadcast Classic Hits Northland. In 2005 FM broadcasting of Classic Hits Northland was extended to Dargaville on 96.0FM, Kaikohe on 97.2FM, Kaitaia on 97.6FM and in 2006 broadcasting was extended to the Bay of Islands on 96.8FM. The remaining AM frequencies were now used to broadcast Newstalk ZB into Kaikohe and Kaitaia. The station frequencies were adjusted in 2010 after an alignment of FM frequencies around New Zealand. Whangarei moved to 95.6FM, Kaikohe to 96.4FM, Kaitaia also to 96.4FM and the Bay of Islands to 106.1FM. Programming was also extended to Doubtless Bay on 105.9FM. On April 28, 2014 all stations part of the Classic Hits network were rebranded as The Hits. A networked breakfast presented by Pauline Gillespie and Grant Kareama was introduced to almost all The Hits stations with the former breakfast announcer moved to present a 6-hour show between 9am and 3pm.

The Duchy of Lithuania (; ) was a state-territorial formation of ethnic Lithuanians which existed from the 13th centuryC. Rowell, Lithuania Ascending: A Pagan Empire Within East-central Europe, 1295‚Äì1345 to 1413. For most of its existence, it was a constituent part and a nucleus of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Other alternative names of the territorial formation, used in different periods, were Auk≈°taitija or Land of Lithuania (13th century), Duchy of Vilnius (14th ‚Äì early 15th centuries), Lithuania proper or simply Lithuania (in a narrow sense). History The formation emerged in the central and eastern part of present-day Lithuania, known as Auk≈°taitija, or the Lietuva Land (). It is supposed to have formed in the central Lithuania on the left bank of the Neris River and swiftly expanded eastwards. This land was mentioned in 1009 as Litua (see Name of Lithuania). The territory was ruled by chieftains of an ethnic Lithuanian tribe, Auk≈°taitians or \\"Lithuanians\\", in the original sense of the term. After the expansion of the Lithuanian state in the 13th century, when it became known as the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Kingdom of Lithuania (1251‚Äì1263), the Duchy of Lithuania became an administrative unit, governed by dukesKnown as kunigaik≈°tis in Lithuanian, a word derived from kunigas, itself derived from the German k√ºnig, meaning \\"king\\" and inherited through dynastic links. The main administrative center of the Duchy until the late 13th century might have been Kernavƒó. It is possible that the Duchy of Lithuania, which became known as the Duchy of Vilnius from the 14th century on, was formed out of the eastern part of the original Duchy of Lithuania under the rule of Grand Duke of Lithuania Vytenis at the end of the 13th century; its southwestern part was turned into a separate Duchy of Trakai, under the dominion of Gediminas, who had established himself in the newly built Senieji Trakai Castle. It is known for certain that the Duchy of Trakai existed as the domain of Kƒôstutis at the beginning of his rule in 1337. It was a progenitor of the future Trakai Voivodeship. The last Duke of Lithuania () was Vytautas the Great, who, as a result of the 1392 Astrava Treaty, received the Duchy from Jogaila, who, in turn, had inherited it from his father Algirdas. Since 1397, the Duchy had had the status of an Eldership, comparable to that of the Eldership of Samogitia. After the administrative reform of 1413 by Vytautas, based on the Union of Horod≈Ço, the Duchy ceased to exist, becoming a part of the newly established Vilnius Voivodeship.

She was built at Leith around 1505 by order of King James IV of Scotland, as part of his policy of building a strong Scottish navy. He named her after his new wife, Margaret Tudor. Records of shipbuilding between 1502 and June 1506 appear to refer to her construction; two French master shipwrights John Lorans and Jennen Diew were among the workforce. Some of Andrew Barton's sailors were employed watching the works. At the time she was built she was considerably larger than any other ship in the Scottish navy, but soon after she was superseded by a warship which was considerably larger again, the Michael. As her maiden voyage, she took James IV to the Isle of May in July 1506. New equipment included nine crossbows, 6 compasses, and two night glasses. James IV ordered himself a special gold whistle, and bought another made of silver. The ship had a blue banner with the white saltire, and a yellow flag with the red lion of Scotland embroidered in gold and silk by a Flemishman called Nannik. Special Flemish cloth for the banners and streamers was ordered from an Italian merchant Gerome Frescobaldi. The blue cloth of the saltire also formed the background of the lion's tongue and claws; \\"ane blew steik of sey to the banar for the schip with Sanct Androis cors in the myddis\\" and other coloured cloths for the \\"toungis and clukis for the Lioun in the banar.\\"Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, vol. 3 (Edinburgh, 1901), pp. lix-lxv, 89-91, 196.

She later became a politician and worked towards the closing of brothels in France in 1946. Early life In Nancy, she became an apprentice to a tailor at fourteen, but later was registered as a prostitute in 1905. After a soldier accused her of giving him syphilis, she was forced to leave for Paris, where she met in 1907, and later wed Henry Richer. He was a rich industrialist who worked at Les Halles. In 1912, her husband bought himself a plane and she flew it for the first time in 1913. She claimed in the press at the time to have broken the female record for the Le Crotoy-Zurich trip. She actually only flew the plane to Burgundy, whence it was shipped by train to the Zurich countryside, and flew it into Zurich. However, the new record was approved. In 1914, she participated in the founding of L'Union patriotique des aviatrices fran√ßaises (\\"Patriotic Union of French Women Aviators\\"). Espionage Her husband died in World War I in 1916. She became a spy under Captain Georges Ladoux thanks to her lover, a young Russian anarchist. As part of her duties, she became the mistress of von Krohn, the Naval Attach√© of the German Navy in Madrid. On their return to France, she discovered that Captain Ladoux was a double agent and he was placed under arrest. She married Thomas Crompton in 1926. He was the financial director for the Rockefeller Foundation and patron of the restoration of the Petit Trianon. When he died unexpectedly in 1928 in Gen√®ve, she moved to Bougival and lived very well. After being released from prison and restored to the post of commander, Captain Ladoux published his fictionalized Memoires in 1930. The volume about Richard, Marthe Richard, spy in the French service, was mostly an invention. She claimed half of the vast royalties and accepted the advice to write her own memoirs. Under the pseudonym of Richard she published the best seller, My life as a spy in the French service (adapted as a film in 1937) and instantly became a heroine of France. Under media pressure, her lover √âdouard Herriot, French Prime Minister at the time, gave the widowed Mme Crompton the L√©gion d'honneur for Foreign Affairs. During World War II, her courage was admired in France and she was hated in Germany. She got close to certain members of the Gestapo, including Fran√ßois Spirito. Political career In 1945, now famous as the \\"heroine of two wars,\\" she was elected to the municipal council of the 4th arrondissement on the MRP ticket. When she was accused of claiming 300,000 francs for the release of a convicted German traitor, her reputation saved her. Also, her many contradictions raised skepticism among some people. When the MRP wanted to outlaw prostitution, she tried to convince the municipal council, but they refused. Then on December 13, 1945, she presented her plan for the closing of brothels in the IVe arondissement. The proposition was passed, and they were closed within three months. Encouraged, Marthe Richard began a campaign to end prostitution in all of France.On December 19, 1945, in Le Canard encha√Æn√©, Pierre B√©nard wrote, \\"Il n'y a pas d'√©lectricit√©. Il n'y a pas de charbon. Il n'y a pas de vin. Il n'y a pas de pommes de terre et les sinistr√©s attendent toujours un toit‚Ä¶ Fuyant ces d√©primants d√©bats, les conseillers municipaux parisiens ont consacr√© deux longues s√©ances √† discuter de la suppression des maisons closes. Mme Marthe Richard, l'espionne bien connue a ouvert le d√©bat!\\" (English: \\"There is no electricity. There is no coal. There is no wine. There are no potatoes and the disaster victims are without shelter‚Ä¶ Fleeing these depressing times, the Parisian municipal councillors devoted two long meetings to the removal of brothels. Mme Marthe Richard, the famous spy, began the debate!\\" On April 9, 1946, Marcel Roclore, Minister of State, presented the Commission's report on the population and public health, and concluded that closing the brothels was a necessity. Pierre Dominjon proposed a bill for this purpose. The bill, now known as La loi Marthe Richard, was passed with the votes of an alliance of the Christian democrat MRP and the Communists.. On April 13, 1946, the prostitution registry was destroyed and 1,400 brothels were closed, including 180 in Paris. Many brothels were converted into hotels, which prostitutes continued to use. Prostitution was still legal, though many acts surrounding it were made illegal. Nationality controversy A controversy surrounding her nationality came up in 1948. She was British by her marriage to Thomas Crompton (her repatriation was denied in 1937). Thus, her election was illegal as were the votes she had participated in. Meanwhile, the director of Le Crapouillot, Jean Galtier-Boissi√®re denounced her services to the nation, accusing her of involvement with organized crime, of smuggling jewels, and of covering up crimes. The inspector of national safety, Jacques Delarue, a specialist in false heroes of war, inquired into the accusations, and found them to be false in 1954. She was called La Veuve qui cl√¥t (a pun on Veuve Clicquot) by Antoine Blondin.

For several years, WQTE has referred to itself as \\"Q95 Country,\\" presumably to avoid confusion with adjacent-channel WKQI 95.5 FM in Detroit, which called itself \\"Q95\\" for many years and serves the northeastern part of WQTE's listening area.

The principal is Pauric Cannon. History The school stands on the site of the town's first Gaelic football playing field. It was built in 1974. At the time of the new Scoil Colmcille's opening over 600 boys attended the school. By 1985 school numbers grew to over 700 and 23 teachers were employed. The current principal is Pauric Cannon, who succeeded Tom Redden. Boys are housed at the rear end of the school and play in the back yard while girls are taught at the front entrance and play in the adjoining yard. Other non- teaching staff include secretaries, cleaners, ancillary workers and a caretaker. The school choir, led by Mr Frank Breslin, sang to a prime time national audience on The Late Late Toy Show in 1995. At an event held at the school in January 2020, organised by teachers Rory Kavanagh and Odhran McGowan and attended by many of those who had been pupils there in the past, the then Leas-Cheann Comhairle Pat \\"the Cope\\" Gallagher claimed that, while not having attended the school, he had come close to doing so as his father had been employed by Esso in Letterkenny.

Craft unionism meant that unions were formed on the basis of the trade practiced by a group of skilled workers, in contrast to industrial unionism. For example, in the printing trades, a printer had once been able to perform all the duties in the print shop, but with the development of machinery and printing techniques, different skills became necessary for each step of the printing process. These skills developed into separate trades, and the printing process involved \\"compositors, pressmen, feeders, stereotypers, bookbinders, electrotypers, and photoengravers.\\" These various trades had all belonged to the Typographical Union, but between 1889 and 1903 all except for the compositors left to form their own craft unions. The AFL supported this process of separation by skill. In some cases, the AFL forced affiliates to merge. After a decade of jurisdictional warfare between the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners (UBCJ) and the Amalgamated Wood-Workers International (AWWI), which did the same type of work, the UBCJ threatened to secede from the federation. The AFL revoked the charter of the weaker AWWI and forced them to join the Carpenters' union. Some powerful AFL affiliates successfully resisted pressure to split into separate crafts. The United Mine Workers had been formed as an industrial union. They demanded, and were granted, the right to include craftsmen ‚Äì \\"hoisting engineers, firemen, blacksmiths, carpenters\\" ‚Äì into their industrial union locals.A History of American Labor, Joseph G. Rayback, 1966, page 208. The Scranton Declaration was re-affirmed in 1912, repudiating an argument made by the Industrial Workers of the World that trade unions are too rigid to meet changing demands. About one-third of the delegates voted for an industrial union proposal put forward by the AFL-affiliated United Mine Workers. Even so, by 1922 the AFL had repeatedly voted down all resolutions endorsing industrial unionism.Marion Dutton Savage, Industrial Unionism in America, 1922, page 27-28.

Early life De Burgh was the youngest son of the Rev. William de Burgh, D.D., and his wife Janette, n√©e Macartney. He was born at Sandymount, County Dublin, Ireland. He was educated at Rathmines school and the Royal College of Science for Ireland, and was for some time employed on railway construction in Ireland. Engineering in Australia De Burgh then migrated to Australia, arriving in Melbourne on the Orient 21 March 1885. Travelling to Sydney de Burgh immediately obtained a position in the New South Wales public works department and was engaged on survey work for Sydney's southern outfall sewer. In 1887 he was sent to the countryside in charge of the construction of steel bridges, and eventually became engineer of bridges. He was in this capacity responsible for several bridges over the Murray, Murrumbidgee, Lachlan, Hunter and other rivers. He was also responsible for the Hampden Bridge (see picture) over the Kangaroo River. In 1903 de Burgh became acting principal assistant engineer of water supply and sewerage, a year later visited Europe to study dam construction and water supply, and after his return did important work in connexion with the Burrinjuck Dam and Murrumbidgee irrigation scheme. He was appointed chief-engineer for harbours and water supply in 1909, and in 1913 chief-engineer for water supply and sewerage. He designed and supervised the construction of the great reservoirs for the Sydney water supply at Cataract, Cordeaux, Avon, and Nepean, for the Chichester scheme for Newcastle district, and the Umberumberka scheme at Broken Hill. While he was chief-engineer for harbours, he directed the design of the No1. Jetty at Port Kembla, a coal jetty and ship-loader of an advanced design for its time. Later life and legacy De Burgh was a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers, London, and was twice winner of the Telford premium. De Burghs Bridge over the Lane Cove River, Sydney, is named for him. The De Burgh Dam near the Burrinjuck Dam was also named after him.

He served as Archbishop of Westminster from 1935 until his death, and was elevated to the cardinalate in 1937. Early life and ministry Hinsley was born in Carlton near Selby, to Thomas and Bridget (n√©e Ryan) Hinsley. His father was a carpenter and his mother was an Irish Catholic. He studied at Ushaw College in Durham and then proceeded for theological studies to the English College in Rome. Hinsley's education was sponsored by his parish priest, who was also one of the Duke of Norfolk's chaplains at Carlton Towers.Diocese of Westminster. Cardinal Arthur Hinsley 11 January 2005 Ordained to the priesthood on 23 December 1893 and was immediately appointed to teach at Ushaw College, a position he held until 1897. He then took up pastoral ministry in Leeds and served as headmaster of St. Bede's Grammar School (which he also founded) from 1900 to 1904. In 1917, after another period of pastoral work, Hinsley became a Domestic Prelate of His Holiness (14 November) and the rector of the English College in Rome, a post in which he remained until 1928. Episcopate On 10 August 1926, he was appointed Titular bishop of Sebastopolis in Armenia by Pope Pius XI. Hinsley received his episcopal consecration on the following 30 November from Rafael Cardinal Merry del Val, with Archbishop Giuseppe Palica and Bishop Peter Amigo serving as co-consecrators, in the chapel of the English College. He was later named Apostolic visitor to British Africa on 10 December 1927. While in Africa, he suffered a bout of paratyphoid fever.TIME Magazine. Death of a Voice 29 March 1943 At the age of 65 he made a valiant effort with other clerics to climb Mount Etna in South Italy. Sadly they had to turn back as one of the party, Cardinal Francis Carberri, had respiratory problems halfway up the mountain. Hinsley always said even on his deathbed that he regretted not climbing up Etna. Pius XI, on 9 January 1930, made Hinsley Titular Archbishop of Sardis and Apostolic Delegate to the British missions in Africa that were not under the jurisdiction of the apostolic delegations of Egypt, Belgian Congo, and South Africa. He retired as Apostolic Delegate due to ill health on 25 March 1934 and in recognition of his long service in Rome and to the Vatican was appointed a canon of St. Peter's Basilica. It was from this tranquil, semi- retired position, in his 70th year, that Hinsley was the surprisingly nominated fifth Archbishop of Westminster on 1 April 1935, thus becoming the spiritual leader of the Catholic Church in England and Wales. Cardinalate Tomb of Cardinal Arthur Hinsley in Westminster Cathedral He was created Cardinal-Priest of S. Susanna by Pope Pius XI in the consistory of 13 December 1937. In his capacity of cardinal, Hinsley served as one of the electors in the 1939 papal conclave, which selected Pope Pius XII. A supporter of ecumenism, Hinsley founded the multi-denominational 'Sword of the Spirit' in October 1940 to rally his fellow English clergymen (including non-Catholics) against totalitarianism.TIME Magazine. Unity in Britain 19 May 1941 He defended Alfred Noyes in his argument with the Vatican.TIME Magazine. Noyes Annoyed 5 September 1938 The English prelate apparently supported Franco during the Spanish Civil War.Rankin Nicholas, Defending the Rock It has been claimed his support for Winston Churchill was important to the Prime Minister in 1940 and helped improve relations between the Church and the British establishment. Catholic schools at that time educated 8% of children in England and Wales. The President of the Board of Education, Rab Butler, was drawing up plans for what would eventually become the Education Act 1944, and was keen to draw Church schools into the state system in return for financial support. Although he was able to negotiate deals with the Church of England and the nonconformist Churches, Butler was told that his plans were not acceptable to the Roman Catholic Church (15 September 1942). Hinsley wrote a shrewd letter to \\"The Times\\", stressing President Roosevelt's commitment to freedom of conscience and arguing that Catholic schools should not be bullied by the state as they often provided for the poorest inner-city communities.Howard 1987, pp. 112, 124‚Äì6, 128‚Äì30 Hinsley, nearly blind and deaf, died from a heart attack at his country retreat of Hare Street House near Buntingford, at age 77. He was buried at Westminster Cathedral. Archbishop William Temple, of Canterbury, described him as \\"a most devoted citizen of his country...[and] a most kindly and warmhearted friend\\". The Daily Mail described him as \\"the greatest English Cardinal since Wolsey...and probably the best loved Cardinal England ever had.\\" The Diocese of Leeds‚Äô Pastoral and Conference Centre, Hinsley Hall, was named in honour of the Cardinal.

Willey (born 4 November 1947), known as the Mad Scientist, is a former physics instructor at the University of Pittsburgh at Johnstown in Johnstown, Pennsylvania. Physics has been a major interest in his life since he attended The Coleshill School and the John Port School in Etwall, Derbyshire. He has been presenting physics shows since the early 1980s. Willey is a scientific consultant for the skeptics group, C.S.I. (Committee for Skeptical Inquiry). He also designs physics apparatus/equipment for the Science Kit Boreal Labs. In his spare time he enjoys hunting, gardening, woodworking, working with stained glass, and playing golf. Education and career Willey studied at Aston University and Birmingham University from 1966 to 1971. Then he taught at Saltley Grammar School, in Birmingham from 1971 to 1972. Next, Willey moved from his home country of England to the United States and enrolled at the Ohio State University. He was in Columbus, Ohio until he obtained his masters in physics in 1974. His first teaching position was with the University of Pittsburgh at Johnstown. In the early 1980s, he performed his first physics show at the University's open house. A few months later, Willey made a 15-minute video of physics demonstrations with a group of troubled boys from a remand home. This video was played on local television for the public to see. A local school teacher saw Willey's demonstrations and asked him to perform some of them for her class. Willey's physics show, \\"How Does A Thing Like That Work?\\" was born. His wife Raven became his assistant. Looking for the next big physics demonstrations, Willey found fire walking. He teamed up with the Norwegian Physicist, Kjetil Kjernsmo of University of Oslo, to study the physics behind fire walking. They developed a computer model of a foot while a person fire walked. They needed data from long walks and hot walks to verify the computer model. A fire walking group from Seattle, Washington volunteered to perform the first walk. On 18 October 1997, in Redmond, Washington, Michael McDermott walked across a bed of coals that were at a temperature of 1813 ¬∞F. Willey also walked on that fire bed, but not at the record temperature. Willey's next, and most famous fire walk, was in July 1998 at the University of Pittsburgh at Johnstown. This fire walk was 165 feet long to break the world record for the longest distance walking on fire. His walk was recorded and shown on television by the BBC and ABC. This got the attention of the producers of The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. Willey's nickname, \\"Mad Scientist\\", was born. For the next 10 years (1998‚Äì2008) Willey performed physics demonstrations on The Tonight Show. He appeared on the show 19 times. During this time, Willey also appeared on other television shows such as Time Warp, Humanly Impossible, Talk Soup, Steve Harvey's Big Time, King 5 TV, Skeptical Inquirer, Extreme Body Parts, John Stossel's Power of Belief, the Crook and Chase Show, Science Park, Jensen!,http://www.rtl.nl/shows/jensen/search/index.xml?q=willey&zoek.x;=46&zoek.y;=8&t;=article&t;=video Johannes B.

Miller) (July 4, 1925May 24, 1985) was a record producer and the founder of many budget album record companies. Miller is more familiar to some record buyers and collectors as the notorious Leo Muller who produced many Exploito type records.  Life and career  Miller was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to Albert and Olive Miller. Following World War II service in the United States Navy along with his brother in-law Ralph Joseph, they started recording weddings direct to disc. After briefly working at the RCA Victor record pressing plant in Camden, New Jersey, where he learned more about recording and manufacturing records, he and his brother Paul formed their first record company with their own savings and those of their father Albert, naming their company Palda Records (a portmanteau of Paul, Albert, and David) in Philadelphia, eventually buying out their father's share.  Essex Records  Miller became the founder of Essex Records in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1951. The label had local popular success, being known mostly for its release of the early records by Bill Haley & His Comets. Miller originally changed the name of the group from the \\"Four Aces of Western Swing\\" to \\"Bill Haley and the Saddlemen\\" then repeated a suggestion that the group change their name to the Comets after Halley's Comet. After Haley and the Comets signed to Decca Records, Haley sued Miller for selling the group's earlier records on his Essex label without paying royalties. As a result, Miller went bankrupt.  Somerset Records  Under his Miller International Company formed in 1957, with his Essex Records office manager George Phillips, he founded Somerset Records and Somerset Stereo Fidelity Records budget albums. His greatest claim to fame was selling large amounts of cheaply priced albums, with Somerset claiming to have manufactured the first stereo budget albums. The name of Somerset high fidelity albums was suggested by Miller International's West Coast distributor, Jimmy Warren, with the name of Stereo Fidelity (stereo albums) thought of by Wally Hill to capitalize on the public's interest in both high fidelity and stereophonic sound. The economy came from Miller starting his own record factory in Swarthmore, Pennsylvania, using public domain music and non union musicians from outside the United States to record cover versions of hit songs of the time. Many original tunes were written by Monty Kelly, Robert Lowden, and Joseph Kuhn with the music published by Miller's own music publisher, Chesdel Music created in 1962. Miller had his own distribution channels of his records in supermarkets and drugstores with the cheap albums being sold in metal racks similar to those holding paperback books or cardboard record holders called \\"dumps\\" that could be placed anywhere. Miller's record albums were sold wholesale for 93 cents to salesmen who sold them to merchants who sold them to the public for $1.98.p.192 Denisoff, R. Sergei; Solid Gold: The Popular Record Industry, 1975, Transaction Books. Somerset Records used artist Anthony \\"Chic\\" Laganella to create attractive eye catching album covers. Miller used the name 101 Strings for several German orchestras; their first album appearing in September 1957. In 1958 Somerset released 24 101 Strings titles. Miller International's philosophy after their experience with Essex Records was that recording \\"hits\\" was too unstable, and recording for teenagers and \\"sophisticates\\" was unprofitable as the two types bought \\"fads\\". Miller said that he did not want to record anything that would not sell ten years in the future. In 1959 Miller signed the London Philharmonic Orchestra to his label and had his Somerset albums distributed in the United Kingdom by Pye Records. Disques Vogue of France followed soon afterwards. Miller sold Somerset to Al Sherman in 1963 but remained credited as a producer on the albums when Sherman changed the name to Alshire Records; though the name Somerset was still used for some albums. Miller formed Europa Records in Germany to duplicate the American sales success of Somerset in Europe. Many of the Somerset/Alshire recordings were issued in Europe on the Europa label. He continued to occasionally produce material and in the mid 1970s formed a brief partnership with Marty Wilson to release three albums of heavily orchestrated material for the New York Disco scene, also releasing the recordings in European markets.

Biography Chu was born into a family of Scholar-bureaucrats in the Wuxing District of Zhejiang Province in the late Qing dynasty. His father was a noted physician. Chu Minyi was sent to Japan in 1903, where he studied economics and politics. In 1906, together with Zhang Jingjiang, he departed Japan for further studies in France, joining the Tongmenghui dedicated to overthrowing the Qing Dynasty, when their ship stopped in Singapore. While in France, he joined the group of Paris Chinese anarchists, such as Li Shizeng and Cai Yuanpei, whom he assisted in printing propaganda leaflets supporting the republican movement. In November 1911, after the start of the Xinhai Revolution, he returned to Shanghai, where he became local leader of the Tongmenghui movement in the city. However, he disagreed with Song Jiaoren over the establishment of the Kuomintang, and left China for Belgium, where he earned degrees in medicine and pharmacology at the Free University of Brussels, but he never went into medical practice. He returned briefly to China in 1915 to oppose Yuan Shikai‚Äôs attempt to establish a new Chinese Empire, but soon returned to Europe. In 1921, he became the Vice President of the Institut Franco-Chinois which Li Shizeng had founded at the University of Lyons and held the post for a year. In 1922 he moved to Strasbourg, and received his doctorate from the University of Strasbourg in 1925. In 1925, on the death of Sun Yat-sen, Chu returned to China and became a member of the Kuomintang educational commission and the head of the medical school at the Guangdong University. He also became a member of the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang in 1926. As a Kuomintang Committee member, he organized the Chinese Arts Association, served as the Chairman of the Commission for the Establishment of National Hygiene and represented China in European countries in the early 1930s. However, due to various political differences with Chiang Kai-shek, he resigned his positions. Chu was in Shanghai during the Battle of Shanghai in 1937, remaining in that city during the Japanese occupation. However, when his brother-in-law Wang Jingwei broke ranks with the Kuomintang and established the collaborationist Wang Jingwei Government, Chu accepted the post of Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Foreign Minister in 1940. There was a byword describing the main members of Wang Jingwei's government. ‚ÄúChen Gongbo's mouth, Zhou Fohai's pen and Chu Minyi's legs.‚Äù As the Foreign Minister, he negotiated the November 30, 1940 treaty in which Tokyo accorded formal diplomatic recognition to the Wang Jingwei Government and worked to secure diplomatic recognition by the Axis Powers by the end of 1941. He was awarded the Order of the Rising Sun (1st class) by Emperor Hirohito. Chu became the ambassador of the collaborationist Chinese government to Japan briefly before becoming the Foreign Minister again until the final months of the war, and continued to pay an important role in the Wang Jingwei Government until the end of World War II. In 1945, after the surrender of Japan, Chu was taken into custody by the Republic of China government in Guangdong, where he served as governor, in August 1945. He was brought to trial in Nanjing on charges of treason in April 1946. There was considerable public sympathy for Chu at the time of his trial for many people found it hard to consider Chu as a national traitor due his record as a Chinese nationalist. Many people considered his wartime role as a result of his personal loyalty to Wang Jingwei. Nevertheless, Chu was found guilty of treason and executed at Suzhou on August 23, 1946. His last words were ‚ÄúI am not ashamed for my living, yet my death will make more value. My body should be sent to the hospital to assist the study on medicine.‚Äù References * David P.

The route was approximately that of the original A41 road; the Edgware Road, through Watford, Kings Langley, Apsley, the Boxmoor area of Hemel Hempstead, Berkhamsted and Tring. Much of this part is now numbered the A4251 road. It linked in with other turnpikes to the north forming a route to Birmingham. The turnpike trust was set up in 1762 by around 300 landed gentry to look after about 26 miles of road between Sparrows Herne near Bushey and Walton near Aylesbury. It was the turnpike's depot at Sparrows Herne which gave the road its name. The frequent use of the route by heavy carts carrying grain to London made it notorious for its rutted and pitted state even after being made into a turnpike. The turnpike survived the coming of the railways until 1872, when it passed to the route's various parishes and highway boards to maintain and the tolls were removed. Description The original turnpike gates were: *Watford Gate at the bottom of Chalk Hill.Sparrow Herne Trust Turnpike Marker, Lower High Street, Watford, Images of England, English Heritage National Monuments Record. *Ridge Lane Gate on the north side of Watford. *New Ground Gate just to the south of Tring near New Ground Farm, *Veeches Farm Gate, west of Aston Clinton - this was moved to Aylesbury in 1827 after the road was extended. *The top of Tring Hill in 1860. Brick toll houses for these gates were built at a cost of around ¬£25 each. Tollkeepers were appointed and paid 10s/6d a week for which they had to man the gate day and night and from which money they had to pay for the oil for the nighttime illumination of the gates with lamps. In 1762, the maximum rate for tolls were: *Horse or beast drawing a coach - 3d *Packhorse (laden) - 1¬Ωd *Drove of oxen, cows etc. - 10d per score *Drove of sheep, calves, swine - 5d per score.

After completing service of his indenture, in 1726 Pittillo was granted on Wagua Creek in Brunswick County, Virginia. Appointed as a tobacco inspector in Bristol Parish in 1728, that year he was also selected for the major expedition of William Byrd II to survey the border between Virginia and North Carolina. Through grants of headrights and purchases, Pittillo eventually acquired more than in the area of what developed as Prince George, Brunswick, and Dinwiddie counties in Southside Virginia. Biography James Pittillo was born between 1690 and 1698 in Scotland, likely in Perthshire. According to records in the British Archives of persons captured in the Jacobite rising of 1715 and deported to the colonies, James Pittillo was a laborer from the parish of Logierait in the ancient county of Perthshire (or Perth). Pittillo was captured at the Battle of Preston, tried, and transported on the ship Elizabeth and Anne to Virginia in June/July 1716. James settled in Bristol Parish, Prince George County. This was part of what became known as Southside Virginia. His name first appeared in colonial Virginia records in February 1723/24 when he witnessed the will of Richard Smith. In April 1724, Pittillo was recorded as surveying on the north side of Moccosoneck (presently called Rowanty) Creek in Prince George County, Virginia. In October 1726, having served his indenture to pay for the costs of his transportation to the colony, Pittillo was granted on Wagua Creek in what was now Brunswick County. (The county was formed in 1720, partly from land previously assigned to Prince George County.) In 1734, Pittillo received a grant for on both sides of White Oak Swamp of Rowanty. In 1735, he was granted on Sturgeon Run, land which he sold in 1742. In 1745-6, Pittillo received grants for more than 2500 acres (10 km¬≤) on Stony and Moccosoneck creeks in Prince George County, Virginia. It is likely these grants were for headrights for persons Pittillo paid to bring to the colonies, such as indentured servants and African slaves. In this period of development, the Crown granted 240 acres in headrights for each person whom an individual brought to the colony, as it wanted to develop the pool of workers and increase agricultural productivity. In all, through land grants and purchases, Pittillo acquired more than in the area of Prince George County, Brunswick, and Dinwiddie counties in Southside Virginia. His largest land holdings were on the north side of Moccosoneck Creek. This area south of present-day Petersburg, Virginia was originally in Prince George County, but it was assigned to Dinwiddie County when it was organized in 1752. With so much land to be worked, he likely also had acquired numerous British indentured servants and African slaves as laborers. By the mid-18th century, planters were having to rely more on purchase of slaves, as economic conditions had improved in England and fewer workers wanted to emigrate to the colonies. In 1728, William Byrd II was commissioned to survey the boundary line between the colonies of Virginia and North Carolina. He assembled an expeditionary force of about twenty men, including Pittillo, whom he considered expert woodsmen and Indian traders. They set out on 5 March 1728. After six weeks, the survey work was halted. They renewed the expedition in September when the weather was cooler. Byrd listed James Pittillo as part of both his spring and fall expeditions. In 1728, James Pittillo was appointed as a tobacco inspector in Bristol Parish. Tobacco was the important commodity crop of Virginia at the time; his position gave him influence in the parish, as he determined prices to be gained by planters. James Pittillo died about 1754 in Dinwiddie County, Virginia. His wife, Mary, and several children survived him. Family of James and Mary Pittillo of Prince George County, Virginia 1\\\\.

Early life Mortensen was born on January 27, 1897 in Park City, Utah, the son of Danish immigrants Agnes and William Peter Mortensen, who had immigrated from Copenhagen, Denmark in 1883. Before serving in World War I, Mortensen graduated from East Side High School in Salt Lake City. He then served as Private in Company D of the 13th Regiment of the United States Infantry from August 6, 1918 to May 16, 1919. At his enlistment, he recorded his occupation as painting. See Inventory of Military service cards from Department of Administrative Services. Division Archives and Records Service, i ca. 1898-1975. After his discharge from the army, Mortensen briefly studied illustration at the Art Students League in New York City. In May 1920 he traveled in Greece, Italy, Egypt and Constantinople to \\"sketch for educational purposes.\\" He returned to Utah, then traveled to Hollywood as an escort for his friend's sister, Fay Wray. After two years at the Art Students League he was declared to have \\"no talent for drawing.\\"Undeterred by this verdict he borrowed money and took off for Greece, to make etchings of the monuments of ancient Attica. Career Actress Margaret Livingston, photographed by Mortensen (1927) Mortensen was a very self-critical man who began his photographic career taking portraits of Hollywood actors and film stills. During the 1920s and 1930s, he was inspired by horror films being adapted in studios, and ended up making portraits about them in his own style. His favorite photographic topics were of witches, dancers, demons, peasants, and Shakespearean actors. In 1931 he moved to the artist community of Laguna Beach, California, where he opened a studio and the William Mortensen School of Photography. Using pens, paints, pumice and razor blades, he preferred the Pictorialist style of manipulating photographs to produce romanticist painting-like effects. Mortensen's style of art consisted of him using a bromoil process. The style brought him criticism from straight photographers of the modern realist movement and, in particular, he carried on a prolonged written debate with Ansel Adams in the pages of Camera Craft magazine. His arguments defending romanticist photography led him to be \\"ostracized from most authoritative canons of photographic history.\\" In an essay, Larry Lytle wrote, \\"Due to his approach‚Äîboth technically and philosophically in opposition to straight or purist adherents ‚Äî he is amongst the most problematic figures in photography in the twentieth-century... historians and critics have described his images as \\"...anecdotal, highly sentimental, mildly erotic hand-colored prints...\\", \\"...bowdlerized versions of garage calendar pin-ups and sadomasochist entertainments...\\", \\"...contrived set-ups and sappy facial expressions...\\", and Ansel Adams variously referred to Mortensen as the \\"Devil\\", and \\"the anti-Christ.\\" In addition, the more realistic photojournalism emerging from World War II correspondents, and carried in national newsmagazines, caused Mortensen's more posed and contrived photos to fade from the public mind. He was largely forgotten by the time of his death in 1965. Recent years have brought praise for Mortensen's development of manipulation techniques and a renewed interest in his work. In 2013, one of Mortenson's students, portrait photographer Robert Balcomb, published a book ‚Äî Me and Mortensen ‚Äî about his time studying with Mortensen in Laguna Beach. He wrote nine books about technique in photography in conjunction with George Dunham. Mortensen was awarded the Hood medal from the Royal Photographic Society in 1949.

Biography The son of Sutton Oglethorpe, he came of an old Yorkshire family from Bramham which had loyally supported King Charles I against the Cromwellian forces, and in consequence suffered severely at the hands of the Puritans with his home and lands being confiscated. With the restoration of the Monarchy, the Oglethorpes, as good Royalists came back into favour, and young Theophilus, soon a dashing major of Dragoons lodged adjacent to Whitehall, fell in love with Eleanor Wall, 'sempstriss' to the King and who lodged at the palaces. They were married and continued in Royal favour, becoming particularly attached to the Duke of York, afterwards James II; Theophilus became his principal equerry, and in the new Parliament elected following his accession to the throne, Theophilus was elected MP for Morpeth. Theophilus played a prominent part in the defeat of James, Duke of Monmouth at Sedgemoor, being hailed as something of a hero. However, his fortunes changed with those of the King, and when James II was forced to abdicate, Oglethorpe accompanied his King to France. His retirement from the Army following the Glorious Revolution in 1688/9, and from all other offices, officially burying himself in his new home at Westbrook, served as a cloak for the continued plotting of himself and his wife, Eleanor, on behalf of the 'king over the water'. The result was that Theophilus was soon the subject of a warrant as a Jacobite conspirator. Following various alarms and adventures he was finally captured on 30 May 1691, but received light punishment being required to pay a fine of forty shillings for failing to take the oaths of allegiance to William III and Mary II. In and out of the country, he continued occasionally hiding at Westbrook and from time to time plotting and counter-plotting until after the death of Queen Mary II. Throughout the whole of this time, although loyally devoting himself to the Stuart cause, Theophilus had remained a Protestant as his father had been, and when James II finally rid his court at Saint-Germain of all non-Catholics in response to the pressure of his French hosts, Theophilus, after twenty years of service to the Stuarts, ruefully returned to Godalming and, in the late autumn of 1696, took the oath of loyalty to William III. In 1698 he was elected Member of Parliament for the Surrey borough of Haslemere. Sir Theophilus died in 1702. Family Three of his sons ‚Äì the oldest, Lewis, his second son, also called Theophilus, and a third James, all sat subsequently for the same constituency (Haslemere) as their father. His son, Lewis Oglethorpe, who was a keen and devoted follower of Marlborough, gave up politics for the Army but died of a wound in the Battle of Schellenberg in 1704. The younger Theophilus became an even more ardent Jacobite than his father and soon relinquished his parliamentary duties, his position as Squire of Westbrook, and his native lands and spent the rest of his life abroad involved in all the intrigues and plans that continuously surrounded the Stuart case, dying at the Court of St-Germain. James Oglethorpe, after also seeing active military service, had a thirty-year career in Parliament and was the founder of the colony of Georgia. Daughter Anne Oglethorpe lived at Westbrook, the family estate at Godalming, after the Glorious Revolution; from there she served as an agent in the Jacobite cause. Daughters Eleanor Oglethorpe de Mezieres, Luisa Oglethorpe de Bassompierre, and Frances Oglethorpe Noyel de Bellegarde, Marchess des Marches, married into Savoyard nobility and remained in Europe where they too served the Jacobite cause. Popular culture Theophilus Oglethorpe is the main protagonist in John Whitbourn's The Royal Changeling, (1998), which describes the 1685 rebellion with some fantasy elements added. Also, Whitbourn's three book 'Downs-Lord' 'triptych' (1999‚Äì2002) constitutes a fantasy treatment of the life and death of Theophilus' son, Theophilus junior.

It was shown in 2002 to be a potential regulator of neural tube development in Xenopus. Neural development happens in the dorsal ectoderm. In the genus Xenopus, over expression of Dullard undergoes apoptosis in early development. Dullard helps promote Ubiquitin by proteosomal degradation. Dullard mRNA is derived from maternal genes and is localized within the animal neural hemisphere. Functioning negatively for the regulation of Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (BMPs), Dullard conserves the C-terminal region of NLI-IF, in which is fairly dominant in cellular functions. Dullard is essential for inhibiting BMP receptor activation during Xenopus neuralization. Dullard is also known as CTDnep1, which stands for CTD nuclear envelope phosphatase 1. It is a protein coding gene, which include phosphatase activity and protein serine/threonine phosphatase activity. This gene is relatively small and only contains 244 amino acids. Dullard protein or CTDnep1 encodes a protein serine/threonine phosphatase and dephosphoroylates LPIN1 and LPIN2. LPIN1 and LPIN2 catalyze the reaction of the conversion of phosphatidic acid to diacylglyerol. The reaction can affect and change the lipid concentration of the endoplasmic reticulum and the nucleus. Human Dullard has shown that the protein has two membrane spanning regions. One end is the N-terminal end, which helps localize the protein to the nuclear envelope. Dullard dephosphorylates the mammalian phospatidic acid phosphatase, lipin. Dullard participates in a unique phosphatase cascade regulating nuclear membrane biogenesis, and that this cascade is conserved from yeast to mammals. There is belief that Dullard may have other targets that is not only associated with the nuclear envelope. In recent studies, dullard interacts with BMP type 1 to inhibit dependent phosphorylation. This can conclude that it is a potential source for regulating the level of BMP signaling and can affect germ cell specification.

At the time members of the Alidosi family dominated Imola, and other citizens looked to the papacy for a change. The petition brought by Benvenuto and others failed; the local political situation at home caused him to move on without returning, going to Bologna, where he made a living as a teacher. He was made the subject of accusations there of indecency, which may have been connected to lectures on the Inferno;Richard Lansing (editor), The Dante Encyclopedia (2000), pp. 97‚Äì8. on the other hand Benvenuto himself had made accusations to the papal legate in Bologna of improper teacher-student relationships of others.

He was a contemporary, close associate, and possible friend of Josquin des Prez, and was one of the first composers to write a completely canonic setting of the Ordinary of the Mass.M. Jennifer Bloxham, in Sherr, p. 202 Life The illegitimate child of a priest, Orto was probably born in Tournai, and spent the early part of his life there. While his original surname was Dujardin, he used \\"de Orto\\" (the Italian translation of Dujardin) throughout his life. In June 1482, in the household of Ferry de Clugny, Cardinal-Bishop of Tournai (who died 7 October 1483), he went to Rome, where he became a singer in the papal chapel; he may have become an accomplished composer around this time, since his Missa ad fugam seems to have been written in response to the similar composition by Josquin des Prez, tentatively dated to the early 1480s, and Orto's mass was copied for the Capella Sistina between 1487 and 1490.Bloxham, in Sherr, p. 202; Picker, Grove online Church of St. Gertrude in Nivelles, where Orto worked from the mid 1490s until his death in 1529, and where he is buried. While he served in the Sistine Chapel Choir until at least 1499, during the papacies of Innocent VIII and Alexander VI, he began to acquire other posts and benefices. He was particularly popular with Innocent, who awarded him benefices and allowed him to rise in the hierarchy in spite of his illegitimacy. During this time he and Josquin worked closely together, even seeking similar positions at Cambrai in their mutual homeland. One of the things he may have done in collaboration with Josquin was a revision of a cycle of hymns by Guillaume Dufay, composed around 1430, which had fallen out of use.Picker, Grove online, referencing Gerber and Osthoff. At some time in the early 1490s Orto acquired the post of dean at the Collegiate Church of St. Gertrude of Nivelles, present-day Belgium; he was to remain closely associated with this institution for the rest of his life. It is not known exactly when he moved there, but he left Nivelles in late 1504 in order to join the choir of Philip the Handsome, la Grande Chapelle, a distinguished musical body which included Pierre de La Rue, and which went to Spain in 1506.Picker, Grove online Orto joined the choir at a very high level, becoming premier chapelain in short order‚Äîby 30 November 1505‚Äîindicating the high level of respect as both composer and singer he had attained.Meconi, p. 74 After Philip's death in September 1506 the choir was kept on by Juana of Castile, \\"Juana the Mad\\", and Orto was one of the singers who left shortly after, between October and December 1506, leaving the duties of premier chapelain to Pierre de La Rue. During this time and for the next three years Juana traveled with her singers, each night singing a requiem to her husband's corpse which went with them in its coffin, in a bizarre journey through Castile until Juana's father Ferdinand finally imprisoned her in the fortress at Tordesillas.Meconi, p. 40, p. 74 Back in the Low Countries, Orto remained in the employ of the Habsburgs, from at least 1509 until 1517, during which time he shared the duties of premier chapelain with Anthoine de Berghes. Sometime during this period he was likely the teacher of Arnold von Bruck, who was a choirboy. No certain documentation of Orto's activities during 1507 and 1508 is known. In the later years of his life he acquired additional posts, as canon both at the Antwerp Church of Our Lady and at Ste Gudule in Brussels, and a record from 1518 lists him as the \\"first chaplain\\" in the Flemish chapel (capilla flamenca) of Charles V. He possibly died of the plague which swept through Nivelles in 1529, and was buried in the church of Ste Gertrude, where he worked for the longest time. His tomb in the choir had an inscription which remained legible until the church was destroyed by the Germans on 14 May 1940, during the Second World War. Music and influence Marbrianus de Orto was a moderately prolific composer of masses, motets, lamentations, and chansons, many of which have survived. He was famous enough that Ottaviano Petrucci published a book of his masses in 1505‚Äîone of his earliest publications, and one of the earliest collections of printed music. De Orto's book of masses followed after those by Josquin, Jacob Obrecht, Antoine Brumel, Johannes Ghiselin, Pierre de La Rue, and Alexander Agricola.Fallows, Grove online Petrucci published five of de Orto's masses in this collection. All are cantus firmus masses, and include a Missa L'homme arm√©, based on the famous tune, probably composed in the early to mid 1480s. Among his masses is the unusual Missa [Ad fugam], one of only a handful of freely composed canonic masses from the period, including Johannes Ockeghem's Missa prolationum, based entirely on mensuration canons. De Orto's Missa [Ad fugam] may be related another canonic mass in a Vatican manuscript, later named \\"Missa Ad fugam\\" and attributed to Josquin by Petrucci. Both masses use strict canon at the fifth between superius and tenor, as well as a head motive in most movements.Bloxham, p. 202 The same title was used to describe the canonic \\"Missa Sine nomine\\" in a later print by Antico. De Orto's motets also usually use cantus firmus technique. The Salve regis mater sanctissima, though anonymous in its only surviving source, is probably by de Orto and was composed for the accession of Alexander VI in 1492. Some of the chansons are akin to the typical French style of the early 16th century‚Äîquick, light, and imitative; others are more in line with the Burgundian style of the formes fixes. De Orto also wrote an early setting of Dido's lament, Dulces exuviae, from the Aeneid (iv.651‚Äì4), containing extensive chromatic writing. NotesReferences and further reading  Sherr, Richard, ed.

He was also a member of the Council for National Policy as well having been a holder of national and international media interests. Childhood Born on April 27, 1945, James Douglas McCotter spent his childhood in Texas and Colorado. He was raised by an originally Methodist family, which later joined the conservative evangelical Plymouth Brethren Church. McCotter graduated from high school in Colorado Springs. Apostle In 1965, a 20-year-old McCotter left his home in Colorado Springs, Colorado and moved to Greeley, Colorado in an attempt to recreate the \\"New Testament Church\\", a church model he believed no existing Christian denomination was emulating fully. After arriving in Greeley, McCotter began sharing his faith primarily at the University of Northern Colorado campus, which he also began attending. According to McCotter, by the end of the first year 12 people had joined him, after 1966 there were thirty, and the following years it \\"doubled and tripled.\\" Eventually a handful of men moved out to other cities in Colorado, as well as Las Cruces, New Mexico, to start other \\"works\\" as they were then called. The size of these \\"works\\" were most likely small, as McCotter has stated that, \\"Most people wouldn't have called them churches. Most people never knew we were churches.\\" Though McCotter was not ordained by the Plymouth Brethren, he claimed the authority of an apostle. McCotter dropped out of college to focus on ministry full time, and was planning to move down to Pueblo, Colorado to continue his efforts; however, in 1967, at the height of the Vietnam War, he was drafted into the United States Army. During training, at a base in Fort Polk, Louisiana, McCotter met Dennis Clark, to whom he imparted his vision of God's \\"strategy\\" to reach the world. Returns to the U.S. Jim McCotter returned to Colorado after he had completed his service in Vietnam. In May 1970, Dennis Clark returned from the service as well and joined Jim in Colorado. On a bus in 1970, while attending a conference, Jim struck up a conversation with Herschel Martindale, who would become one of the early leaders of the movement in the summer of 1970. In the early 1970s, he helped start an evangelical movement with other young Christians at a Colorado university. He spent a summer touring Southwest universities, setting up campus-based churches, which according to one member church, were characterized by a literal interpretation of the Bible, a \\"strong expectation of the soon return of the Lord, and an aggressive emphasis on evangelism.\\" Over the next decade, the movement spread into the wider community. \\"The Blitz\\" In 1970, under the leadership of Jim McCotter, Dennis Clark, Herschel Martindale, and others, approximately 30 college-age Christians embarked on \\"The Blitz\\" - a summer-long evangelistic outreach to several university campuses in the Southwestern United States. \\"The Blitz\\" was named after the Blitzkrieg military offensive of World War II. During the next few years, additional mission outreaches and training conferences took place as the movement expanded to many more university campuses. By the summer of 1973, nearly 1,000 people attended the movement's national conference, held on an eastern campus. Fifteen new campuses were \\"Blitzed\\" that summer by hundreds of recruits, fresh from the conference, and the movement continued to gain strength. By the end of 1973, there were about 15 \\"works\\" established. The movement would eventually become known as Great Commission International, and then later Great Commission Association of Churches. =Child rearing controversy= In 1978, McCotter was criticized in the Des Moines Sunday Register for a statement he made during a sermon about child rearing. The sermon was based upon the Bible verse Proverbs 20:30 (\\"Blows that wound cleanse away evil; strokes make clean the innermost parts.\\") In it, McCotter said, \\"When you discipline, this verse indicates, as others do, that you want to do it so it wounds. Now, when you say ‚Äòwounds,‚Äô it doesn‚Äôt mean that you have a bloody mess on your hands necessarily. It doesn‚Äôt mean that you have a child ‚Äòwounding‚Äô like he has a broken leg.... And he may, and often will be, black and blue. My children have been many times. And it cleans evil from them.\\" ISU child development professor Sedahlia Crase was quoted as saying, \\"What he advocates on this tape is just poor child-rearing practice in every sense of what we know now. Besides that, it's illegal to injure a child and bruising is injuring them. I‚Äôm upset that he goes around preaching these kinds of things.\\" McCotter responded to Crase's comments with, \\"She might have taken what I said out of context, but I would stand by the idea that the Bible very strongly advocates spanking children. Of course, they also need to be loved and played with.\\" =Dating teaching controversy= McCotter has been criticized for his teachings on dating. In a 1984 Great Commission International (GCI) teaching, McCotter taught that dating was forbidden by the Bible because, \\"What we call 'dating,' the Bible may call 'partiality' (James 2:9). What we call 'boyfriend/girlfriend,' the Bible may call a 'clique' or a 'faction' (Galatians 5:20).\\" According to former member and researcher Larry Pile, quoted in a 1988 newspaper article, \\"[In GCI] You‚Äôre practically engaged by the time you have what you normally consider a date. I do know of cases where couples were actually broken up by the leadership.\\" Resignation In late 1986, McCotter announced his resignation from GCI, stating a desire to utilize his entrepreneurial abilities in an attempt to influence secular media for Christ as his reason. Two years later, Jim moved to Florida and has not attended a church affiliated with the movement since that time, with the exception of the 2003 Faithwalkers conference. In an interview with New Zealand's North and South, McCotter denied involvement with Great Commission, saying, \\"I personally grew up as a Protestant and have tried to contribute most of my life to Christian or charitable organizations. However, I am not remotely involved in any way, in any \\"Church Movement\\" as you suggest, although I do go to church.\\" References in Churches That Abuse book In Ronald Enroth's 1992 book Churches That Abuse, Great Commission International, and specifically Jim McCotter, are given as examples of an \\"abusive church\\" situation. Specifically, McCotter is criticized for authoritarian leadership practices during his time with Great Commission: > In abusive-church situations, the \\"spiritual family\\" often displaces the > biological family, and church leaders assume the role of surrogate parents. > The founder of Great Commission International, Jim McCotter, is said to have > usurped \\"the very authority of parents over these young people\\" by allowing > youthful \\"elders\\" to exercise greater influence in the lives of the young > adults than did their own parents. Enroth's 1994 follow-up book, Recovering From Churches That Abuse, further mentioned McCotter when researcher Paul R. Martin noted that: Also in the book, Great Commission International (GCI) was criticized for not denouncing McCotter's teachings and negative influence on the movement, something GCI elder Dave Bovenmyer was quoted as saying \\"we cannot in good conscience do.\\" A former member was quoted in response, suggesting such an attitude \\"protects unequivocally the prophet-leader (McCotter), keeping him in holy light, regardless of the realities of distortion and problems seen from those not under the spell. The implication is, then, that they, even though having made significant moves, are still under 'the spell.'\\" Media mogul While with GCI, McCotter began several publishing enterprises, including a monthly publication called Today's Student, which claims to have reached circulation of 500,000 (a figure disputed by researcher Larry Pile in his book Marching To Zion.) His further interests in media continued with the acquisition of two radio networks (including Florida Radio News Network in 1988), and Media Net (a television holding company). Sun Newspaper Group In 1989, McCotter formed the Sun Newspaper Group and associated Sun Newspapers, which at their peak circulated 235,000 copies a week. After 15 months, McCotter unexpectedly fired the 96 employees and closed the newspaper. The Sun's content was described by Bill Bradford, formerly the Sun's managing editor, as \\"a very conservative viewpoint.\\" Fred Fedler, chairman of the University of Central Florida journalism department, at one point criticized the Sun's content as \\"a bunch of fluff.\\" McCotter was further criticized for his business practices as well as the sudden shutdown of the paper, which occurred without warning five days before the Christmas holiday of 1991. One former employee was quoted as saying, \\"I like Jim McCotter, and that sounds crazy, 'cause I also see him as devious and unethical and a money-grabber. And yet he's a very likable guy. You go figure it out.\\" Canterbury Television In 2001 in New Zealand, McCotter bought Canterbury Television (CTV) for $500,000 and set up a newspaper called The Citizen. He further consolidated television interests there by buying out rival Now TV the following year. Following this, McCotter purchased an $800,000 luxury home with \\"spectacular ocean views\\" in Christchurch, New Zealand. The Citizen lasted about two years, before shutting down in July 2002. At least eight former employees sought legal advice over employment disputes with McCotter, and at least five of these cases were settled out of court. Sports editor Ken Nicholson publicly criticized McCotter's business practices following the closure of The Citizen, saying, \\"My first impression was that he was a slimy, greasy American and my impression since is that for all his supposed religious beliefs he has absolutely no caring for people at all. All it would seem McCotter is interested in is money and more money.\\" McCotter was also criticized for damaging \\"the regional television product quite severely\\", having been accused of driving the three previous news programmes out of business prior to the closure of The Citizen. McCotter, an American, was also criticized as a \\"foreign investor\\" for not caring \\"about the interests of the locals.\\" Political interests McCotter also described himself through New Zealand Media Group as a \\"longtime member of the Council for National Policy\\", an umbrella organization and networking group for conservative activists. Pressed for his views about the CNP in an interview, McCotter replied \\"most in the Republican Party... would consider it an honor to have a leadership role in the CNP.\\" Two of McCotter's nine children, Shannon and Liz, have also appeared on membership lists for the CNP. Maverick Jets In March 2001 McCotter Aviation purchased majority shares of Maverick Air Inc., the brainchild of homebuilder Bob Bornhofen. He expanded Maverick Air Inc. under the name Maverick Jets and relocated it from Colorado to Melbourne, Florida. Leader In August 2002, McCotter was featured on the cover of the Brevard Technical Journal (a Florida Today publication) touting the Maverick Jets Leader, a Very Light Jet priced at $750,000 for \\"the common man.\\" McCotter has experienced several setbacks in seeking certification and production for the Leader, the twinjet VLJ in which Maverick Jets chief pilot Jack Reed suffered a fatal crash in January 2003. On May 8, 2003 Maverick Jets laid off a significant portion of its staff suddenly and without warning. and McCotter's attempts to secure production with Tbilisi Aerospace Manufacturing in the Republic of Georgia fell through in January 2004, leaving McCotter with the task of finding yet another means of production. SmartJet Having produced very few Leaders, Maverick continued development of a next-generation VLJ, the SmartJet. Sohu reported that McCotter eventually signed a treaty with Xi'an, China Vice-Mayor Yang Guangsheng to begin production of SmartJets there. The treaty-signing ceremony was held on November 24, 2006. In 2011, Lorenzo Amaya became the CEO of Maverick. Big Horn Mountain Resorts McCotter purchased Powder Pass Ski Area, Meadowlark Lake Resort and Deerhave Lodge between 1998 and 1999, joining the properties under the operating name Big Horn Mountain Resorts. Andrew Purrier was a minority investor in the joint venture. A dispute broke out on December 23, 1999. McCotter insisted that the resort bar remain open despite Purrier's allegation of the moral toll it was taking on residents and workers. Subsequently, Purrier quit the business. On April 9, 2007 McCotter was cited by the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality for violating health, safety, environmental and sanitation conditions of his Forest Service permit because of raw sewage that had polluted Ten Sleep Creek. Bighorn National Forest Supervisor Bill Bass shut down Deerhaven and Meadowlark Lake Resorts because of the spillage. Frozen lines at both locations were suspected of causing the leaks. On May 15, 2007, Bass reported that McCotter, who had been restricted from touching the sewer systems during the closure, had submitted a plan to fix the problem, which was subject to approval by the U.S. Forest Service and the Wyoming DEQ. On July 19, 2008, the U.S. Forest Service permanently barring Jim McCotter from operating his businesses in the National Forest following a series of investigations and closures for alleged health and safety violations, pending a 45-day appeal period. On October 8, 2008, a pending sale of Big Horn Mountain Resorts was reported. On June 30, 2009, the Washakie County Sheriff's department issued public notice of a Sheriff's sales of the entire Big Horn Mountain Resorts complex to satisfy unpaid creditors. The sale occurred on July 16, 2009 with the three properties making up the Big Horn Mountain Resorts selling for $410,000 to Wayne and Holli Jones, owners of another local lodge. A misdemeanor warrant for ignoring court orders to appear for allegation of failing to pay past employees was issued to McCotter by the Bighorn County attorney's office. Prior to the sale, the Washakie County Sheriff's Department set the minimum bid at $263,000 that included sale costs and outstanding liens filed against McCotter.

After meeting a humble, unassuming master and his three eager students, the fighter continues his arrogant mission and leaves another few reputations in tatters. The defeated master stumbles away with his pupils, but is left shattered by his complete loss of face. It is this dejected state that persuades his three students to look for revenge against the mysterious wanderer. However, they are well aware of their limitations and decide to split up in the search for worthy masters. The first avenger meets an eccentric Crane style master who easily beats him during a fight. After some persuasion, the master accepts the newcomer and decides to teach him the precise Crane movements. The second meets a bean curd seller and her blind father. An initial misunderstanding is turned into a teaching opportunity when the second student is taught legwork by the high-kicking woman. Finally, the third is given a chance to learn pole-fighting from a fisherman after a failed attempt to steal his fish. This opening animosity also turns into a fruitful teacher/student relationship. Meanwhile, the original shamed master is also preparing his skills and, in between drinking bouts, sharpens up his swordplay skills. With each of the four now galvanized by this period of teaching, they are now ready to meet their tormentor.

He is the illustrator of more than 50 books and the author of nine books. He is best known as the illustrator of Kay Thompson's Eloise (1955) and others in the Eloise series. Knight has illustrated for a wide variety of clients, creating artwork for magazines, children's fashion advertisements, greeting cards, record albums and posters for Broadway musicals, including Gypsy, Irene, Half A Sixpence, Hallelujah Baby! and No, No Nanette. Influences One of two sons of artist-writers Clayton Knight and Katharine Sturges Dodge, Hilary Knight was born on Long Island in Hempstead. His father illustrated aviation books, and his mother was a fashion and book illustrator. Living in Roslyn, New York as a child, Hilary was age six when he moved to Manhattan with his family. Knight attended the City and Country School (class of 1940) for elementary and middle school and Friends Seminary for high school. Knight recalled: After study with George Grosz and Reginald Marsh at the Art Students League, Knight labored as a ship painter while serving in the navy from 1944 to 1946. Returning to New York, he studied architectural drafting (at Delahanty Institute), interior design, and theater design, working for one summer as an assistant designer at a theater in Ogunquit, Maine. He painted murals in private homes and entered the field of magazine illustration, starting with Mademoiselle in 1952, followed by House & Garden, Gourmet, McCalls, and Woman's Home Companion. His work as a humorous illustrator was strongly influenced by the British cartoonist Ronald Searle. Books In 1955, he collaborated with Kay Thompson to create the whimsical black, white and, pink look of Eloise. Knight says that the image of Eloise was based on a 1930s painting by his mother Katherine Sturges Dodge.Barnes & Noble: Meet the Writers series , retrieved 8 April 2015 The live CBS television adaptation on Playhouse 90 (1956) with Evelyn Rudie as Eloise received such negative reviews that Kay Thompson vowed never to allow another film or TV adaptation. Three book sequels followed: Eloise in Paris (1957), Eloise at Christmastime (1958) and Eloise in Moscow (1959). Thompson and Knight teamed to create another sequel, Eloise Takes a Bawth, working with children's book editor Ursula Nordstrom. That title was announced in the Harper Books for Boys and Girls fall 1964 catalog, but in the mid-1960s, Thompson removed the three Eloise sequels from print and did not allow Eloise Takes a Bawth to be published. It was an action that deprived her collaborator of income for decades (a situation that changed with Thompson's death in 1998). In Salon, Amy Benfer speculated on Thompson's motives in \\"Will the real Eloise please stand up?\\" (June 1, 1999): Eloise Takes a Bawth was finally published in 2002. Knight recalled: Knight also illustrated most of the Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle books. Other publications with Knight illustrations include Good Housekeeping and the children's magazine Cricket. In addition to creating children's picture books‚Äîamong them, in collaboration with poet Margaret Fishback, A Child's Book of Natural History (USA: Platt & Monk, 1969), a revision and extension of A Child's Primer of Natural History by Oliver Herford‚ÄîKnight has illustrated for other genres, such as Peg Bracken's The I Hate to Cook Book. The roll call of artists Knight admires includes Ludwig Bemelmans, Joseph Hirsch, Leo Lionni, Robert Vickrey, and Garth Williams. His 1964 book Where's Wallace, featuring an orangutan that kept escaping from the zoo to visit different places such as a circus, museum, department store, beach etc. and who had to be located in each of the books panoramic pictures, anticipated Where's Waldo? by more than 20 years. The Algonquin Cat written by Val Schaffner with drawings by Hilary Knight is a charmingly illustrated story about a real cat that resides in the Algonquin Hotel in New York City. There have been numerous cats in the hotel over the years. This is a delightful addition to the numerous books with Mr. Knight's art work. Published by Delacorte Press/Eleanor Friede in 1980. Galleries Over the decades, Knight maintained an apartment in midtown Manhattan, which also served as his studio and library. Here, he adds to his collection of books, sheet music, programs, and soundtrack and cast recordings. He is represented by two galleries‚Äîthe Giraffics Gallery (East Hampton, New York) and Every Picture Tells a Story (Santa Monica, California). In other media The 2015 HBO documentary, It's Me, Hilary: The Man Who Drew Eloise, chronicles Knight's work on Eloise, personal life, and tumultuous relationship with Kay Thompson.

It originally aired once monthly on Saturday nights from 11:30 p.m. to 1 a.m. Eastern time, the same time slot as Saturday repeats of The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson during its first season, then to replace Saturday Night Live,http://www.americanpressinstitute.org/content/1462.cfm once a month on those weekends when the SNL cast was not producing a show. The program was awarded a George Foster Peabody medal in 1975 and attracted a cult following.  Overview  The program was hosted by Lloyd Dobyns, who also did much of the reporting. The show's creator and executive producer was past (and future) president of NBC News, Reuven Frank. Together, Dobyns and Frank were largely responsible for the distinctive writing and quirky style of the program. The opening theme was the guitar intro to \\"Jumpin' Jack Flash\\" by the Rolling Stones. As a forward-focused executive, Frank brought in a woman, Clare Crawford-Mason, as the show's producer. In 1978, after four years of critical success and moderately good ratings for that hour, NBC moved Weekend to prime time. After airing once a month in various time slots in September, October, and November, the network placed the program weekly on Saturday nights at 10 P.M. Eastern time starting in December 1978. Linda Ellerbee was added as Dobyns' co-host and co-lead reporter. Placed against strong programs on ABC and CBS, the show eventually died of poor ratings. A few years later, Ellerbee and Dobyns reunited to anchor another late-night NBC news program, NBC News Overnight. The program was known for an offbeat format, a somewhat less serious tone than such programs as 60 Minutes; comic relief included the use of humorous images (e.g., a trio of magazine covers, New York, The New Yorker, and the completely fictitious New Yorkest), and the occasional animated cartoon, such as Mr. Hipp. At the end of each broadcast, until the program began airing weekly, a sequence would be played of a rotating phonograph record with voiceover explaining when the next broadcast would take place. In the spring of 1978, when Weekend's late-night run ended, Dobyns noted that \\"Your Subscription Has Expired\\", but stated that Weekend would be back that fall, in prime-time. At the end of the last broadcast in 1979, the voice intoned, \\"...there will be no more Weekends.\\" References Category:1974 American television series debuts Category:1979 American television series endings Category:American late-night television shows Category:1970s American television news shows Category:NBC late-night programming Category:NBC original programming Category:NBC News Category:Peabody Award-winning television programs Category:1970s American late-night television series ","title":"Weekend (TV program)"},{"id":"10821964","text":"Kecksburg may refer to: * Kecksburg, Pennsylvania, United States * Kecksburg UFO incident, a purported Unidentified Flying Object incident in 1965 near Kecksburg in Western Pennsylvania ","title":"Kecksburg"},{"id":"10821978","text":"The Shades of Blue were an American blue-eyed soul vocal group from Livonia, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit. The band started in high school as The Domingos. Original group members included Nick Marinelli, Ernie Dernai, Linda Allen, and Bob Kerr. By 1965 The Domingos signed a recording contract for the Detroit-based Golden World label. John Rhys, a sound engineer, suggested a name change and The Shades of Blue was the result.Group History at the Shades of Blue website Their biggest hit was the 1966 song \\"Oh How Happy\\", written by Edwin Starr, who did the lead vocals on the record which reached number 12 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, number 16 on the US Billboard R&B; chart, and the Top 10 in Canada. That same year, the song \\"Lonely Summer\\", again written by Starr, reached number 72, and then \\"Happiness\\" peaked at number 78 in the Hot 100. Taste in popular music changed in the late 1960s, and the group's later single efforts failed to chart and they disbanded in 1970. In 2003, original member Nick Marinelli joined a Motown group that was reforming, The Valadiers. That lineup, consisting of Marinelli, original Valadier Stuart Avig, and new members Andy Alonzo and Donald Revels, began also touring as The Shades of Blue. Revels left the group in 2006 and was replaced by Charlie Valverde; he returned to the group three years later when the last original member, Nick Marinelli, decided to leave.

Plot In the town of Ho Si, two prominent Chinese clans have a family feud dating back centuries. The ancestors of the malevolent Mong clan and the righteous Chows split up their territories with a property line and instituted laws to keep each faction from crossing those lines. Those brave enough to traverse the line have their legs cut off by the opposing clan. The Chows want to do away with this ridiculous law and establish relations with the Mongs. But the clan leader Mong Fan (Ku Feng) wants nothing more than to totally eradicate his hated enemies. He seeks to recruit the best Kung Fu teacher in the land, Wong Yang (Ti Lung) to train his family members. Teacher Wong refuses because he knows that Mong Fan's men will use his teachings only for selfish purposes. Mong Fan comes up with an idea to frame Teacher Wong for murder. He arranges for a hired hand to start a fight with Teacher Wong in the center of town in front of the townsfolk. The man who challenges Teacher Wong is no match for him, and when the guy stumbles backwards after Teacher Wong pushes him away, he ends up falling onto wooden spikes that puncture his flesh. The guy promptly dies in view of everyone, and the townspeople turn against the respected Kung Fu instructor. Rather than face arrest, Teacher Wong flees so he can prove his innocence. An emissary of the Mong clan finds Teacher Wong hiding out, and claims that in exchange for martial arts lessons, Mong Fan will use his political clout to clear his name. Rather than face the alternative, Teacher Wong agrees to educate the Mongs in the ways of Kung Fu. Chow Ping (Wang Yu) is a member of the Chow family who risks life and limb to traverse the boundary lines in order to witness Teacher Wong's agonizing lessons. Then Chow Ping returns to his makeshift training room to practice what he learned from the training sessions. At the Mong palace, Teacher Wong meets Chao Cheh (Therea Chu), a beautiful young lady (adopted by the Mongs when she was an infant) who takes a liking to him. The careless Chow Ping is captured on the Mong territory and brought to Mong Fan for sentencing before they remove his limbs. Teacher Wong overhears and speaks up on behalf of Chow Ping. Teacher Wong tells Mong Fan he is taking Chow Ping back to the Chow's territory. Both Teacher Wong and Chow Ping fight their way through the Mong hordes and cross over the border where the Chow clan are happy to welcome them. Teacher Wong is impressed with Chow's Ping's desire to learn Kung Fu and offers to teach him the martial arts. One of Mong Fan's lackeys crosses the border to deliver a message to Teacher Wong. Mong Fan insists there is no hard feelings and begs Teacher Wong to continue training the Mongs. Teacher Wong insists they meet up to discuss the matter. During the negotiations, Mong Fan requests that Teacher Wong teach his men the unbeatable Shaolin Pole Style. Mong Fan firsts tries to bribe him, and then tries to blackmail him. Teacher Wong responds by accusing the Mongs of setting him up on the murder charge. Mong Fan tells him to collect his belongings and leave the Mong property. As Teacher Wong starts to do so, he is assaulted by Mong soldiers and seriously wounded. Chao Cheh hides him and tends to his wounds while the Mongs continue to search for him. Mong Fan then orders his men to murder some monks, so he can use his clout to place the blame on the Chow clan. The police soon round up the Chows and it looks like Mong Fan will have his way. But Teacher Wong vows to tutor Chow Ping in the ways of the Shaolin Pole Style. After some intensive training, Chow Ping comes up to speed. Teacher Wong insists that they pay a visit to the home of Mong Fan and expose the truth and clear the name of the Chow family. However, Mong Fan learns of their upcoming arrival, and plans a trap to eradicate his enemies. Production The Kung Fu Instructor was the first Shaw Brothers film partly shot with a steadicam.

The film is a sequel to Come Drink With Me.  Plot  Golden Swallow is forced into violence when a figure from her mysterious past goes on a killing rampage while leaving evidence that holds her responsible. Golden Swallow gets involved with a love triangle involving a mad, but righteous, swordsman named Silver Roc and a gentle warrior named Golden Whip. The three team up to conquer the evil forces of the martial world, but their joint venture only lasts so long, due to the two men's egos. Ultimately, a duel to the death is planned between them, leaving Golden Swallow caught between two men, both of whom she admires. Cast *Cheng Pei-pei as Golden Swallow *Jimmy Wang as Silver Roc *Lo Lieh as Golden Whip *Chao Hsin-yen as Mei Niang *Wu Ma as Flying Fox *Yeung Chi-hing as Poison Dragon *Hoh Ban as Golden Dragon Branch chief Production Director Chang Cheh stated that for Golden Swallow he disregarded a historical backdrop for the film to give the story more creative freedom. Chang Cheh was his first time partnering with Ni Kuang to write the script. Cheh said that Ni \\"quickly picked up the techniques of scriptwriting‚Äî'The Invincible Fist' (1969) was simply a masterstroke by a gifted writer! The ensemble of characters was each vividly portrayed and the script depicted the four seasons with a sensibility rarely found in Chinese films. I also heightened the romantic sub-plot of 'The Golden Swallow' which centres on the triangular love relationship between Jimmy Wang Yu, Lo Lieh and Cheng Pei-pei.\\" The Shaw Brothers intended to base the script on the character of Golden Swallow character in King Hu's Come Drink with Me. After several script re-writes, the characters bear little to no resemblance to the original characters from Come Drink With Me. Chang also stated he took influence from Japanese cinema at the period, and chose to shoot the film entirely in Japan. Release Golden Swallow was distributed in Hong Kong on April 4, 1968. The film was among the ten top-grossing Mandarin films of 1968. Reception From contemporary reviews, \\"Harr.\\" of Variety stated the film was in competition with Italian Western as \\"one of the bloodiest films ever released\\" and that \\"the nauseating degree of violence and bloodshed in this film recommends it only for sadistic, exploitation situations.\\" From a retrospective review, Donald Guarisco of AllMovie stated that the film was \\"full of outrageous bloodletting, over-the-top melodrama and plenty of machismo\\" and depending on the viewers tolerance of these elements, the film \\"offers plenty of rewards for those who can appreciate action filmmaking at its most extreme.\\" Guarisco found that \\"the plotting doesn't always make sense and Cheng Pei-Pei [...] is unfortunately sidelined by the film's male-centric story line. That said, Hsia Yu-Yen delivers all the thrills a kung-fu film should offer and is well worth the time for genre enthusiasts thanks to its historic importance as an early Chang Cheh classic.\\" It was the third-highest grossing film in Hong Kong for the year behind You Only Live Twice and Dragon Inn.

The region was generally southwest of Aleppo, in the neighborhood of other kingdoms, such as Nuha≈°≈°e, Niya, and others. In the Amarna letters, Barga is referenced only in one damaged letter, (EA 57, EA for 'el Amarna'), when referencing the \\"king of Barga\\" and \\"Akizzi, king of Qatna\\".

The company had been formed as one of six state-owned Soci√©t√© Nationales in the 1936 reorganization of military industries, and was created by the nationalization of several aircraft factories in the north of France. It survived until 1954 when it merged to form Nord Aviation. History Following the resolution of the 1936 general strike of French heavy industry the government of L√©on Blum introduced an act to nationalize the French war industry on or before April 1, 1937. This led to the formation of six nationalized aircraft manufacturing companies, organized regionally: SNCAN (in the north), SNCAO (west), SNCAM (Le Midi), SNCAC (centre), SNCASO (the south-west), and SNCASE (south-east). A further company, SNCM, (previously Lorraine-Dietrich), was created for building aircraft engines. SNCAN was a merger of the Potez factory at M√©aulte in Picardy, CAMS in Sartrouville, ANF Les Mureaux in the Ile-de-France, Amiot/SECM Caudebec-en- Caux, and Breguet Le Havre in Normandy. SNCAN at aviafrance.com; retrieved 27 June 2016 In the run-up to the Second World War, SNCAN continued to build aircraft to established designs of the original makers. It also produced several new designs and prototypes, although only one, the Potez 63 series, went into full production.Sampson Low Guide p252 After the fall of France in 1940, SNCAN's assets lay in the occupied zone, and work in the aircraft industry was restricted, although in 1944 the company was able to build a German sport and touring aircraft, the Me 108, under licence; after the end of the war this was continued as the Nord Pingouin. During this period, SNCAN adopted the \\"Nord\\" marque name and generated a series of successful designs, the best-known of which was the Nord Noratlas transport aircraft. In 1949 the SNCAC group was dissolved and several of its assets were absorbed by SNCAN; however a further period of rationalization saw SNCAN merge with SFECMAS, the recently-privatized French government Air Arsenal, and renamed ‚ÄúNord Aviation‚Äù, Later, in 1970, Nord merged with Sud Aviation to form Aerospatiale, the French government's primary aircraft manufacturer. Products Nord Noratlas in 1983 Aircraft designed and built by SNCAN include the Pingouin, in 1944; the Nor√©crin, a 3-seat cabin monoplane trainer, in 1945: the Nor√©lan, a 3-seat trainer, in 1948: and the Noroit, a 2-engine air-sea rescue amphibian/flying-boat, in 1949 In 1947 Nord built a prototype carrier bomber, the Nor√©clair, and a prototype 2-seat helicopter, the Nor√©lic, but neither went into production. In 1947 Nord also designed the Norazur, a prototype 2-engine transport plane, and followed it with the Noratlas in 1949, which became the main transport aircraft of the French Air Force of the era.

He won seven world championships and set up one of Britain's largest cycle-parts companies and ran a roller-skating rink and ballroom. Background Meredith was born in St Pancras, London. Sources give his name at birth as Lewis Leon Meredith. However, reports in the cycling press refer to him as Leon Lewis Meredith, and friends called him Jack. He was a mild-looking, bespectacled man who parted his hair in the centre. Cycling said: > There was something Clark Kent, the children's comic-book hero, in the make- > up of Edwardian cyclist Meredith. Like Clark Kent he presented a mild, shy, > bespectacled image off the bike, but once on the bike he became Superman, > beating all and sundry in a devastating manner.Dennis Donovan, Cycling, UK, > undated cutting He was born in central London. He became interested in cycling in 1901 and made his first long ride, from London to Brighton, 80 km on badly surfaced roads. On the way he met riders from Paddington Cycling Club, neighbours in the region of London where he lived, and agreed to ride with them provided they didn't go too fast. It was Meredith, however, who set the pace and the other riders asked him to join their club. He rode his first race in the Finchley Harriers meeting on the track at Kensal Green, in north London, winning the one-mile handicap. By the end of the season he was the national tandem-paced champion over 50 miles (80 km). He finished 17 seconds outside the record and was cheered off the track. Meredith worked for his uncle, William Boyer, a builder with a wharf on the canal in Praed Street, Paddington. Meredith cycled all over London visiting his uncle's building sites. When Meredith showed talent at racing, his uncle subsidised him. That meant he could have a full-time trainer, a masseur and that he could travel across Europe to meet the best opposition.Price, Mike (2000), Days of Gold and Glory, privately published, UK International career Meredith won his first world championship at Crystal Palace in London in 1904, beating the nine starters - four of them British - in the 100 km motor-paced event. He set off straight into the lead, passing five kilometres in 4m 49, 10 km in 9m 20s, 20 km in 18m 31s, and 30 km in 27m 30s. By then he was leading by five laps. He completed 50 km in 45m 15s and 80 km in 1h 15m 5s. Then his pacing motorcycle broke down and Meredith hit the track's banking and fell. He rolled across the track, turning somersaults. He got back to his feet, blood running, shouted for another bike and another pacer and finished the race 7m 19s faster than the world amateur record. He became an Olympic gold medalist in the 1908 Games, also held in London, on the 660-yard track at White City. He rode in the team pursuit with Ernie Payne, Ben Jones and Clarence Kingsbury. It was the first time the event had been held in the Olympic Games. In the tandem race he was eliminated in the semi-final. He reached the final of the 20 km race but did not finish. He was part of the team which won the silver medal in the Team road race. In the individual road race he finished fourth. Eight years later he participated in the individual road race, finishing 18th. He won seven motor world motor-paced championships, in London in 1904, Antwerp in 1905, Paris in 1907, Leipzig in 1908, Copenhagen in 1909, Rome in 1911 and Berlin in 1913. The world track champion, Bill Bailey, said of him: > He was one of the most versatile riders I ever saw, winning races from a > quarter-mile to six hours. Usually when thinking of motor-paced riders, we > regard them as specialists who, once they have adopted the little front > wheel,Bicycles in motor-paced racing have smaller front wheels to bring the > rider into the shelter of his pacer reversed forks and big gears are somehow > never able to show good form in normal competition. Meredith was an > exception. He mixed his racing most successfully and, in 1910, when he had > already been world champion five times, astounded the cycling world by > becoming the first rider ever to beat five hours for an unpaced out-and-home > 100 [miles] on the road.Leon by Bill, Sporting Cyclist, UK, undated cutting And of the world championship in Copenhagen, he said: > The championships were at Ordrup track, and we were staying at > Charlottenlund by the sea, and had to walk a mile or so through the forest > to get to the track. We could speak no Danish and the staff at the small > pension where we were staying spoke no English. But on the day of the > championships, just as we were leaving for the track, they lined up and made > it known that they wanted 'tips'. We were annoyed at this, since we were not > leaving for several days. Not until later did we realise the tips they > wanted concerned the bike races, for the Totalisator was already a feature > of Danish racing. Domestic career Meredith was the first rider to beat five hours for a 100-mile time trial, held out-and-home. He did it on the Bath road out of London, starting in Hounslow and turning between Newbury and Hungerford. He finished in 4h 52m 52s and won a gold medal put up by the magazine Cycling. The Rover bicycle on which he rode was put on display in the Gamages department store in central London. The cycling administrator and journalist Frederick Bidlake called Meredith's ride \\"rather fortunate when he went for the Cycling medal to get the out-and-home '100' inside five hours at his first essay, when all the other triers were finding trouble.\\"Cycling, 11 July 1912, p27 His record was beaten by Frederick Grubb later that year with 4h 50m 49s. In 1916, he had built enough of a fortune from the cycle industry (see below) that the British Olympic Association ruled that he should get no expenses should he be picked for the Olympic Games. The formal reason given was that he was too old and not worthy of public support. The war ended both his career and the 1916 Olympic Games. Meredith's last races were in 1924, 22 years after he had started, when he tried to break long-distance records. Among the trophies he won was the Penrose Cup, large enough to hold eight UK gallons. Friends joked he should fill it with beer and drain it. But Meredith was teetotal and a non-smoker. Business career In 1912 Meredith acquired the rights to a patent for a racing tyre. It was unusual that whereas other racing tyres were tubular and sewn together at the base, Meredith's tyre was sewn with diagonal threads that made the inner tube accessible at the base of the tyre. Meredith enjoyed skating and found that one of his teachers, a man called Bain, was brother of Joseph Bain who ran the Constrictor Tyre Company, in Nursery Lane, Forest Gate, a suburb of London. Meredith was asked for financial advice and invested ¬£100. He soon replaced the managing director, who had invented the Constrictor tyre. He began importing more cycling parts and buying Bastide bicycles from France and hubs from BSA. He branded them all Constrictor. By then he owned a roller-skating rink in the Porchester Hall, off Queensway, London, and advertised it by breaking the national one-mile record at Holland Park rink and the five-mile record on the Maida Vale rink.Price, Mike (2000), Days of Gold and Glory, UK, privately published He then opened another in the Broadway, Cricklewood, north London, He ran it with Bill Skuse, one of his pacers on the track. Encouraged by that, he bought a dance hall. He later planned a sporting club beside the Thames at Twickenham. Constrictor was a pioneer in alloy cycle equipment and made a novel alloy rim called the Conloy. The firm outlasted Meredith's death but foundered at the end of the 1960s in a national decline of the cycle trade and in face of rising imports.http://www.classiclightweights.co.uk/components/constrictorhubs.html Marriage and death Meredith married Cissie Parkham in 1914. Her father Charles was Member of Parliament for Willesden, an alderman of Middlesex County Council and a magistrate. He was later knighted. Their daughter, Leonie, was named after Leon. Meredith died six days before his 48th birthday while on a skiing holiday in Davos, Switzerland, of a heart attack. His ashes were interred at Willesden cemetery. Wreaths came from around Britain and from France and Belgium, some in the shape of bicycles. Cissie died in a nursing home five years later.

He is best known as a director of Avon Products and the founder of the Alexander Dawson Schools. Early life Girard Henderson (Jerry) was born on February 25, 1905, in Brooklyn, New York. He was the son of Alexander D. Henderson and Ella M. Brown. He was the grandson of Joseph Henderson (pilot) and brother to Alexander D. Henderson, Jr. In 1910, the family moved from Brooklyn to Suffern, New York. Henderson went to the Suffern Grammar School and later the Sisters of the Holy Child Jesus. He continued his education at the preparatory Storm King School in Cornwall On Hudson, New York. He graduated in the class of 1923.

(Those are reasons in the normative sense.) For example, that a doctor's patient is grimacing is a reason to believe the patient is in pain. That the patient is in pain is a reason for the doctor to do things to alleviate the pain. In another sense of the term, reasons are explanations of why things happened. (These are reasons in the explanatory sense.) For example, the reason the patient is in pain is that her nerves are sending signals from her tissues to her brain. A reason, in many cases, is brought up by the question \\"why?\\", and answered following the word because. Additionally, words and phrases such as since, due to, as, considering (that), a result (of), and in order to, for example, all serve as explanatory locutions that precede the reason to which they refer. Types of reason In philosophy, it's common to distinguish between three kinds of reason. Normative or justifying reasons are often said to be \\"considerations which count in favor\\" of some state of affairs (this is, at any rate, a common view, notably held by T. M. Scanlon and Derek Parfit). Explanatory reasons are considerations which serve to explain why things have happened‚Äîthey are reasons events occur, or why states of affairs are the way they are. In other words, \\"reason\\" can also be a synonym for \\"cause\\". For example, a reason a car starts is that its ignition is turned. In the context of explaining the actions of beings who act for reasons (i.e., rational agents), these are called motivating reasons‚Äîe.g., the reason Bill went to college was to learn; i.e., that he would learn was his motivating reason. At least where a rational agent is acting rationally, her motivating reasons are those considerations which she believes count in favor of her so acting. Normative reasons Some philosophers (one being John BroomeBroome, John. \\"Reasons\\". In Reason and Value: Themes from the Moral Philosophy of Joseph Raz. Edited by R. Jay Wallace et al. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004. p. 28.) view normative reasons as the same as \\"explanations of ought facts\\". Just as explanatory reasons explain why some descriptive fact obtains (or came to obtain), normative reasons on this view explain why some normative facts obtain, i.e., they explain why some state of affairs ought to come to obtain (e.g., why someone should act or why some event ought to take place). Epistemic vs. practical reasons Philosophers, when discussing reasoning that is influenced by norms, commonly make a distinction between theoretical reason and practical reason. These are capacities that draw on epistemic reasons (matters of fact and of explanation) or practical reasons (reasons for action) respectively. Epistemic reasons (also called theoretical or evidential reasons) are considerations which count in favor of believing some proposition to be true. Practical reasons are considerations which count in favor of some action or the having of some attitude (or at least, count in favor of wanting or trying to bring those actions or attitudes about). =Epistemic reasons in argumentation= In informal logic, a reason consists of either a single premise or co-premises in support of an argument. In formal symbolic logic, only single premises occur. In informal reasoning, two types of reasons exist. An evidential reason is a foundation upon which to believe that or why a claim is true. An explanatory reason attempts to convince someone how something is or could be true, but does not directly convince one that it is true.

The 2002 team made it to the Elite Eight for the first time in school history. On April 14, 2008, Walvius announced her resignation from South Carolina.ESPN report on Walvius resignation Walvius is currently the co-founder and co-CEO of SHEEX, Inc., a bed linen company specializing in sheets and pillowcases constructed from advanced athletic-performance fabrics. Playing career Walvius attended Gar-Field Senior High School in Virginia, prior to attending Virginia Tech, where she was an all-American basketball player. As a player at Virginia Tech, Walvius established herself as one of the most successful players to wear a Hokie uniform. The four-year letterwinner was named to Virginia Tech's All-Decade team, is the school leader in career blocked shots and ranks second in field goals made and third in scoring and rebounds. An All-Metro Conference selection in 1986, Walvius was named All-America by Converse and Street & Smith's. She graduated in 1986 with a bachelor's degree in urban studies. Early coaching career Walvius began her coaching career at Bradley University in 1986 as an assistant coach for two seasons. After spending a year in private business, she returned to coaching as an assistant at the University of Rhode Island from 1989 to 1990 before becoming the youngest head coach in the nationWalvius' SHEEX biography at Virginia Commonwealth University in 1990. Walvius' ability to rebuild a program was first evident during the five years she spent at the helm of VCU. Only 25 years old when she was hired, Walvius coached at VCU from 1990 to 1995 and led the 1995 team to the Women's NIT after posting a 20-10 record. That 20-win season was just the second in the history of the VCU program. Walvius' effort did not go unnoticed as she was named the 1995 Virginia State Coach of the Year and was nominated for National Coach of the Year in District 3. Leaving VCU in 1995, Walvius was the head coach at West Virginia University from 1995-1997. In just her second season at WVU, Walvius led the 1996-97 squad to its first winning season in five years with a 19-12 record. She displayed her ability as an outstanding recruiter by attracting a top-20 freshman class to West Virginia. University of South Carolina Walvius was hired on April 28, 1997, as the head women's basketball coach at the University of South Carolina. Susan Walvius led South Carolina into the postseason in five of her 11 seasons at helm, including five of the last seven. She took a floundering program to back-to-back NCAA Tournaments with an Elite Eight appearance in 2002, earning her SEC and WBCA District 3 Coach of the Year honors in just her fifth season on the job. Over her 11 seasons, she amassed a 165-160 record, giving her an 18-year career mark of 263-261. Walvius built the program's success with a series of nationally ranked recruiting classes. Between 2003 and 2008, she signed four classes ranked among the nation's top 20, including a 2008 group that was as high as seventh by Blue Star Index in the early signing period. In total, she attracted six top-25 recruiting classes to the South Carolina campus. The 2007-08 class was tabbed as the No. 18 group in the nation by The Collegiate Girls Basketball Report, and Blue Star Index rated the 2005-06 class as the 13th-best in the country. The 2003 class was ranked as the 10th-best class in the nation by All-Star Girls Report. The 1998-99 freshman class was named as the 10th-best in the country, while the freshmen who entered Carolina in the fall of 1999 were named the 22nd-best group in the country. Under Walvius, the Gamecocks emerged as one of the best defensive and rebounding teams in the Southeastern Conference the last two years. In 2006-07, South Carolina led the SEC in blocked shots, rebounding margin and rebounds per game and ranked second in the league in field goal percentage defense and steals. In 2007-08, the Gamecocks were among the league's top five in all but one of those defensive categories as well. With Walvius stalking the sidelines, Carolina turned the Colonial Center into a difficult place for opponents to play in 2006-07, compiling a 15-5 record at home that included an 80-48 pounding of in-state rival Clemson, a 95-35 wipeout of SEC foe Alabama and an 81-40 second-round Women's NIT victory over America East Conference champion Hartford. In fact, the Gamecocks outscored the opposition by an average margin of just under 22 points per game in home games played during the 2006-07 campaign en route to matching a school record total for home victories. Walvius' crew posted a nine-game improvement in 2005-06 from the year prior, a mark that led all Southeastern Conference schools and ranked as the fifth- largest improvement in any of the power conferences (SEC, ACC, Big Ten, Big 12, Pac-10, Big East). A significant factor in the Gamecocks' improvement was suffocating defense, as Carolina led the SEC and ranked second nationally in field goal percentage defense, holding the opposition to 34.7 percent shooting. Walvius' team also ranked among the national leaders in blocked shots (third; 6.7 per game) and rebounding margin (fifth; 8.3 per game) and ranked among the top 30 teams nationally in scoring margin (16th; +12.2 points per game), field goal percentage (22nd; 45.0%) and scoring defense (26th; 56.8 points per game). The Gamecocks set the school record for blocked shots and field goal percentage defense in 2004-05, then came back to break both of those records in addition to setting a new school mark for scoring defense in 2005-06. During the 2001-02 and 2002-03 seasons, Walvius posted a combined 48-15 mark with the Gamecocks and a 19-9 mark in the SEC. For her efforts, Walvius was honored as a finalist for Naismith Coach of the Year in each of those seasons. Under Walvius in 2001-02, the Gamecocks recorded a 25-7 overall mark and finished second in the SEC with a 10-4 record. South Carolina advanced to the NCAA Tournament and into the Elite Eight for the first time in school history. The team achieved its first national ranking in 10 years and finished the season ranked sixth in the final ESPN/USA Today Coaches' Poll. For her achievements, Walvius was selected as the SEC Coach of the Year by her peers and by the Associated Press, and was named as the WBCA District 3 Coach of the Year. In 2002-03, Walvius directed South Carolina to a 23-8 record and a 9-5 SEC mark. Ranked 18th in the final ESPN/USA Today Coaches' Poll, South Carolina secured a 20-win season for the second consecutive year and posted the school's first back-to-back NCAA Tournament appearances in 12 years. The Gamecocks defeated Tennessee-Chattanooga in the first round, marking the first back-to-back first round NCAA Tournament victories in South Carolina's history. The Gamecocks fell in the second round to host Penn State. To celebrate the team's Elite Eight appearance in the 2002 NCAA Tournament, the Gamecock women were also chosen to open the state-of-the art Colonial Center on Nov. 22, 2002. The inaugural game attracted a state of South Carolina basketball record crowd of 17,712 to witness Carolina's victory over in-state rival Clemson. The record attendance was also the fifth-highest figure in the NCAA during the 2002-03 season. While at South Carolina, Walvius worked hard to establish South Carolina's reputation as one of the up-and-coming women's basketball programs in the country. Her dedication to the program was critical to helping build top-notch facilities for the student-athletes, renewing the team's focus on academic success and developing the Mentors Program. Walvius is extremely involved with the marketing of the team and is a frequent guest speaker in the community and on radio and television. Thanks to her work behind the scenes and on the sidelines, Gamecock home game attendance tripled. During the 2001-02 season, South Carolina established another precedent by selling out the Carolina Coliseum for the January 17th game against Tennessee. The announced attendance of 12,168 was the largest at any Carolina Coliseum sporting event all year. Walvius' teams consistently achieved a high grade- point average and set a new team record with a 3.347 mark in the Spring 2005 semester. In addition, seven Gamecock players were named to the SEC Winter Sports Academic Honor Roll in 2005. Carolina led the league and set a new school record by placing 10 players on the SEC Winter Sports Academic Honor Roll in 2007, just one year after leading the conference with eight honor roll selections in 2006. Walvius also recognized the importance of student-athletes receiving guidance in the real world before graduation, as she engineered the Mentors Program, which teamed up female leaders of the Columbia community with members of the Gamecock basketball team to further their real-world education, cultural and networking skills. The mentors helped the student-athletes work on their cultural and business education for life after basketball.

Constructed from materials commonly found in modern athletic wear, SHEEX provide similar moisture-wicking, temperature-control, breathability and stretch not found in traditional cotton sheeting.SHEEX features Notable Susan Walvius coached three players who went on to play in the WNBA after their careers at South Carolina. Under Walvius, the Gamecocks advanced to the Elite Eight in 2002 with Walvius earning SEC Coach of the Year recognition. Carolina had consecutive top-20 finishes in 2002 and 2003 with Walvius at the helm. Under Walvius, South Carolina made five trips to the postseason in her last seven years, including consecutive postseason appearances in 2006, 2007 and 2008. In her 11th year at Carolina, Walvius was the fourth-longest tenured SEC coach at her current school, trailing only Pat Summitt (34 years, Tennessee), Andy Landers (29 years, Georgia) and Sharon Fanning (13 years, Mississippi State). Under Walvius' direction, the Gamecocks were one of the SEC's elite defensive teams. Carolina has ranked in the top three in the conference each of the last four years in field goal percentage defense and blocked shots. Walvius led Carolina to a nine-game improvement and a trip to the postseason in 2005-06. Walvius was responsible for the inception of the Mentors Program, in which successful women from the community work with South Carolina's female student- athletes to help them achieve their goals both in and out of the classroom. From 2004 through 2008, Walvius' players have appeared on the SEC Winter Sports Academic Honor Roll 38 times, a figure that leads all SEC schools during that time. In fact, South Carolina's 38 honorees is more than twice as many as seven SEC schools during that same time (Auburn, Georgia, Kentucky, LSU, Mississippi State, Ole Miss, and Vanderbilt.) During the 2001-02 season, the Gamecocks were ranked in the top 10 nationally for the first time since the 1981-82 season.

It is one among the four pairs of deep cerebellar nuclei, which are from lateral to medial: the dentate, interposed (which consists of the emboliform and globose), and fastigial nuclei. These nuclei can be seen using Weigert's elastic stain. Emboliform, from Ancient Greek, means \\"shaped like a plug or wedge\\". Structure The emboliform nucleus is a wedge-shaped structure of gray matter found at the medial side of the hilum of the dentate nucleus. Its neurons display a similar structure from those of the dentate nucleus. In some mammals the emboliform nucleus is continuous with the globose nucleus, forming together the interposed nucleus. When present, the interposed nucleus can be divided in an anterior and a posterior interposed nucleus, considered homologues of the emboliform and globose nuclei, respectively. Function As a part of the interposed nucleus, the emboliform participates in the spinocerebellum, a system that regulates the precision of limb movements. Axons leaving the emboliform exit through the superior cerebellar peduncle and reach the red nucleus in the midbrain and several thalamic nuclei which project into areas of the cerebral cortex that control limb movement.

San Marco, a former US Postal Service employee, shot and killed seven people in Goleta, California before taking her own life. Spree shooting On January 30, 2006, San Marco drove to her former Santa Barbara condominium and killed Beverly Graham, a former neighbor who she argued with. She then drove to the mail processing plant in Goleta, California. San Marco entered the sprawling plant's lot by tailgating another car as it passed through the gate. She gained entry to the building by taking an employee's identification badge at gunpoint in order to gain an electronic access to the secure staff entrance. She then told the employee to leave and was unharmed. At 9:00 p.m., San Marco shot Ze Fairchild, 37, in the head in the building's parking lot. She turned to Maleka Higgins and shot her at point-blank range. She then shot Nicola Grant. Some workers, after hearing gunshots, went to the windows to see what was happening. San Marco reportedly turned to them and smiled. Several employees fled to a nearby fire station. San Marco entered the building (which had around 80 employees inside at the time) and continued firing. Walking into the complex, she shot supervisor Charlotte Colton, who was then dragged into a room by a coworker. Colton would die two days later in Cottage Hospital.http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4665790.stm San Marco headed to her former work station, where she encountered Guadalupe Swartz who saw her coming and tried to flee. San Marco, however, rapidly fired four shots into Swartz, killing her. Dexter Shannon, an Air Force veteran of the Vietnam War with grandchildren, heard nothing of the gunshots as he was working with headphones on; he was fatally shot at point-blank range. San Marco then took her own life by shooting herself in the head.http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/01/31/postal.shooting/ Aftermath Graham's body was linked to the shooting hours after it ended.

She went to Edward R. Murrow High School, later attending Brooklyn College. She then studied natural resources management at Rutgers University in New Jersey but did not graduate. In 1989 she came to California, where after studying she was hired as a guard at medium-security Chuckawalla Valley State Prison in Blythe. She quit two days before her probation period ended. She never gave a reason for quitting and was described as a good worker. She had held down a number of jobs, including working as a dispatcher for the Santa Barbara Police Department in the mid-1990s, a job for which she underwent a background check and psychological evaluation. She left the job after several months. San Marco worked at a high school serving lunch before quitting in 2000. She eventually bought a condominium and went to work for the postal service as a clerk. She left on psychological disability following a 2003 incident in which she was pulled out from under a mail-sorting machine and had to be wheeled from her workplace by police in handcuffs. She did return briefly, but was again removed from the building due to her erratic behavior and never returned. She was institutionalized at a Ventura mental hospital for three days in February 2001. San Marco's car broke down in Grants, New Mexico sometime in 2004 and she decided to stay and reside there until the shooting. In the small town of Grants, San Marco earned a reputation for her strange behavior, which included speaking (or sometimes furiously shouting) to herself, ordering food at restaurants and bolting out the door before eating it, stripping naked in public (often in random parking lots), kneeling and praying in random places (often roadsides), talking to an imaginary friend, screaming death threats, yelling profane rap lyrics, and making racist comments. She began getting tattoos and showed them to a neighbor named Jeannie Steen. When Steen didn't react, San Marco walked around her in a circle and spat on the ground. In July 2004, she was denied a business license to begin publishing a periodical which would have been known as The Racist Press. San Marco also at one point said she wanted to register a cat food business and was rejected because she lived in an unincorporated area of Cibola County. While being interviewed there, she would often talk to herself. After the rejection, she would frequently come to the office and stare at an employee named Sonya Salazar and ask to see her. Salazar was often told to hide when San Marco came to the office. San Marco once made a rude accusation that Salazar slept with someone and authorities were called. She also came into contact with authorities after she appeared naked at a gas station. She was clothed when the officers arrived and ultimately let off with a warning. These run-ins with authorities were frequent and she was once admonished for driving half-naked. San Marco sold her condominium and told people she was going to visit a sister on the East Coast. Sometime in November, a mental health clinic manager named Darlene Hayes said she saw San Marco alone in a post office parking lot kneeling at her car and talking to herself. When asked what she was doing, she replied, \\"They pray before they get in.\\" She was supposedly talking about her sister and brother (who she apparently believed were there). Hayes called the police and left several minutes later. According to a police lieutenant, there was no record of Hayes‚Äôs call. A man who delivered propane gas to her and described her as polite noted that she always paid her bills on-time, though he had noticed her talking to an \\"imaginary friend.\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/03/us/woman- in-california-postal-shootings-had-history-of-bizarre-behavior.html Possible motives and preparation San Marco was apparently convinced that she was the target of a nefarious conspiracy centered at the Goleta postal facility, according to writings recovered from her home in New Mexico. A spokesman for the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Office conjectured that San Marco's paranoia and history of mental illness may have motivated her to commit the murders. Racism may have also been an influence in the massacre, as six of the victims were minorities (three were black, one was Chinese- American, one was Hispanic and one was Filipino). She may have also murdered Graham for personal reasons. Graham had been in several arguments with San Marco. According to Graham's boyfriend, San Marco would often go outside and start singing loudly. Graham also complained to her brother that San Marco would come out and \\"rant and rave\\" in front of her building.https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2006-feb-02-me- postal2-story.html Among San Marco's writings were error-laden explanations of various religions and a confusing theory linking the U.S. government to \\"Son of Sam\\" killer David Berkowitz, the Ku Klux Klan and racist murders.https://www.investigationdiscovery.com/crimefeed/crime-history/female- postal-worker-jennifer-san-marco-goes-on-mass-shooting-rampage A diary with over 100 pages was also found full of meticulously tracked perceived slights and offenses she received from people.

While the I-Novae engine has been in development since 2004 (as a personal project until 2010), development of Infinity never started. In Infinity, the player controls a spacecraft and travels throughout a galaxy trying to make a name for themselves. Players will be able to connect to an online server on which large numbers of other people are playing in a persistent world. A pre-alpha combat prototype was launched in 2006 and a tech demo video was released in 2010. In 2013, the development team announced the postponement of Infinity the MMO and a new plan to fund Infinity: Battlescape, a space combat game, through Kickstarter. Plot Based on the original Infinity Timeline and Exegesis. Human descendants of planet Earth, who have long lost the knowledge of Earth's existence, inhabit a star by the name of Delta on planet Geodesa under the rule of Deltan Government. Scientists predict the collapse of the star within 500 years. Deltan government construct a massive evacuation vessel named the Ark Starship which may hold a few million occupants from the billions that are on Geodesa. As the filled Ark ship leaves Delta in search of a new home, remnants of the Deltan government call evacuation of the whole Delta star system. Only a few million people manage to escape before the collapse of the star. Deltan government reforms on nearby habitable stars growing into an interstellar civilization known as the Deltan Federation. Hundreds of years later the Ark Starship colonizes a star several thousand light years away from the collapsed Delta star forming the Centaurus culture. Thousands of years later Centaurus re-establish contact with the Deltan Federation. Centuries later distant Deltan colonies form the Star Fold Confederacy politico-economic union against the wishes of the Deltan Federation. Deltan Federation declares war on Star Fold Confederacy. Deltan Federation closes Hyper-spatial Interstellar Portal used for high speed travel between Deltan and Star Fold space. War lasts for decades at a seeming stalemate and is brought to end by Centaurus acting as peace negotiators. A thousand years later practically all humans develop a genetic malfunction that causes infertility. All interstellar governments blame each other and especially the Centaurus due to their Biogen gene manipulation program. A cold war sets in. A data file is received from an anonymous source that points that a cure may be found on Earth. From this point the game's players act as protagonists with the discovery of Earth as their main objective. I-Novae Studios noted that discovery of Earth would end the beta phase for the game, which corresponds to the subtitle 'The Quest for Earth'. Gameplay Gameplay is inspired by the 1984 space simulation game Elite by David Braben and Ian Bell. Like Elite, the player travels throughout the vast galaxy to fight, trade, explore and develop their character through missions, bounties, etc. However, both have different game features resulting in different gameplay. Infinity does not focus on combat as much as Elite. The combat and flight in Infinity is twitch-based (at least for smaller ships) and not at all similar to the point-and-click-based movement and combat in many other massively multiplayer online games set in space. Instead, the game is open-ended, and the player can engage in either aggressive or peaceful styles of playing. Also, unlike Elite, the player can land on planets and see their landscapes like in Elite's sequels Frontier: Elite II, Frontier: First Encounters (Elite 3) and Elite Dangerous: Horizons. Planets and systems Like Elite, Infinity will offer a vast number of systems and planets. The universe will consist of approximately 200 billion star systems each with an assortment of planets, moons, and smaller bodies in addition to other phenomena such as nebulae and black holes. Procedural generation is used to create this vast universe on the fly as the player moves throughout the galaxy. This does not mean that each player will generate a random universe to explore on their own, but rather that each player's client will generate a universe identical to everyone else's, creating an effect similar to the non-procedural design of most standard massively multiplayer online games. In addition, the engine has the ability to automatically adjust planetary level of detail so that the player can seamlessly move from orbit to ground level without loading screens. Unlike many space based computer games, realistic scales and distances are maintained, and planetary bodies move realistically about their stars. Infinity Combat Prototype The Infinity Combat Prototype is a standalone game that was released in May 2006 and improved upon until July 2007 as a way to test some components of Infinity before it was finished. It is a separate program that only shares the engine, and as such it does not represent what would be found in Infinity. Its goal was to test the graphics engine, the physics engine, and the networking engine, and to experiment with its controls, combat mechanics and balance, to measure performance, and to improve stability and fix bugs. The combat prototype does not include any form of planetary landing, and only ten ships are available to the players. The gameplay is arena (team vs team) based, as opposed to Infinity's intended open-ended, \\"sandbox\\" style of play. Infinity: Battlescape In 2013 the game's developers announced that they would be attempting to raise funding on Kickstarter for a multiplayer combat game Infinity: Battlescape at some time in 2014. The development blog described the game to be an arena-based shooter in space. However, due to the capabilities of the I-Novae engine, this \\"arena\\" will take the form of a realistically scaled solar system. On a basic level, it is planned to focus on combat in the Infinity universe. On October 21, 2015, the Infinity: Battlescape Kickstarter was launched. The campaign succeeded and raised a total of . Lead developer Keith Newton announced in an update following the successful campaign that he had begun working full-time on the project. Development In late August 2004, on video game development website GameDev.net, Flavien Brebion created a journal describing the progress of developing the 'Infinity' game engine, not to be mistaken for BioWare's Infinity Engine. The game engine's features creation of real scale planet terrain, star systems and galaxies using procedural generation. While it would be possible to create other game assets using a similar method. Brebion chose not to do so, as the quality of such assets was unsatisfactory. These assets included 3D models of ships and structures, textures, and music. So instead, contributors of the forum community offered their free time producing these assets. In May 2006, Flavien released the freeware Infinity Combat Prototype meant to test networking code, as well as basic space combat gameplay. Game engine unrelated content was mostly provided by volunteer contributors from the community. Game consists of two teams fighting each other with the goal of earning credits and destroying the other team's NPC capital ships. Players earn credits from destroying enemy ships and are able to buy other types of ships and missiles. The prototype is still available for download on the official ModDB Infinity game page, though there are no longer any official servers set up. Up until this point, the project was managed by Brebion as a part-time hobby project. In early 2010 Epic Games engine programmer Keith Newton left Epic to form I-Novae Studios along with Brebion with the initial goal of creating the commercial engine called I-Novae, proceeds of which were meant to fund development of the game. In March, Newton attended the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco and showed the engine privately to potential licensees. In April, I-Novae Studios uploaded a 14-minute technical demonstration video of I-Novae game engine on their website and in August also on their official YouTube channel. I-Novae Studios failed to attract licensees for the engine and so in April 2013 announced that the Infinity: The Quest For Earth project has been put on hold for a reduced scope space combat game called Infinity: Battlescape. I-Novae Studios stated that game's full development would be funded through a Kickstarter campaign. I-Novae Studios stated that the same I-Novae game engine would be used and noting that development of the game engine meant progress towards the MMORPG. It is important to note that development of Infinity (subtitled The Quest for Earth) never commenced. Until Battlescape, all development effort was purely on developing the I-Novae engine.

Israeli officials and Western diplomats said that US and Israel were discussing ways to destabilize the Palestinian government so that newly elected Hamas officials will fail and elections will be called again.

Jeremy M. Sharp and Christopher M. Blanchard, CRS Report for Congress, 27 June 2006 (RS22370) The US ceased providing both indirect and direct foreign aid to the PA with the exception of some emergency humanitarian assistance. The US said it would withhold $411 million in aid over the next few years and asked for the return of $30 million it had already donated. The CRS Report for Congress wrote on 27 June 2007: \\"With the suspension of all USAID-managed economic aid to the West Bank and Gaza Strip and the general prohibition on financial transactions by U.S. persons with the PA, the United States has tried to assuage fears that its policies are causing Palestinian suffering.\\" Impact Although, despite the suspension of aid to the PA, aid to the Palestinian territories reportedly increased during 2006, poverty climbed sharply during the same period. According to Oxfam, this was because international aid did not compensate for the substantial loss of income created by the withholding of at least $475m of Palestinian tax and customs revenues by Israel. This accounted for around 50% of the PA's monthly income in 2005. Also, the aid came late, it did not generate income, and was less effective. Moreover, the boycott had helped trigger factional violence between Palestinians. Oxfam observed in 2006 dropping incomes, increased poverty, institutional collapse and economic decline. Media reports suggested that the humanitarian situation in the West Bank and Gaza Strip was worsening. In February 2006, Quartet envoy James Wolfensohn warned that the Palestinian Authority was on the verge of economic collapse within two weeks time, because of the cessation of tax funds to the PA from Israel. In a letter to the US government, Wolfensohn warned that the economic situation could lead to violence.Wolfensohn warns of PA collapse. Jerusalem Post, 27 February 2006 In his report of May 2006, Wolfensohn questioned the decision of Western powers to cut all but humanitarian aid to the Palestinians' Hamas-led government.

Temporary international mechanism The World Bank warned a collapse of the Palestinian infrastructure would be hard to reverse. On 9 May 2006, the Quartet issued a new statement, in which it reiterated its grave concern that the PA government had so far failed to commit itself to the formulated principles. It noted that it had \\"inevitably impacted direct assistance to that government\\" and was deeply concerned about the consequences for the Palestinian people. The Quartet announced an international mechanism to ensure direct delivery of assistance to the Palestinians.Quartet Statement, 9 May 2006. un.org In conjunction with the World Bank, the Quartet attempted to find a way to provide some relief to the Palestinians without working with the Hamas-led government. The US softened its hardline position to prevent the PA from collapsing and agreed to a mechanism for indirect funding under pressure of EU and Russia. On 17 June 2006, the Quartet announced the establishment of a temporary international mechanism (TIM), to channel funding directly to Palestinians, while bypassing the Hamas-led PA government.Quartet Statement, 17 June 2006. Changes after Hamas takeover of Gaza Following Hamas' takeover of Gaza in June 2007, Israel and the United States announced plans to blockade the Gaza Strip. At the same time, they lifted some of the sanctions on the West Bank, in order to support the Fatah government. On 16 June 2007, United States Consul-General Jacob Walles said that the US was planning to lift the ban on direct aid to the emergency government installed by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. Some Israeli officials said US$300 to $400 million in Palestinian tax revenues may be transferred to the PA, short of the $700 million Abbas was seeking. The Quartet voiced support for Abbas and concern for the humanitarian situation in Gaza, though they did not announce any change in the ban on direct aid. Few days later, the US ended its 15-month economic and political boycott of the Ramallah-based PA, but the Hamas-led government in Gaza remained under sanction and blockade.

It was named by the Dutch for its resemblance in outline to a sugarloaf when sailing up the river towards it. Topography Sugarloaf Hill is part of a ridge running northeast and southwest close to the east shore of the Hudson. The peak of Castle Rock lies off the northeast end of the ridge, while NY 9D runs along the west side. A small stream runs along the southeast side and flows into the Hudson, while to the northwest,the ground declines gently to the Hudson. The hill is high at its summit, towards the middle of the ridge. A red-blazed trail climbs its western side, and then runs along the ridge, across the summit, to end at a viewpoint over the Hudson of about elevation.New York‚ÄìNew Jersey Trail Conference Trail Map 101, East Hudson Trails: Hudson Highlands State Park 7th ed., 2006 Flora Opuntia humifusa (Eastern prickly pear cactus) in bloom atop Sugarloaf Hill Somewhat unusually, Opuntia humifusa, Eastern prickly-pear cactus, can be found growing on ledges atop Sugarloaf Hill. The oceanic warmth brought upstream by the estuarine Hudson and the sunny, exposed rock allows this cactus to grow on the hill, and elsewhere in the Hudson Highlands. History Col. Beverley Robinson's house, occupied by Benedict Arnold as his headquarters Beverley, the house of Col. Beverley Robinson, was built at the foot of the peak in 1758. Robinson, a Tory, lost his house and estates there to confiscation in 1777. It was used as a headquarters by several American generals during the Revolution, and Benedict Arnold chose to dwell there when he took command of West Point in 1780. It was at Beverley that Arnold learned of the capture of John Andr√© and the failure of his treason, and fled thence to HMS Vulture. Beverley later passed into the hands of Hamilton Fish, and was destroyed by a fire in 1892. The hill was donated by the Osborn family to the Taconic State Park Commission in 1974, and now forms part of the Osborn Preserve of Hudson Highlands State Park.

In other words, it is the error of treating something that is not concrete, such as an idea, as a concrete thing. A common case of reification is the confusion of a model with reality: \\"the map is not the territory\\". Reification is part of normal usage of natural language (just like metonymy for instance), as well as of literature, where a reified abstraction is intended as a figure of speech, and actually understood as such. But the use of reification in logical reasoning or rhetoric is misleading and usually regarded as a fallacy. Etymology From Latin res (\\"thing\\") and -fication, a suffix related to facere (\\"to make\\").\\"reification, n.\\" OED Online. Oxford University Press, September 2016. Web. 24 September 2016. Format Thus reification can be loosely translated as \\"thing-making\\"; the turning of something abstract into a concrete thing or object. Theory Reification takes place when natural or social processes are misunderstood or simplified; for example, when human creations are described as \\"facts of nature, results of cosmic laws, or manifestations of divine will\\". Reification may derive from an inborn tendency to simplify experience by assuming constancy as much as possible.David Galin in B. Alan Wallace, editor, Buddhism & Science: Breaking New Ground. Columbia University Press, 2003, p. 132. Fallacy of misplaced concreteness According to Alfred North Whitehead, one commits the fallacy of misplaced concreteness when one mistakes an abstract belief, opinion, or concept about the way things are for a physical or \\"concrete\\" reality: \\"There is an error; but it is merely the accidental error of mistaking the abstract for the concrete. It is an example of what might be called the 'Fallacy of Misplaced Concreteness. Whitehead proposed the fallacy in a discussion of the relation of spatial and temporal location of objects. He rejects the notion that a concrete physical object in the universe can be ascribed a simple spatial or temporal extension, that is, without reference to its relations to other spatial or temporal extensions. > [‚Ä¶] apart from any essential reference of the relations of [a] bit of matter > to other regions of space [‚Ä¶] there is no element whatever which possesses > this character of simple location. [‚Ä¶ Instead,] I hold that by a process of > constructive abstraction we can arrive at abstractions which are the simply > located bits of material, and at other abstractions which are the minds > included in the scientific scheme. Accordingly, the real error is an example > of what I have termed: The Fallacy of Misplaced Concreteness. Vicious abstractionism William James used the notion of \\"vicious abstractionism\\" and \\"vicious intellectualism\\" in various places, especially to criticize Immanuel Kant's and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel's idealistic philosophies. In The Meaning of Truth, James wrote: > Let me give the name of \\"vicious abstractionism\\" to a way of using concepts > which may be thus described: We conceive a concrete situation by singling > out some salient or important feature in it, and classing it under that; > then, instead of adding to its previous characters all the positive > consequences which the new way of conceiving it may bring, we proceed to use > our concept privatively; reducing the originally rich phenomenon to the > naked suggestions of that name abstractly taken, treating it as a case of > \\"nothing but\\" that concept, and acting as if all the other characters from > out of which the concept is abstracted were expunged. Abstraction, > functioning in this way, becomes a means of arrest far more than a means of > advance in thought. ... The viciously privative employment of abstract > characters and class names is, I am persuaded, one of the great original > sins of the rationalistic mind.James, William, The Meaning of Truth, A > Sequel to 'Pragmatism, (1909/1979), Harvard University Press, pp. 135-136 In a chapter on \\"The Methods and Snares of Psychology\\" in The Principles of Psychology, James describes a related fallacy, the psychologist's fallacy, thus: \\"The great snare of the psychologist is the confusion of his own standpoint with that of the mental fact about which he is making his report. I shall hereafter call this the \\"psychologist‚Äôs fallacy\\" par excellence\\" (volume 1, p. 196). John Dewey followed James in describing a variety of fallacies, including \\"the philosophic fallacy\\", \\"the analytic fallacy\\", and \\"the fallacy of definition\\".Winther, Rasmus G. (2014). James and Dewey on Abstraction. The Pluralist 9 (2), pp. 9-17 http://philpapers.org/archive/WINJAD.pdf Use of constructs in science The concept of a \\"construct\\" has a long history in science; it is used in many, if not most, areas of science. A construct is a hypothetical explanatory variable that is not directly observable. For example, the concepts of motivation in psychology, productivity in economics, and singularity event horizon in physics are constructs; they are not directly observable. The degree to which a construct is useful and accepted as part of the current paradigm in a scientific community depends on empirical research that has demonstrated that a scientific construct has construct validity (especially, predictive validity).Kaplan, R. M., & Saccuzzo, D. P. (1997). Psychological Testing. Chapter 5. Pacific Grove: Brooks-Cole. Thus, in contrast to Whitehead, many psychologists seem to believe that, if properly understood and empirically corroborated, the \\"reification fallacy\\" applied to scientific constructs is not a fallacy at all; it is one part of theory creation and evaluation in 'Normal science'. Stephen Jay Gould draws heavily on the idea of fallacy of reification in his book The Mismeasure of Man. He argues that the error in using intelligence quotient scores to judge people's intelligence is that, just because a quantity called \\"intelligence\\" or \\"intelligence quotient\\" is defined as a measurable thing does not mean that intelligence is real; thus denying the validity of the construct \\"intelligence.\\" Relation to other fallacies Pathetic fallacy (also known as anthropomorphic fallacy or anthropomorphization) is a specific type of reification. Just as reification is the attribution of concrete characteristics to an abstract idea, a pathetic fallacy is committed when those characteristics are specifically human characteristics, especially thoughts or feelings.http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/446415/pathetic-fallacy pathetic fallacy. Retrieved on: 9 October 2012 Pathetic fallacy is also related to personification, which is a direct and explicit ascription of life and sentience to the thing in question, whereas the pathetic fallacy is much broader and more allusive. The animistic fallacy involves attributing personal intention to an event or situation. Reification fallacy should not be confused with other fallacies of ambiguity: * Accentus, where the ambiguity arises from the emphasis (accent) placed on a word or phrase * Amphiboly, a verbal fallacy arising from ambiguity in the grammatical structure of a sentence * Composition, when one assumes that a whole has a property solely because its various parts have that property * Division, when one assumes that various parts have a property solely because the whole has that same property * Equivocation, the misleading use of a word with more than one meaning As a rhetorical device The rhetorical devices of metaphor and personification express a form of reification, but short of a fallacy. These devices, by definition, do not apply literally and thus exclude any fallacious conclusion that the formal reification is real. For example, the metaphor known as the pathetic fallacy, \\"the sea was angry\\" reifies anger, but does not imply that anger is a concrete substance, or that water is sentient. The distinction is that a fallacy inhabits faulty reasoning, and not the mere illustration or poetry of rhetoric. This distinction is often difficult to make, particularly when the fallacious use is a disguise intended to deceive a literal suggestion. Counterexamples Reification, while usually fallacious, is sometimes considered a valid argument. Thomas Schelling, a game theorist during the Cold War, argued that for many purposes an abstraction shared between disparate people caused itself to become real. The most clear example was nuclear weapons; in Schelling's time, there were conventional explosives that were more destructive than any nuclear ones, which could be and were used as weapons of war. However, nuclear weapons of lower power were not (excepting, of course, Hiroshima and Nagasaki). The abstract concept of nuclear weaponry, which was only different in kind on an abstract level, reified itself. Other examples include the effect of round numbers in stock prices, the importance placed on the Dow Jones Industrial index, national borders, preferred numbers, and many others.

Consumer Direct's intention was to make such basic advice available to everyone regardless of the area in which they live. Previously, provision of consumer advice services varied, with some local Councils operating extensive services with several staff; and others relying on other local advice services such as the Citizens Advice Bureau. The service operated via a standardised national telephone number (currently 03454 04 05 06) and by e-mail. Simpler complaints were dealt with directly; more complex matters that may require direct intervention or indicate some criminality were passed on to the relevant organisation (usually the relevant local Trading Standards office) as a referral. The website also provided a number of advice sheets. Trading Standards offices were notified of all complaints relating to a trader based in their area. It was expected that this would assist in identifying problem traders more quickly. Data was transmitted on a secure network using a standardised xml format which assists automated uploading of the information into local databases and eventually into the proposed eTSN (electronic Trading Standards Network).

Anton Myrer's book, on which the series is based, is a military novel written in the United States. The novel is noted for its stark descriptions of men in combat and in its analysis of human and technical challenges and the moral dilemmas of command. It is one of only two novels on the US Army's recommended reading list for Officer Professional Development; the other is The Killer Angels by Michael Shaara. A coincidental element to both novels is that Sam Elliott had a starring role in the film adaptation of each one, playing a US Army general officer.Military Times newsweekly web site.

Milwaukee Avenue in Chicago's six corners neighborhood, is dedicated to displaying and studying art produced by veterans from the Vietnam War and other wars and conflicts. Originally a traveling exhibition, while in Chicago it was viewed by Mayor Richard M. Daley, who was so taken by the power of the art that he immediately insisted that the city provide a permanent home for it. The entrance hall had 58,226 dog tags hanging from the ceiling, representing the US soldiers who died in Vietnam. It and the other exhibits have been described as deeply moving. History The National Veterans Art Museum is the result of efforts of the Vietnam Veterans Art Group, formed in 1981. The group built a following almost immediately after their first show, Vietnam: Reflexes and Reflections, which opened in October 1981. With increasing popularity and press, the Group grew; veterans from all over the United States began to send in work to be displayed. In 1996 the Vietnam Veterans Art Group established a museum, the only one of its kind at 1801 S. Indiana Ave in Chicago's South Loop. Mission The museum's mission is to inspire greater understanding of the impact of war through the collection, preservation, and exhibition of art created by veterans of all U.S. military conflicts. The museum displays military and artistic heritage, helping civilians and veterans make connections across diverse ranges of experience. With nearly 2,500 works of art by more than 250 artists, the museum offers visitors of all ages and backgrounds insight into war from the viewpoint of people who were physically and emotionally involved in military conflicts. In addition, the museum provides an artistic outlet for veterans to work through and express their combat and military service experiences.

The route loops off U.S. Route 13 (US 13) from south of Townsend to Tybouts Corner, traveling to the west of US 13 by way of Townsend, Middletown, and the Summit Bridge. The route overlaps DE 896 from Mount Pleasant to just north of the Summit Bridge, where DE 896 continues north to Glasgow. DE 71 was built as a state highway during the 1920s and 1930s. By 1938, the route was designated to run from US 13 south of Townsend to US 13 in Tybouts Corner roughly along its present-day alignment. In the 1950s, DE 71 was rerouted to head to the Maryland border southwest of Middletown to connect to Maryland Route 71 (MD 71), with the former route south of Middletown becoming an extended DE 896\\\\. Between the 1950s and 1980s, DE 71 was signed with various alignments of US 301 and US 301S. In the 1980s, DE 71 was truncated to DE 896 in Summit Bridge before being extended back along its 1930s alignment to US 13 by the 1990s. The US 301 concurrency between Middletown and Summit Bridge was removed in 2019. Route description DE 71 heads to the northwest from US 13 on two- lane undivided Summit Bridge Road, passing through wooded areas with some homes. The road passes to the east of the town of Townsend and intersects Pine Tree Road/Main Street in an area of businesses. Past Townsend, the route continues northwest into farmland, crossing the Appoquinimink River and making a turn to the north. DE 71 enters residential areas as it crosses Deep Creek into the town of Middletown, where it becomes South Broad Street. The road heads north through the town and intersects DE 299 (Main Street) in the downtown area. From this point, the route becomes North Broad Street and passes more homes before running near businesses. DE 71 crosses the Delmarva Central Railroad's Delmarva Subdivision line at-grade and intersects Middletown Warwick Road immediately after. DE 71 northbound past Middletown Warwick Road in MiddletownDE 71 heads north on Summit Bridge Road, leaving Middletown. The road runs a short distance to the west of the Delmarva Central Railroad line as it continues through farmland with some scattered residential and commercial development. DE 71 comes to an interchange with the US 301 toll road, where it widens to a four-lane divided highway as it intersects the ramp before it briefly gains a center left-turn lane. The route becomes a divided highway again as it passes under US 301 before it narrows back to a two-lane undivided road. In Mount Pleasant, DE 896 joins DE 71 in a concurrency and the road widens to a four-lane divided highway. The road heads between the Summit Airport to the west and housing developments to the east. DE 71/DE 896 heads to the northwest through farm fields before turning to the west and passing a residential subdivision to the south. In the unincorporated community of Summit Bridge, the road intersects the northern terminus of DE 15. Past this intersection, DE 71/DE 896 turns north and crosses over the Chesapeake & Delaware Canal and the Michael N. Castle Trail on the north bank of the canal on the Summit Bridge, a cantilever truss bridge. Past the Summit Bridge, the road runs through woods and passes under Chesapeake City Road near the Delaware Veterans Memorial Cemetery. DE 71 splits from DE 896 by heading to the southeast on two-lane undivided Red Lion Road. The road passes a mix of woods and homes as it becomes the southern boundary of Lums Pond State Park and turns east. The route curves northeast and continues into a mix of farmland and homes. DE 71 passes through the community of Kirkwood and crosses the Delmarva Central Railroad again at-grade. The road heads across Dragon Creek and continues past suburban residential development before it intersects DE 72 in Williamsburg. The route continues northeast, crossing Norfolk Southern's Reybold Industrial Track at-grade. From here, the road runs to the community of Red Lion, where it crosses Red Lion Creek before reaching an intersection with DE 7\\\\. The final stretch of DE 71 heads northeast toward its northern terminus at US 13 in Tybouts Corner. This intersection is within an interchange between US 13 and DE 1, where DE 1 merges off US 13\\\\. Direct access is provided from southbound DE 1 to DE 71 just before the intersection with US 13. The portion of the route between Main Street in Townsend and Noxontown Road south of Middletown is part of the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad Byway, a Delaware Byway. DE 71 has an annual average daily traffic count ranging from a high of 29,685 vehicles at the north end of the DE 896 concurrency to a low of 4,533 vehicles at the DE 7 intersection. The portion of DE 71 between Middletown Warwick Road and the north end of the DE 896 concurrency is part of the National Highway System. History What is now DE 71 originally existed as a county road by 1920, with the portion south of Townsend proposed as a state highway at this time. By 1924, the entire length of the present route was paved, with the portion from the Summit Bridge to Kirkwood proposed as a state highway and the portion from Kirkwood to Tybouts Corner improved to a state highway. A year later, the state highway had been completed south of Townsend and between Mount Pleasant and Kirkwood. In 1930, the state highway between Middletown and Mount Pleasant was finished. By 1931, the remainder became a state highway. When Delaware started numbering state highways by 1936, this road remained unnumbered. By 1938, DE 71 was designated to run from US 13 south of Townsend north to US 13 in Tybouts Corner, following roughly the same alignment it does today. By 1957, DE 71 was rerouted to follow DE 299 southwest from Middletown before splitting from that route and reaching the Maryland border, where it connected to MD 71\\\\. Also, DE 896 was extended south from Summit Bridge to follow DE 71 to Middletown and then continue along the former DE 71 through Townsend to US 13. By 1959, US 301 was designated along DE 71/DE 299 between the Maryland border and Middletown and US 301S was designated along DE 71 from Middletown to Tybouts Corner. The route was realigned to a new Summit Bridge a short distance to the west in 1960, following new roads that led to the bridge. As a result of this, US 301S/DE 71 was designated onto a former piece of DE 896 between the new alignment and Red Lion Road to the east, with the rest of the former alignment becoming a dead end road south to the canal and the former alignment south of the canal becoming a local road serving the community of Summit Bridge. In 1971, US 301 was shifted to follow what had been US 301S between Middletown and Summit Bridge, with US 301S remaining along DE 71 between Summit Bridge and Tybouts Corner. By 1984, DE 896 was rerouted to run from Mount Pleasant to Boyds Corner, with the route being removed from DE 71 from Mt. Pleasant to Middletown and the segment from Middletown to south of Townsend, which was the original routing of DE 71, becoming unnumbered. A year later, US 301 was rerouted onto the newly aligned DE 896 and US 13 between Mount Pleasant and Tybouts Corner and removed from DE 71/DE 896 from Summit Bridge to Mount Pleasant. The south end of DE 71 was truncated to DE 896 in Summit Bridge by 1987. By 1990, DE 71 was extended back south along its original alignment to again end at US 13 south of Townsend. US 301 was realigned to follow the route between Mt. Pleasant and Summit Bridge in 1992. The concurrency with US 301 between Middletown and Summit Bridge was removed when the US 301 toll road opened on January 10, 2019.

The State of Utah proposed this in response to trademark owners' claims that online advertisers have abused trademarked terms. Some online advertisers, particularly search engines, allow trademarked keywords to generate advertisements for a trademark holder‚Äôs competitors. Several corporations have sued search engines to stop this practice, claiming that it violates United States trademark law. In most of these cases, courts have ruled that traditional trademark law, as currently written, does not restrict advertisers‚Äô ability to use trademarked terms to trigger advertisements. The Utah Trademark Protection Act created the electronic registration mark. Under this now defunct law, trademark holders could have restricted the use of its registered trademarks to generate advertisements for products that compete directly with the trademarked product. The owner of the mark could have sought redress from two parties: The competitor that purchased the advertisement, and the website that displayed the keyword-generated advertisement. This law applied only to internet pages viewed within the State of Utah. The law had instructed the state to create a searchable database of electronic registration marks and to provide access to this database free of charge. This became Utah law in 2007 but was repealed in 2008 before implementation. No other states have established electronic registration mark laws, and the federal government's trademark law does not clearly address how it applies to online keyword searching. Judges in France have consistently upheld rulings that French trademark law bans the sale of trademarked search terms in keyword advertising for any website viewed from within France.  Controversy  Critics find several flaws with electronic registration marks. They argue that restricting the keywords that advertisers can use violates the First Amendment. Another issue concerns an advertiser‚Äôs ability to determine whether a web page is being viewed in Utah or elsewhere: Because of this ambiguity, the law may be vulnerable to Dormant Commerce Clause challenges. Critics also assert that the law worsens the quality of online search results by restricting the search results that users can view. Supporters respond that trademark law has always considered trademark infringement to be a form of theft that is not protected speech, that search engines have demonstrated that they can pinpoint Internet users‚Äô locations, and that paid advertisements are not a core component of an Internet user's experience.

According to Bernadette, her visions occurred at the grotto of Massabielle, just outside Lourdes. Peyramale, under instructions from his bishop, Monsignor Laurence, never visited the grotto during any of the apparitions. He therefore never saw first-hand the effects that these apparitions produced in Bernadette and the onlookers. Nevertheless, he was deeply involved in the events, interviewing Bernadette on a number of occasions. Initially convinced he was dealing with a childish prank or hoax, Peyramale was eventually convinced that Bernadette's experiences were genuine.

Coos Bay is located on the southern Oregon coast. The campus consists of four major buildings, including an Intermediate building which opened in 2000 that serves as a math and science building. It also has a gymnasium that seats 4,000. There is also a separate facility that houses the Drama program. Marshfield High School started in 1908 after being bought from the International Order of Odd Fellows, who owned the cemetery the school is built around. Construction of the first building later known as the East Branch was finished a year after the purchase and was soon followed by a small gym with a pool in 1915. By 1938, the small building was becoming crowded so the decision was made to make another building. With the help of architect Francis Marion Stokes of Portland Oregon, the Main Building (1940) and the West Gym (1939) were added to the campus. In 1952, another gym was installed in the center of campus claiming the name Main Gym. The Main Building was extended onto the North side in 1953, and the West side in 1962. The old East Branch was becoming out dated with the tall pillars and peaked roof compared to the Art Deco style of the rest of the campus, so it was remodeled in 1958. Just before the turn of the century, the school decided to install another building at the North side. The East Branch was becoming old, and the town wanted to keep it around for sentimental value until the plaster ceiling came toppling down onto a desk. Once Pirate Hall was completed in January 2000, the East Branch was relieved of duty, and soon became the parking lot for the students.  Media  In the November 14, 1977 issue of Time magazine, Marshfield High School was one of three American high schools featured in the cover story, \\"High Schools in Trouble: A Tale of Three Cities.\\" The eight-page article, titled \\"High Schools Under Fire: Even outside the big cities, there is trouble everywhere\\", featured Marshfield under the sub-heading \\"The Classroom Blahs.\\" It included quotes from the following MHS teachers: James Whitty (Accounting); \\"Marshfield's most demanding teacher\\" Jerry Kotsovas (Civics); \\"strict, highly respected\\" John Johnson (Math, Head Basketball Coach); Margaret Burdg (English, American Culture); and Noel Connall (History, American Culture). At the time, Marshfield had a student body of 1866, course offerings numbering 215 (including science fiction and film studies), and the dropout rate had reportedly fallen from 24% in 1966 to 13%. The other two schools featured Medford High School in Medford, Massachusetts, a Boston suburb, West High School in Iowa City, Iowa. Academics In 2008, 78% of the school's seniors received their high school diploma. Of 268 students, 210 graduated, 37 dropped out, 1 received a modified diploma, and 20 are still in high school.

Originally named The Ma-Hi Times, the newspaper was renamed The Marshfield Times by editor-in-chief Moreen Littrell. It was produced on the school's own printing press for many years before moving to a paste-up layout model and a local printer in the 1980s. The newspaper converted to digital layout in fall 1991 using Aldus PageMaker software, two Macintosh Classic computers, a digital scanner for importing photos and clipart, and a 300-dpi monochrome laser printer (the laser printer's hard-copy output was pasted-up for final printing). The paper also reverted to The Ma-Hi Times name at time of the conversion to digital layout, using a scan of an original nameplate from the 1920s. The name switched back to The Marshfield Times in 2007 by editor Cody Hockema.

The story is set in the Nebraska plains of United States. The film premiered \\"out of competition\\" and appeared in a midnight slot at the 2008 Cannes Film Festival. Surveillance is Lynch's second feature film, following a fifteen-year break after Boxing Helena. Plot A series of violent deaths and the disappearance of a young woman bring FBI agents Hallaway (Bill Pullman) and Anderson (Julia Ormond) to a town in rural Nebraska. They meet the three survivors of a mysterious bloodbath; the young Stephanie (Ryan Simpkins), the cocaine-addicted Bobbi (Pell James), and the foul-mouthed police officer Bennett (Kent Harper). Hallaway watches the trio's respective interviews with Captain Billings (Michael Ironside) and officers Wright (Charlie Newmark) and Degrasso (Gill Gayle), where they tell the story of what brought them there: In a warped way to pass the day, Officer Bennett and his partner Officer Conrad (French Stewart) watch (both hidden from view) and shoot the tires of cars driving along an isolated county road, then convince the drivers their tires blew out as a result of their speeding, and threaten them afterwards. They do so to one young couple then let them go. A bit later, Stephanie, traveling on vacation with her family, sees a car (the couple's) with blood on it and tells it to her oblivious mother (Cheri Oteri). Bobbi, using drugs with her boyfriend Johnny (Mac Miller), is in a car right behind them. At a rest stop, both girls learn a pair of killers are responsible for a string of murders and likely the woman's disappearance. Stephanie's stepfather Steven (Hugh Dillon) supposedly speeds and their car's tire is shot by Bennett. Bobbi and Johnny are about to offer help, but the officers arrive and harass all of them, making Steven put Conrad's gun in his mouth and making Bobbi swear at Johnny. After all of this, Stephanie tells the officers about the bloody car she saw earlier. The officers leave to investigate. Steven gets to work changing the tire, and Bobbi gets out to talk with Stephanie's family, who all feel violated by the officers. Simultaneously, after passing a white van, Bennett and Conrad find the car Stephanie described further down the road, with evidence of an altercation, and race back towards the van. The van plows into the back of Johnny's car, killing him and Steven. A dead man is at the wheel, and a live person, covered in a black bag, is sitting in the passenger seat of the van, whom Bobbi tries to save. Bennett and Conrad arrive back at the scene. In the chaos, Conrad is killed and persons emerge from the van wearing rubber masks, kill Stephanie's mother and brother, and knock Bennett unconscious. Stephanie and Bobbi take refuge in the police car. Presently, Hallaway and Anderson are trying to figure things out when bodies are discovered in a motel nearby. Anderson takes Wright and Degrasso to the scene, leaving Hallaway with Bobbi, Billings, Bennet, and Stephanie, who whispers something in Hallaway's ear after Anderson leaves. Hallaway talks with the three others, while Degrasso discovers nude pictures of Anderson and Hallaway. Leafing through them in Anderson's backseat, Degrasso is shocked to see the agents with the body of a dead woman. Before he can react, Anderson shoots both Degrasso and Wright dead, then dumps both bodies by the roadside. Hallaway, meanwhile, reveals that he was at the bloodbath earlier, and reveals he and Anderson are in fact the killers. Hallaway kills Billings, and when Anderson returns Bennett and Bobbi are also murdered. A phone message left at the police station reveals the bodies at the motel are those of the missing woman and two real FBI Agents. As Anderson and Hallaway drive away they see Stephanie standing out in a field by the side of the road. Hallaway relates to Anderson that the little girl was on to them all along so he let her go free. Anderson tells Hallaway, \\"I think that's the most romantic thing in the whole world.\\" Stephanie watches their vehicle disappear into the distance. Cast * Julia Ormond as Elizabeth Anderson * Bill Pullman as Sam Hallaway * Pell James as Bobbi Prescott * Ryan Simpkins as Stephanie * Michael Ironside as Captain Billings * French Stewart as Officer Jim Conrad * Kent Harper as Officer Jack Bennett * Mac Miller as Johnny * Hugh Dillon as Dad * Cheri Oteri as Mom * Gill Gayle as Officer Degrasso Production Different film stocks were processed in different ways to provide the varying states of minds and perspectives that belong to the various characters in the film: the two local police officers' POV is sepia toned, to reflect their power, while over-saturation was employed for the illicit drug-using couple, and a \\"super sharp and super clear\\" depiction for the young girl. Reception=Critical response Overall, reviews of the film were mixed. The aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 55% approval rating with an average score of 5.19/10, based on 76 reviews. The website's consensus reads, \\"This dark psycho-thriller from Jennifer Lynch, is violent, sharp and baffling, but not to everyone's taste.\\" On Metacritic the film achieved a score of 31 out of 100 based on 12 reviews, which indicates \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". Accolades In October 2008, the film took the top prize at the Festival de Cine de Sitges. The film made history at the New York City Horror Film Festival when Jennifer Lynch became the first female to win the Best Director award and Ryan Simpkins became the first child to win the Best Actress award at the fest.

They are generally found in small groups that stay near the water surface. To avoid predators, adults may jump out of the water and juveniles mimic leaves. Some species are popular in the fishkeeping hobby and are frequently kept in aquariums.Linke H, Staeck L (1994) American cichlids II: Large Cichlids.

The company was established in 1998 in Winnipeg, Manitoba and based there until 2010. It was named for the prehistoric glacial Lake Agassiz which once covered much of Manitoba. Agassiz beer was available in Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Ontario, and British Columbia.  History  Agassiz Brewing Company was founded by former Fort Garry Brewing Brewmaster Gary De Pape. It was established in Winnipeg in late 1998 and opened on March 17, 1999. Agassiz was one of a trio of microbreweries, the others being Fort Garry and Two Rivers Brewing, that launched in Manitoba in the late 1990s to produce and bottle locally made ales and lagers for the Winnipeg and Manitoba market. Agassiz did very well during its first year, launching its version of a Mild Ale with Catfish Cream Ale as its flagship brand. It also released a Bohemian styled lager with its Premium Pilsner. Later it released Canada's first ever packaged German Hefeweizen with Harvest Haze Hefeweizen. That beer had tremendous and instant success. At the end of its first year, Agassiz launched a Bock Beer, made with orange peel and Manitoba honey in a limited edition six pack that sold out in hours. De Pape was the first Manitoba brewer to enter the American market when he signed a tri-state distribution agreement for North Dakota, South Dakota and parts of Minnesota with the Miller Distributor, Beverage Wholesalers. But after pressure from his shareholders steered the company into a different direction, De Pape left to pursue other interests. As per that US distribution agreement, once De Pape left, Beverage Wholesalers wanted nothing to do with Agassiz and the contract ended. Immediately after, Manitoba and Saskatchewan sales of its beers dropped and Agassiz Brewing had difficulty covering operating costs as it was only selling a small volume, of its 600,000 litre capacity. After considering several options, including approaching rival Fort Garry, it closed its Winnipeg operation on January 31, 2002, sold its assets and went bankrupt to re-emerge as a contract brewer, known as New Manitoba Brewing Ltd. New Manitoba handled marketing, sales, and distribution, leaving brewing and packaging to Northern Breweries of Sudbury, Ontario. New Manitoba then came to terms with Fort Garry on a co-packing arrangement. On October 15, 2004, New Manitoba signed an agreement with its former rival for that company to warehouse, distribute and market Agassiz brands. Fort Garry ended that relationship in January 2010, saying they were too busy with their own brands to have room in their tanks for Agassiz's last brand, Catfish Cream Ale. Joe Constant, a partner in New Manitoba, said he and his partners tried unsuccessfully to get other small breweries to take on brewing Catfish.

It travels from Maryland Route 282 (MD 282) at the Maryland state line east of Warwick, Maryland to DE 9 in Mathews Corners, traveling through Middletown and Odessa. The route intersects the U.S. Route 301 (US 301) toll road west of Middletown, DE 15 and DE 71 in Middletown, the DE 1 toll road east of Middletown, and US 13 in Odessa. The highway travels through a mix of suburban development and some farmland. DE 299 was originally designated as DE 4 in 1938, traveling as far east as US 13 in Odessa. By 1957, DE 4 became DE 299 to match MD 299 (now MD 282) and was extended east to DE 9 in 1959. Over the years, several different highways had followed the DE 299 alignment including DE 71 west of Middletown between 1959 and 1987, US 301N between Middletown and Odessa from 1959 to 1971, and US 301 west of Middletown between 1959 and 2019. In 2008, a widening of DE 299 in the western part of Middletown began; it was completed in November 2010. A portion of the route west of Middletown was realigned in 2017 as a result of the construction of the US 301 toll road. Route description DE 299 westbound past the DE 1 interchange in MiddletownDE 299 heads east from the Maryland border on two-lane undivided Warwick Road, passing through farmland. At the state line, the road continues west into Maryland as MD 282. Shortly after the state line, the route curves north, with US 301 toll road parallel to the east. The road turns southeast and widens to a four-lane divided highway as it comes to a diamond interchange with US 301 before reaching an intersection with DE 15\\\\. At this point, DE 15 and DE 299 become concurrent and head northeast on four-lane divided Middletown Warwick Road. From here, the roadway enters the commercial western part of the town of Middletown. At an intersection, the two routes split, with DE 15 heading northwest on Bunker Hill Road, DE 299 turning east onto West Main Street, and Middletown Warwick Road continuing north. The route narrows to a two-lane undivided road and heading east across the Delmarva Central Railroad's Delmarva Subdivision line at-grade into the downtown area of Middletown. In the center of town, DE 299 intersects DE 71 (Broad Street). DE 299 eastbound past the DE 1 interchange near Odessa After running through the downtown area, the route becomes East Main Street and heads east through suburban commercial development in the eastern part of Middletown, passing to the north of Middletown High School and becoming Middletown Odessa Road. The roadway heads south of the Christiana Care Middletown Free-standing Emergency Department before it becomes a divided highway, passing south of a park and ride lot and intersecting the DE 1 toll road at a diamond interchange. Following this interchange, DE 299 becomes undivided again and heads east through a mix of farms and homes into the town of Odessa, where it is called Main Street and curves southeast. In Odessa, the route is lined with homes and intersects US 13, which is split onto 5th Street northbound and 6th Street southbound. Following this intersection, the road runs through the Odessa Historic District. Past Odessa, DE 299 crosses the Appoquinimink River and heads to the southeast on Old State Road into housing developments. The route curves south before makes a turn southeast onto Taylors Bridge Road and ends a short distance later at DE 9 in Mathews Corners. Portions of DE 299 are designated as part of the Delaware Byways system. The section between Silver Lake Road in Middletown and DE 9 is part of the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad Byway while the section between US 13 in Odessa and DE 9 is a spur of the Delaware's Bayshore Byway. DE 299 has an annual average daily traffic count ranging from a high of 18,470 vehicles along Main Street in Middletown to a low of 727 vehicles at the eastern terminus at DE 9. The portion of DE 299 concurrent with DE 15 is part of the National Highway System. History By 1920, what is now DE 299 existed as an unimproved county road. This county road was paved by 1924. The present-day alignment of DE 299 became a state highway by 1935. The current DE 299 was originally designated as DE 4 in 1938, running between the Maryland border and US 13 in Odessa. By 1957, DE 4 was renumbered to DE 299 to match MD 299 (now MD 282) across the border and DE 71 was designated concurrent with most of the route west of Middletown.

The US 301N designation was removed between Middletown and Odessa in 1971. DE 71 was rerouted off US 301/DE 299 by 1987. By 1994, DE 15 was designated to follow a portion of US 301/DE 299 west of Middletown. In July 2008, a widening project began on US 301/DE 299 between United Drive and the east end of the concurrency. This widening to four lanes was completed in November 2010. On July 15, 2017, DE 299 was realigned near the Maryland border as a result of construction of the US 301 toll road. The concurrency with US 301 west of Middletown was removed when the US 301 toll road opened on January 10, 2019. There are plans to reconstruct and widen DE 299 between Catherine Street and DE 1 in Middletown, with the section between Catherine Street and Cleaver Farm Road to be widened into a three-lane road with a center left-turn lane and the section between Cleaver Farm Road and DE 1 to be widened into a four-lane divided highway. Construction on the widening project is expected to begin in mid-2021 and be completed in later part of 2022.

History View of the station, circa 1900-1909 Biggar received its first railway service in 1907 when the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) built a branch line through the area. The Grand Trunk Pacific Railway (GTP) transcontinental railway project was built through Biggar the following year in 1908 and the GTP designated the town as a division point on the main line between the railway's eastern terminus at Winnipeg, Manitoba and the railway's western terminus at Prince Rupert, British Columbia. The town was named in honour of William Hodgins Biggar, who was the railway company's General Counsel. The station building was constructed by the GTP in 1909 and opened in 1910. It was one of the largest GTP stations in western Canada and featured a 24-hour-per-day restaurant for passengers and railway employees. In 1920, the bankrupt GTP system was nationalized by the Government of Canada and it was merged into the Canadian National Railways (CNR), a federal Crown corporation. Under CNR, later shortened to CN or CN Rail, the Biggar Railway Station saw continued use as a station stop for that company's premier transcontinental passenger train, the Super Continental. In 1978, CN transferred its passenger railway service to Via Rail, a new federal Crown corporation dedicated exclusively to operating Canada's passenger trains. In 1981, Via Rail budget cuts saw the Super Continental discontinued, thus Biggar lost its passenger service, however this returned in 1985 when the Via Rail budget cuts to the Super Continental were reversed. In 1990, further budget cuts to Via Rail saw the Super Continental cut once again, however the Canadian which had run on the Canadian Pacific Railway in southern Saskatchewan from Winnipeg via Regina to Calgary, Alberta and on to Vancouver, British Columbia, was shifted to the more northerly CN line running through Biggar. In 1976, the station was designated a National Historic Site of Canada as a recognition of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway's role in the development of Western Canada and the distinctive contribution its stations made to Canada's architectural heritage. On 19 February 1996, Sheila Copps, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Canadian Heritage further designated the Biggar Railway Station as a Heritage Railway Station, which resulted in legislative protection to prevent demolition or alteration. The citation reads as follows: The building was built of wood in a bungalow style, typical of small town railway stations built by the Grand Trunk Pacific during that period. Current use The Biggar Railway Station is a station stop used by Via Rail's Canadian transcontinental passenger train service. Trains stop 2 days/week in each direction. Biggar is the first stop for the westbound Canadian after departing Saskatoon 1 hour earlier to the east. Edmonton is approximately 5 hours by train to the west. Biggar was a division point for Canadian National Railway (CN) in its freight service, which closed in April, 2014. Although the actual station is too run-down to enter, 2 smaller heated waiting sheds are also there for passenger use. However, it has now been slated for demolition (originally on July 25, 2014, then July 31, and now by the end of October). In 2018 the federal government granted approval for demolition. The station was demolished in July, 2018.

The route runs from DE 52 near Greenville to the Pennsylvania border near Yorklyn, where the road continues into that state as Pennsylvania Route 82 (PA 82). The route runs through areas of woods and fields in northern New Castle County, with much of the route paralleling the Red Clay Creek. The entire route is a part of the Red Clay Scenic Byway, created in 2005. DE 82 was first numbered by 1952 on its current alignment. In 2010, the Delaware Department of Transportation (DelDOT) proposed eliminating the route number, but the plan fell through due to public opposition. Route description DE 82 northbound past its southern terminus at DE 52 near Greenville DE 82 heads to the west of DE 52 near Greenville as two-lane undivided Campbell Road. East of DE 52, the road continues to DE 100 as Kirk Road. The road passes through wooded areas with some fields and homes before crossing over the Hoopes Reservoir. A short distance after the reservoir, DE 82 reaches an intersection with Owls Nest Road and Walnut Green Road, where it makes a left turn onto New London Road to head to the south. The route passes through woodland, curving to the west as it follows a winding alignment. The route intersects Pyles Ford Road and turns southwest onto that road, curving to the west. DE 82 splits from Pyles Ford Road by turning northwest onto Creek Road. The road reaches an intersection with Mt. Cuba Road in the community of Mount Cuba. Here, the route continues northwest along Creek Road and parallels the Red Clay Creek and the Wilmington and Western Railroad, which are both to the west of the road. The roadway continues on a winding alignment, crossing Burrows Run, and passes over the creek twice before crossing the railroad at-grade two times. Along this stretch, the road passes through the community of Ashland, where Barley Mill Road heads south and crosses the Red Clay Creek on the Ashland Covered Bridge to provide access to the Ashland Nature Center. DE 82 at Snuff Mill Road in Yorklyn The route reaches the community of Yorklyn, where it turns southwest briefly. In Yorklyn, the Wilmington and Western Railroad splits from following the road and the creek by heading to the southwest. After making a turn to the northwest at the Yorklyn Road intersection to continue on Creek Road, DE 82 heads alongside the Red Clay Creek through Auburn Valley State Park, curving to the north. A short distance past Yorklyn, the route reaches the Pennsylvania border, where the road becomes PA 82 and continues toward the borough of Kennett Square. The entire length of DE 82 is a part of the Red Clay Scenic Byway, a designation given to several roads in the Red Clay Creek valley. The Red Clay Scenic Byway is a part of the Delaware Byways system. DE 82 has an annual average daily traffic count ranging from a high of 2,724 vehicles at the southern terminus at DE 52 to a low of 256 vehicles at Mt. Cuba Road. None of DE 82 is part of the National Highway System. History When Delaware started numbering state highways in the 1930s, what is now DE 82 was originally an unnumbered road. By 1952, DE 82 was created on its current alignment to connect PA 82 at the Pennsylvania border to DE 52 near Greenville. DE 82 was incorporated into the Red Clay Scenic Byway, the second scenic byway to be designated in Delaware, in 2005. In 2010, DelDOT considered removing the DE 82 designation in order to preserve the route as a scenic byway. After a public workshop on the proposed designation removal was held, DelDOT decided in April 2010 to keep the DE 82 designation due to strong opposition from area residents on the plan.

It had over 130,000 members and covered 1,600 associations nationwide. It operated 800 psychiatric sheltered workshops throughout Japan, where social stigma largely prevents employers from hiring a person who has been treated for mental illness (Johnson, 2001). Collapse In 1996, Zenkaren constructed the 2 billion yen Heartpia Kitsuregawa in Sakura, Tochigi Prefecture, a hot spring (spa) hotel with a vocational rehabilitation facility. The cost was covered in part by grants, government subsidies and loans. After Zenkaren was found to have misused funds for personnel expenses and debt repayment it declared itself unable to meet its loan obligations, return the misused moneys to the government and the Nippon Foundation (a grantor) and pay penalties; therefore it declared bankruptcy and dissolved itself on April 17, 2007 (Zenkaren files for bankruptcy, 2007).

It was founded in 1919 after World War I, when a group of Irish nurses and midwives had a meeting in Dublin to discuss the issues in promoting an improvement in wages and advocating for a standard to be set for the conduction of their duties in the medical profession. This new organisation focused on increasing awareness towards tackling problems of pay and pension. They encouraged participation in recognising these changes by recruiting new members and establishing a standard for nursing and midwifery practice through educational initiatives. They were originally known as the ‚ÄòIrish Nurses Union‚Äô. In the 1930s, they began to promote their campaigns internationally by becoming affiliated with the International Council of Nurses. To this day they are still active and are based at the Whitworth Building in North Brunswick, Dublin. Establishment of the INMO The \\"Irish Nurses and Midwife Organisation\\" was established in 1919 when a group of twenty nurses and midwives had a meeting in the Dublin Espresso Club to discuss the conditions in the nursing workplace. The decision came from this meeting to establish a trade union in order to improve workplace conditions for employees. This union advanced to become the first trade union for hospital nurses in the world. The union developed in the interest to improve the policies and conditions of work for nurses and midwives, as well as an improvement in pay. Throughout the early years the INMO successfully grew a following and new members joined their programs created to increase numbers. ‚ÄúA provisional committee was established at the INU‚Äôs first meeting in February 1919. Louie Bennett was nominated president and Marie Mortished was nominated secretary‚Äù INMO Midwives The INU developed a scheme where they implemented a minimum wage of 25 shillings per case for midwives and encouraged midwives to not accept any lower than this. Another step taken to improve workplace standards included publishing the names of the local INU members in the press in an attempt to encourage trade unionist to select from these midwives when their wives required one. The Irish Nurses Union had a base which provided a postal address for the public to contact the midwives easier. The union further sought for an increase in midwives‚Äô salaries to seventy five pounds per year and a months‚Äô paid leave. INMO Nurses ‚ÄúThe INU aimed to represent private practice nurses as well as nurses working in poor law hospitals, voluntary working, sanatoria and the jubilee district nursing service‚Äù The INU's aim was to provide fairer working conditions for nurses, including increased salaries and decreased weekly working hours. 1925 The Irish Nurse Union transformed from a trade union to a professional association in 1925. Changes within the structure of the INU began as membership numbers began to fall. Marie Mortished resigned as secretary of the INU in 1921, and Louis Bennet resigned as president in 1925. In an attempt to increase member numbers, the INU started to run courses such as ‚ÄòHousewivery and storekeeping‚Äô. ‚ÄúEducation courses were partly responsible for increasing the organisations membership‚Äù with sixty percent of the new midwives who joined the INO in October 1936 were sourced at a refresher course at Dublin's Coombe Hospital. With new programs resulting in an increase of members, the Irish Nurse Union evolved into the Irish Nurse Organisation. The programs worked, with there being 220 nurses and 324 midwives in 1930 \\\\- an increase from the 437 members in 1929 . By 1936 there were 937 members. The Irish Nurses Organisation began began working on an international level in 1931. They became affiliated with the International Council of Nurses (ICN) which is an affiliation which continues today. 1940 ‚Äì 1949 With the beginning of World War II in 1939, the Irish Nurses and Midwife Organisation faced many challenges. Ireland remained neutral throughout World War II, but experienced shortages in commodities such as tea, flour and fuel. Shortages and tighter restrictions made it hard for nurses to travel to and from work and increased the price of living by 70 percent between 1942 and 1946. St. John's Ambulance nurses (6400072529) The demand for nurses increased in countries participating in the war such as England and Western Europe. ‚ÄúTwenty four nurses were employed by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and a team of nurses joined the Irish Red Cross Hospital in St Lo in Normandy‚Äù. Ireland, as a result of increased need for nurses internationally, experienced a shortage of nurses due to this emigration. The INO registered as a legal company under the Trade Union Act in 1941. After this registration the INO became more persistent in their call for the regulation of salaries. The company introduced university level postgraduate courses which increased the INO's popularity among the Irish Catholic community. Tuberculosis became an imminent problem throughout the 1940s which resulted in a nation-wide campaign for the eradication of tuberculosis. With this campaign came improvements in hospital hygiene conditions. Irish Hospitals Sweepstake - group of nurses 1946 Miss Margret Reidy was appointed nurse supervisor in the department of health in 1948. This was the first appointment of a nurse supervisor in the department of health for the INO. 1950 ‚Äì 1959 Throughout the 1950s the INO split into different sections. They were formed to group nurses and midwives into categories more specific to their disciplines to allow meetings which were of common importance. The Public Health Nurses section formed in 1951. Mrs P McConville was appointed president. Through the remainder of the decade, the ‚ÄòHospital Nurses‚Äô section and the ‚ÄòJubilee Nurses' and Midwives' section were formed. They were designed to allow staff to ‚Äúaddress professional development issues and provide social personal support‚Äù. 1960 ‚Äì 1969 Free trade agreements and foreign investment in Ireland in the 1950s increased the annual growth rates between 1959-1973 , and as a result began a decade of prosperity for the INO. The union saw an increase in nurse and midwife wages by 4 percent per year. Unemployment rates fell and the trade unions rose. The organisation began to develop a staff committee in hospitals to solve internal problems throughout this period. 1970-1979 Membership of the Irish Nurses Organisation at the beginning of 1970 was 5918. A new 40 hour week was in operation as a requirement for nurses and midwives. This applied to Local Authority and voluntary hospitals from 1 April 1971. Kyran Lunch was appointed as a full- time Industrial Relations officer in July 1977 to strengthen negotiation activities for the union. 1980-1989 The number of members of the Irish Nurses Organisation rose steadily through the years. In 1968 membership was 4499. By 1977, membership had risen to 8055. Throughout the 1980s, government cuts to the health budget affected nurses and midwives work significantly. ‚Äúsome nurses feared their institutions were so short staffed that a patient might die yet remain undiscovered for a number of hours‚Äù. The frustration of nurses could be seen in 1989 when 98 percent of nurses voted in favour of a strike. The headquarters were moved to 11 Fitzwilliam Place during this period. ‚ÄúThe Nurses Union of Ireland, the union wholly owned by the Irish Nurses Organisation, was granted full negotiating licence by the High Court‚Äù The Irish Nurses Organisation joined the Nurses Union of Irealnd in an effort to obtain full negotiating licence which was helt by the Nurses Union of Ireland. This was a long-term goal of the INO to affiliate with the ICTU which was a success. The nurses act was published in 1985. 1990-1999 Pay increase at the beginning of the 1990s increased from 2 percent in the 1980s to almost 40 percent in the mid 1990s. The membership of the INO increased from 9000 in the mid 1980s to 23000 in the late 1990s. With the new implementation of new benefits for members including a salary protection scheme, car insurance, a salary protection scheme and indemnity insurance as well as discounted health insurance rates and discounted rail rickets, the membership of the INO began to rise to 23,000 in the late 1990s. PJ Madden became the new general secretary in 1998 and Ita O‚ÄôDwyer,Kay Craughwell and Anne Cody shared the position as presidents of the INO. In 1999, the INO merged with the Nurses Union of Ireland, which became a Trade Union on 1 November 1990. Throughout the 1990s, nurses were required to work 39 hours in the week. INMO in the 21st century The current membership of the Irish Nurses Organisation is 43,000. The Irish Nurses Organisation established an overseas nurses section as a response to growing concerns surrounding the integration and support of international nurses. In 2006, the Irish Nurses Organisation won the Metro Eireann Media and Multicultural Award as a recognition of the INO's success in integrating overseas nurses and midwives into the Irish healthcare setting. In March 2007, the Irish Nurses Organisation published a book of essays entitled ‚ÄòForming EU healthcare Policy: A showcase of Irish involvement' to celebrate the INO‚Äôs achievements of having four representatives holding positions as presidents of European nursing organisations. In 2009, the Irish Nurses Organisation began sponsoring the education of women nurses in Ethiopia. The following year in 2010, the INO members raised money for the victims of earthquake in Haiti ‚Äì 500 of which had been nursing students. Campaigns The Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation has been active in campaigns since its establishment. Its campaigns have surrounded issues from safeguarding working rights of migrants and efforts in eradicating racism. In 2005, the INMO staged a campaign of ‚ÄòEnough is Enough‚Äô to highlight the lack of accident and emergency departments in hospitals. This campaign encouraged the public to post postcards to the Irish Minister of Health to take action. This campaign was a success as in June 2006 ‚ÄòToward 2016‚Äô was established as a national partnership deal which promised a 10-year framework to plan social and infrastructure developments. The INMO became the first organisation to support the ‚Äòturn off the red light‚Äô campaign in 2011. This campaign was ultimately successful, with the purchase of sex becoming outlawed in Ireland under the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act of 2017. The INMO attempted to mobilise public opinion behind its patient advocacy drive, and in conjunction with the Irish Patients Association Cystic fibrosis Ireland and the Irish Medical Organisation, launched a campaign known as the ‚ÄòPatients First‚Äô campaign in 2014. The Irish Nurses and Midwife Organisation campaigned its support of same-sex marriage in Ireland in 2015 which also became a success. In 2016, the INMO campaigned for a human rights approach to the health care system funded by general taxation, which was established by the state in 2016 with the launch of the all- party Slaintecare Report in 2017. On 30 January 2019, the Irish Nurses and Midwife Organisation called a strike as a dispute over pay conditions. The members of the organisation withdrew all non essential services for twenty four hours. The aim of this strike was to ask for a twelve percent increase to pay across the board. This strike was received by the public with general support in their attempt to achieve higher pay and to ensure a safer and more efficient health service.

Swarf or chips can be small particles (such as the gritty swarf from grinding metal or the sawdust from sawing or sanding wood); long, stringy tendrils (such as the springy chips from turning tough metals, or long shavings from whittling); slag-like waste (such as is produced within pipe during pipefitting work); or stone fragments and dust (as in masonry).\\"The universe is finished; the copestone is on, and the chips were carted off a million years ago.\\" ‚ÄîIshmael, in Moby-Dick, by Herman Melville. Some of these terms are mass nouns (such as swarf and sawdust) and some of them are count nouns (such as chips, filings, or shavings). Wood swarf is discussed at sawdust. Metal swarf Metal grinding produces grinding swarf. Chips can be extremely sharp and they can cause serious injuries if not handled correctly. It is not uncommon for chips flying off the cutter to be ejected with great force and to fly several yards. Due to its high surface area, swarf composed of some reactive metals can be highly flammable. Swarf may also spontaneously combust, especially if the swarf is coated with cutting oil. To extinguish swarf fires, a special fire extinguisher is needed, designed for fighting Class D (metal) fires. Some common engineering materials such as beryllium are hazardous when finely divided and appropriate measures should be taken to prevent exposure. For ease of transport and handling, swarf may be compressed into bricks. Metal swarf can usually be recycled.

Geelong 21.14 (140) defeated 18.6 (114) in the grand final, held as a curtain-raiser to the seniors grand final on 26 September. Notable events *In the 1980/81 offseason, the East Perth Football Club from the West Australian Football League made a unilateral bid to join the VFL, potentially as early as 1983. East Perth's vision was for two WAFL clubs to join the league, as part of a transition to a national competition, and to limit the drain of talent from and provide an opportunity to play the highest level of football in Western Australia. The application was rejected. * A protest by Richmond against the eligibility of defender Doug Cox to play for St. Kilda led to the Saints temporarily losing the points for their first two wins after Round 8. They were reinstated after Round 17 due to changes in the relevant rules, but a fine of $5000 remained. *On 27 May, was fined $20,000 for poaching Stephen Allender from . Although Allender lived in South Melbourne's zone and was playing for VFA club Port Melbourne when recruited, he was residentially tied to and would remain as such until November 1983, because he had lived in Carlton's zone until February 1979. Carlton ended up granting him a clearance to South Melbourne, but South Melbourne was deemed to have broken the league's poaching laws by having \\"negotiated with an agent acting for a Carlton player\\". * In Round 11, Kevin Bartlett became the first to play 350 VFL games, after having broken John Rantall's record for most games played during 1980. * Carlton's grand final full-back, Scott Howell, was a member of the only three-generation set of AFL/VFL grand final players. His father Jack E. ‚ÄúChooka‚Äù Howell had played for Carlton in the 1947 Grand Final against Essendon. His grandfather, Jack P. \\"Chooka\\" Howell, had played in the 1918 Grand Final for South Melbourne against Collingwood. * Malcolm Blight (North Melbourne) and Alex Jesaulenko (St Kilda) became the final ever playing coaches in VFL/AFL history. Jesaulenko retired as player after Round 8, becoming the last captain-coach; Blight was sacked as coach after Round 16, making him the last person ever to be a playing coach of a club. (Blight was not captain during his time as playing coach.) Playing coaches have since been prohibited under salary cap regulations instituted in 1987. *The State Government granted the VFL once-off permission to trial two Sunday matches in Victoria during the season; it was the first time the VFL had been granted this permission since the once-off Sunday match in 1970 which coincided with a royal visit. Under the conditions of the trial, alcohol was not allowed to be sold at or brought to the games, and the games could not be televised. The two matches were vs in Round 18, and vs in Round 19. *On 7 August, the VFL's entire senior umpiring panel resigned over a contract dispute, due to the VFL's refusal to commit to negotiating a collective agreement with the Umpires' Association, rather than individual agreements with each umpire. The VFL hastily arranged for Round 19's matches to be umpired by a team of junior umpires, all aged between 18 and 22, from the state's minor leagues; both the junior umpires' association and the VFL umpires' association gave their approval for the juniors to serve as strikebreakers. The dispute was resolved the following week, and the senior umpires returned for Round 20. * In Round 22, South Melbourne played its last senior VFL match at the Lake Oval (also known then as Lakeside Oval). The team relocated to Sydney in 1982 and eventually became known as the Sydney Swans. * On the way to VFL Park for the Preliminary Final, the Geelong team bus failed to pick up Garry Sidebottom. Apparently, due to a breakdown in communications, no Geelong officials had told Sidebottom that he was going to play, so believing that had not been chosen, Sidebottom was not at his usual stop when the bus passed. * The grand final was the last match played with the old MCG scoreboard, which was given to Manuka Oval in 1982 after the MCG installed a new colour video scoreboard. The old scoreboard still resides at Manuka Oval today. References * Stephen Rogers and Ashley Brown (1998). Every Game Ever Played. 6th ed. Victoria: Penguin Books.

Seniorectus was opposed to the policy of Roger II of Sicily, who intended in the late summer of 1136 to establish a garrison in Montecassino under the chamberlain Joscelin and chancellor Guarin, as defense against the invading armies of the Emperor Lothair II and Henry X of Bavaria. On 5 January 1137, Guarin demanded their assistance and when refused besieged the monastery in an attempt to seize its treasure and its walls. The abbot contracted an illness during the siege and died a few months later.He was not forced to resign, as suggested by Howe. While Parlamocchi places the rebellion of Seniorectus and the attempted garrisoning of Montecassino in 1134, this hypothesis is refuted by the presence of Joscelin in the chronicle of Peter the Deacon: Joscelin being appointed chamberlain only in October 1135.

Notable events * South Melbourne, affected by limited finances and loss of its inner-city support base ever since World War II, relocated to Sydney after experimental matches played by the VFL there since 1979. Early in the season, the team was still formally known as South Melbourne, although it marketed itself as 'Sydney Swans' in Sydney; on 2 June, the team formally became known as 'the Swans' for the remainder of the season, before formally becoming the 'Sydney Swans' in 1983.Sydney - Part 2 Full Points Footy * From 4 May, patrons were banned from bringing alcoholic beverages into VFL matches, and were limited to purchasing at most two pre-opened cans at a time from vendors at the ground. * Owing to the extreme drought and consequent firm grounds, the 1982 season remains the highest-scoring on record. Among the records were: ** an average game score of 112 points; the next highest average score in a season was 106 points in 1979 and 1983 ** St Kilda and Footscray became the only teams ever to concede 3,000 points in one season ** 66 scores of 20 goals occurred, a record equalled only in 1991 ** 57 matches where both teams scored more than 100 points - no other season had more than fifty such matches ** Round 10 is the only round in VFL/AFL history in which every team scored 100 or more points. * In Round 16 against North Melbourne, Hawthorn set record scores of 13.3 (81) for the first quarter and 20.7 (127) for the first half. The former record stood until 2011, and the latter stood until 2004. * After a negative response from the players since its introduction in 1980, the VFL abandoned the practice of presenting runners-up medals to the losing team as part of the Grand Final post-match presentation. * In Round 18, Leigh Matthews ran into and broke a behind post at Windy Hill. * Early in the season, the VFL arranged for the Grand Finalists to play a rematch as a demonstration sport at the 1982 Commonwealth Games, held in Brisbane shortly after the season was finished. Carlton and Richmond played the exhibition match at the Gabba on Wednesday, 6 October, and Richmond won the high-scoring match 28.16 (184) to 26.10 (166).

Vahshi was born in the agricultural town of Bafq, southeast of the city of Yazd. Biography=Early life Born in Bafq, Vahshi Bafqi was trained by his eldest brother Moradi in poetry. He also trained at the local literary luminary ≈†araf-al-Din  øAli of BƒÅfq. He moved to Yazd before continuing onto Kashan. Later life In Kashan, Bafqi started working as a schoolteacher when his poetry attracted the attention of the regional governor. He wrote poems honouring Tahmasp I. From Kashan, Bafqi travelled to Arak and Bandar Abbas, before returning to Yazd. Bafqi settled in the small village of Taft where he was the foremost poet at the court of hereditary rulers of the region. Bafqi wrote poems honouring the governors of Kerman and also Ismail II. According to Aw·∏•adi of BalyƒÅn, Bafqi died from alcohol poisoning in 1583 in Yazd.  Works  Vahshi's, Shirin and Farhad, a Persian folklore and romantic story of Sassanid Iran is written in the meter of the Persian poet Nizami's romantic epic Shirin and Farhad. Although the work was left unfinished at the time of Vahshi's death, with the introduction and barely 500 verses of the story completed, it has been recognized as one of the poets most famous masterpieces. Approximately a hundred manuscripts of this famous Persian epic from Vahshi has been catalogued around the world. Two poets from Shiraz, Wesal and Saber, took on the task of completing Vahshi's poem in the 19th century. Awhadi, the literary executor of Vahshi gathered some 9,000 verses of Vahshi's poetry after his death. They include various Persian forms including Ghazal, Qasida and panegyrics to patrons as well praises of the saints of the time.

It held that judicial review of a regulation's validity was inappropriate because the controversy was not ripe for adjudication. Since it was not clear whether or not an inspection would be ordered and the reasons had not been given by the Commissioner to justify his order, no primary conduct was affected and so no irremediable adverse consequences flowed from requiring a later challenge to the regulation by a manufacturer, who refused to allow inspection.  Facts  The Toilet Goods Association was an organization of cosmetic manufacturers accounting for 90% of annual American sales in the field. The Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration promulgated a rule that stated, in part: \\"(a) When it appears to the Commissioner that a person has:\\" \\"(4) Refused to permit duly authorized employees of the Food and Drug Administration free access to all manufacturing facilities, processes, and the formulae involved in the manufacture of the color additives and intermediates from which such color additives are derived; he may immediately suspend certification service to such person and may continue such suspension until adequate corrective action has been taken.\\"28 Fed. Reg. 6445-46; 21 C.F.R. ¬ß 8.28 Decision Justice Harlan wrote, \\"In determining whether a challenge to an administrative regulation is ripe for review a twofold inquiry must be made: first to determine whether the issues tendered are appropriate for judicial resolution, and second to assess the hardship to the parties if judicial relief is denied at that stage.\\" The issues were appropriate for judicial resolution. The regulation states that the commissioner may order an inspection and that a permit may be refused. There was no excessive hardship on the parties. Unlike in other cases, failure to comply with the rule resulted in, at most, a suspension of a certification. Fines, seizures of goods, and criminal liability were not present.

Abbott Laboratories held that drug companies were not prohibited by the ripeness doctrine from challenging a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulation requiring a prescription drug's generic name to appear on all related printed materials. The government argued that the case was not ripe because the regulation had yet to be enforced; however, that argument failed as the Court found the issues to be fit for judicial resolution, and that the drug companies would experience substantial hardship if denied a pre-enforcement challenge to the statute. Prosecution for non- compliance was likely, civil and criminal penalties could be imposed, and the drug companies would suffer reputational damage if required to violate the regulation before challenging it in court.  Facts  The action was brought by individuals and associations accounting for more than 90% of the prescription drugs industry. Specifically, the petitioners challenged the decision by the Commissioner of Food and Drug to promulgate the \\"established name\\" rule pursuant to a statute granted by Congress. After inviting and considering comments submitted by interested parties, the Commissioner established the following rule: > If the label or labeling of a prescription drug bears a proprietary name or > designation for the drug or any ingredient thereof, the established name, if > such there be, corresponding, to such proprietary name or designation, shall > accompany each appearance of such proprietary name or designation.

The case presented the question of the extent to which a decision of an administrative agency, here the Food and Drug Administration, to exercise its discretion not to undertake certain enforcement actions is subject to judicial review under the Administrative Procedure Act.  Background  Respondents had been convicted in Oklahoma and Texas criminal courts and sentenced to death. The procedure to be used was lethal injection. They applied first to the FDA, stating that while the drugs to be involved in the lethal injection had been approved, the manner in which they were going to be used had not, in violation of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act's prohibition against \\"misbranding\\". They also argued that the Act's procedures for \\"new drugs\\" should be applicable, given that these drugs were being utilized for a new and un-tested purpose. More simply, they were arguing that the FDA had not certified that the drugs were \\"safe and effective\\" for human executions, and thus should be barred for being distributed via interstate commerce.  Opinion of the Court  Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of the Court saying, \\"[The Court] granted certiorari to review the implausible result that the FDA is required to exercise its enforcement power to ensure that states only use drugs that are 'safe and effective' for human execution...\\" The Court assessed that the Court of Appeals decision coming before raised three questions: # whether the FDA had jurisdiction to undertake the enforcement actions requested # whether if it did have jurisdiction its refusal to take those actions was subject to judicial review, and # whether if reviewable its refusal was arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion. The Court's opinion skirted the jurisdictional issue, ruling that an agency's decision not to pursue an enforcement action is presumptively unreviewable, as such actions are \\"committed to agency discretion by law\\" under ¬ß 701(a)(2) of the Administrative Procedure Act. The Court however, did not reach this conclusion based on a reading of text, but rather on the notion that such decisions were presumptively unreviewable under the common law, that it was Congress' intention under the APA to codify the common law, and that therefore such a presumption should be sustained under the APA. The Court further supported its holding by pointing to three reasons why reviewing an agency's decision not to act is unsuitable to judicial review. First, agency decisions whether to initiate enforcement actions are usually based on a complicated balancing of multiple factors, such as efficient allocation of limited resources, likelihood of success, and the relationship of the potential action to the overall enforcement strategy of the agency. The courts are ill-suited to perform such an analysis. Secondly, the court noted when an agency chooses not to act, they are not exercising any coercive power over others that might be worthy of heightened judicial protection. Third, the Court found an agency‚Äôs discretion not to seek enforcement as being analogous to exercises of prosecutorial discretion that courts have traditionally been unwilling to review. The Court though emphasized that the presumption of unreviewability is rebuttable where (1) an agency declines to act based \\"solely\\" on its belief that it lacks jurisdiction, or (2) where an agency \\"consciously and expressly\\" adopts a policy that is so extreme that it represents an abdication of its statutory responsibilities. The Court declined to address whether the presumption of unreviewability applies to an agency decision not to issue a rule or initiate a rulemaking.

Robison, a conscientious objector, argued that such unequal benefits violated his 5th Amendment right to Equal Protection and his First Amendment right to free exercise of religion. The court rejected both arguments.  Opinion of the Court  The court reasoned that a rational basis existed to give combat veterans better benefits than those who objected for religious reasons: namely, encouraging people to participate in the armed forces as soldiers. The court reasoned that the increased disruption and longer commitment for soldiers justified disparate allocation of benefits. As to free exercise, the court held that the withholding of benefits had only an incidental burden, if any, on religious exercise, that that burden was not intended, and that it was justified by the substantial government interest in raising an army.

This case represented a challenge to the OSHA practice of regulating carcinogens by setting the exposure limit \\"at the lowest technologically feasible level that will not impair the viability of the industries regulated.\\" OSHA selected that standard because it believed that (1) it could not determine a safe exposure level and that (2) the authorizing statute did not require it to quantify such a level. A plurality on the Court, led by Justice Stevens, wrote that the authorizing statute did indeed require OSHA to demonstrate a significant risk of harm (albeit not with mathematical certainty) in order to justify setting a particular exposure level. Perhaps more importantly, the Court noted in dicta that if the government's interpretation of the authorizing statute had been correct, it might violate the Nondelegation doctrine. This line of reasoning may represent the \\"high- water mark\\" of recent attempts to revive the doctrine.  Background  The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 delegated broad authority to the Secretary of Labor to promulgate standards to ensure safe and healthful working conditions for the Nation's workers (the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) being the agency responsible for carrying out this authority). According to Section 3(8), standards created by the secretary must be ‚Äúreasonably necessary or appropriate to provide safe or healthful employment and places of employment.‚Äù Section 6(b)(5) of the statute sets the principle for creating the safety regulations, directing the Secretary to ‚Äúset the standard which most adequately assures, to the extent feasible, on the basis of the best available evidence, that no employee will suffer material impairment of health or functional capacity‚Ä¶‚Äù. At issue in the case, is the Secretary's interpretation of \\"extent feasible\\" to mean that if a material is unsafe he must ‚Äúset an exposure limit at the lowest technologically feasible level that will not impair the viability of the industries regulated.‚Äù  Opinion of the Court  The Court held the Secretary applied the act inappropriately. To comply with the statute, the secretary must determine 1) that a health risk of a substance exists at a particular threshold and 2) Decide whether to issue the most protective standard, or issue a standard that weighs the costs and benefits. Here, the secretary failed to first determine that a health risk of substance existed for the chemical benzene when workers were exposed at 1 part per million. Data only suggested the chemical was unsafe at 10 parts per million. Thus, the secretary had failed the first step of interpreting the statute, that is, finding that the substance posed a risk at that level. In its reasoning, the Court noted it would be unreasonable to assume that congress intended to give the Secretary ‚Äúunprecedented power over American industry.‚Äù Such a delegation of power would likely be unconstitutional. The Court also cited the legislative history of the act, which suggested that Congress meant to address major workplace hazards, not hazards with low statistical likelihoods.  Concurring opinion  In a famous concurrence, Justice Rehnquist argued that the section 6(b)(5) of the statute, which set forth the \\"extent feasible\\" principle, should be struck down on the basis of the non-delegation doctrine. The non-delegation doctrine, which has been recognized by the Supreme Court since the era of Chief Justice Marshall, holds that Congress cannot delegate law-making authority to other branches of government. Rehnquist offered three rationales for the application of the non-delegation doctrine. First, ensure Congress makes social policy, not agencies; delegation should only be used when the policy is highly technical or the ground too large to be covered. Second, agencies of the delegated authority require an ‚Äúintelligible principle‚Äù to exercise discretion which was lacking in this case. Third, the intelligible principle must provide judges with a measuring stick for judicial review.  Subsequent developments  Most scholars have said that the interpretation of statute ignored a foundational principle of statutory interpretation. Generally, specific language governs general language. In this case, the court read the more general provision of Section 3(8) as governing the specific process specified in Section 6(b)(5). The case also marks the current state of affairs for the non-delegation doctrine. When the court is faced with a provision that appears to be an impermissible delegation of the authority, it will use tools of statutory interpretation to try to narrow the delegation of power.

Robbins, 519 U.S. 452 (1997), is a United States Supreme Court case that concerns the standard that the Court should apply when it reviews an executive department's interpretation of regulations established under federal legislation. The specific issue was whether sergeants and lieutenants in the St. Louis Police Department should be paid for working overtime. The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 established the overtime pay requirement, and the US Department of Labor issued regulations to determine if an employee was covered by the overtime requirement. The Court held that it should defer to the Secretary of Labor's interpretation of the regulations.  Background  A statute under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 exempted \\"bona fide executive, administrative, or professional\\" employees from overtime pay requirements. In determining whether an employee was exempt, the US Department of Labor and the Secretary of Labor applied a \\"salary-basis\\" test in 1940 that was not applicable to state and local employees. In 1974, Congress extended the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to cover all public-sector employees. For an employee to be exempt under the salary-basis test, the employee must earn a specified minimum amount on a salary basis. Employees would be considered to be paid on a salary basis if they routinely received a weekly predetermined payment that was not subject to reduction because of any variations in the \\"quality or quantity of the work performed.\\" Petitioners were sergeants and a lieutenant employed by the St. Louis Police Department in Missouri. They sued the respondents, members of the St. Louis Board of Police Commissioners, and sought overtime pay that they believed was owed to them under the FLSA. Petitioners argued that they did not meet the requirements of the Secretary's salary-basis test since the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department Manual stated that their salary could be reduced for a variety of disciplinary infractions, including the quality or the quantity of work performed. Petitioners also argued their duties were not of an executive, administrative, or professional nature, as required under the salary-basis test. The District Court found for the respondents, ruling that petitioners were paid on a salary basis. On appeal, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed in part and reversed in part. While petitioners had argued that the police department manual made it a possibility for employees to be deducted pay for disciplinary infractions, all employees are subject to such deductions that are nonexempt under the FLSA. Specifically, the petitioners highlighted the fact that one sergeant was actually subjected to a disciplinary deduction. The Court of Appeals rejected the petitioners' argument. The Court held that a \\"one-time incident\\" in which disciplinary deductions were executed against one sergeant was a unique circumstance that did not defeat the salaried status of an employee. The Court held that both the salary-basis test and the duties test were satisfied to all petitioners. The Supreme Court granted certiorari.  Issue  *Did the Fair Labor Standards Act's rule regarding overtime pay for private-sector employees apply equally to public-sector employees? *If the first question was answered in the affirmative, did the Secretary of Labor reasonably interpret the salary-basis test to deny public-sector employees salaried status and thus grant them overtime pay when their compensation might, \\"as a practical matter,\\" be adjusted in ways that were ostensibly inconsistent with the letter of the test? Given that the police manual provided for disciplinary deductions in pay for the police officers, which is generally sufficient to preclude exempt status under the FLSA, the question was whether the possible but unlikely disciplinary deductions in pay, as provided for by the police manual, were enough to render the petitioners' pay \\"subject to\\" disciplinary deductions specifically within the meaning of the salary-basis test.  Decision  The Supreme Court agreed with the Court of Appeals in holding that both the salary-basis test and the duties test were satisfied as to all petitioners. The Supreme Court dismissed the petitioners' argument that the regulations concerning \\"disciplinary actions\\" should not apply to public sector employees and instead deferred to the Secretary of Labor's regulations by citing Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. (1984) because it was \\"based on a permissible construction of the statute.\\" The Court denied the petitioners argument that public sector employee pay is distinguished from private sector employee pay because in the public sector enforcing compliance with work rules is a necessary component of effective government, thus reinforcing the 1974 extension of the FLSA to cover virtually all public sector employees. While Chevron refers to the interpretation of an agency's enabling statute, the Court here gave deference to the agency in interpreting its own rules and regulatory schemes and reasoned that \\"because the salary-basis test is a creature of the Secretary's own regulations, his interpretation of it is, under our jurisprudence, controlling unless, 'plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.'\\" Further, the fact that the Secretary's interpretation came in the form of a legal brief did not make it unworthy of deference since the Secretary's position was \\"in no way a post hoc rationalization...to defend past agency action against attack.\\". Under the Secretary's view, it is not enough that the police policy manual includes some specified penalties that involve disciplinary deductions in pay because the manual lists 58 possible rule violations and a range of penalties, which does not effectively communicate that pay deductions are or should be an anticipated form of punishment. Therefore, the Court stated that \\"no clear inference can be drawn as to the likelihood of a sanction being applied to employees such as petitioners.\\" Additionally, the Supreme Court states that even if the petitioners had been correct in their arguments, they did not follow the proper procedures. Under the APA, they should have gone through the regulatory appeals process, instead of directly appealing to the courts.Nicholas R. Bednar, Defying Auer Deference, 100 Minn. L. Rev. (2015), http://www.minnesotalawreview.org/2015/06/defying-auer-deference-skidmore- solution-conservative-concerns-perez-v-mortgage-bankers-association/ Legacy Auer deference gives agencies a highest level of deference in interpreting their own regulations. However, deference is warranted only if the language of the regulation is ambiguous unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation. The case expands Chevron deference by giving the agency the highest deference. In Chevron, there was a two-step standard of review. The Chevron standard dealt with \\"a formal rationale for judicial deference to an agency's interpretation of a statute.\\" Auer did not adopt the two-step process for review in Chevron but a single level standard of deference \\"to an agency's permissible interpretation of its regulation.\\" Auer deals with the agency's interpretation of its own regulation, as opposed to the agency's interpretation of the statute, as in Chevron. In Auer, the claim was not that the regulation was substantively unlawful or even that it violated a clear procedural prerequisite. It was that it was arbitrary and capricious not to conduct amendatory rulemaking, which might have resulted in no change. There was no basis for the court to set aside the agency's action, prior to any application for relief addressed to the agency itself. The proper procedure for pursuit of respondent's grievance was set forth explicitly in the APA: a petition to the agency for rulemaking. The question of whether to overturn Auer was the focus of the 2019 Supreme Court case, Kisor v. Wilkie.https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/kisor-v- wilkie/https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/15-861_2c8f.pdf The Court's decision did not overturn Auer but set forth a set of conditions where courts should use the Auer deference, limiting the extent of its use.

The case concerned the meaning of the term \\"employees\\" in the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA). Background Hearst Publications (Hearst), the publishers of four daily Los Angeles newspapers, refused to bargain collectively with their newsboys. The newsboys filed petitions with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) for certification as a local union. The NLRB found that the newsboys were full- time employees within the meaning of the NLRA and ordered Hearst bargain with the newsboys. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit refused to enforce the order, reasoning that the newsboys were independent contractors, rather than employees.NLRB v. Hearst Publications, 322 U.S. 111, 113-15 (1944) Decision of the Court Justice Rutledge, delivering the opinion of the court, ruled that the NLRB's interpretation of the Act was not erroneous. The court held that when an administrative agency engages in \\"specific application of a broad statutory term in a proceeding in which the agency administering the statute must determine it initially, the reviewing court's function is limited.\\"Id. at 131. The newsboys were employees within the meaning of the Act, with whom Hearst was required to collectively bargain. Dissent Justice Roberts, dissenting, wrote that \\"the question of who is an employee, so as to make the statute applicable to him, is a question of the meaning of the Act and, therefore, is a judicial and not an administrative question.\\"Id. at 136. National Labor Relations Board v Hearst Publications, Inc is a US labor law case, concerning the scope of protection for employees under the National Labor Relations Act 1935. Facts Newsboys, who distributed papers on the streets of the city of Los Angeles, formed a union to collectively bargain over wages. They claimed they were 'employees' under the National Labor Relations Act 1935. They alleged their employers were Hearst Publications Inc, which owned the Los Angeles Examiner and the Los Angeles Evening Herald and Express, as well as the Los Angeles Times. The National Labor Relations Board determined that the newsboys were employees, as they worked continuously, regularly and relied on their earnings to support themselves and their families. The publishers dictated the buying and selling prices, fixed their markets, controlled their supply of papers, supervised their work hours and effort, and gave them sales equipment for the publishers' benefit. The NLRB then designated the full-time newsboys and 'checkmen' to be a bargaining unit within the city, excluding temporary, casual and part-time newsboys and bootjackers. The newspapers argued that under common law standards, their control over the newsboys made them no more than independent contractors, so that they were not 'employees' and had no duty to bargain in good faith under the National Labor Relations Act 1935. Judgment The Supreme Court held that the Act's history, context and purposes should be taken into account when determining whether someone is an employee, not just common law standards, local law or legal classifications made for other purposes. The NLRB's determination that someone is an employee may not be set aside if it has a reasonable legal basis. Its identification of bargaining units was within its discretion, including its exclusion of suburban newsboys on the ground that they were not in the union. Rutledge J gave the court's judgment.322 US 120-134 Reed J concurred, and said the NLRB had the definition of 'employee' correct. Roberts J dissented, stating his view that the newsboys were not employees.

Background Mead Corporation challenged a ruling of the US Customs Service that classified its day planners as \\"diaries, notebooks and address books, bound,\\" which were subject to a tariff. Issue Before Mead, it was clear that the Chevron doctrine applied to interpretations adopted in legislative rules and certain formal adjudications, but lower courts differed on whether it also applied to interpretative rules, policy statements, informal adjudications, advisory letters, and amicus briefs. In 2001, the Supreme Court finally began to shed some light on the issue. In Mead, the issue was whether the court should defer to the US Customs Services' interpretation of the Customs Act, as manifested by the many classification decisions its regional offices made annually. The Court granted certiorari to determine the limits of Chevron deference. Decision Justice Souter wrote that \\"administrative implementation of a particular statutory provision qualifies for Chevron deference when it appears that Congress delegated authority to the agency generally to make rules carrying the force of law, and that the agency interpretation claiming deference was promulgated in the exercise of that authority.\\". Recognizing that thousands of tariff decisions are issued each year by the 46 regional offices of the U.S. Customs Service, and that each decision has no precedential value, the Court determined that the Chevron Doctrine should not apply.

D.J. Farraday (Robert Glen Keith) discovers that his father, Del (Stockwell), has been having an affair.

When the two arrive at the summer house, they find Del's younger son, Campbell \\"Cam\\" Farraday (Behr), already there. Eventually it is revealed that Del had found Cam and his boyfriend, Billy, embracing there at the cabin. Del brutally beat Billy, and father and son have not spoken since. While D.J. is trying to convince Cam to stay and attempt a reconciliation, Cam reveals to him that Billy is dead, and the clear implication is that Cam blames his father for the loss. A short while later, the two escaped convicts show up at the cabin and ask to use the phone, claiming that their car has broken down. Red, who is introduced as Frank's adult son, makes a point of taking up the hospitality offered, using that excuse to remain in the house (over Frank's objection).

Evelyn was raised in the Church of the Nazarene and felt a strong desire to be a missionary from an early age. She received her Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Illinois and her medical degree from the University of Michigan. She was appointed as a medical missionary to India in 1941 but was taken by the Japanese and interned at the Santo Tomas Internment Camp in the Philippines for three years. After her release, she returned to the United States until 1947, when she was reappointed to India and began her assignment at the Reynolds Memorial Hospital in Basim. In the later years of her missionary deployment, she also engaged in medical field work by taking charge of a mobile clinic unit that carried medical supplies and instruments to more remote areas. There she would address the medical needs of the people who could not easily travel to the hospital. Dr. Witthoff's missionary assignment ended in 1973, and she joined the faculty of Olivet Nazarene College, where she taught in the nursing program until her retirement in 1977.

Henan province is the origin of Yu opera. Henan's one-character abbreviation is \\"\\" (y√π), and thus the opera style was officially named \\"\\" (Y√πj√π) after the founding of the People's Republic of China. The area where Yu opera is most commonly performed is in the region surrounding the Yellow River and Huai River. According to statistical figures, Yu opera was the leading opera genre in terms of the number of performers and troupes. Outside Henan, provinces such as Hubei, Anhui, Jiangsu, Shandong, Hebei, Beijing, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Xinjiang, all have professional Yu opera troupes. There is also a troupe in Kaohsiung, Taiwan. The history of Henan opera dated back to more than 200 years ago. The opera was widely spread in Henan province in the late Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) and faced new development opportunities after the founding of PRC in 1949. The opera spread across China and was ahead of the other 300 local operas in China before the mid-1980s. History Yu opera into being during the late Ming and early Qing dynasties. At the beginning, it was mainly song arias without make-up, which was loved by the ordinary people. As a result, it developed rapidly. The origin of Yu opera was hard to trace, and the sayings about its origin were different. With regard to the origin and formation of Henan opera, there was a shortage of records in ancient books and few scholars wanted to engage in in- depth and comprehensive exploration and research. Since the 1920s and 1930s there have been multiple theories and viewpoints on the origin of opera. There is no one theory that is generally agreed upon by researchers as there is not enough evidence to convince all people, so there are multiple similar and completely opposite arguments. Four major representative opinions concerning the origin of the opera are presented following, they are originating from Shanxi opera, originating from the folk society of Henan, originating from the operatic tune which is popular in Central Plains area of China, and originating from the predecessor of Henan Bangzi. Tune types There are four major types of Yu opera. Xiangfu tune opera is heard around Kaifeng; Yudong tune in the Shangqiu area. Yuxi tune is heard around Luoyang, and the Shahe tune around Luohe. Yudong and Yuxi are the main forms, with Yudong expressing comedy and Yuxi expressing tragedy. In the late Qing Dynasty(1644-1911), Henan Bangzi have been greatly expanded in Henan. Due to different living habits, language characteristics, natural environment, cultural psychology, and aesthetic tastes, Henan Bangzi has changed from the repertoire to operatic tune in different regions of Henan. Therefore, four main tune types of Henan opera formed. The four types are centered on different regions in Henan province. Famous people The most famous Henan opera actors and actresses are Chang Xiangyu, Chen Suzhen, Cui Lantian, Ma JinFeng. Besides the four actresses mentioned, there are also some well-known actors such as Zhao Yiting, Tang Xicheng, Li Sizhong. Zhao Yiting (1995-1992), a member of the Chinese Theatre Association and director of the Henan Theatre Association. His artistic career spans more than 60 years and has made outstanding contributions to the theatrical career. He is an important figure in the history of Henan opera. Tang Xicheng (1924-1993), a member of the Chinese Theatre Association, director of the Henan Theatre Association. The achievements of his artistic achievements contributed to the highest peak of the male character in Henan opera and Mr. Tang is a master of Henan opera. Li Sizhong (1921-1996), a famous master of the Henan opera, the representative of the Heilian performer (\\"male character with darkish painted face\\") of Henan Opera. Status quo and suggested solutions As an important local opera genre among the numerous non-material cultural heritage related Chinese operas, however, Henan opera are facing a hard situation on the protection and development. As many other local operas, the future of Henan Opera is worrying due to the influence of commodity economy and the impact of modern lifestyles. The number of plays and urban audience has reduced, and the rural audience is dominated by the elderly. As for suggestions to improve the hard situation, Henan opera can establish a mutual benefit with tourism resource to appeal more audience. At the same time, the exploration and research of Henan opera materials can be enriched, the investment in the development of Henan opera can be increased, and the productization of Henan Opera tourism meets the need of the times. There are some specific strategies such as strengthening the tourism propaganda of Henan opera, building the characteristic brand of Henan opera culture, developing the Henan opera tourism experience project, holding the Henan opera festival, Cultivating the new force of Henan opera tourism, and exploring various development model of Henan opera tourism.

In 1978, Shelly began preaching as Senior Minister for the Family of God at Woodmont Hills, formerly known as the Woodmont Hills Church of Christ, in Nashville, Tennessee where he continued until 2005. While preaching at Woodmont Hills, he also taught at Lipscomb University, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, and Tennessee State University. From 1979 to 1980 while he worked to complete his graduate work at Vanderbilt University, he served as a graduate assistant in the Department of Philosophy. From 1981 to 1983, he was an Assistant Professor of Philosophy at Lipscomb University. In 1986, while continuing his education at Vanderbilt University, he taught as an Adjunct Assistant Professor in the Department of Medicine (Medical Ethics) until 1988. From 2000 to 2004, he was an Adjunct Assistant Professor of Philosophy at Tennessee State University. When he stepped down from the pulpit in 2005, he began teaching again as a Professor of Philosophy and Religion at Rochester College, in Rochester Hills, Michigan. He was named the President of Rochester College in May 2009. He also currently serves as a co-minister for the Bristol Road Church of Christ in Flint, Michigan.Rochester president resigns; Rubel Shelly to lead during interim In late 2012, Shelly announced that he would be stepping from his role as President at Rochester College by September 2013. He is known primarily as a preacher. Shelly has been involved in debates and academic lectures on Christian apologetics, ethics, and medical ethics. Shelly has also served with such groups as the AIDS Education Committee of the American Red Cross. Changes in theological emphasis Shelly's theological stance on several important issues abruptly shifted around 1986 from traditional Church of Christ theology. He began to voice a radical plea for Ecumenism, as indicated by his book, I Just Want to Be a Christian. Shelly had started out as a boy preacher in the Churches of Christ, writing several books containing what some have called \\"sound teaching\\", yet eventually Shelly became disenchanted with what he has called a \\"language of exclusion.\\"Mark A. Matson, interviewer, \\"Two Ministers, One Mission (an interview with Rubel Shelly and John York)\\", Christian Standard, 6/26/2005 (accessed December 20, 2013) \\"Out of my own spiritual evolution, I've tried to adopt a much more Christ-like spirit and not be so sectarian and isolationist\\", Shelly said.Edwards, Holly (1 Feb 2005). \\"Rubel Shelly Leaving Church to Teach in Michigan College\\". The Tennesseen. Retrieved November 19, 2007. Now, he pursues a unifying vision \\"more nearly the ideal of the early American Restoration Movement concept and experience than what [he] was born into.\\" He critiques his former colleagues for trying to \\"decide who's in and who's out based on some list. We're very anticreedal in churches of Christ and Christian churches, meaning we won‚Äôt publish that list; we are more insidious in that we have unpublished lists of what lets you be \\"in\\" or \\"out\\" of our local churches. That's simply wrongheaded.\\" Though these calls for unity do, in fact, echo Alexander Campbell and Barton W. Stone, in other ways Shelly has disengaged from the central tenet of the Restoration Movement: that the modern Church must restore the first century Church. In The Second Incarnation, Shelly and Randy Harris claim that this move is anachronistic and leads to doctrinal error, because no church has ever achieved perfection, and in any case, one cannot and should not attempt to recreate the first century Church.Hughes, Richard T. Reviving the Ancient Faith: The Story of Churches of Christ in America. Abilene, Texas: Abilene Christian University Press, 1996. Shelly has also co-edited and co-founded two important journals, Spiritual Sword in 1969 with Dr. Thomas B. Warren and Wineskins (more recently) with Mike Cope. Leadership status Rubel Shelly was inducted in 2007 into the Restoration Forum's Honor Roll of Unity, an award \\"given to people who are recognized for their love for those in the Christian fellowship and for their noble efforts to heal the divisions of the past and build unity.\\"Rubel Shelly Inducted into Restoration Honor Roll, Rochester College, October 8, 2007 (accessed January 16, 2009) Because Churches of Christ are strongly congregational, there are only a few ways to rise to prominence: publications, lectureships, holding the pulpit of a large congregation, and by outside recognition. Rubel Shelly has written many influential books, cited by others in the Restoration Movement, and he routinely appears at lectureships sponsored by Universities and colleges affiliated with the Church of Christ. Shelly has also been the preacher at one of the larger, more affluent churches for many years (Woodmont Hills Church in Nashville, Tennessee). One measure of Shelly's national reputation is the fact that local and national journalists call on him as an expert about Church of Christ matters. An infamous example of this was when Nancy Grace of CNN asked Shelly on national television whether or not the Church of Christ is a cult. Many felt that Shelly did not have a chance to express himself fully ( ).

ASIST completed sea trials by July 31, 1992, and production units are in operation with the Chilean Navy, Republic of Singapore Navy, Turkish Navy and United States Navy. Mode of Operation The ASIST system employs a sophisticated electro-optic tracking system which detects a laser beacon- equipped helicopter. The system tracks the helicopter and provide real time helicopter position simultaneously via visual cues to the pilot. A computer- controlled rapid securing device will also be driven by the position data to track the helicopter at low hover. Once the system has detected that the helicopter has landed on the deck, the securing device automatically approaches the helicopter and secures it. The securing device and traversing system are then used to align the helicopter with the deck tracks and manoeuvre it into a hangar, all without the need for manned intervention. All ASIST electrical and mechanical systems are modular and are housed in the hangar or below deck level to minimize space and weight requirements.

The species is named for Nikolai Przhevalsky, the Russian explorer who described it. Its taxonomic affinities were unclear for a long time, giving rise to other common names, the pink-tailed bunting and the Przewalski's rosefinch. In 2000 it was proposed that it should in fact be regarded neither as a finch nor a bunting, but as the only member of the family Urocynchramidae, something that had been originally proposed in the German ornithological literature as long ago as 1918 by Janusz von Domaniewski, and also by Wolters in 1979. This change was adopted in the sixth edition of the Clements checklist. Description and ecology Przewalski's finch is a small bird similar in appearance to the long-tailed rosefinch. The tail is long and - quite unlike in typical finches - graduated, with the outer feathers much shorter than the central ones. The sexes are sexually dimorphic, with the males having bright pink on the throat, breast and belly. Both sexes have brown streaked plumage on the back and wings. The bill is thinner than those of the rosefinches. The morphological feature which is diagnostic for the Urocynchramidae is the outer primary; in finches and buntings this feather is vestigial but in the Przewalski's finch it is two-thirds the length of the next primary. This bird lives at elevations between , usually in pairs during the breeding season and in small flocks during the winter. Przhevalsky described the species' song as similar to that of buntings. The species has not been studied much in the wild, and little is known of its behaviour. It is not thought to be threatened by human activities and is listed as least concern on the IUCN Red List.

The Loan Council now operates under the Financial Agreement between the Commonwealth, States and Territories of 25 February 1994, which is incorporated as a schedule to the Financial Agreement Act 1994, which came into effect on 1 July 1995. The 1994 arrangements made significant changes to the previous arrangements, the main changes being: * the Commonwealth and the states each nominate a 'Loan Council Allocation' (LCA), which does not need to be approved by the Loan Council, * the Commonwealth no longer borrows on a state's behalf, * the states can now enter into whatever financial arrangements they choose and can issue securities in their own names, and * the Australian Capital Territory and Northern Territory became full-voting members of the Loan Council (they previously had observer status).

The Commonwealth has a dominant position over the council, having two votes and also a casting vote. Under this arrangement, the votes of six states/territories are required to outvote a Commonwealth proposition. In the interest of transparency, each jurisdiction is required to publish its Loan Council Allocation estimates, under the 'Uniform Presentation Framework'. The method of public release is the responsibility of each jurisdiction. 50px This article incorporates text from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 licence. History The Loan Council was established by the Premiers' Conference of May 1923 as a voluntary organisation of Commonwealth and state governments, to co-ordinate Commonwealth and state debt raisings and to avoid each competing against the others for capital funds, three-quarters of which came from overseas (mainly Britain).Josie Castle \\"The 1920s\\" in R. Willis, et al (eds.) (1982), p. 253 The arrangements were formalised in 1927 when the Commonwealth and states signed a Financial Agreement. The 1927 Financial Agreement discontinued the per-capita payments system that had existed since 1910, and restricted the borrowing rights of the states by subjecting such borrowing to control by a Loan Council. It also provided for Commonwealth assistance in state debt reduction. Henceforth all governmental borrowing, except for purposes of defence or for 'temporary' purposes, was to be under Loan Council control. The agreement was ratified by all jurisdictionse.g., Commonwealth and States Financial Agreement Ratification Act of 1927 (Qld) and was incorporated into the Financial Agreement Act 1928. Due to doubts concerning the constitutionality of this new body, it was agreed that its legality would be put beyond doubt by a constitutional amendment. The 1928 referendum for the purpose was carried by a large majority of voters in all six states to insert a new provision, Section 105A, into the Finance and Trade Chapter of the Australian Constitution. A test of the Financial Agreement soon came when the Great Depression hit Australia and the Commonwealth and state governments sought to devise a strategy to deal with it. In August 1930, Prime Minister Scullin invited Sir Otto Niemeyer of the Bank of England to advise the premiers. He recommended a traditional deflationary response of balanced budgets to combat Australia's high levels of debt and insisted that interest on loans be met. All state governments other than NSW and the federal government agreed to the strategy, which was called the \\"Melbourne Agreement\\". Early in 1931, Jack Lang, Premier of New South Wales, released \\"the Lang Plan\\" to combat the Depression as an alternative to the Melbourne Agreement. Key points of the Lang Plan included the reduction of interest owed by Australian governments on debts within Australia to 3%, and the cancellation of interest payments to overseas bondholders and financiers on government borrowings, besides other strategies. As the Commonwealth Government became responsible under the Financial Agreement for state debts, the new UAP government of Joseph Lyons was obligated to pay the interest to the overseas bondholders, and then extract the money from the states. The Commonwealth Government rejected the Lang Plan and Lang refused to pay to the Commonwealth interest and principal that was payable to overseas bondholders, setting the stage for the Lang Dismissal Crisis. To enforce New South Wale's obligations under the agreement, the Commonwealth passed the Financial Agreement Enforcement Act 1932 to withhold moneys payable to the state and to seize state assets, which the High Court held to be valid. The 1928 Financial Agreement only authorised borrowings by governments and did not encompass borrowing by Commonwealth and state semi-governmental and local authorities. In 1936, these arrangements were voluntarily brought under Loan Council control, under a 'gentlemen's agreement', to prevent state governments circumventing the council's borrowing limits. This agreement remained in effect until 1984‚Äì85 when 'global borrowing limits' were introduced.

Character The character of Blind Oichi is a blind swordswoman created by Teruo Tanashita in a manga published by Shukan Manga Times, in what is believed to be a response to the hugely successful Zatoichi series. The main difference, apart from being a female, was that her weakness is a stereotyped female tendency to be emotional. The character was played by Y≈çko Matsuyama, future wife of the original manga author Teruo Tanashita, who had starred as swordswomen in a number of popular TV series including Kotohime Shichi Henge (The Seven Faces of Princess Koto) from 1960 to 1962, Tsukihime Toge (Princess Tsuki Pass) in 1963, and Tabigarasu Kurenai Osen (Crimson Osen The Wanderer) from 1968‚Äì1969. The origin of the international English title \\"Crimson Bat\\" is unclear. Some have suggested that it was due to her wearing a crimson red kimono and being \\"blind as a bat\\", as the saying goes. Others have claimed the title came from a much earlier non-related film entitled (1958) which featured Y≈çko Matsuyama in a supporting role. Another (perhaps more likely) reason was that Matsuyama had just finished playing a sword-wielding character named \\"Crimson Osen\\" in the aforementioned 52 episode TV series Tabigarasu Kurenai Osen. The character appeared in 4 films released by Shochiku studios, before moving on to television just as the Zatoichi series did.

During his long career his work included bringing the ship that carried the Statue of Liberty safely into port after its trip from Europe, and was called upon as an expert seaman to determine the height of the water span of the Brooklyn Bridge, a new bridge from Brooklyn to New York City. On his death he was called \\"was one of the oldest and best known of the Sandy Hook [pilots]\\". Early life Henderson was born in Charleston, South Carolina. According to the 1880 Federal Census, Henderson's father and mother were born in South Carolina. At sixteen years of age, Henderson left Charleston to find passage to New York as a cabin boy on a ship traveling there. By 1845, he must have been well established as a New York pilot. The New York Herald notes: \\"Some men on South street remember him in 1845 as a pilot of some standing even then.\\" Henderson married Angelina Annetta Weaver on February 11, 1849, at the Tabernacle Baptist Church Sandy Hook pilot Henderson was a Sandy Hook pilot in New York Harbor and along the Atlantic Coast during the American Civil War. In 1846, when Henderson was twenty years old, he took out his pilot papers with the Board of Commissioners of Pilots of the State of New York. He became adept in all branches of piloting. Henderson was listed in the 1848 Doggett's New York City directory as a seaman at 325 Front Street, New York City. He owned several pilot ships in the Sandy Hook service. By the age of twenty-one, he was captain of his own schooner, self- educated in seamanship, and a New York Sandy Hook pilot. He spent over 45 years as a New York pilot and was in more boat accidents than any other pilots. On September 13, 1853, Henderson became a Branch Pilot on the pilot boat Ellwood Walter, No. 7, belonging to the New York Pilots' Association. The pilot boat was named after Ellwood Walter, the president of the Mercantile Insurance Company, and was built by Edward T. Williams, of Greenpoint, Brooklyn. On December 17, 1856, Henderson was listed as being one of the captains for the pilot boat No. 11, George W. Blunt. On January 21, 1857, Henderson was listed as being on the Blunt, anchored at Coney Island, but hemmed in by the ice. Civil War Arago (1855) During the Civil War, Henderson was a pilot on the transports Arago and Fulton, running from Newport News, Virginia to Port Royal, South Carolina. The author Charles Edward Russell wrote about Henderson and the Sandy Hook men during the Civil War. Russell said: \\"In 1862 he [Joseph Henderson] was snapped up by the Federal Government to do pilot work on the southern sounds, with which, it is said, he had some youthful acquaintance. His work for the Government was so valuable, ingenious, and efficient that he received not only thanks but unusual reward in bankable funds.\\" Among the valuable services performed by the Sandy Hook men in that contest was the guiding of naval vessels through the intricate channels of southern waters, conspicuously Albemarle, North Carolina and Pamlico Sound. Henderson was one-quarter owner of the William Bell, a pilot boat built in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, New York, in 1864 and co-owned with other Sandy Hook pilots. On August 11, 1864, the William Bell ventured too far out to sea and was captured and burned by the Confederate raiding steamer the . Henderson was at sea on another vessel at the time of the capture, acting as pilot for the Government. In 1883, Henderson and the other owners successfully petitioned the United States, via the Alabama Claims award, for compensation of their loss. Post-Civil War=Steamship Tybee In December 1869, Henderson offered his services to pilot the steam vessel Tybee out of the port of New York, leaving for San Domingo, Dominican Republic; but the shipmaster refused to employ him. The Tybee proceeded to sea without having any pilot of the port on board. In the trial, \\"Henderson v. Spofford,\\" a judgment was made in the district court of New York City in favor of Joseph Henderson (plaintiff) for thirty-eight dollars and eighteen cents plus the costs for pilotage fees out of the Port of New York. Brooklyn Bridge In 1879, during the construction of the east river bridge, Captain Henderson was called upon as an expert seaman to determine the height of the water span of the Brooklyn Bridge, a new bridge from Brooklyn to New York City. He testified to the Assembly Sub-Committee on Commerce and Navigation, as to the difficulties masters of ships would experience in bringing their ships under the bridge when completed. Another witness, Edward W. Serrell, who was a civil engineer, said that he had examined the plan and sections of the bridge and that the calculations of the assumed strength of the bridge were not accurate; and the effect of gales or wind would have upon the structure and upon foot passengers. There was a fear of cars being overthrown and woman being raised by the wind and cast over the railing. Statue of Liberty Hendersons appearance with the Is√®re was reported in several New York newspapers. On June 16, 1885, at ten o'clock Tuesday night, the Pilot Boat Pet, No. 9 was sighted by the French steamer Is√®re, laden with the Statue of Liberty. She was about ten miles outside the Sandy Hook lightship. Captain Joseph Henderson set sail to her and when near enough launched a dingy and pulled alongside the Is√®re. He was taken on board and they then headed for the Sandy Hook Lightship. Henderson judged that the night was too dark with rain falling for safe crossing of the bar. He took charge of the ship, brought the ship to an anchor, and stood offshore waiting for daylight. On June 17, 1885, the Is√®re arrived at the Horseshoe of Sandy Hook and it was moved to Gravesend Bay alongside the man-of-war USS Omaha. On Friday, at 1 o'clock, the Is√®re reached Bedloe's Island. The ferryboat Atlantic left the ferry house at the foot of Wall Street and then passed Governors Island. Then the Atlantic came next to the Is√®re. The first man from the Atlantic was Pilot Henderson. Blizzard of 1888 In 1888, Henderson was on board the pilot boat America, No. 21 during the Great Blizzard of 1888, when the vessel rode out the storm off the Shinnecock Light.The New York Herald On November 9, 1888, a newspaper account titled: \\"Overdue Vessels Come In. Rough Weather Reported by all. Few, Of Them Seriously Damaged\\", which talks about not hearing from the pilot-boat Pet. no. 9. She had left port twelve days ago, and when last heard from was 300 miles east of Sandy Hook. She had a crew of six men and Joseph Henderson was in charge.New York Herald-Tribune (New York, NY) Page 3. Pilot Boat Pet New York Sandy Hook Pilot Boat \\"Pet, No. 9\\" On October 28, 1872, Henderson, Captain of the New York pilot boat \\"Pet, No. 9\\", sighted the brig Emily during a heavy gale. The crew of the Emily came on board the pilot boat Pet, which lay by the brig until 7 p.m., at witch time the Emily capsized. It was not until the next day that the crew members were transferred from the Pet to the steamship Italy, from Liverpool, and brought to the New York port. On November 5, 1872, Henderson spoke at a meeting of the Board of Commissioners of Pilots in their office, No. 75 South Street, in the City of New York, about how he and his pilot boat Pet, No. 9, rescued the crew of the brig Emily.Nov 5, 1872; ProQuest Historical Newspapers The New York Times, pg. 2. The Board of Pilot Commissioners acknowledged Henderson's effort with a resolution, which granted that a reward for such acts of personal risk be paid to the pilots for a sum of $250. On February 3, 1877, an article from the Spirit of the Times newspaper wrote about Henderson and the pilot-boat Pet. \\"This week, in connection with a picture of the pilot-boat Pet, Captain Joseph Henderson, we give a brief sketch, the object of which is to explain how the business of these craft is conducted in the port of New York.\\" On September 22, 1880, the pilot boat Pet, No. 9, ran across the schooner Gladiator, which sailed from Barbados for Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, that was overturned bottom up. The crew lowered a boat, which went alongside the vessel. They cut a hole in her side to sink her but discovered a terrible stench that was coming from below. A man was discovered with a rope around his neck hanging from the bowsprit. The crew of the vessel were laying dead in her cabin. On November 20, 1889, Henderson was commander of the pilot boat Pet, No. 9, which was lost in the Newport, Rhode Island harbor. Pilot boat Pet, No. 9, of New York went ashore this morning on the east side of Conanicut Island, halfway between Beaver Tail and Mackerel Cove, Rhode Island. The wind died out and they let go her anchor, but it would not hold, and the heavy sea drove the boat on the rocks. The seas broke over her and she filled and sank. The agile Henderson and other pilots escaped with their lives. She was later reported as having gone to pieces and left abandoned; she was partly insured. Teutonic and City of New York On August 13, 1890, Henderson took the White Star Line passenger steamer RMS Teutonic to sea on her first westward race across the Atlantic with the steamship SS City of New York. The race ended in victory for the Teutonic. The race from Queenstown harbor, Ireland to Sandy Hook, took five days and nineteen hours.The New York Evening Post On August 21, 1890, the big steamship liner Teutonic and liner City of New York raced from the New York pier to the Sandy Hook bar out to the bay. Hundreds of people were present to observe the famous liners as they departed. The pilot on the Teutonic was Captain Joseph Henderson, the pilot on the City of New York was Peter McEnneny. After seeing the vessels safely outside the bay, the pilots were taken off by Pilot boat Lillie, No. 8. Pilot Henderson said the Teutonic crossed the bar at 9:42 AM. Pilot Peter McEnenerny said the City of New York crossed at 10:20 AM. The Teutonic went at the rate of 17 knots an hour. It was expected that the vessels would be in sight of each other for 2‚Äì3 days. The best eastern record was held by the New York's twin sister, the City of Paris, which made the passage in 1889 in less than 6 days. USS Baltimore On August 23, 1890, Henderson guided the cruiser USS Baltimore out to sea when she carried inventor Captain John Ericsson remains to their final resting place in Stockholm, Sweden. Death Joseph Henderson tombstone at Greenwood Cemetery, Brooklyn, New York.

Some other provinces, such as Hubei, Anhui, Henan, Shanxi, also have Huaguxi. It is known in China for its earthy quality, and is often referred to as the \\"spicy\\" form of Chinese opera. Most Huaguxi plays were originally ', short plays lasting an hour or less. These plays often dealt with everyday rural life. With the rise of professional Huaguxi performers and performances in the capital city of Changsha, longer plays, ', began to be performed. These plays dealt with grander themes of social satire and class struggle. Like other forms of Chinese opera, Huaguxi is staged with very few props. Music accompanying Huaguxi reflects the Changsha dialect spoken in Hunan. It is played with instruments like the datong (fiddle), yueqin (moon lute), dizi (bamboo flute), and suona (oboe). Percussion instruments provide the basic tempo for the performance.  Origin  Originating from songs, Huaguxi can be referred to as early as the reign of Emperor Jiaqing (1760 ‚Äì 1820) of the Qing dynasty. At that time, the amateur Huaguxi players were mostly farmers. They dressed up in colorful clothes with their faces painted, singing and dancing along the street to celebrate the Spring Festival (Chinese New Year) and Spring Lantern Festival. These singer-dancers were popular among the people in the countryside, leading to the development of Huaguxi as a theatrical form. The integrated story with songs and dance began during the early 19th century. At that time, there were only two roles: chou, a male clown, and dan, a young girl, both played by a man. Female players were not allowed until the early 20th century. In the 1860s, more roles, including dan, chou, and sheng‚Äîa handsome young man‚Äîwere playing and the performance had developed a lot. The early Huaguxi lasted only 45 minutes to an hour, and the contents of the performances were mostly related to the rural life of the peasants. Some common scenes were paddling, carrying and loading soybeans. These plays were designed to express people's hopes and wishes for love, life, and harvest. In the late 19th and 20th centuries, some Huaguxi performance groups began to move to Changsha, the capital of Hunan. Huaguxi then lasted for two to three hours. Stories also went beyond activities of daily life. Social satire, religious belief, and immoral behaviors began to be shown on the stage. More roles were included in the plays.  Reformation  In 1952, ‚ÄòThe Three Reformations‚Äô on the mandatory formation of xiqu was issued. After describing the evolution of Huaguxi as ‚Äòrelatively realistically reflect[ing] the working people‚Äôs wish for [a] free life‚Äô, it criticizes the form severely: ‚ÄòAfter huaguxi entered the international concessions, it gradually became contaminated by the semi-feudal and semi-colonial dust and dirt. In addition, the Manchu ruling class subsequently employed some feudal literati to inject feudal toxin into huaguxi. As a result, huaguxi started to be infused with certain semi-feudal and semi-colonial content during this period. This is huju‚Äôs main source of subsequent dross‚Äô.Shanghaishi wenhuaju, ‚ÄúWei tongzhi xuanpai daibiao canjia guanmotuan fujing guanmo diyijie quanguo xiqu huiyan you‚Äù (To notify the selection of representatives to participate in the observation delegation to Beijing to observe the First National Traditional Theatre Festival), City of Shanghai Archives, B172‚Äì1‚Äì70 (1952), ‚ÄúHuju jieshao‚Äù (Introduction to Shanghai opera) According to the regulation, Huaguxi players were required to change the content of the plays‚Äîto abolish the ‚Äòugly, vulgar‚Äô acting style. Some traditional Huaguxi plays were deleted due to their violation of the regulation. In 1949, there were more than 18 private Huaguxi performance groups in Changsha. In 1952, all performance groups were reorganized. The official Hunan Huaguxi Company was established in Changsha. For the first time Huaguxi had official recognition, funding, and support. In 1957, the Hunan Arts School was established with a department of Huaguxi, which pushed Huaguxi to regulated art forms further. After the extensive reformation of the traditional Huaguxi, the demand for new plays especially reflecting the new lives of Chinese people became the dominant aim of the artists. According to the Communist Party policy, 'Art must serve [the] people. Art must serve Socialism.' More and more plays written in praise of workers, farmers, and soldiers were created, such as ‚ÄòDa Tong Luo‚Äô (Beating the Gong) by Li Tong Ren, and ‚ÄòBu Guo‚Äô (Fixing the Pan) by Tan Zhou and Xu Shuhua.  Contemporary Development  In 1981, there were 54 official Huaguxi performance groups in Hunan. In 2008, Huaguxi became an Intangible Cultural Heritage of China. Nowadays, however, people's passion for xiqu has been declining. With rapid economic development, people are more used to Internet entertainments, which have a huge impact on traditional Huaguxi. Fewer artists are creating new Huaguxi plays and the number of Huaguxi performers are dramatically decreasing. How to preserve this traditional art form remains a problem for both the Chinese government and Chinese people.  Some Famous Plays  Some famous Huaguxi plays are ‚ÄòLiu Hai Kan Qiao‚Äô, ‚ÄòDa Tong Luo‚Äô, and ‚ÄòBu Guo‚Äô. These plays have some straightforward and educating themes. ‚ÄòLiu Hai Kan Qiao‚Äô describes the love story of a diligent worker, expressing people's hopes for work and love. ‚ÄòDa Tong luo‚Äô tells people selfishness is bad; to damage others in order to benefit oneself is immoral; to help others is to help yourself. ‚ÄòBu Guo‚Äô tells people all jobs are created equally and there shouldn't be any discrimination. ‚ÄòThe Revolutionary job is a whole Just as a big machine You're raising pigs, need me to fix the pan To fix the pan requires iron Iron workers are powerful Yet they need to eat and wear clothes Eating depends on farmers Wearing depends on weaving cotton workers Seventy- two professions are equally important Complement each other, can't be separated.‚Äô \\\\--- Bu Guo References Category:Chinese opera Category:Culture in Hunan ","title":"Flower-drum opera"},{"id":"10824912","text":"Human Rights Defenders and Promoters was formed in 2002 in Burma to raise awareness among the people of Burma about their human rights and help them conduct advocacy. According to Human Rights Defenders and Promoters (HRDP), on April 18, 2007, several of its members (U Myint Aye, Maung Maung Lay, Tin Maung Oo and Yin Kyi) were attacked by approximately a hundred people under the direction of U Nyunt Oo - Secretary of the Union Solidarity and Development Association (USDA). Myint Hlaing and Maung Maung Lay were badly injured and are now hospitalized. The HRDP believes that this attack was condoned by the authorities and vows to take legal action. The Burmese military government stated its intention to crack down on these human rights activists, according to an April 23, 2007, report in the country's official press. The announcement, that comprised a full page of the official newspaper, followed calls by human rights advocacy groups, including London-based Amnesty International, for Burmese authorities to investigate recent violent attacks on rights activists in the country. Two members of Human Rights Defenders and Promoters, Maung Maung Lay, 37, and Myint Naing, 40, were hospitalized with head injuries following attacks by more than 50 people while the two were working in Hinthada township, Irrawaddy Division in mid-April. On Sunday, April 22, 2007, eight people were arrested by plainclothes police, members of the pro-junta Union Solidarity and Development Association, and the Pyithu Swan Arr Shin (a paramilitary group) while demonstrating peacefully in a Rangoon suburb. The eight protesters were calling for lower commodity prices, better health-care and improved utility services. Htin Kyaw, 44, one of the eight who also took part in an earlier demonstration in late February in downtown Rangoon, was beaten by a mob, according to sources at the scene of the protest. Reports from Burmese opposition activists have emerged in recent weeks saying that Burmese authorities have directed the police and other government proxy groups to deal harshly with any sign of unrest in Rangoon. \\"This proves that there is no rule of law [in Burma],\\" the 88 Generation Students group said in a statement issued on April 23, 2007. \\"We seriously urge the authorities to prevent violence in the future and to guarantee the safety of every citizen.\\" Group co-founder Myint Aye, imprisoned on a life sentence in 2008, was selected by Amnesty International in 2012 as their case to promote at the annual Edinburgh Festival.

Ilkal sari takes its name from the town of Ilkal in the Bagalkot district of Karnataka state, India. Ilkal saris are woven using cotton warp on the body and art silk warp for border and art silk warp for pallu portion of the sari. In some cases instead of art silk, pure silk is also used. Ilkal sari has been accorded geographical indication (GI) tag. Its GI tag number is 76.List of Geographical Indications in India History Ilkal was an ancient weaving centre where the weaving seems to have started in the 8th century AD.Brief history of Ilkal saris is provided by The growth of these saris is attributed to the patronage provided by the local chieftains in and around the town of Bellary. The availability of local raw materials helped in the growth of this sari. About 20000 people in the town of Ilkal are engaged in sari-weaving.The history of Indian saris is discussed by Uniqueness * The uniqueness of sari is joining of the body warp with pallu warp with a series of loops locally called as TOPE TENI technique. * The weaver will gait only 6 yards, 8 yards, 9 yards warp due to above TOPE TENI technique. KONDI Technique is used for weft through inserting 3 shuttles (‡∞≤‡∞æ‡∞≥‡∞ø). * Pallau portion-Design: \\"TOPE TENI SERAGU\\" Normally in tope teni seragu 3 solid portions would be in red colour, and in between 2 portions in white colour. * Tope Teni seragu has been regarded as a state symbol and was greatly respected during festival occasions. * Traditional Borders: (i) Chikki, (ii) Gomi, (iii) Jari and (iv) Gadidadi, and modern Gayathri are unique ones in Ilkal saris - width ranging from 2.5\\" to 4\\" * Border Colour Uniqueness: Red usually or Maroon dominates. Description The peculiar characteristic of the sari is joining the body warp with the pallu warp which is locally called as TOPE TENI. This technique is used exclusively at Ilkal. If anyone requires Ilkal sari one must prepare a warp for every sari. Warp threads for body are prepared separately. Similarly pallu warp is prepared separately either with art silk or pure silk depending upon the quality required. Thirdly border portion of warp is prepared, like the pallu warp, either art silk or pure silk and the colour used for pallu and on border will be one and the same. In general, the length of the pallu will range 16\\" to 27\\". The pallu threads and body threads are joined in loop technique, a unique method locally called TOPE TENI. Features The distinctive feature of Ilkal saris is the use of a form of embroidery called Kasuti. The designs used in Kasuti reflect traditional patterns like palanquins, elephants and lotuses which are embroidered onto Ilkal saris. These saris are usually 9 yards in length and the pallu of the Ilkal sari (the part worn over the shoulder) carries designs of temple towers. This pallu is usually made of red silk with white patterns. The end region of the pallu is made up of patterns of different shapes like hanige (comb), koti kammli (fort ramparts), toputenne (jowar) and rampa (mountain range). The border of the sari is very broad (4 to 6 inches) and red or maroon in colour and is made of different designs with ochre patterns. The sari is either made of cotton, or a mixture of cotton and silk or in pure silk. The colors traditionally used are pomegranate red, brilliant peacock green and parrot green. The saris that are made for bridal wear are made of a particular colour called Giri Kumukum which is associated with the sindhoor worn by the wives of the priests in this region. Types of Borders The design woven in the length wise borders are mainly three types: * Gomi (more popularly known as Ilkal dadi) * Paraspet (Sub-divided into chikki paras and dodd paras) * Gaadi * Jari Main Body design *Stripes *Rectangles *Squares Other Differences With above broad parameters the Ilkal saris differ in matters of size, nature and quality of yarn used for different portion of sari as also colour combination and combinations of designs on the borders and main body of the sari. The beauty of Tope-teni seragu is further enhanced at times by weaving in its middle portion, yet another design known as ‚ÄòKyadgi‚Äô. Production Weaving of Ilkal saris is mostly an indoor activity. It is essentially a household enterprise involving active participation of female members. To weave one sari with the help of the handloom, it takes about 7 days. We can weave it with the help of the powerloom also. Methods of Production Ilkal traditional saris are produced mainly on pit looms with the combination of three types of different yarns namely Silk x Silk, Silk x Cotton, Art silk x Cotton. Along with the above said yarn combination totally four different traditional designs are produced - they are Chikki Paras, Gomi, Jari and recently modified traditional design Gayathri. These saris are produced in different lengths 6.00 yards, 8.00 yards, and 9.00 yards with solid as well as contrast borders. The main distinction in these saris is its attached temple type Pallav (locally called as TOPE TENI) by inter locking body warp and pallav warp using loop system and inserting weft by three shuttles using two different colours yarn by Kondi technique. A weaver requires apart from himself two others for preparatory work.

He won the WBA Junior Welterweight championship of the world in 1992, and competed at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Games.Olympic results He is one of the few Japanese champions that lacked financial backing from large gyms or television companies, and he had to personally negotiate with opponents to land a shot at the world title. Amateur career Hiranaka won an amateur boxing tournament in high school, training at the local Ryukyu boxing gym. He continued boxing at Nippon University, and fought in the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics while attending (he lost in the second round). He had a successful amateur career, making 37 of his 43 wins by knockout. Olympic results Welterweight (‚Äì 67 kg), 1984 *1st round bye *Lost to Genaro Leon (Mexico) 0-5 Professional career Hiranaka's success in the amateur ring made him one of Japan's best prospects in the light welterweight division. He won the Japanese light welterweight title in only his fourth professional fight, knocking out his opponent in the 6th round. Hiranaka became the WBA's top-ranked fighter in the light welterweight division, but lack of financial support made it difficult for him to challenge the world title. He had to defend the Japanese light welterweight title 9 times before finally getting a fight at the world stage. Hiranaka challenged Juan Martin Coggi of Argentina in Italy on April 29, 1989, for the WBA title. Hiranaka knocked Coggi down twice in the third round. However, Hiranaka lost by a decision for the first loss of his career. This match was controversial for the decision with excessive favor to the Italian-Argentine boxer Coggi, while Coggi was knocked down by Hiranaka twice and has been inferior to Hiranaka at performance throughout 12 rounds. Among many boxing fans, there have been the strong voice that the victory should have been given to Hiranaka, since the match was owned by him. Even after losing, Hiranaka retained his world ranking, and waited for another chance for the world title. However, Hiranaka spent three years without a title match, and did not fight at all in 1990. Hiranaka finally got his second chance in April 1992, fighting in Mexico City against Puerto Rican world champion, Edwin Rosario. Hiranaka surprised onlookers by knocking out the champion only 92 seconds into the first round. He immediately pinned the champion against the ropes, and landed a furious array of punches, until the referee saw that the champion Edwin Rosario had been knocked unconscious while standing up. This fight remains as the shortest world title match in the light welterweight division. Despite making an epic entrance onto the world stage, Hiranaka lost his title after only five months to Morris East from the Philippines. Hiranaka had led the fight going into the 11th round, but was knocked out in an unexpected blow from the challenger. This knockout was named the 1992 Ring Magazine Knockout of the Year. Hiranaka was diagnosed with an intracranial hemorrhage after the fight, and was forced into retirement. His record was 20-2-0 (18KOs). He also has the highest KO percentage of any Japanese boxer (90%). Post retirement He now runs the Hiranaka Boxing School Gym in Okinawa, and has taught boxing at Seido Kaikan. Deceased K-1 champion Andy Hug trained at Hiranaka's gym in Okinawa before the K-1 Grand Prix tournament.

British nuclear tests in Australia  As Minister of Supply, Beale assisted in the facilitation of British nuclear weapons testing in Australia which took place at the Montebello Islands, Emu Field and Maralinga. Of the proposed Maralinga testing program, he told the media in 1955, \\"Every precaution will be taken to ensure there is no danger to human beings or stock\\". This statement later proved to be untrue, with aboriginal people and military servicemen becoming contaminated and fallout from tests being detected as far afield as Adelaide. Fallout from testing at the Montebello Islands in Australia's northwest was detected in Queensland, in Australia's northeast. A Royal Commission into British nuclear tests in Australia took place, following Beale's death, in 1984‚Äì1985.  Nuclear power  Beale said of nuclear power in 1956 that his Government believed that \\"completely effective precautions have already been developed to avoid hazards to the population from the use of nuclear power reactors\\". He endorsed the study of radiation's effect following the Maralinga nuclear weapons tests. Anticipating an expansion in nuclear power generation and other uses of atomic energy, he stated that he believed that it was \\"necessary that we should expand our knowledge of the problems of radiation as fully and as quickly as possible\\".

Minnesota Wing is headquartered in Inver Grove Heights, Minnesota. The Wing is divided into four Groups. Each Group is, in turn, made up of 4 to 7 Squadrons. Minnesota Wing currently has 23 squadrons located throughout the state.  Aerospace Education  MNWG has been recognized nationally by National Headquarters CAP for outstanding performance with the Aerospace Education program. The week-long North Central Region flight academy is held each summer in Mankato, Minnesota. Cadets have the option of attending a course focused on powered flight, or one focused on glider flight. In either school, cadets have the opportunity to log up to 20 hours of flight time, as well as solo should they demonstrate proficiency.  Cadet Programs  Most squadrons in MNWG include cadets (as either a Composite Squadron or a Cadet Squadron). North Hennepin Squadron in Crystal, Minnesota holds the distinction as being the first squadron in the nation to have a cadet program. Currently, there are 662 cadets in the Wing. Minnesota holds an annual Encampment at Camp Ripley. Encampment is a 7- to 10-day cadet training activity that typically consists of between 80-100 students and 40 cadet staff. Encampment is held in mid- to late-Summer and is targeted for new (typically, first-year) cadets in the program, as well as providing opportunities for advanced cadets seeking management training.

Early life and family Kay was born in Chester-le-Street, County Durham, England, on 14 January 1922, the son of a colliery manager. He left school at the age of 14, and accepted an electrical apprenticeship at the local colliery managed by his father, and took night classes in electrical engineering. In 1940, Kay joined the Royal Air Force, training as a pilot, but was later posted as an aircraft engineer because of his engineering background. His role included modifying aircraft, recalibrating their instruments, and test-flying the planes to ensure their airworthiness. In 1944, Kay married Nora Waters, and the couple went on to have three children. Career=England After World War II, Kay earned a Bachelor of Engineering at Durham University, and joined the Admiralty as a civilian scientist based at the Isle of Portland. He was involved in the development of transmitting underwater sonar for the identification of submarines, mines and torpedoes, undertaking research both on land and at sea. He also took part in naval operations, and was in a submarine off Port Said during the Suez Crisis. After discovering that details of the technology that he helped to develop had been passed to the Soviet Union, Kay chose to move to an academic post at the University of Birmingham, where he established the Department of Electrical Engineering. At Birmingham, Kay initially continued researching underwater ultrasonic technology, but was inspired to investigate air sonar to assist blind people to navigate after watching blind children learning to swim. This led to his study of the way that bats navigate, and the development of devices for blind people. Kay was awarded a PhD by Birmingham on the basis of eight papers on echolocation by humans and animals that he either authored or co-authored. New Zealand In 1965, Kay and his family migrated to New Zealand, where he took up a post at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch. He was appointed to a personal chair in 1982. Kay served as a member of the University Grants Committee, head of the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, and dean of the School of Engineering at Canterbury. At Canterbury, Kay continued his work improving devices for the blind, as well as applying ultrasonic technology to applications in medicine, robotics, diving and fishing. He developed an international reputation for his work, particularly for the sonic torch, allowing blind people to avoid obstacles, sonic spectacles, and the Trisensor Aid, allowing blind children to be trained in spatial awareness. Kay became a naturalised New Zealander in 1979. When he retired from the University of Canterbury in 1986, Kay was conferred the title of professor emeritus. He continued his research independently, establishing Bay Advanced Technologies, a research business in Russell, to further refine devices for the blind. In 1999, he received the Saatchi and Saatchi Prize for innovation, recognising his lifetime's contribution to the field. Honours and awards In 1971, Kay was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of New Zealand, the first engineer to be so honoured. He was also awarded fellowships of the New Zealand Institution of Engineers (now Engineering New Zealand), the Institution of Electrical Engineers and the Institution of Electronic and Radio Engineers (both now part of the Institution of Engineering and Technology). In the 1988 New Year Honours, Kay was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire, for services to electrical and electronic engineering. Later life and death Kay's wife, Nora, died in 2004, and he retired from active research in 2006. In retirement, Kay lived with his daughter in Southland, where he died on 2 June 2020.

Life  He was born in Wiltshire, eldest surviving son and heir of Sir Henry Long of Draycot, and his wife Eleanor Wrottesley. Long was Esquire of the Body to Henry VIII. He is recorded as being present at the reception of Anne of Cleves, and together with his father, he served at the Siege of Boulogne. He was given the manor of Calstone near Calne in 1538 in a grant by Henry VIII, and at least part of this land was still controlled by the Long family in 1704, when the rent from one farm called Tossells was used for a Draycot charity. In 1576 he acquired the manor of Sutton Benger, adjacent to Draycot. He was appointed High Sheriff of Wiltshire in 1575, during the reign of Elizabeth I. He married Barbara Carne c. 1546 and they had one daughter and four sons including: *Sir Walter Long (d.1610) *Jewel Long (d.1647), whose godfather was the Bishop of Salisbury, John Jewel *Henry Long, murdered 1594 Sir Robert Long died at Draycot in 1581 and his wife died at Bulford in 1605.  Murder of his son  Sir Robert's son Henry was murdered by Sir Charles Danvers and Sir Henry Danvers, after a long-running feud between the neighbouring Danvers' and the Longs, in particular, Henry and his brother Sir Walter Long. The mutual animosity came to a head in 1594, when their father Sir John Danvers, from the magistrate's bench, committed one of Sir Walter Long's servants for robbery. Sir Walter rescued the servant from the justice, and, after complaining to the judge at the next assizes, Sir John had Sir Walter locked up in the Fleet Prison. He then committed another of Sir Walter's servants on a charge of murder. On leaving prison, Sir Walter and his brother provoked various brawls between their own followers and Sir John's, resulting in one servant being killed and another grievously wounded.  History of the feud  Sir John Danvers was one of the executors of Sir Robert Long's will, indicating that perhaps the feud was started between the sons, and had not been carried over from a previous generation, although in his book William Shakespeare: The Man Behind the Genius, author Anthony Holden contends the feud dated as far back as the Wars of the Roses. Another authorSociety, Politics and Culture: Studies in Early Modern England (Past and Present Publications), Mervyn Evans James 1988 writes that it began as a result of the attempts of Sir Walter Long ‚Äì recently returned from military service in Ireland, strengthened by his marriage to Catherine Thynne of Longleat, and with one of his houses, Draycot, only a few miles from the Danvers seat at Dauncey ‚Äì to challenge the Danvers' predominance. Sir Charles Danvers developed a close friendship with Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, and served under him in Ireland, later taking a prominent part in the revolt there. On the other hand, Sir Walter Long, through his Thynne connection, developed a friendship with Sir Walter Raleigh, who was deeply hostile to Essex.John Aubrey, Letters... by Eminent Persons and Lives of Eminent Men 1813 There was an established conservative group of gentry with whom the Danvers' associated, and who were opposed to the rival Knyvet-Long faction, which was backed by the Thynnes at Longleat.  Unendurable insults  It was the Danvers family itself, and not their followers, that were the target of the Longs, and Henry Long wrote insulting letters to Sir Charles Danvers calling him a liar, a fool, a puppy dog, a mere boy, and promised that he would whip his bare backside with a rod. Sir Charles was very angry. His mother later wrote to Lord Burghley describing the letters as 'of such a form as the heart of a man indeed had rather die than endure'. Accompanied by his brother and some of his men, he went to an inn at Corsham where Sir Walter and Henry Long were dining with a group of magistrates. Sir Henry Danvers drew his pistol, ('a certain engine called a dagge') and shortly after Henry Long was dead. The Danvers brothers got away and took refuge with their friend Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton at his seat, Whitley Lodge near Titchfield, who happened to be in the midst of his twenty-first birthday celebrations.William Shakespeare: The Man Behind the Genius ‚Äì Anthony Holden 2000  Romeo and Juliet?  Southampton was patron of William Shakespeare and some literary critics (e.g. A. L. Rowse,The Times 24 July 1971; pg. 12; Issue 58233 Anthony Burgess, M. C. BradbrookShakespeare: The Poet in His World, M. C. Bradbrook 2005) have conjectured that the feud may have inspired Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, and that Romeo's exile may allude to Southampton's protection of Sir Charles and Sir Henry Danvers, whom he aided in their escape to France. According to historian John Aubrey, immediately after the murder of her son Henry, Lady Barbara Long, by then a widow and possibly a lady at court, informed the Queen of the ' committed by Sir Charles Danvers and Sir Henrie Danvers, Knights', although no indictment was ever preferred against them by either the Long family or the state. Aubrey also wrote that the events relating to the Danvers' escape and concealment hastened the death of the Danvers' father, and their mother soon remarried, to Sir Edmund Carey, a cousin of the Queen, to influence the granting of a pardon for her sons, which later eventuated, and the Danvers' returned to England in August 1598. Sir Henry Danvers later became Earl of Danby, and his brother Sir Charles was beheaded in 1600 for joining in a plot with the Earl of Essex against Queen Elizabeth.

This model was used to validate the card counting methods published by Ed Thorp and Julian Braun in Beat The Dealer. Patterson discussed this model on a panel with Ed Thorp, Julian Braun and other gambling notables at the 1964 Fall Joint Computer Conference. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Patterson developed and published a method for tracking favorable clumps of cards and cutting them into play and tracking unfavorable clumps of cards and cutting them out of play. This is known as \\"shuffle-tracking\\". In 1982, a lawsuit initiated by Ken Uston prohibited the Atlantic City casinos from barring card counters but allowed the casinos to establish new blackjack rules making it much more difficult to attain an advantage in the multi-deck shoe game, except for players willing to play to the long-term. Since most of Patterson's clients and book readers are recreational, short-term players, he published a special report advising them of the potential impact of these new rules on their blackjack play. Patterson also responded to these restrictive new blackjack rules by developing (with Eddie Olsen), a non-counting strategy called TARGET 21. This non-counting blackjack strategy caused the division of blackjack players into two groups which Patterson refers to as traditional players and new era players. TARGET is controversial and considered unscientific by respected blackjack experts.

The comic's tagline describes it as \\"A webcomic of romance, sarcasm, math, and language\\". Munroe states on the comic's website that the name of the comic is not an initialism, but \\"just a word with no phonetic pronunciation\\". The subject matter of the comic varies from statements on life and love to mathematical, programming, and scientific in-jokes. Some strips feature simple humor or pop-culture references. It has a cast of stick figures, and the comic occasionally features landscapes, graphs, charts, and intricate mathematical patterns such as fractals. New cartoons are added three times a week, on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. Munroe has released four spinoff books from the comic. The first book, chronologically, published in 2010 and entitled xkcd: volume 0 was a series of select comics from his website. His 2014 book What If? is based on his blog of the same name that answers unusual science questions from readers in a light-hearted way that is scientifically grounded. The What If column on the site is updated with new articles from time to time. His 2015 book Thing Explainer explains scientific concepts using only the one thousand most commonly used words in English. A fourth book, How To, which is described as \\"a profoundly unhelpful self-help book,\\" was released on September 3, 2019.  History  Randall Munroe, the creator of xkcd As a student, Munroe often drew charts, maps, and \\"stick figure battles\\" in the margins of his school notebooks, besides solving mathematical problems unrelated to his classes. By the time he graduated from college, Munroe's \\"piles of notebooks\\" became too large and he started scanning the images. xkcd began in September 2005, when Munroe decided to scan his doodles and put them on his personal website. According to Munroe, the comic's name has no particular significance and is simply a four-letter word without a phonetic pronunciation, something he describes as \\"a treasured and carefully guarded point in the space of four-character strings.\\" In January 2006, the comic was split off into its own website, created in collaboration with Derek Radtke. In May 2007, the comic garnered widespread attention by depicting online communities in geographic form. Various websites were drawn as continents, each sized according to their relative popularity and located according to their general subject matter. This put xkcd at number two on the Syracuse Post-Standard's \\"The new hotness\\" list. By 2008, xkcd was able to financially support Munroe and Radtke \\"reasonably well\\" through the sale of multiple thousand T-shirts per month. On September 19, 2012, \\"Click and Drag\\" was published, which featured a panel which can be explored via clicking and dragging its insides. It immediately triggered positive response on social websites and forums. The large image nested in the panel measures 165,888 pixels wide by 79,822 pixels high. Munroe later described it as \\"probably the most popular one I ever put on the Internet\\", as well as placing it among his own favorites. \\"Time\\" began publication at midnight EDT on March 25, 2013, with the comic's image updating every 30 minutes until March 30, when they began to change every hour, lasting for over four months. The images constitute time lapse frames of a story, with the tooltip originally reading \\"Wait for it.\\", later changed to \\"RUN.\\" and changed again to \\"The end.\\" on July 26. The story began with a male and female character building a sandcastle complex on a beach who then embark on an adventure to learn the secrets of the sea. On July 26, the comic superimposed a frame (3094) with the phrase \\"The End\\". Tasha Robinson of The A.V. Club wrote of the comic: \\"[...] the kind of nifty experiment that keeps people coming back to XKCD, which at its best isn't a strip comic so much as an idea factory and a shared experience\\". Cory Doctorow mentioned \\"Time\\" in a brief article on Boing Boing on April 7, saying the comic was \\"coming along nicely\\". The 3,099-panel \\"Time\\" comic ended on July 26, 2013, and was followed by a blog post summarizing the journey. In 2014, it won the Hugo Award for Best Graphic Story. Around 2007, Munroe drew all the comics on paper, then scanned and processed them on a tablet computer (a Fujitsu Lifebook). As of 2014, he was using a Cintiq graphics tablet for drawing (like many other cartoonists), alongside a laptop for coding tasks. Influences \\"Wikipedian Protester\\", with tooltip \\" THE CONSTITUTION\\" Munroe has been a fan of newspaper comic strips since childhood, describing xkcd as an \\"heir\\" to Charles M. Schulz's Peanuts. Despite this influence, xkcds quirky and technical humor would have been difficult to syndicate in newspapers. In webcomics, Munroe has said that \\"one can draw something that appeals to 1 percent of the audience‚Äî1 percent of United States, that is three million people, that is more readers than small cartoons can have.\\" Munroe cited the lack of a need for editorial control due to the low bar of access to the Internet as \\"a salvation.\\"  Recurring themes  \\"Malamanteau\\", with tooltip \\"The article has twenty-three citations, one of which is an obscure manuscript from the 1490s and the other twenty-two are arguments on Language Log.\\" While there is no specific storyline to the webcomic, there are some recurring themes and characters. Recurring themes of xkcd include \\"technology, science, mathematics and relationships.\\" xkcd frequently features jokes related to popular culture, such as Guitar Hero, Facebook, Vanilla Ice, and Wikipedia. There are many strips opening with the words \\"My Hobby:\\", usually depicting the nondescript narrator character describing some type of humorous or quirky behavior. However, not all strips are intended to be humorous. Romance and relationships are frequent themes, and other xkcd strips consist of complex depictions of landscapes. Many xkcd strips refer to Munroe's \\"obsession\\" with potential Velociraptor attacks. References to Wikipedia articles or to Wikipedia as a whole have occurred several times in xkcd.Other comics related to Wikipedia include:   * A facsimile of a made-up Wikipedia entry for \\"malamanteau\\" (a stunt word created by Munroe to poke fun at Wikipedia's writing style) provoked a controversy within Wikipedia that was picked up by various media. Another strip depicted an example of a topic that Wikipedia could not cover neutrally‚Äîa fictional donation to either anti-abortion or abortion-rights activists, determined by the word count in a Wikipedia article on the event where the donation was announced being either odd or even. All xkcd strips have a tooltip (specified using the \`title\` attribute in HTML), the text of which usually contains a secondary punchline or annotation related to that day's comic. One of the only recurring characters is a man wearing a flat black hat. He is extremely sociopathic, and has dedicated his life to causing confusion and harm to others just for his own entertainment. He has no name, though he is commonly referred to as \\"Black Hat\\" or \\"Black Hat Guy\\" in the community. He gained a girlfriend, commonly named \\"Danish\\" by the community, during the course of a small series called \\"Journal\\", who is just as cruel as he is. Another recurring character is a man with a beret, sometimes simply referred to as \\"Beret Guy\\". He seems to be naive, obsessed with bakeries, optimistic, and completely out of touch with reality. He also has magical abilities, which often manifest in the creation of situations or objects that support his overly optimistic worldview, even when in direct violation of societal norms or the laws of physics; an example is his startup making incredible amounts of money despite his not even knowing what they do. In one instance, he hired Lin-Manuel Miranda as an engineer and, in another instance, sprouted literal \\"endless wings\\". Geographical maps, their various different formats and creation methods are a frequently recurring theme in the comic.  On occasion these maps have been mentioned by analysts due to their imaginative or original presentation of figures or statistics. In the comic \\"2016 Election Map\\", colored stick figures are used to display how people voted according to their region giving a clearer picture of how people voted in the 2016 election. Alan Cole, a student at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, critically analyzed the map, concluding that it is the most elegant and informative he has seen. Spiders have also featured frequently in xkcd, almost always in a negative light. This began very early, with the 8th xkcd comic, Red Spiders, which began a series showing the arachnids attacking humans. Other comics related to spiders include Ballooning, Coronavirus Name, Cirith Ungol, and a number of others, and his related What-If articles have featured terrifying machines that resemble spiders. Munroe has said he dislikes eating lobster, considered by most people a delicacy, because to him it is too similar to eating spiders.  Inspired activities  Hoax attack on Richard Stallman by students dressed as ninjas. Inspired by \\"Open Source\\" On several occasions, fans have been motivated by Munroe's comics to carry out the subject of a particular drawing or sketch offline. Some notable examples include: * Richard Stallman was confronted by students dressed as ninjas before speaking at the Yale Political Union ‚Äì inspired by \\"Open Source\\". * On September 23, 2007, hundreds of people gathered at Reverend Thomas J. Williams Park, , in North Cambridge, Massachusetts, whose coordinates were mentioned in \\"Dream Girl\\". Munroe appeared, commenting, \\"Maybe wanting something does make it real\\", reversing the conclusion he drew in the last frame of the same strip. This park is recognized by NASA's Spot The Station program, which provides information on viewing opportunities for the International Space Station. Cory Doctorow wearing a red cape and a pair of goggles based on his appearance in xkcd. Doctorow later wore the costume again while accepting a Hugo Award on Munroe's behalf. *When animated xkcd strip \\"Time\\" won a Hugo Award for Best Graphic Story in August 2014, it was accepted by Cory Doctorow on behalf of Munroe, dressing as Munroe had drawn him in an earlier strip, \\"1337: Part 5\\". * xkcd readers began sneaking chess boards onto roller coasters after \\"Chess Photo\\" was published. ‚Äì inspired by \\"Chess Photo\\". * The game of \\"geohashing\\" has gained more than 1,000 players, who travel to random coordinates calculated by the algorithm described in \\"Geohashing\\". * In October 2007, a group of researchers at University of Southern California Information Sciences Institute conducted a census of the Internet and presented their data using a Hilbert curve, which they claimed was inspired by an xkcd comic that used a similar technique. Inspired by the same comic, the Carna botnet used a Hilbert curve to present data in their 2012 Internet Census. * Based on \\"Packages\\", programmers have set up programs to automatically find an item for sale on the Internet for $1.00 every day. * In response to \\"Password Strength\\", Dropbox shows two messages reading \\"lol\\" and \\"Whoa there, don't take advice from a webcomic too literally ;)\\" when attempting to register with the password \\"correcthorsebatterystaple\\". ArenaNet recommended that Guild Wars 2 users create passwords following the guidelines of the same comic. * The Python Standard Library module \\"antigravity\\", when run, opens the xkcd comic \\"Python\\". * Inspired by the xkcd comic \\"Online Communities 2\\", Slovak artist Martin Vargic created the \\"Map of the Internet 1.0.\\" * In 2008, Munroe posted a parody of the Discovery Channel's I Love the World advertising campaign on xkcd, which was later reenacted by Neil Gaiman, Wil Wheaton, and Cory Doctorow.  Awards and recognition  xkcd has been recognized at various award ceremonies. In the 2008 Web Cartoonists' Choice Awards, the webcomic was nominated for \\"Outstanding Use of the Medium\\", \\"Outstanding Short Form Comic\\", and \\"Outstanding Comedic Comic\\", and it won \\"Outstanding Single Panel Comic\\". xkcd was voted \\"Best Comic Strip\\" by readers in the 2007 and 2008 Weblog Awards. The webcomic was nominated for a 2009 NewNowNext Award in the category \\"OMFG Internet Award\\". Randall Munroe was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Fan Artist in both 2011 and 2012, and he won a Hugo Award for Best Graphic Story in 2014, for \\"Time\\".  Books  On September 2009, Munroe released a book, entitled xkcd: volume 0, containing selected xkcd comics. The book was published by breadpig, under a Creative Commons license, CC BY-NC 3.0, with all of the publisher's profits donated to Room to Read to promote literacy and education in the developing world. Six months after release, the book had sold over 25,000 copies. The book tour in New York City and Silicon Valley was a fundraiser for Room to Read that raised $32,000 to build a school in Salavan Province, Laos. In October 2012, xkcd: volume 0 was included in the Humble Bundle eBook Bundle. It was available for download only to those who donated higher than the average donated for the other eBooks. The book was released DRM-free, in two different-quality PDF files. On March 12, 2014, Munroe announced the book What If?: Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions. The book was released on September 2, 2014. The book expands on the What If? blog on the xkcd website. On May 13, 2015, Munroe announced a new book entitled Thing Explainer. Eventually released on November 24, 2015, Thing Explainer is based on the xkcd strip \\"Up Goer Five\\" and only uses the thousand most commonly used words to explain different scientific devices. On February 5, 2019, Munroe announced a fourth book, titled How To, which uses math and science to find the worst possible solutions to everyday problems. It was released on September 3, 2019.

The screenplay by Jeremy Brock and Andrew Davies is based on the 1945 novel of the same name by Evelyn Waugh, which previously had been adapted in 1981 as the television serial Brideshead Revisited. Plot Although he aspires to become an artist, middle-class Charles Ryder reads history at the University of Oxford, where he befriends the flamboyant and wealthy Lord Sebastian Flyte. Sebastian's mother, Lady Marchmain, strongly disapproves of Sebastian's lifestyle, especially his heavy drinking. When Sebastian takes Charles home to visit his nanny, Charles is enthralled by the grandeur of the Marchmain family estate, known as Brideshead, and entranced by its residents, including the devout Roman Catholic Lady Marchmain and her other children, Sebastian's elder brother Bridey and his sisters Julia and Cordelia. When Lord Marchmain invites Sebastian and Julia to visit him and his mistress Cara in Venice, Lady Marchmain encourages Charles to go with them in the hope that he can act as a positive influence on her son. Increasingly interested in Julia, Charles surreptitiously kisses her in a dark alley, unaware that Sebastian can see them from the other side of a canal. Jealous of his attention to his sister, Sebastian sets out to end this friendship, and on their return to Britain, Lady Marchmain makes it clear that Charles cannot marry Julia since he is not Catholic and professes to be an atheist. Sebastian's mother, concerned about his increasing alcoholism, cancels his allowance. During a visit to Brideshead, Ryder gives Sebastian money, which he uses to buy alcohol. Later that day, at a party given by the family, Charles is shocked when Lady Marchmain announces that the celebration is in honour of Julia's engagement to Canadian businessman Rex Mottram. Sebastian arrives at the party late and improperly dressed. After an embarrassing scene, Sebastian flees the party, and Lady Marchmain privately dresses down Charles because he gave Sebastian money, and tells him that he is no longer welcome at Brideshead. Sebastian flees to Morocco. Four years elapse. Lady Marchmain has become terminally ill. She asks Charles to find Sebastian and bring him home. Charles travels to Morocco, but Sebastian could not return even if he wanted to, which he clearly does not. He is in the hospital with fluid in one of his lungs, and the doctor warns Charles that Sebastian is too ill to travel. More time elapses. Julia marries Rex, and Charles marries as well, and becomes successful as an artist. Charles is reunited with Julia on an ocean liner travelling to Britain from New York. They immediately realise they are still in love and decide to leave their respective spouses and live together. Charles and Julia return to Brideshead, where Charles plans to ask Rex to step aside so he and Julia can be together. Rex first implies he will never let Julia go, and accuses Charles of just wanting the estate. However, he then relents and agrees to release her in exchange for two of Charles's paintings, which are now viewed as a good investment. He also reveals that he converted to Catholicism to get Julia, and he disdains Charles for not having been willing to do the same. Julia overhears all of this, is shocked and angered, feeling like bartered goods. Their arrangements made, Charles and Julia prepare to leave Brideshead. Just as they are driving out, however, they pass two cars arriving: Lord Marchmain is terminally ill, and has returned with Cara to spend his final days in his home. On his deathbed Lord Marchmain, who hitherto has not wanted Catholicism, regains his faith and dies reconciled to the Roman Catholic Church. Deeply affected by her father's transformation, Julia decides she cannot relinquish her own faith to be with Charles, and the two sadly part. Several years later, the Second World War is in process. A disillusioned Charles, now an army captain, finds himself once again at Brideshead, this time in its capacity as a military base. A corporal tells him Julia is serving in the women's services overseas and that her elder brother, Bridey, died during the Blitz. We also learn that he is alone ‚Äì he has no girlfriend or wife. Charles visits the family chapel, where he finds a single lit candle. He dips his hand into holy water and moves to snuff out a candle that is almost out of wax. However, he then reconsiders, and leaves the flame to burn. Cast * Matthew Goode as Charles Ryder * Ben Whishaw as Lord Sebastian Flyte * Hayley Atwell as Lady Julia Flyte * Emma Thompson as Teresa Flyte, Marchioness of Marchmain (Lady Marchmain) * Michael Gambon as Alexander Flyte, Marquess of Marchmain (Lord Marchmain) * Greta Scacchi as Cara * Anna Madeley as Celia Ryder * Patrick Malahide as Mr. Ryder * Felicity Jones as Lady Cordelia Flyte * Ed Stoppard as Earl of Brideshead, \\"Bridey\\" (Lord Brideshead) * Jonathan Cake as Rex Mottram * Joseph Beattie as Anthony Blanche * James Bradshaw as Mr. Samgrass Production Castle Howard in North Yorkshire was used as Brideshead for the film. Actors Paul Bettany, Jude Law, and Jennifer Connelly were signed for the lead roles by original director David Yates for Warner Independent Pictures in 2004. However, constant budget issues stalled the film's production and Yates left the project to direct Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. This led to the roles being recast by directorial replacement Julian Jarrold. Just as it did for the earlier television adaptation of Waugh's novel, Castle Howard in North Yorkshire serves as the setting for Brideshead. In The World of Brideshead, a bonus feature on the DVD release of the film, Simon Howard reveals his family was eager to welcome film crews to the estate once again. It had become a major tourist attraction after the television serial aired; they hoped the feature film would renew interest in the property. Principal photography took place at Castle Howard during the summer of 2007, and many extras were employed from the local population in and around York. The ending of the film was also altered from that of the novel. In the film, Charles leaves the family chapel at Brideshead seemingly unchanged in his atheist/agnostic leanings, although he decides not to snuff out the candle that is burning. The novel ends with Charles entering the chapel and kneeling down to pray using \\"ancient and newly learned words\\", thus implying he has recently converted to Catholicism. Release=Box office The film opened on thirty-three screens in the United States on 25 July 2008 and grossed $332,000 on its opening weekend, ranking twenty-first at the box office. It eventually earned $6,432,256 in the US and $7,018,930 elsewhere for a total worldwide box office of $13,451,186. Critical reception Comparing the film to the earlier television adaptation, A.O. Scott of The New York Times called it \\"necessarily shorter and less faithful to Waugh's book, and also, for what it's worth, more cinematic. It is also tedious, confused and banal.\\" He blamed director Jarrold and screenwriters Davies and Brock \\"for finding so little new or interesting to say... and for systematically stripping Waugh's novel of its telling nuances and provocative ideas.\\" He concluded, \\"The long experience of English Catholics as a religious minority, the subtle gradations of class in the British university system, the crazy quilt of sexual norms and taboos governing the lives of young adults: all of this is what makes Brideshead Revisited live and breathe as a novel. None of it registers with any force in this lazy, complacent film, which takes the novel's name in vain.\\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times observed, \\"While elegantly mounted and well acted, the movie is not the equal of the TV production, in part because so much material had to be compressed into such a shorter time. It is also not the equal of the recent film Atonement, which in an oblique way touches on similar issues. But it is a good, sound example of the British period drama; mid-range Merchant-Ivory, you could say.\\" Mark Olsen of the Los Angeles Times said, \\"The film's strengths are in Waugh's story and not so much in the particular spin of these filmmakers. Their decision to turn up the volume on the homosexual undertones between Sebastian and Charles feels like an unimaginative nod to our modern times... In Brideshead, Jarrold seems too often to consciously be making an in-quotation-marks classy picture, much like last year's Atonement, in which the costumes and setting are just so, but the human drama gets lost amid the pictorial pleasantries. That the film is neither a true triumph nor a total disaster makes it somewhat difficult to justify revisiting Brideshead, apart from the hope it will inspire someone somewhere to pick up the book.\\" David Wiegand of the San Francisco Chronicle called it \\"a very noble movie, which makes it interesting at times, but not often enough... What Jarrold has done right is to hire Andrew Davies to work with Jeremy Brock on the adaptation. There's no one better at dusting off English classics for the wide and small screens than Davies. He and Brock have done a competent job of culling just the right plot elements from Waugh's book and assembling them into a serviceable story. Whether you want to stick it out, however, is another matter entirely... Jarrold and his writers are more than respectful of the original source material, but compressing it all into two hours and change doesn't make for a terribly enjoyable film... Davies and Brock perform miracles in making this somewhat workable, but the ultimate impossibility of their task shows at the end.\\" David Ansen of Newsweek suggested, \\"Think of Jarrold's briskly paced, stylish abridgment as a fine introduction to Waugh's marvelously melancholy elegy. It brings these unforgettable characters to life again, and if it sends people back to the novel, and back to the classic TV series... all the better. There's room for more than one Brideshead in this far less glamorous day and age.\\" Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly graded the film B and commented, \\"Brideshead Revisited is opulent and watchable, yet except for Thompson's acting, it's missing something ‚Äì a grander, more ambivalent vision of the England it depicts dying out. In the series, we looked at that palatial fortress of Brideshead manor and thought: Here, in one house, is a fading empire. In the movie, it's just sublime real estate.\\" Dennis Harvey of Variety called the film \\"finely wrought\\" and added, \\"Purists may blanch at the screenplay's changes to the source material's narrative fine points, but its spirit survives intact... Goode provides a fine center of gravity as the middle-class tourist in heady but toxic upper-class realms. Thompson superbly etches a complex, eventually tragic portrait in her relatively few scenes.\\" Geoffrey Macnab of The Independent rated the film three out of five stars and called it \\"flawed and uneven\\". He added, \\"In trying to shoehorn Waugh's novel into a two-hour movie, the film-makers have left characters underdeveloped while skipping over plot points and condensing material that surely requires greater exposition. Boldly ‚Äì and perhaps rashly ‚Äì they have almost entirely dispensed with voiceover narration. Anyone expecting an equivalent to Jeremy Irons' evocative reading of Waugh's prose will be disappointed... On the credit side, this Brideshead boasts a handful of very strong performances... Emma Thompson makes a formidable Lady Marchmain and Michael Gambon is dependable as ever as Lord Marchmain but this Brideshead is slow to build momentum.

A doctor declared that the three finest May peaches would save her, but then she would have to marry within a week or fall sick again. Many men came with peaches, but none saved the princess. A woman had three sons, and the oldest set out with the finest peaches from their orchard. He met an old woman who asked what he had; he claimed rabbit dung, she said that so it was, and when he got the castle, that was what he carried. His next brother set out next, told the old woman he carried horse dung, and again found that was what he carried. The youngest, who was short and regarded as a little simple, persuaded his mother to let him try as well, and told the old woman that he carried the peaches to cure the princess, and she said so it was and also gave him a silver whistle. When he got to the castle, eating the peaches revived the princess. The king did not want such a puny little son-in-law. He told the boy had to herd a hundred rabbits and not lose one for four days. The first day, the rabbits scattered, but the boy used the whistle to bring them back. The second day, the king sent the princess to get one; the boy would only trade one for a kiss, and when she had it and had reached the gates of the castle, he used the whistle, and it came back. The next day, the king sent the queen to get one; the boy would only trade one if the queen turned three somersaults, and when she did, the king locked it in a room but the boy used his whistle and it came back through a window. The fourth day, the king went himself. The boy would only trade it if the king kissed his donkey's behind. When the king had gotten the rabbit, he had it killed and skinned and put on to casserole, but the boy used his whistle and it jumped out of the dish, back into its skin, and back to the boy. Then the king said that the boy had to fill three sacks with truths. He said the princess had kissed him for a rabbit, and that filled the first sack; the queen had turned somersaults for a rabbit, and that filled the second. The king stopped him and let him marry the princess.

It debuted at the Alliance Theatre in Atlanta, Georgia, in 2012. A touring production began in late 2013 through the South and Midwest. A soundtrack was released featuring country, folk, and rock musicians. The story is a Southern Gothic tale of two brothers who hate each other and are forced by their father to spend time in a haunted cabin, where they are visited by the ghosts of dead brothers who also hated each other. Production T Bone Burnett produced the music for Ghost Brothers. In 2002, Mellencamp talked about his vision for the project: \\"I plan to have every person sing from their generation. This is what I'm thinking right now, but it may not work out this way. When the 18-year-old sings, he'll be rapping at you. When the people in their 70s are singing, they'll be singing in the style of Broadway or the style of Frank Sinatra or country. I intend to cover any type of music that Americans have invented.\\" He did not wind up following this format, as all the songs in the final production are performed in a folk and roots rock style. Mellencamp provided this update of the musical's progress November 2010: > T Bone and I and Stephen King are working on a musical. All the music has > been recorded. We had Kris Kristofferson, Neko Case, Elvis Costello, Taj > Mahal, all singing different characters' roles. I wrote all the songs, 17 > songs. [T Bone] produced. It sounds like the Sgt. Pepper of Americana to me. > Forget about the play, just the songs, the way these people sing them. I'm > sitting there listening to it and thinking, \\"Did Rosanne Cash just kill that > song or what!\\" The play is called \\"Ghost Brothers of Darkling County,\\" about > two brothers who hate each other. If you could imagine Tennessee Williams > meets Stephen King. King and Mellencamp sought a regional theater to stage the show and chose Atlanta. \\"We wanted a place that was cosmopolitan but not out of touch with country roots. Atlanta seemed like the middle of the bulls-eye\\", King said. \\"You know that song, 'If you can make it here, you can make it anywhere?' That's how I feel about Atlanta and this show.\\" Ghost Brothers began preview shows at the Alliance Theatre in Atlanta on April 4, 2012, opened April 11 and played until May 13, 2012. The musical was directed by Alliance Theatre director Susan V. Booth, with musical supervision by T Bone Burnett. The band included Mellencamp's guitarist and musical director, Andy York, as well as Nashville session bassist David Roe. The copyist (transcribing the musical score) and vocal coach was Peggy Still Johnson. The cast included Tony Award winner Shuler Hensley and nominee Emily Skinner. Other cast members included Justin Guarini, Jake La Botz, Lucas Kavner, Kate Ferber, Christopher Morgan and Dale Watson. Completing the cast were Peter Albrink, Kylie Brown, Lori Beth Edgeman, Gwen Hughes, Joe Jung, Joe Knezevich, Rob Lawhon, Royce Mann, Travis Smith, Jeremy Aggers, Russell Cook, Stephanie Laubscher, Joseph Signa, and DeWayne Woods. The show featured the blood effects of Joseph Jefferson Award-winning special effects artist Steve Tolin, notable for his international work on Martin McDonagh's, The Lieutenant of Inishmore. The show went on a 20-city U.S. tour of the Midwest and Southeast in October‚ÄìNovember 2013 and an 18-city tour of the Northeast (including Canada), Mid-Atlantic, Upper Midwest, and West regions in late 2014. Plot Horror author Stephen King has worked in several media over the course of 40 years but never made a musical until this one. Describing the plot, Mellencamp said, \\"I can tell what it's not going to be like: It won't be 'Jack and Diane' meets Cujo. He's [King] already written the story‚Äîit's very beautiful, more like The Green Mile. It's an American story about an American family. Some of the characters are 100 years old, some are 15. So that will give me the opportunity to write for each character in a different style. I ain't writing a bunch of rock songs.\\" In a later interview he said, \\"[It's about] two brothers; they're 19 years old or 20, maybe 18 or 21, who are very competitive and dislike each other immensely. The father takes them to the family vacation place, a cabin that the boys hadn't been to since they were kids. What has happened is that the father had two older brothers who hated each other and killed each other in that cabin. There's a confederacy of ghosts who also live in this house. The older [dead] brothers are there, and they speak to the audience, and they sing to the audience. That's all I want to say, except through this family vacation, many things are learned about the family, and many interesting songs are sung.\\" The official production synopsis reads: \\"In the tiny town of Lake Belle Reve, Mississippi in 1967, a terrible tragedy took the lives of two brothers and a beautiful young girl. During the next forty years, the events of that night became the stuff of local legend. But legend is often just another word for lie. Joe McCandless knows what really happened; he saw it all. The question is whether or not he can bring himself to tell the truth in time to save his own troubled sons, and whether the ghosts left behind by an act of violence will help him‚Äîor tear the McCandless family apart forever.\\" Reception Reviewers emphasized the strength of Mellencamp's songwriting. A writer for Esquire magazine visited a New York rehearsal of the show in the fall of 2007 and said, \\"Musicals aren't usually a guy thing. This one, though, is not only tolerable, it's good. It may be the first-ever musical written by men for men. There's no orchestra, just a band with two twangy acoustic guitars, bass guitar, drums, an accordion, and a fiddle. The songs are both haunting and all-American.\\" The Atlanta Journal-Constitution noted in 2013 that \\"reviews were mixed\\" of the original production but \\"the problems that required tweaking all resided in Stephen King's book‚Äîparticularly an overlong, muddled second act‚Äînever in the music of John Mellencamp.\\" The newspaper called the musical \\"a pretty awesome spectacle\\", praising Mellencamp's \\"rousing score, a fusion of blues, country and rock that's superbly performed by [director Susan] Booth's 19-member cast. Under Burnett's musical direction, the sensational four-piece band never misses a beat.\\" Of the plot, the reviewer commented: \\"As a prolific novelist, King is a legendary master of suspense. As a first-time playwright, he doesn't really break new ground so much as he sticks to what he does best. Indeed, 'Ghost Brothers' might impress as a freaky paranormal morality tale on the surface, but at its core it spins a story as ancient as Cain and Abel‚Äîor, for one dysfunctional family living in backwoods Mississippi circa 2007, as recent as a mysterious tragedy from 40 years earlier.\\" The New York Times review said \\"[t]he production is as rambling as the script\\", asking \\"with its parade of Southern Gothic references (Faulkner, Williams, O'Connor) and melodramatic metaphors, is the show supposed to be a winking, mischievous musical? It's not clear.\\" Of the plot, it said \\"[t]he intricate story of Ghost Brothers might work wonderfully on the page ... but the mood too often wavers. The ghosts fade into the background, sometimes on purpose, other times not.\\" The review praised musical director Burnett, who \\"handles a diverse range of styles without ever sounding a slick note\\" with \\"an impressive chorus of voices to support Mr. Mellencamp's score of blues, gospel and roots.\\" It noted that, overall, \\"the show does resist cliche.\\" Soundtrack A CD/DVD was released on June 4, 2013, containing handwritten lyrics and a documentary about the making of the musical. The soundtrack features Neko Case, Rosanne Cash, Elvis Costello, Sheryl Crow, Kris Kristofferson, and Taj Mahal.

These simple, often geometric, marks have been frequently compared to some of the earliest known Chinese characters appearing on the oracle bones, and some have taken them to mean that the history of Chinese writing extends back over six millennia. However, only isolated instances of these symbols have been found, and they show no indication of representing speech or of the non-pictorial processes that a writing system requires. Nature of the symbols At a range of Neolithic sites in China, small numbers of symbols of either pictorial or simple geometric nature have been unearthed which were incised into or drawn or painted on artifacts, mostly on pottery but in some instances on turtle shells, animal bones or artifacts made from bone or jade.Qiu 2000, p.30 These sites include those pertaining to the cultures of Yangshao, Liangzhu, Majiayao and Longshan. The question of whether such symbols are writing, primitive or proto-writing, or merely non-writing symbols or signs for other purposes such as identification is a highly controversial one, and the debate still continues today. Proponents of the view that they are early Chinese writing tend to see evidence in comparisons of individual signs with individual oracle bone script characters. Others believe that Neolithic signs are part of an incipient semiotic system that eventually led to the development of mature Chinese writing.Dematt√© 2010. William G. Boltz of the University of Washington's Department of Asian Languages and Literature points out that such comparisons are \\"notoriously risky and inconclusive\\" when based on such primitive scratch marks rather than on similarity in function (2003, p. 38). Boltz adds: In general, the Neolithic symbols which have been unearthed to date are found in isolated use (as would be expected with ownership marks or clan symbols) rather than in sequences consistent with representation of the spoken language, and there is no evidence of processes fundamental to the beginnings of a true, useful writing system such as phonetic loan usage.WƒÅng 1981, p.42 As Qiu (2000, p. 39) explains: > Only when symbols...are consciously used to record words used to form > sentences is there a true sign that the development of script has begun. Furthermore, the evidence is still extremely scanty, even when the early Shang period evidence is added to the picture: It is still safe to conclude that the earliest known undisputed examples of true writing in China (that is, symbols used to fully record language rather than isolated meanings) are the oracle bones of the late Shang dynasty, c. 1250 BCE.Boltz 2003, p.31Qi√∫ Xƒ´guƒ´ (Ë£òÈå´Âú≠) 2000, p.11. Early Neolithic The earliest of China's Neolithic signs come from Jiahu, Dadiwan and Damaidi. Jiahu Examples of Jiahu symbols Jiahu is a Neolithic site in Wuyang County, Henan Province, in the basin of the Yellow River, dated to 6600‚Äì6200 BCE. This site has yielded turtle plastronsW√©nw√π 1989, v.1, pp.1‚Äì14 that were pitted and inscribed with markings known as the Jiahu symbols. Despite headlines proclaiming the earliest known \\"writing\\", some scholars warn that the meaningful use of such individual signs should not be easily equated with writing, although it may represent an earlier, formative stage. In the words of the archaeologists who made the latest Jiahu discovery: Furthermore, there is no evidence of a direct cultural link between Jiahu and the Shang culture, and the five-millennium gap between the two makes connections unlikely; as oracle bone scholar David Keightley told the BBC:Paul Rincon, \\"Earliest writing\\" found in China, BBC Science 2003-4-17. Dadiwan Dadiwan (5800‚Äì5400 BCE) is a Neolithic site discovered in Qin'an County, in the province of Gansu. Its earliest phase has yielded symbols painted on the inside surfaces of pottery basins.W√©nw√π 1983:11, pp.21‚Äì30 More recent excavations there have also uncovered a handful of Neolithic symbols.Chen Lin, Dadiwan Relics Break Archeological Records, China.org. Damaidi In Damaidi, at Beishan Mountain in Ningxia, 3,172 cliff carvings dating to 6000‚Äì5000 BCE have been discovered over an area of 15 square kilometers, including a reported 8,453 different kinds of pictures like celestial bodies, gods and hunting or grazing scenes. Researchers have identified 2,000 pictorial symbols, which they said are similar to later forms of ancient characters and many can be identified as such.  Middle Neolithic =Banpo and Jiangzhai Banpo pottery symbols Jiangzhai pottery symbols Another group of early symbols, which many have compared to Chinese characters, are the Banpo symbols from sites like Banpo, just east of Xi'an in Shaanxi dating from the 5th millennium BCE, and nearby, at Jiangzhai, in Lintong District, from the early 4th millennium BCE. As the Banpo symbols were discovered fairly early (1954‚Äì57)ÊñáÁâ©Âá∫ÁâàÁ§æ W√©nw√π Ch≈´b«énsh√®, 1963, p.306 and are relatively numerous (with 22 different symbols on 113 sherds),Woon 1987, p.13 (count excludes variants) these have been the focus of the most attention. Some scholars have concluded that they are meaningful symbols like clan emblems or signatures which have some of the quality of writing, perhaps being primitive characters,Guo Moruo 1972, pp. 2 & 6 while others have concluded based on comparisons to oracle bone script that some of them are numerals.ÊùéÂ≠ùÂÆö Lƒ≠ Xi√†od√¨ng 1974, p.366Y√∫ Xƒ≠ngw√∫ 1973 p.32Ping-ti Ho 1975, pp.229‚Äì30Zh√®ng D√©k≈´n 1973, p.45 Still others feel they may be ownership mark or potters' marks.Woon 1978 p.13W√©nw√π Press 1963, p.198WƒÅng 1981, p.23 Finally, some scholars sound a note of caution, calling such conclusions unwarranted or premature. This is because all the Banpo-type symbols occur singly,Woon 1978 p.13 &22W√©nw√π Press 1963, p.197; pl.141 & pls.167‚Äì171 on pottery and pottery fragments, unlike written words, which tend to occur in strings representing language. Thus, there is no context from which to conclude that the symbols are actually being used to represent language.T√°ng L√°n 1978Qiu 2000 p.31 Furthermore, there is no evidence of the phonetic loan usage and semantic- phonetic compounding necessary to produce a functional script as seen in the Shang dynasty's oracle bone script. Thus, leading scholar Qiu Xigui (2000) argues that: In Qiu's opinion, they instead more closely resemble the non- writing symbols which remained in use even into the early historical period.GƒÅo 1987, pp.35‚Äì36; cited in Qiu 2000, p.31 Another problem which has been noted is that, since the oracle bone script was fairly pictorial in nature, if one were to go back to ancestors predating them by over three millennia, one should expect an increase in the pictorial nature of the symbols, but in fact, a comparison of the majority of the Banpo symbols shows the exact opposite to be true.Qiu 2000, p.31‚Äì32 However, it is possible that some of the Banpo or other Neolithic symbols were used as numerals in a pre- literate setting. It is also plausible that when writing eventually did emerge, some such Neolithic symbols already in use (and not necessarily from such an early site as Banpo) were absorbed into that writing system.Qiu 2000, pp.32‚Äì33 Other discoveries Symbols unearthed in 1992 at Shuangdun in Bengbu, Anhui province are said to include composite signs. Late Neolithic=Dawenkou Inscription-bearing artifacts from the Dawenkou culture in Shandong, dating to c. 2800‚Äì2500 BCE,Qiu 2000, p.33 have also been unearthed since excavations started in the 1950s,Woon 1987, p.27Earliest Chinese Characters Discovered, People's Daily, 2000-4-21. and have drawn a great deal of interest amongst researchers, in part because the Dawenkou culture is believed to be directly ancestral to the Longshan culture, which in turn is thought ancestral to the Shang, where the first undisputed Chinese writing appears. At a Dawenkou site in Shandong, one pictorial symbol has been found painted in cinnabar,W√©nw√π Press 1974 while at the Dawenkou sites by the L√≠ngy√°ng River () and in D√†zh≈´ Village (), eighteen isolated pictorial symbols of eight types incised and/or painted with cinnabar on sixteen pottery jars and shards have been found, mostly from wealthier tombs.W√°ng 1986 Some resemble axes, and another has been variously described as resembling the sun above a cloud or fire Dawenkou symbol 1, while a third type has the latter above a fire or mountain-like element. In addition to the similarity in style between these and pictographic Shang and early Zhou clan symbols,W√°ng 1981 p.33 what is important about the latter two types is that they have multiple components, reminiscent of the compounding of elements in the Chinese script, thus eliciting claims of a relationship. Yu Xingwu identified the circle-and- cloud graph as the Chinese character for \\"dawn\\", Êó¶ d√†n,Y√∫ 1973, p.32 while T√°ng L√°n identified it as \\"bright\\", ÁÇÖ ji«íng,T√°ng 1975, pp.72‚Äì3 and so on. Helping fuel speculation of a link between Dawenkou symbols and Shang writing is their somewhat greater proximity in time (1400 years distance) and space to the Shang oracle bones, compared to earlier Neolithic finds; furthermore, the Shandong Dawenkou culture is thought by some to be ancestral to Shandong Longshan culture, which in turn may have given rise to early Shang culture. As with each of the other Neolithic sites, the comparison is based on only a handful of isolated pictures, and there is again no evidence of use in strings of symbols such as we would expect with true writing ‚Äì none of these appear jointly. W√°ng N√≠ngshƒìng thus concluded that they are marks of personal or clan identity rather than writing.W√°ng 1981, p.27 According to W√°ng, \\"True writing begins when it represents sounds and consists of symbols that are able to record language. The few isolated figures found on pottery still cannot substantiate this point.\\"Wang, Ningsheng, p. 28. 1981.Qi√∫ 2000, p. 38. Keightley opines that \\"they probably served as emblems of ownership or identity on these pots and jades, rather than as words in a writing system\\".Keightley 1989 p.197, cited in Boltz 2003, p.46 Boltz agrees that they may have been \\"the pre-Shang counterpart to the Shang clan-name insignia\\" (p. 48), but contrasts this with an actual writing system, for which there isn't any evidence at that time (p. 51‚Äì52), while Qiu concludes: Longshan culture Eleven characters found at Dinggong in Shandong, China on a pottery shard, Longshan culture The Chengziya site in Longshan, Shandong has produced fragments of inscribed bones presumably used to divine the future, dating to 2500‚Äì1900 BC, and symbols on pottery vessels from Dinggong are thought by some scholars to be an early form of writing. Again, this is controversial. Symbols of a similar nature have also been found on pottery shards from the Liangzhu culture of the lower Yangtze valley. A pottery inscription of the Longshan culture discovered in Dinggong Village, Zouping County, Shandong contains eleven symbols that do not look like the direct ancestor of Chinese characters. Chinese scholar Feng Shi (È¶ÆÊôÇ) argued in 1994 that this inscription can be interpreted as written by the Longshan people.Feng Shi, \\"Shandong Dinggong Longshan shidai wenzi jiedu\\" in Kaogu 1:37‚Äì54 Other scholars, like Ming Ru, are doubtful about attributing a Neolithic date to the inscription. The authenticity of these inscriptions is hotly disputed due to their appearance on a broken ceramic ware, an unusual feature among prehistorical text, as well as its unexpected relation to the Yi script, a modern writing system associated with an ethnic group in the southwestern China, thousands of miles and thousands of years apart from the Longshan culture in northern China. Possible Liangzhu symbols There are also some items, including some inscribed jades, which have symbols similar to or identical to several of the Dawenkou pictures, such as the circle and peaked crescent motif Dawenkou symbol 1, and another described as a bird perched on a mountain-like shape; it appears that some of these may belong to the Liangzhu culture.Lƒ≠ 1987, p.79W√©nw√π (Cultural Relics) 1978, p.52Lƒ≠ Xu√©q√≠n 1985Qiu 2000, pp.35‚Äì37 and espec. footnote 7, p.37 Between 2003 and 2006, over 240 pieces of artifacts containing ancient characters used by the 5000-year-old Liangzhu culture were unearthed within the Zhuangqiaofen ruin in Lindai town, Pinghu city, Zhejiang province.

Ben's father, Mijndert Pon, owned a shop (founded in 1898) that sold sewing machines, household articles and tobacco goods at Arnhemseweg (Arnhem Road) in Amersfoort.Pon Dealer Later, he added Opel bicycles and motorized bicycles to his range of goods. Beginning in 1920, Pon sold Opel and Ford automobiles as well as Continental tires.Pon in bedrijf, magazine of Pon, 2006, p. 6ff.

Half a million were to follow by 1960. A mere two years later there were one million Beetles in the U.S.Lanz, ibid., p. 166f. It has not been ascertained that Ben Pon was significantly involved in this success story, even though he was among the first to export them into the U.S. It cannot even be proved that he sold the first Beetle in the United States. He was, in fact, unable to find a partner for a distributorship and left the country with an unpaid hotel bill,This story is told in The Beetle Driver but eventually it made him a multimillionaire and one of the richest people in the Netherlands. In 1971, the dealership was separated from the export division and ran under the name of Pon Dealer. Audi later became a partner of Pon's. The business continued to grow, and in 1980 he incorporated Pon Holdings: an exempt private company with approximately 9,000 employees.

According to some, (for example, Essendon's Famous \\"Mosquito Fleet\\" is a Worry to Opposing Sides, The Sporting Globe, (Saturday, 22 May 1926), p.6.) there were another two Essendon players that were diminutive enough to be considered to be \\"mosquitoes\\": Garnet Campbell (5'7¬Ω\\"), and Greg Stockdale (5'8\\"). The term \\"mosquito fleet\\" was drawn by analogy from a maritime expression relating to particular assemblies of small vessels (e.g., the South Australian \\"mosquito fleet\\", the Queensland \\"mosquito fleet\\", a number of different U.S. \\"mosquito fleets\\", etc.). =Career= He played 137 games with Essendon Football Club from 1921 to 1928. The last 118 of those games ‚Äî from round 12 in 1922 to round 17 in 1928 inclusive (he did not play in the last match of the 1928 season, \\"[having] requested the selectors not to consider him for the match as he was not in form\\"Place Within Their Reach, The (Melbourne) Herald, (Friday, 31 August 1928), p.13.) ‚Äî were played consecutively. He was first rover (with 2 goals) in the 1923 premiership team, and played on the half-forward flank (with 4 goals in the three matches) in the team that won the 1924 (round-robin) premiership.

Maher, was captain of the Victorian Football League representative team that played against the Ovens and Murray Football League in Wangaratta in June, 1928 and praised a 16 year old Haydn Bunton (O&MFL;) after the games as a player \\"who could hold his own in any league team\\". =Brownlow medal (third place)= He polled strongly in the 1925 Brownlow Medal, coming in third place with four votes.In those days, there was only a single vote available in any one game. The 1925 winner, St Kilda's Colin Watson won the medal with 9 votes (i.e., best on the ground on nine occasions) having played in only 15 matches. Oakleigh (VFA) Late in 1928, the VFA decided to expand its number of teams from ten to twelve. Oakleigh and Sandringham were chosen to take part in the 1929 VFA competition.Football: Association Admits Oakleigh: Sandringham May Also Be Invited, The Age, (Tuesday, 27 November 1928), p.11.

The fire-walking ceremony is in honour of the goddess Draupati Amman, who is considered the incarnation of goddess Mariamman, and is practiced not only in India, but also in Fiji, Sri Lanka, Singapore, Malaysia, Mauritius, R√©union, South Africa and other countries with large South Indian populations. In Singapore, the celebrations begin at Sri Srinivasa Perumal Temple in Serangoon Road around 10pm and the priest leads the grand procession of people through the streets to Sri Mariamman Temple in South Bridge Road where the actual tƒ´miti takes place. The priest starts the tƒ´miti by walking through the pit filled with hot burning wood with a karakattam \\"sacred water-filled pot\\" on his head. He is followed by male devotees intent on fulfilling their personal promises and proving their faith. The devotees may include a minority of non-Indians and non-Hindus. Events during the festival period Preparation of fire walking pit at the Draupati Amman temple festival in Udappu, Sri Lanka Sri Mariamman Temple in Singapore, 1913 During the period of the festival, scenes from Mahabharata are enacted by the devotees and drama troupes. A week before the fire walking they perform prayers to Periyachi who is one of the most important deities of Mariamman‚Äôs entourage. The grand prayer session is held to request her blessings upon the devotees and that no unpleasant incidents should happen during the festival.\\"Mahabharathathil Uruvaana thiruvizha,\\" by Radha Kasiramu. Tamil Murasu, October 2005, pg 3. The second event is a symbolic grand marriage ceremony conducted between Arjuna and Draupadi. Following this is probably the most important ritual: a simulation of the sacrifice of Hijra, which was done before the Mahabharata war to ensure success to the Pandavas. The simulated ritual does not involve human sacrifice. Afterwards, devotees offer their prayers like carrying milk pots, doing Kumbiduthandam (prostrating after every step) and Angapirathatchanam (rolling around the temple grounds). Mariamman is given a milk bath with the milk that the devotees brought as it is a belief that the sins of man will be washed away. Two days before the Tƒ´miti festival, a silver chariot procession takes place to commemorate the 18-day battle which culminates in the Pandavas victory. At this juncture, Krishna agreed to be Arjuna's charioteer. Marking this occasion in Singapore, on the Friday and Saturday prior to Tƒ´miti, a chariot procession takes place around the Telok Blangah and Bukit Merah districts. The fire pit is prepared the night before the final day and kept red hot throughout the ritual. Devotees begin their ritual as early as 4 am and the event ends before 11am. It is believed that if they are truly devoted to Draupadi they will walk through the fire unscathed. Some devotees suffer burn injuries on their feet. Injuries to children subjected to such rituals in Tamil Nadu have been reported. Reportedly due to unsteadiness while walking, children fall and often sustain injuries to other parts of their bodies besides their feet. However, studies have found that the prolonged suffering involved in this and similar rituals can result in feelings of euphoria for participants, an effect similar to the marathon \\"runners high\\".Fischer, R., D.

In addition to Carver's operations the facility includes a pilots‚Äô lounge, a flight planning room, a business center and conference rooms. The airport's old 1950's era terminal was torn down as part of this construction project. In 2012, the airport received a $63,000 grant from the U.S. Department of Transportation for an environmental impact study. The study was for an upcoming project that includes the extension of runway 15/33, the main northwest-southeast runway, from to with new taxiways. The local fixed-based operator Carver Aero offers flight charter, aircraft rental, and flight training, as well as line and maintenance services.

PILPG also provides policy formulation advice and training on matters related to conflict resolution, including transitional justice, documentation of human rights violations, and community-level peacebuilding. To date, PILPG has advised over two dozen states and numerous civil society organizations on the legal aspects of peace negotiations and post-conflict constitution drafting. It has also advised numerous government and non-governmental actors in Europe, Asia and Africa about protecting human rights, prosecuting atrocity crimes, and rebuilding communities from the grassroots up.

Upon occasion, PILPG also uses volunteer legal assistance from other practicing international lawyers as well as pro bono assistance from major international law firms. From 1996 to 1998, PILPG operated under the auspices of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. In July 1999, the United Nations granted official Non-Governmental Organization status to PILPG.

The album rose to number 9 on the Billboard Top LPs chart and number 7 on the R&B; chart. History Once Upon a Dream was the band's first album billed to \\"The Rascals\\"; they had, for legal reasons, been known as The Young Rascals until this time. It was also the last Rascals album to be available in both mono and stereo mixes. The album was received differently by fans and critics. Many consider this album to be the band's best work, while others insist that it was too different from their traditionally rhythm and blues influenced music. Lead vocals came from both Eddie Brigati and Felix Cavaliere, as well as from Eddie's brother and unofficial band member David Brigati (on \\"Finale: Once Upon a Dream\\") and Gene Cornish on his own number, \\"I'm Gonna Love You.\\" In an interview with Melody Maker in 1967, Cavaliere stated, \\"Our new album, and I say this in a humble way, will be Sgt. Pepperish.\\" The album uses frequent sound effects and spoken words between the songs. A single of \\"It's Wonderful\\" (credited to \\"The Young Rascals,\\" the band's last recording to be so billed) was issued November 27, 1967 and peaked at number 20 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The album version ends with a coda of \\"Mardi Gras\\"-style special effects and party sounds that were not included in the single version. The album was reissued on CD August 28, 2007 by Collectors' Choice Music. Reception In his review for Allmusic, music critic Thom Jurek, who highly praised the album, noted the influence of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and wrote the Rascals \\"put their own spin on it by adding their trademark blue-eyed soul and jazz influences to the mix of psychedelia... All details aside, though, a listen to this platter is startling. Its sophisticated orchestral and vocal arrangements are remarkable even in the 21st century... It's an under-celebrated masterpiece of the psychedelic era and belongs next to Pet Sounds and Sgt. Pepper's on the shelf because it is easily as sophisticated, and once heard in its entirety, can never be forgotten.\\" Track listing All songs are written by Felix Cavaliere and Eddie Brigati, except where otherwise indicated.

Robin Riker played his wife and Matthew Brooks, Jennifer Love Hewitt, and Bradley Pierce played their children. The show aired on Fox from December 27, 1992 to May 23, 1993. Theme Bob Moody was mid-life, mid- career, middle-management and middle-class. He worked as a quality-control inspector for United General Technologies. He loved his family and worked hard to support them, but in ways was struggling with adulthood as well. Episodes often focused on Bob's thwarted ambitions at work, or the fact that he was not a traditional husband and father at home. Bob managed to get by as a result of finding the confidence to accept himself. Some episodes were surrealistic in nature, such as Bob trying an experimental hair-restoration product that slowly turned him into a werewolf. In another episode he takes up \\"Dance Fu\\", a combination of the martial arts and jazz dancing, to protect his family's right to go to a restaurant after a bully from work threatens him. Other episodes were more down to earth. In one Bob stages a sit-in in his younger son's treehouse in order to protest oppressive zoning laws which demand the treehouse be demolished. In another episode his daughter asks him to stay in the kitchen and not embarrass her at her first party, but when it flops, he livens it up with disco music and a game of Twister to everyone's delight and helps his daughter approach a boy she likes. However outlandish the situations became, the series was always grounded in family life. The series finale had Bob circulating a petition to save the local school music program, ultimately Bob is tackled by Secret Service agents when he tries to get newly-elected President Bill Clinton to sign the petition - in a men's room. Scheduled alongside primetime broadcasts of Batman: The Animated Series, against powerhouse 60 Minutes, Shaky Ground struggled in its time slot, while retaining a small but devoted cult following.

It is a community of 1,110 people. Located at the \\"Narrows\\" between Peter Pond Lake and Churchill Lake, tourism and resource extraction (logging, fishing) are its main economic activities.  History  John Franklin's Coppermine Expedition map of 1819‚Äì1822 showing the fur trade route from √éle-√†-la-Crosse to Methye Portage Buffalo Narrows or D√©troit du Boeuf as it was called in French was founded in the early 20th century as a trapping, mink ranching and fishing settlement by Scandinavian traders. The community developed around an earlier Dene settlement. John Macoun, who was travelling the fur trade route from Methye Portage to Lac √éle-√†-la-Crosse visited the \\"Narrows\\" in September 1875. He described his visit to this old community in the following lines: \\"After sunrise, a head wind sprang up with which we battled all day and reached the \\"Narrows,\\" that connect Buffalo and Clearwater lakes, before dark. \\"Chipewyan House\\" is situated at the eastern end of the \\"Narrows,\\" and at the head of Clearwater Lake. Here the Chipewyans have built themselves a number of houses.\\" Chipewyan House where Macoun stayed for about four days was probably a small outpost of the Hudson's Bay Company much like Buffalo House at Dillon and Bull's House on the La Loche River. Clearwater Lake (or Clear Lake) was renamed Churchill Lake in 1944 and Buffalo Lake was renamed Peter Pond Lake in 1932. Notable events On January 30, 1969, the community was the site of the murder of the Pedersen family, and their friend John Herman. Seven people were killed by 19-year-old M√©tis Labourer Frederick Moses McCallum (b. 1949). McCallum was later arrested, diagnosed with schizophrenia and found not guilty by reason of insanity. As of February 2019, he is being held at the Saskatchewan Federal Penitentiary.  Demographics  Climate  Buffalo Narrows has a humid continental climate (Koppen: Dfb) bordering on a subarctic climate (Dfc). Summers are comfortably warm with cool nights, while winters are very cold and dry.  Attractions  Park on Churchill Lake Rare piping plover Highway 155 bridge over the Kisis Channel Churchill Lake viewed from Buffalo Narrows Buffalo Narrows is notable for its scenery and its bridge that crosses the Kisis Channel. The bridge was officially opened in 1981 replacing a ferry that was set up in 1957. This channel links Peter Pond Lake and Churchill Lake.  Buffalo Narrows Sand Dunes Park  The dunes of Buffalo Narrows Sand Dunes Park located north of downtown create a fine sandy beach along the southwest shore of Big Peter Pond Lake (). The park, which is in size, includes the peninsula that nearly cuts Peter Pond Lake in two creating Little Peter Pond, the southern section and Big Peter Pond, the northern section. Formerly Crown land, the recreation area was transferred to the Northern Village of Buffalo Narrows in 2003. The community has assumed the responsibility for its maintenance and development. The beach is a nesting site of the vulnerable sparrow-sized piping plover.  Governance  As set out by the Northern Saskatchewan Municipal Government Act, and overseen by Municipal Relations, the village is governed by six Councillors, who are elected at-large every four years. Robert Woods is the mayor.  Transportation  Buffalo Narrows is connected to the rest of Saskatchewan by Highway 155. Highway 155 is paved along its whole length. The community is served by the Buffalo Narrows Airport and the Buffalo Narrows Water Aerodrome.

The route served the former Fort St. Clair State Memorial (now Fort St. Clair Park) in Eaton, Preble County. The route began at SR 122 in western Eaton, traveled south along Camden Road for about before turning into the memorial, looping through the entire site, and ending at itself just south of the route's start at SR 122. The route was removed from the state highway system shortly after the park's jurisdiction was transferred from the state to the City of Eaton. Route description SR 355 began at an unsignalized intersection with SR 122, also known as West Main Street, in the western extents of Eaton. SR 355 headed south on the two-lane Camden Road first past the park exit and then between the park and the Mound Hill Cemetery. The route turned right into the park and wound its way throughout the park, past the museum and parking areas. The route ended at the park exit at Camden Road, just south of where the route started at SR 122. History The route was created in 1932 as an unnumbered spur from SR 122 in Eaton to Fort St. Clair State Memorial. By 1934, Ohio maps showed the spur as SR 355. Official state maps prior to 1969 showed the route as a route, but maps after 1971 showed it as one-mile-long (1.6 km). The short route would not undergo any major changes throughout its history until the park had its jurisdiction transferred from the state to the city in 1992.

The flat itself houses a large public picnic area, and is the starting point for several historic trails of the San Gabriel Mountains, including the Gabrielino Trail. The US Forest Service estimates the road to Chantry as the third busiest entry into the Angeles, next to CA State Highways 2 and 39.2005 quote from Angeles National Forest Supervisor Jody Noiron - given to the creator of this article Significance Chantry Flat is home to the last pack station in Southern California. It is also the trailhead to Sturtevant's Camp, the oldest resort in the San Gabriels and one of a handful that still exist. The Chantry Flat/Big Santa Anita Canyon area boasts the last magneto-type crank phone system in the United States. The entire watershed is a living museum to the great hiking era in the first half of the twentieth century. History In 1905 Iowa-born Charley Chantry arrived in Sierra Madre, CA. He prospected his way there from the Black Hills of the Dakotas by way of the San Gabriel back country. He erected a sturdy tent cabin in Little Santa Anita Canyon from which he rented riding donkeys to kids staying at nearby Carter's Camp. Soon his stock was packing into all of the area's mountain resorts from his Mount Wilson Stables. While packing to Sturtevant's Camp, Charley passed through an oak-studded bench above Big Santa Anita Canyon's bottom at the San Olene Gap. With a reliable spring in adjoining San Olene Canyon (a corruption of the original Santa Oline) and the relatively flat land of an ancient slide, Chantry imagined this to be an ideal site for a small ranch. The details of his official occupation of the flat are unclear, even from John Robinson's The San Gabriels. The 1977 edition The San Gabriels by John Robinson - 1977 printing, Golden West Books, San Marino, California suggests that his plans for a home and orchard were thwarted by enactment of the Forest Homestead Act (1906), which forbade such development. The 1991 edition The San Gabriels by John Robinson - 1991 printing, Big Santa Anita Historical Society reports that he was granted a permit for in 1907, that he failed to act on his plans and that he allowed the permit to lapse, returning control to the Forest Service. Glen Owens, author of The Heritage of the Big Santa Anita Heritage of the Big Santa Anita by Glen Owens - 1981 & 2007, Big Santa Anita Historical Society believes the latter to be true and substantiates his claim with the witness of a Forest Service agricultural permit in Charley's name. In any event, Charley and his dog, Patch, did occasionally occupy a tent here, graze his stock here, and spend enough time here to have his name permanently attached to the area now known as Chantry Flat (formerly Poison Oak Flat). Charley died in 1936, one year after Los Angeles County paved a road to his old stomping grounds from the top of Santa Anita Ave. The road in was originally planned as a highway to join the Angeles Crest Highway (State Hwy 2) at Shortcut Canyon. The Forest Service never allowed it. It would have been a largely unwelcome introduction of modern civilization and would have obliterated the charm and beauty of both the Big Santa Anita and the West Fork of the San Gabriel River.Los Angeles Times Sunday Magazine article, We Are Agin \\"Progress\\" Up in Our Canyon, September 4, 1932 The county was permitted, however, to build a road into Winter Creek. They stopped short with a less intrusive terminus at Chantry Flat. The Civilian Conservation Corps built a campground here that was later remodeled by the Forest Service in 1958 and designated a picnic area. Also in 1958, the USFS built the existing firehouse with barracks and information center, the two 3-bedroom houses to house employees, and a water system ( capacity) drawn from a lateral well. The lateral well was later replaced by the vertical well now in use.Kevin Hunt - Water Inspector, USFS, ANF The Picnic Area The picnic grounds of Chantry Flat, known to locals as The Picnic Grove, are authorized for day use only.

It consists of of evergreen wilderness atop Lookout Mountain, named for its being a favored lookout point of the native Ute Indian tribe. Lookout Mountain Park is the burial site of the internationally famous western frontiersman William Frederick \\"Buffalo Bill\\" Cody, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Early history In 1889 a group of prominent area businessmen and residents proposed the idea of creating a mountain park as a getaway point for people from the urban city. After a lively competition between Lookout Mountain and Eden Park in Jefferson County west of Denver, Lookout Mountain was chosen for the honor. Plans were commissioned from famed architect Frederick Law Olmsted, the designer of Central Park in New York City, to create a naturalistic resort park for the area public to enjoy. Although the area for the original Lookout Mountain Park, as it became commonly known, was acquired by the syndicate, little manmade construction took place since finances were stymied by the Silver Crash of 1893. After languishing due to this and the deaths of its aging stockholders, Lookout Mountain Park was acquired by businessman Rees Vidler, who constructed a funicular incline railway to the top along with other attractions. Denver's Park View from Lookout Mountain looking west into the Rockies With the advent of the Denver Mountain Parks system, Lookout Mountain was quickly eyed by the city, whose efforts were led by Mayor Robert W. Speer who earlier sat on the board of Lookout Mountain Park during the early efforts. In 1917 a portion of what earlier was Lookout Mountain Park was acquired by Denver, which became the new Lookout Mountain Park for Denver. After existing briefly side by side, the bankrupt remaining original park passed by the wayside and Denver's park has been popularly known as Lookout Mountain Park. Since then much of the area of the original park has been reacquired for park purposes as part of Jefferson County Open Space. Buffalo Bill \\"Buffalo Bill\\" Cody, who spent his final years living in Denver, was buried at Lookout Mountain Park on June 3, 1917. It is disputed whether Cody was buried here by his own request or by coercion,When William F. Cody died, in 1917, he proved not to have been able to control even his own corpse. He had chosen a burial spot in Cody, Wyoming, but his current partner, Harry Tammen, the Denver newspaperman, either bullied or bamboozled the grieving Louisa and had the Last of the Great Scouts put to rest on Lookout Mountain, near Denver. and it is not known if the exact site was chosen by his sister. In 1921 the gravesite was joined by Pahaska Tepee, a large and rustic wooden lodge designed by Edwin H. Moorman, housing the Buffalo Bill Museum. Today the museum continues to host visitors from around the world, a testament to Buffalo Bill's global appeal even a century after his Wild West exhibition last performed.

(For an explanation of scoring see Australian rules football). Awards * The 1972 VFL Premiership team was Carlton. * The VFL's leading goalkicker was Peter McKenna of Collingwood who kicked 130 goals. * The winner of the 1972 Brownlow Medal was Len Thompson of Collingwood with 25 votes. * North Melbourne took the \\"wooden spoon\\" in 1972. * The reserves premiership was won by . Hawthorn 13.10 (88) defeated 12.12 (84) in the Grand Final, held as a curtain-raiser to the seniors Grand Final at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on 7 October. Notable events * The Page‚ÄìMcIntyre system for determining the VFL premiership team, that had been centered on a \\"Final Four\\", and had operated from 1931 to 1971, was replaced by the McIntyre \\"Final Five\\" system in 1972 (the new finals system operated from 1972 until the 1991 AFL season, when it was replaced by the First McIntyre \\"Final Six\\" system). * In Round 1, Hawthorn full-forward Peter Hudson kicked 8 goals at Glenferrie Oval before he sustained a knee injury that kept him out until Round 21 of the following season. * In Round 10, the VFL changed a tradition: the field umpire, rather than team captains, tossed the coin at the start of the match, in order to reduce gamesmanship. * In Round 14, Collingwood half-forward John Greening was felled by St Kilda back-man Jim O'Dea 70 metres behind play. Greening was comatose for some time and was extremely lucky not to have died. After a VFL investigation, O'Dea received a 10-week suspension, which was seen by some as unsatisfactory. * In the second quarter of Carlton's Round 16 match against Essendon, Alex Jesaulenko kicked six goals in eleven minutes. Carlton kicked 11 goals straight in that second quarter. * In August, the VFL announced that it would grant a free transfer to any player who had played 10 years with a single club. **The \\"10-year rule\\" was introduced in order to render the VFL immune from the sorts of \\"restraint of trade\\" difficulties that were being experienced, at the time, in New South Wales in relation to Rugby League footballers. **Although twenty-two VFL players were eligible to do so, only six players, George Bisset (Footscray to Collingwood), Barry Davis (Essendon to North Melbourne), Carl Ditterich (St Kilda to Melbourne), Adrian Gallagher (Carlton to Footscray), John Rantall (South Melbourne to North Melbourne), and Doug Wade (Geelong to North Melbourne) took advantage of the new rule. The rule was rescinded in May 1973. * In September, North Melbourne Football Club appointed Ron Barassi as its 1973 coach. * In Round 20, Geelong's Ken Newland kicked a behind after the siren to win the match against Collingwood. * In the Round 21 match between Fitzroy and Essendon at the Junction Oval, bespectacled Essendon full-forward Geoff Blethyn kicked his 100th goal. A mounted policeman galloped out to protect Blethyn from spectators, and Blethyn was temporarily rendered sightless when the policeman's horse slobbered all over his glasses. * The 16 September First Semi-Final between Richmond and Carlton was tied at 8.13 (61) each. Angry fans invaded VFL Park immediately after the siren and field umpire Ian Coates was assaulted. * The Grand Final between Carlton and Richmond featured an aggregate score of 50.27 (327), setting the record for the highest aggregate score in any game, final or otherwise. The previous record of 48.25 (313) had stood since 1942, and the record would last until 1978.

The team was first introduced in Venom: Lethal Protector #2 (March 1993), and were created by David Michelinie and Mark Bagley. Fictional team history The Jury was originally conceived and financed by General Orwell Taylor, with Sentry (Curtis Elkins), Ramshot (Samuel Calkin), Screech (Maxwell Taylor), Firearm and Bomblast as the armored vigilantes. After his oldest son Hugh Taylor was a prison guard at a prison for super powered criminals who was killed by Venom in an attempt to escape, Orwell gathered together Hugh's friends; Elkins as a fellow co-worker and friend, Caulkin was an army buddy of Hugh's, Maxwell is Hugh's younger brother, and Firearm and Bomblast worked with Hugh. Orwell provided his five employees with costumes that were based on the Guardsman armors which were outfitted with sonics and fire, both of which are anathema to the Venom symbiote. Edwin Cord. Art by Mark Bagley The team's first mission was an attempt to destroy Venom but failed. Later, they legally rented spots on multiple New York City rooftops and used sensory equipment to scan for Spider- Man. This did not meet with the expected success because there are multiple superheroes that operate high above the city streets. Spider-Man figured out their plan and manages to ambush one of the Jury's maintenance men. The man stands up to Spider-Man, encouraging the superhero to take him to the police, as the equipment is all legal. Unsure what to do about the entire situation, Spider-Man intentionally baits one of the sensors, drawing the entire team out into a fight. Ramshot was unsure about kidnapping Spider-Man and was ordered back to base. Spider-Man was defeated by the remaining members. He was drugged and tried for his part in originally bringing the Venom symbiote to Earth. Witnesses were present to testify about Venom's crimes. One was a woman whose child had been traumatized after witnessing Venom's monstrous form (Venom had been trying to protect the girl from what he thought was a dangerous stranger). This trial was part of a plan designed to guilt Spider-Man into helping them steal a government designed weapon capable of slaying Venom. Paranoia Gavel, the judge for the Jury's trials. Art by John Calimee.Orwell seemed to lose sight of his original goals and began making shady deals with the Life Foundation (of which he was a shareholder) thus relegating the Jury to bodyguards for the foundation's clientele in their bunkers. Orwell began to become paranoid that his team was against him. Orwell eventually abandoned his team to die at the hands of Carlton Drake as a Man- Spider. Taylor and Roland Treece were later arrested by federal agents after trying to flee the Life Foundation. Eventually the Jury breaks from Orwell and reinvent themselves. Maxwell gives up his Screech identity and chose to redesign the Jury and set himself up as the defense lawyer in the Jury's trials of criminals. A mysterious hooded man named Gavel is assigned to be the judge for all their trials. Gavel was not an actual member of the Jury. He only served to deliver the verdict and always via a transmission from a secret location. A lawyer named Olivia Lentz was recruited to serve as the prosecutor for their trials. Finally the Jury recruited Jennifer Stewart, a former Guardsman whose husband Ryan was killed during a riot at the Vault. Stewart took the codename Wysper and took Screech's place in the team. At this time the Jury operated out of a secret location outside of the United States. They also had a base in southern California located in the office of a shell company named Equity Inc. which supposedly made office furniture. The Jury used a flying ship called the Justifier. Their briefing room was called \\"The Box\\". Shortly after recruiting Wysper, the Jury invaded the small country of Boca Del Dios and freed Tarantula (Luis Alvarez) from a prison guarded by robotic dreadnaughts. The Jury tried Tarantula and after presenting testimony he was convicted. Tarantula tried to escape and was told by Gavel that if he killed Wysper, he would be free to go. Tarantula and Wysper battled, Wysper was unsure she could kill Tarantula until she was informed by Gavel that Tarantula was the one who murdered her husband Ryan during the riot at the vault. Wysper snaps Tarantula's neck and was officially made a member of the Jury. Hybrid The Jury later tracked down Scott Washington aka Hybrid, a former Guardsman who was bonded to a symbiote that was in fact a gestalt of four symbiotes. The Jury fails to kill Hybrid due to the intervention of Hybrid's friends the New Warriors. After a fight that both sides confessed got out of hand, all present are convinced that Scott can control the symbiote; he had used pleasant memories of his times with his old Vault colleagues to calm the entity. Later the Jury lost their funding and hit hard times. They were forced to be hired goons yet again but this time working for Edwin Cord. U.S. Agent was made their leader. The Jury was sent after the Thunderbolts who had recently been revealed to be the Masters of Evil. The Jury was defeated by the Thunderbolts and their new leader Hawkeye. Weeks later, The Jury was ordered not to go into battle with Graviton and the Thunderbolts by Cord who had no desire to waste resources in battles in which he had nothing to gain personally. The U.S. Agent and the Jury would sometime later go against Cord's mandate and help the Thunderbolts fight the new Secret Empire. The Jury fought the New Thunderbolts. They were defeated easily by Songbird.

He is currently an expatriate professional basketball player. High school Young was a four-year letterman in basketball at Clifton J. Ozen High School in Beaumont, Texas. He was named All-Region three times and All-State twice. As a senior, he averaged 18 points and 10 rebounds per game; his team won the Texas State championship and earned a Top 10 national ranking. Young was a high school teammate and friend of Kendrick Perkins. Perkins was a McDonald's All-American in 2003; he was heavily recruited by many colleges from across the United States. University of Memphis coach John Calipari offered scholarships to both Perkins and Young. Both players initially committed to play at Memphis, but Perkins changed his mind and entered the 2003 NBA Draft. When he learned that Perkins would not be playing for his team, Calipari rescinded his scholarship offer to Young. Junior college Left without a Division I scholarship late in the summer, Young ended up playing at South Plains College in Levelland, Texas. During his freshman season (2003‚Äì04), Young averaged 9.9 points and 7.2 rebounds per game. He helped the Texans post a 24-9 record, good for second place in the Western Junior College Athletic Conference. During his freshman season, Young accepted a scholarship offer from Texas Tech coach Bob Knight. However, one of Knight's assistants visited South Plains while Young was in the midst of a slump. A short time after that, Texas Tech called South Plains coach Steve Green, informing him that Young was welcome to walk-on at Texas Tech, but he no longer had a scholarship offer there.Schools' changes of heart offer reminder: Recruits beware - NCAA Division I Mens Basketball - CBSSports.com Live Scores, Standings, Stats Division I career Because of financial concerns, Young decided not to walk-on at Texas Tech. He planned to return to South Plains for his sophomore season, but was surprised to receive a scholarship offer from Steve Cleveland, coach at Brigham Young University. He accepted the offer and joined the Cougars as a sophomore for the 2004-05 season. Young was happy to play at a Division I school, but his first year at BYU was frustrating at times. He started the season as a backup, alternating between small forward and power forward throughout the season. Young struggled to adjust to his role on the team. Towards the end of the season, Young replaced injured Garner Meads as starting power forward. At 6-foot-6 and 215 pounds, Young was undersized at power forward, but he excelled at the position nonetheless. He scored in double figures nine times during the season, finished with an average of 7.2 points per game. He also averaged a team-high 5.6 rebounds per game. Unfortunately, Young broke his shooting hand and missed the last five games of the season. The Cougars finished 2004-05 with a disappointing 9-21 record. Young began his junior year (2005‚Äì06) as BYU's starting power forward. He started the season slowly, but picked up his game as the season wore on. He scored in double figures in 15 of BYU's last 23 games, including his first 20-point game as a Cougar (against San Diego State). BYU improved dramatically as a team, finishing with a 20-9 record and a birth in the National Invitation Tournament. Young was a major reason for the team's improvement. He finished the season with averages of 10.3 points and 5.8 rebounds per game, and his field goal percentage (52.3 percent) ranked fifth in the Mountain West Conference (MWC). For his efforts, he was named Third Team All-MWC and First Team All-Utah by a local newspaper (the Deseret Morning News). However, Young was overshadowed during his junior year by new teammate Trent Plaisted, a 6-foot-11 center who averaged 13.6 points and 6.9 rebounds per game. Plaisted was named MWC Freshman of the Year. In anticipation of the 2006-07 season, Plaisted was anointed BYU's go-to guy, while Young was considered just a solid role player. As the season began, opposing teams focused their defensive efforts on Plaisted. Facing constant double-teams, Plaisted struggled early in the season. However, Young had worked hard during the summer in preparation for his senior season. He developed some strong offensive moves in the low post, and he improved his mid-range jump shot. While Plaisted struggled, Young emerged as BYU's top offensive weapon. He scored in double figures in the first seven games of the season, including 27 points and 11 rebounds in a 73-69 victory over Weber State. The 27 points represented a career high for Young. As the season progressed, Young continued his dominating play. He led the Cougars to a championship in the BYU Holiday Classic in December 2006. He totaled 21 points and a career-high 16 rebounds against Oral Roberts in the semi-final game, then added 26 points and 9 rebounds in BYU's 77-68 win over Seton Hall in the title game. When BYU began conference play, Young elevated his game even higher. He set a new career high with 29 points in 31 minutes against Wyoming. He also added 10 rebounds in BYU's 89-81 victory. Young was spectacular in February. He matched his career high with 29 points in another victory over Wyoming. He scored 25, 23, and 24 points in the next three games, all BYU victories. Young carried the Cougars to their first regular season MWC championship since 2000-01. Opponents took notice of Young's outstanding play. Ray Giacoletti, the coach of rival Utah, commented, \\"You can't guard Keena Young. Nobody can. Nobody has had an answer for Keena Young, anywhere\\".CSTV.com: #1 in College Sports - Men's Basketball However, Young faced constant double-teams and struggled in the first two games of the 2007 MWC Tournament. Fortunately for BYU, Plaisted raised his game and led the Cougars to victory each time. Young returned to form in the title game against UNLV. He set a new career-high with 34 points, including BYU's last 16 points of the game. He also added 9 rebounds, but UNLV ultimately won the game, 78-70.

He is a graduate of Berklee College of Music. In 2005 he won the main prize at the International Jazz Piano Competition in Moscow.[1]  Life and career  Masecki started taking music lessons from his father at age three. He took up piano at seven and quickly began showing talent for improvising as well as interpreting classical music. These have proven to be the two main pillars of his activity. He studied classical piano in the Chopin Secondary School in Warsaw under prof. Ma≈Çgorzata Rawska and jazz piano under Andrzej Jakodzi≈Ñski, graduating in 1998. During his school years he frequented the legendary Wednesday jam sessions at Akwarium Jazz Club.

It is over thick and about long where it impounds the lake.BCGNIS Geographical Name Details The area below and adjacent to The Barrier is considered hazardous due to the unstable lava formation. Formation The Barrier was formed about 9,000 years ago, when large lava flows emanated from Clinker Peak on the west shoulder of Mount Price. The large lava flowed towards the Cheakamus River valley. At the time of eruption, the valley was filled by glacial ice. The lava flow was stopped by the ice and ponded, eventually cooling to form an ice-marginal lava flow. When the ice melted away, the ice-cooled lava-flow front formed a precipitous cliff; water ponded behind the lava dam, forming Garibaldi Lake. Rubble Creek boulder field The unstable lava formation of The Barrier has in the past unleashed several debris flows in the area below Garibaldi Lake. The most recent major landslide in 1855-1856 formed a large boulder field which gives Rubble Creek its name.Catalogue of Canadian volcanoes - Garibaldi volcanic belt Retrieved on 2007-09-07 At least of rock was removed from The Barrier during the 1855-1856 event. Hazards Concerns about The Barrier's instability due to volcanic, tectonic, or heavy rainfall activity prompted the provincial government to declare the area immediately below it unsafe for human habitation in 1981.Fire and Ice: Distinctive landscape features of Garibaldi Provincial Park This led to the evacuation of the small resort village of Garibaldi nearby, and the relocation of residents to new recreational subdivisions away from the hazard zone. Should The Barrier completely collapse, Garibaldi Lake would be entirely released and downstream damage in the Cheakamus and Squamish Rivers would be considerable, including major damage to the town of Squamish and possibly an impact-wave on the waters of Howe Sound that would reach Vancouver Island.

The Beech Ridge Wind Farm in Greenbrier County, West Virginia, is a 100 MW generating facility with 67 GE 1.5 MW wind turbines. The tall wind turbines, are placed along Shellcamp, Smokehouse, Beech, Rockcamp and Big ridges and Cold Knob, Old Field, Blue Knob and Nunly Mountains. It is served by a new , 138 kilovolt power transmission line, located in Greenbrier and Nicholas counties, tied to an electrical substation near Nettie, West Virginia. As of June 2003, plans for expanding the facility with 33 additional units were underway. The wind farm is owned by Beech Ridge Energy, LLC, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Chicago-based Invenergy, LLC. It is being built on land owned by MeadWestvaco. History The project came to public notice throughout West Virginia in November 2005, when its owners filed an application for a site permit with the West Virginia Public Service Commission (PSC). The proposal incited vocal controversy, particularly in Greenbrier County, where supporters touted the project's potential economic benefits, while detractors pointed out its effect on the local viewshed, which was felt might lead to negative consequences for the area's tourism industry, as well as a decrement in the local quality of life. According to viewshed mapping prepared as part of the application, the turbines are visible from parts of Greenbrier, Nicholas and Pocahontas Counties. At least parts of the turbines can be seen from areas within the Monongahela National Forest, Watoga State Park, and the Cranberry Wilderness Areas. Opposition In December 2005, a group called Mountain Communities for Responsible Energy (MCRE) was formed to oppose the development, citing concerns including potential reductions in property values, adverse effects on tourism, bat fatalities, claimed inefficiency of wind energy, tax benefits for wind factories, environmental degradation, and stresses on the local infrastructure. MCRE and several local individuals filed motions to dismiss the application, but the PSC ultimately approved the project in December 2006. MCRE filed for reconsideration, but the PSC denied its motion. Subsequently, MCRE and Jeffery and Alicia Eisenbeiss filed separate appeals of the PSC's denial with the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia. They were heard on January 9, 2008.. On June 23, 2008, the Court ruled in favor of Beech Ridge, indicating that the Public Service Commission had acted appropriately in granting the building permit, thus clearing the way for the development.. The PSC held compliance hearings on October 16 and 17, during which it was announced that Beech Ridge would not build any turbines within one mile of the dwelling of anyone who opposed the project. As a result, financial settlements have been reached with several homeowners, and 5 turbines have been eliminated from the plans, reducing the total number planned to 119. On February 13, 2009, the PSC issued its final order, approving the start of construction. According to a Beech Ridge spokesman, the company planned to begin construction during the Spring of 2009.http://www.istockanalyst.com/article/viewiStockNews+articleid_2716557.htmlhttp://www.register- herald.com/local/local_story_289224608.htmlhttp://www.register- herald.com/archivesearch/local_story_045002600.html The Court's decision to hear the case delayed the construction of the project, which was originally scheduled to begin in late 2007. According to a Beech Ridge spokesperson, \\"...this decision will definitely delay our efforts to finalize our construction plans and contracts and, for the time being, it has put our plans to hire West Virginia construction workers to build the project on hold.\\" The MCRE spokesperson commented, \\"for 30 million years, Cold Knob, Big Ridge, and Big Beech Knob have been some of the signature landmarks of Greenbrier County. If this industrialization of our mountaintops is allowed to go forward, the new landmarks will become turbines A-16, A-17, A-18 and A-19\\" On July 10, 2009, the Animal Welfare Institute and Mountain Communities for Responsible Energy filed a motion for a preliminary injunction against developer Beech Ridge Energy LLC of Rockville, Maryland in U.S. District Court. The plaintiffs claim that ongoing destruction of the endangered Indiana bat's habitat is occurring in violation of the U.S. Endangered Species Act.http://cbs2chicago.com/wireapnewsil/Groups.concerned.about.2.1080576.htmlhttp://www.mountainmessenger.com Construction Construction began in mid-2009 and by early December of that year, road building and site preparation was well advanced, and several turbines had been erected. However, a federal district judge ruled that while Invenergy could complete the construction of the 40 units currently under construction, others could not be built until the company applied for and received a permit to allow incidental kills of Indiana Bats from the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. Further, the company may operate the existing 40 windmills only during winter months, when the bats are hibernating. The Wind Farm operates GE SLE wind turbines.

The regiment was formed in mid-1941 and was intended to be deployed to the Middle East. In late 1941, in response to the growing threat posed by Japan's entry into the war in the Pacific, it was employed in a defensive role to guard against a possible invasion of mainland Australia. It was disbanded in early 1944 without seeing action as part of the reduction of Australia's armoured forces and the reallocation of manpower to other formations more suited to jungle warfare. History The 2/11th Armoured Car Regiment was formed in Cowra, New South Wales, during August 1941 as part of the 1st Armoured Division. Its first commanding officer was Lieutenant Colonel Edward Sheehan. The regiment was gradually brought up to full strength and was expanded to four \\"sabre\\" squadrons following the outbreak of the Pacific War, by which time Lieutenant Colonel Oliver Rennick took command, serving in that position for the remainder of the unit's existence. It had an authorised strength of over 1,000 personnel. On paper, it was allocated 12 scout cars and 58 armoured cars; however, or the first 11 months of its existence the regiment was equipped with a small number of obsolete Australian-built armoured cars which were suitable only for training purposes. In July 1942, these vehicles were replaced with more modern Australian designed vehicles such as the Rover Light Armoured Car and Dingo scout car. Upon formation, the 1st Armoured Division was intended to serve in the Middle East, but following Japan's entry into the war following the attack on Pearl Harbor and the invasion of Malaya in December 1941, it was retained in Australia, as a key part of Australia's defensive plans to resist a potential invasion. The regiment participated in the 1st Armoured Division's large-scale exercises which were held near Narrabri, New South Wales in late 1942, at which time the division reached operational readiness. Following the Allied naval victory during the Battle of the Coral Sea and the successes elsewhere such as at Buna‚ÄìGona, the threat posed by Japanese forces to the Australian mainland decreased, and as a result the need for large armoured formations diminished. By this then, the Australian Army was suffering a manpower shortage, which resulted in a reallocation of resources and the gradual reduction of Australia's armoured units. In October 1942, the regiment was reduced in size when 'D' Squadron was used to form the 2/4th Armoured Regiment in Queensland. In November 1942, the 2/11th Armoured Car Regiment moved to Western Australia (WA) with the 1st Armoured Division departing from Gunnedah and travelling via rail through Adelaide and crossing the Nullarbor Plain. During 1943, the regiment conducted reconnaissance patrols across much of WA. The regiment survived the 1st Armoured Division's disbandment in September 1943 and became part of the 2nd Infantry Division. Although the regiment was re-equipped with Staghound armoured cars in early 1944 it was disbanded in New South Wales in March or April 1944 at which time its personnel were transferred to other units more suitable for jungle warfare.

As of 2018, renewable energy accounted for 79% of the domestically produced electricity used in Brazil.Renewable energy in Brazil Brazil relies on hydroelectricity for 65% of its electricity, and the Brazilian government plans to expand the share of biomass and wind energy (currently 6%) as alternatives. Wind energy has the greatest potential in Brazil during the dry season, so it is considered a hedge against low rainfall and the geographical spread of existing hydroelectric resources. In January 2015, a drought in Brazil that cut water to the country's hydroelectric dams prompted severe energy shortages. This crisis ravaged the country's economy and led to electricity rationing. Brazil held its first wind-only energy auction in 2009, in a move to diversify its energy portfolio. Foreign companies scrambled to take part. The bidding lead to the construction of 2 gigawatts (GW) of wind production with an investment of about $6 billion over the following two years. Brazil's technical potential for wind energy is 143 GW due to the country's blustery kilometres coastline where most projects are based. The Brazilian Wind Energy Association and the government have set a goal of achieving 20 GW of wind energy capacity by 2020 from the current 5 GW (2014). The industry hopes the auction will help kick-start the wind-energy sector, which already accounts for 70% of the total in all of Latin America.Wind power and hydroelectricity in Brazil According to Brazil's Energy Master-plan 2016-2026 (PDE2016-2026), Brazil is expected to install 18,5GW of additional wind power generation, 84% in the North-East and 14% in the South. Brazil started focusing on developing alternative sources of energy, mainly sugarcane ethanol, after the oil shocks in the 1970s. Brazil's large sugarcane farms helped the development. In 1985, 91% of cars produced that year ran on sugarcane ethanol. The success of flexible-fuel vehicles, introduced in 2003, together with the mandatory E25 blend throughout the country, have allowed ethanol fuel consumption in the country to achieve a 50% market share of the gasoline-powered fleet by February 2008.90% of cars produced in Brazil are Flexfuel Electricity= Hydroelectricity  Hydroelectric power plants produce almost 80% of the electrical energy consumed in Brazil. Brazil has the third highest potential for hydroelectricity, following Russia and China.http://thebrazilbusiness.com/article/hydro-electricity-in-brazil = Itaipu power plant = Itaipu hydroelectric power plant in the State of Paran√°. Wenceslau Braz, Minas Gerais. The Itaipu Dam is the world's second largest hydroelectric power station by installed capacity. Built on the Paran√° River dividing Brazil and Paraguay, the dam provides over 75% of Paraguay's electric power needs, and meets more than 20% of Brazil's total electricity demand. The river runs along the border of the two countries, and during the initial diplomatic talks for the dam construction both countries were suffering from droughts. The original goal was therefore to provide better management and utilization of water resources for the irrigation of crops. Argentina was also later incorporated in some of the governmental planning and agreements because it is directly affected, being downstream, by the regulation of the water on the river. If the dam were to completely open the water flow, areas as far south as Buenos Aires could potentially flood. Construction of the dam started in 1975, and the first generator was opened in 1983. It is estimated that 10,000 locals were displaced by the construction of the dam, and around 40,000 people were hired to help with the construction of the project. Many environmental concerns were overlooked when constructing the dam, due to the trade-off considering the production of such a large amount of energy without carbon emissions, and no immediate harmful byproducts, such as with nuclear energy.  Wind power  Windfarm in Os√≥rio, Rio Grande do Sul. the total installed wind power capacity in Brazil was 16.4 GW, with 13.8 GW in the Northeast Region and 2.1 GW in the South Region. Wind is more intense from June to December, coinciding with the months of lower rainfall intensity. This puts the wind as a potential complementary source of energy to hydroelectricity.Wind power in Brazil - G1 News Brazil's first wind energy turbine was installed in Fernando de Noronha Archipelago in 1992. Ten years later the government created the Program for Incentive of Alternative Electric Energy Sources (Proinfa) to encourage the use of other renewable sources, such as wind power, biomass, and small hydro. Since the inception of Proinfa, Brazil's wind energy production has grown from 22 MW in 2003 to 602 MW in 2009, and to over 8,700 MW by 2015. Developing these wind power sources in Brazil is helping the country to meet its strategic objectives of enhancing energy security, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and creating jobs. The potential for this type of power generation in Brazil could reach up to 145,000 MW, according to the 2001 Brazilian Wind Power Potential Report by the Electric Energy Research Centre (Cepel). While the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP15) was taking place in Copenhagen, Brazil's National Electric Energy Agency (ANEEL) held the country's first ever wind-only energy auction. On December 14, 2009, around 1,800 megawatts (MW) were contracted with energy from 71 wind power plants scheduled to be delivered beginning July 1, 2012.  Solar power  according to ONS, total installed capacity of photovoltaic solar was 6.8 GW, with 3.7 GW of distributed solar, 2.0 GW in the Northeast Region, and 1.0 GW in the Southeast Region. Brazil has one of the highest solar incidence in the world.Brazilian Atlas for Solar Energy Resource: SWERA Results The largest solar plants in Brazil consist of Ituverava and the Nova Olinda plants. The Ituverava solar plant produces 254 MW and the Nova Olinda plant produces 292 MW.  Ethanol fuel  Brazil's ethanol program started in 1975, when soaring oil prices put a chokehold on the economy. Sugarcane was an obvious candidate, given Brazil's large amount of arable land and favourable climate.Ethanol in Brazil - USA Today Most cars on the road today in Brazil can run on blends of up to 25% ethanol, and motor vehicle manufacturers already produce vehicles designed to run on much higher ethanol blends. Most car makers in Brazil sell flexible-fuel cars, trucks, and minivans that can use gasoline and ethanol blends ranging from pure gasoline up to 100% ethanol (E100). In 2009, 90% of cars produced that year ran on sugarcane ethanol. Brazil is the second largest producer of ethanol in the world and is the largest exporter of the fuel. In 2008, Brazil produced 454,000 bbl/d of ethanol, up from 365,000 in 2007. All gasoline in Brazil contains ethanol, with blending levels varying from 2025%. Over half of all cars in the country are of the flex-fuel variety, meaning that they can run on 100% ethanol or an ethanol-gasoline mixture. According to ANP, Brazil also produced about 20,000 bbl/d of biodiesel in 2008, and the agency has enacted a 3% blending requirement for domestic diesel sales. The importance of ethanol in Brazil's domestic transportation fuels market is expected to increase in the future. According to Petrobras, ethanol accounts for more than 50% of current light vehicle fuel demand, and the company expects this to increase to over 80% by 2020. Because ethanol production continues to grow faster than domestic demand, Brazil has sought to increase ethanol exports. According to industry sources, Brazil's ethanol exports reached 86,000 bbl/d in 2008, with 13,000 bbl/d going to the United States. Brazil is the largest ethanol exporter in the world, holding over 90% of the global export market.Ethanol fuel in Brazil  Biomass  Sugarcane plantation in Avar√© (State of S√£o Paulo). Cane remains are used to produce biomass energy. Eucalyptus in the State of Esp√≠rito Santo. Remains of the tree are reused for biomass power generation. Biomass is a clean energy source used in Brazil. It reduces environmental pollution as it uses organic garbage, agricultural remains, wood shaving or vegetable oil. Refuse cane, with its high energetic value, has been used to produce electricity.Biomass in Brazil More than 1 million people in the country work in the production of biomass, and this energy represents 27% of Brazil's energetic matrix.Facts of Brazil's Biomass The recent interest in converting biomass to electricity comes not only from its potential as a low- cost, indigenous supply of power, but for its potential environmental and developmental benefits. For example, biomass may be a globally important mitigation option to reduce the rate of CO2 buildup by sequestering carbon and by displacing fossil fuels. Renewably grown biomass contributes only a very small amount of carbon to the atmosphere. Locally, plantations can lessen soil erosion, provide a means to restore degraded lands, offset emissions and local impacts from fossil-fired power generation, and, perhaps, reduce demands on existing forests. In addition to the direct power and environmental benefits, biomass energy systems offer numerous other benefits, especially for developing countries such as Brazil. Some of these benefits include the employment of underutilized labour and the production of co- and by-products, for example, fuelwood. Nearly all of the experiences with biomass for power generation are based on the use of waste and residue fuels (primarily wood/wood wastes and agricultural residues). The production of electric power from plantation-grown wood is an emerging technology with considerable promise. However, actual commercial use of plantation-grown fuels for power generation is limited to a few isolated instances. Wood from plantations is not an inexpensive energy feedstock, and as long as worldwide prices of coal, oil and gas are relatively low, the establishment of plantations dedicated to supplying electric power or other higher forms of energy will occur only where financial subsidies or incentives exist or where other sources of energy are not available. Where biomass plantations are supplying energy on a commercial basis in Brazil, the Philippines and Sweden, it can be shown that a combination of government policies or high conventional energy prices have stimulated the use of short-rotation plantations for energy. Brazil used tax incentives beginning in the mid-1960s to initiate a reforestation program to provide for industrial wood energy and wood product needs. As a consequence of the Brazilian Forestry Code with its favourable tax incentives, the planted forest area in Brazil increased from 470,000hectares to 6.5 millionhectares by 1993. With the discontinuation of the tax incentives in 1988, plantation establishment in Brazil has slowed, although the commercial feasibility of using eucalyptus for energy and other products has been clearly demonstrated.Bioenergy - Biomass in Brazil  See also  * Solar power in Brazil * Energy policy of Brazil * Nuclear power in Brazil * Electricity sector in Brazil  References  ","title":"Renewable energy in Brazil"},{"id":"10826863","text":"Angelle Marie Tymon (born April 4, 1983, from Lutcher, Louisiana) is an American broadcast journalist and game show host.

As a player, he appeared in the Football League for both of Bristol's professional clubs during a career curtailed by injury. As manager, he took brief charge of Third Division club Hereford United and Heart of Midlothian of the Scottish Premier Division. Career Ford started his professional career with Bristol City in 1961, having joined the club as an apprentice. Predominantly a right back he made 171 league appearances for the first team and scored 10 goals. He moved across the River Avon to Bristol Rovers in 1969, for a fee of ¬£4,000, and was appointed captain, but was forced to retire because of injury in 1971, having appeared only 28 times in the league for Rovers. He was awarded a benefit match in July of that year, a game between the two Bristol teams which Rovers won 3‚Äì1 at Ashton Gate. He subsequently moved into coaching, his first appointment being with Plymouth Argyle. In 1973, Ford moved to Hereford United as assistant to former Bristol City coach John Sillett, newly appointed as manager, whom Ford knew from his playing days. Sillett left Edgar Street in 1978 and Ford was appointed caretaker manager. Unable to stop their relegation, he was not offered the position permanently. Ford's next port of call was Heart of Midlothian, where he became Bobby Moncur's assistant. Moncur resigned in 1981 when Wallace Mercer gained executive control of the Edinburgh side and Ford was appointed manager when Mercer failed to convince either Jock Wallace, then at Leicester City, or Dundee United's Jim McLean to move to Tynecastle. Again though Ford's managerial tenure was to be brief and he was dismissed in December 1981, his five months in charge including defeats to minnows such as East Stirlingshire. Ford's son Mike played in the Football League for Cardiff City and Oxford United. He has two other children, Daren and Louise (twins), and 8 grandchildren.

Taylor (November 19, 1923 ‚Äì October 14, 2015) was a philosopher best known for his work in the field of environmental ethics. His theory of biocentric egalitarianism, related to but not identical with deep ecology, was expounded in his 1986 book Respect for Nature: A Theory of Environmental Ethics, and is regularly taught in university courses on environmental ethics. Taylor's Respect for Nature is widely considered one of the fullest and most sophisticated defenses of a life-centered (biocentric) approach to nature. In that work, Taylor agrees with biocentrists that all living things, both plants and animals, have inherent value and deserve moral concern and consideration. More radically, he denies human superiority and argues that all living things have equal inherent value and moral worth. Recognizing that human interests inevitably conflict with the interests of plants and animals, Taylor carefully lays out and defends a variety of priority principles for the fair resolution of such conflicts. Taylor taught philosophy for four decades at Brooklyn College, City University of New York and was professor emeritus there at the time of his death.

Career summary Gibbs graduated from the United States Military Academy in the class of 1846, served and was twice wounded in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War and was wounded again by Apaches during frontier service in 1857. His pre-Civil War career was in cavalry service. During the Civil War, Gibbs commanded the only Union army volunteer regiment which was converted from an infantry regiment entirely to a cavalry regiment: The 130th New York Infantry converted to the 1st Regiment New York Dragoons.http://dmna.ny.gov/historic/reghist/civil/cavalry/1stDrag/1stDragMain.htm New York State Military Museum and Veterans Research Center After the conversion of Gibbs's regiment to cavalry service in August 1863, he was frequently assigned to command a cavalry brigade and briefly to command a cavalry division. He only was appointed to brigadier general of volunteers to rank from the date of the Battle of Cedar Creek, October 19, 1864, and given permanent brigade command in December 1864. He received three brevet general awards for meritorious service in three key battles, Trevilian Station, Opequon or Third Winchester and Five Forks. As commander of an infantry regiment, Gibbs participated in the successful defense of Suffolk, Virginia and Norfolk, Virginia, in April and early May, 1863 when Confederate forces under Lt. Gen. James Longstreet tried to retake those key locations. He led his brigade or his regiment in major battles of the Overland Campaign and Maj. Gen. Philip Sheridan's raid which led to the Battle of Yellow Tavern. His brigade and division were detached from the Army of the Potomac soon after the beginning of the Siege of Petersburg in order to serve with Sheridan in all the battles of the Shenandoah Valley Campaigns of 1864. He and his brigade returned to Petersburg with Sheridan on March 26, 1865, and played a large part in the key battles of Dinwiddie Court House and Five Forks, which led to the breaking of the Confederate lines and the flight of the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia under the command of General Robert E. Lee from Petersburg and Richmond, Virginia. His brigade and division, under the command of Brig. Gen. Thomas C. Devin and the overall command of Maj. Gen. Sheridan joined in the pursuit of the Army of Northern Virginia in the ensuing Appomattox Campaign, and were engaged especially at the key Battle of Sayler's Creek (sometimes shown as \\"Sailor's Creek\\"). Gibbs was present at the surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia at Appomattox Court House on April 9, 1865. Gibbs remained in the Regular Army as a major in the 7th U.S. Cavalry after the war. Gibbs served as Post Commander of Fort Harker, Ks on four different occasions from January 1867 to December 1868. His previous service apparently had taken a toll on him because he died of \\"congestion of the brain\\" on December 26, 1868, aged 45. Early life Gibbs was born on his father's estate, now within Astoria, Long Island, New York. He was the son of mineralogist Colonel George Gibbs and grandson of Oliver Wolcott Jr., Secretary of the Treasury in the administrations of Presidents George Washington and John Adams His older brothers were George Gibbs and Oliver Wolcott Gibbs. Gibbs attended school in White Plains, New York and Dartmouth College before he was appointed to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. He graduated from West Point forty-second of fifty-nine in the class of 1846. Only one reference cited below was found to mention Gibbs marrying or having children.His obituary in the New York Times for December 28, 1868, does not mention any family.

The Gibbs Family of Rhode Island and Other Related Families, New York, Priv. print., 1933. Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War; Frontier service After Gibbs graduated from the U. S. Military Academy in 1846, he was assigned to the Regiment of Mounted Rifles and served in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War in which he was wounded. He was awarded the ranks of brevet first lieutenant and brevet captain for gallantry. In 1847 he served with the Army of Occupation in Mexico City and became an original member of the Aztec Club of 1847. After the war ended, he served as aide-de-camp to Brigadier General Persifor F. Smith until 1856. From 1856 through the beginning of the American Civil War, Gibbs was on frontier duty with his troop of Mounted Rifles. He was wounded in a skirmish with Apaches at Cooke's Spring, New Mexico, in March 1857. American Civil War=Mesilla, San Agustin Springs At the start of the Civil War, Gibbs was first lieutenant of the Regiment of Mounted Rifles of the U.S. Army (Regular Army).Sifakis, Stewart. Who Was Who in the Civil War. New York: Facts On File, 1988. . p. 246 Gibbs was taken prisoner after leading ten men (all that remained of his I Company R.M.R.)driving a herd of one hundred cattle from Fort Craig. Stopped to water the herd at San Agustin Springs, New MexicoSometimes this location is spelled San Augustin. He and his soldiers were included with the Union forces surrendered by Major Isaac Lynde (7th U.S. Infantry) to Confederate forces from Texas under the command of Lieutenant Colonel John R. Baylor during the retreat of United States Army forces loyal to the Union from Fort Fillmore, New Mexico. Gibbs was paroled but not exchanged until August 7, 1862. In the meantime, on August 3, 1861, he was promoted to captain of the 3rd United States Cavalry Regiment. Gibbs was in command at Fort Wayne in Detroit, Michigan, between December 1861 and August 1862 while serving his parole. Soon after his exchange, on September 6, 1862, Gibbs was commissioned as colonel of the 130th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment. The regiment had been organized at Portage, New York, in August 1862.Bowen, 1900. p. 8 Suffolk, Peninsula, Bristoe, Mine Run Gibbs's regiment was sent from Portage to Suffolk, Virginia and arrived on September 13, 1862.Bowen, 1900, p. 14 Their position at Suffolk was located 18 miles southwest of Norfolk, Virginia, recently recaptured by Union forces, at the junction of two railroads.Bowen, 1900, p. 15 The location covered the land access to Norfolk and access to the seaboard by water. Gibbs joined the regiment soon after their arrival at Suffolk.Bowen, 1900, p. 21 The department was commanded by Maj. Gen. John A. Dix from Fort Monroe and the forces in the Suffolk area were commanded by Maj. Gen. John J. Peck.Bowen, 1900, p. 27 After building fortifications, training and marching out from Suffolk on several expeditions, the regiment engaged in the Battle of Deserted House or Battle of Kelly's Store on January 30, 1863.Bowen, 1900, pp. 58-68 General Michael Corcoran was in command of the force of about 8,000 men and three artillery batteries totaling 14 guns, with Colonel Gibbs in command of nine infantry regiments and Colonel Samuel P. Spear in command of the 11th Pennsylvania Cavalry.Bowen, 1900, p. 59 During a three-hour artillery duel, the 130th New York Infantry lost 7 men killed, 20 wounded and 2 missing.Bowen, 1900, p. 62 General Corcoran quarreled with Colonel Gibbs over the disposition of troops and placed him under arrest. Gibbs was soon proved correct, however, when Corcoran's own brigade broke and ran under heavy artillery fire. While Corcoran left the field to try to reorganize his brigade, three regiments decided to charge the Confederates on their own initiative. Though under arrest and without a horse or gun, Gibbs grabbed a flag and led the charge. The 130th New York Infantry was pushing the Confederates back through the adjacent woods when Corcoran reappeared and halted the advance.Bowen, 1900, p. 63 The battle ended with the Confederates under Brig. Gen. Roger Pryor driven from the field.Bowen, 1900, p. 64 The Confederates under Lt. Gen. James Longstreet attempted to recapture Suffolk and Norfolk but after besieging the fortified Union forces from April 11, 1863, to May 3, 1863, the Confederates retired.Bowen, 1900, p. 69-78 Brig. Gen. Henry Dwight Terry now commanded the brigade and on April 17, 1863, he sent 6 companies of the 130th New York Infantry out to determine why the Confederates had ceased firing.Bowen, 1900, pp. 72-75 When the Confederates resumed fire, the regiment lost one killed and five wounded.Bowen, 1900, p. 75 The Confederates broke off the siege on May 3, 1863.Bowen, 1900, p. 78 The brigade took part in Maj. Gen. Erasmus Keyes's abortive Peninsular Campaign toward Richmond between June 13, 1863, and July 12, 1863, while the Army of Northern Virginia was engaged in the Gettysburg Campaign. On August 11, 1863,Bowen, 1900, p. 89 says the order to convert the regiment to cavalry was dated July 28, 1863, and Maj. Gen. George Meade ordered the regiment to report to Manassas on August 2, 1863. Bowen also states that the 130th New York Infantry was the only Union regiment completely converted to cavalry. this regiment was reorganized as a mounted troop named the 1st New York Dragoons, also known as and quite often referred to in reports and sources as the 19th New York Volunteer Cavalry Regiment. The regiment trained at Manassas and guarded the line of the Orange and Alexandria Railroad until November 1863. The regiment also participated in the Bristoe Campaign in September 1863 through November 1863. The Official Records of the Union ArmyU.S. War Dept. The war of the rebellion: a compilation of the official records of the Union and Confederate Armies, Series I, Volume XXIX, Part 2, 1890, p. 128 show an order of battle for August 31, 1863, in which the 19th New York Volunteer Cavalry Regiment was assigned to the Headquarters of the Cavalry Corps of the Army of the Potomac, Maj. Gen. Alfred Pleasonton, commanding. Later the regiment was part of the Cavalry Reserve Brigade, Army of the Potomac (\\"Reserve Brigade\\") commanded by Brig. Gen. Wesley Merritt when it was not under Gibbs's command.Bowen, 1900, p. 104 The 19th New York Volunteer Cavalry Regiment, the 6th Pennsylvania Cavalry Regiment and the 1st, 2nd, 5th and 6th U.S. Cavalry Regiments comprised the brigade, which was occasionally called the \\"Regular Brigade.\\" On and after August 12, 1863, Gibbs was intermittently assigned to temporary brigade, and briefly to division, command in the cavalry corps of the Army of the Potomac and the Army of the Shenandoah through the rest of the war.Boatner, Mark Mayo, III. The Civil War Dictionary. New York: McKay, 1988. . First published 1959 by McKay, p. 341 Gibbs assumed command of the Reserve Brigade, guarding trains between August 12, 1863, and September 12, 1863, and, after Merritt was in command during the Bristoe Campaign, Gibbs resumed command of the brigade between November 21, 1863, and April 10, 1864. Bowen, one of Gibbs's men, states that Gibbs was in command of the brigade when the regiment became engaged at the Battle of Manassas Junction during the Bristoe Campaign on October 17, 1863.Bowen, 1900, p. 102 The regiment suffered 3 killed, 3 wounded, 1 captured and several injuries from falling horses. The brigade guarded a supply train during the Mine Run Campaign in December 1863. After much picket duty, scouting and guarding trains, the regiment went into winter quarters at Mitchell's Station, Virginia, on December 27, 1863.Bowen, 1900, p. 105 Overland Campaign; Trevilian Station As preparations began for the Overland Campaign, the Reserve Brigade became part of the 1st Division of the Cavalry Corps of the Army of the Potomac under the new corps commander, Maj. Gen. Philip Sheridan, who was appointed April 4, 1864.Bowen, 1900, p. 136 Command of the Reserve Brigade was transferred to Brig. Gen. Wesley Merritt from April 10, 1864, through the Battle of the Wilderness, May 5-6, 1864 and Gibbs resumed command of the 19th New York Cavalry (1st New York Dragoons).Bowen, 1900, p. 139 gives the date as April 13, 1864.Sifakis, 1988, p. 446 Then, on May 7, 1864, Merritt had to take command of the 1st Division of the Cavalry Corps to which the Reserve Brigade was assigned because its commander, Brig. Gen. Alfred T. A. Torbert needed an emergency operation to remove a painful abscess from his spine.Rhea, Gordon C. The Battle of the Wilderness, May 5-6, 1864. Baton Rouge, Louisiana State University Press, 2004. (pbk.). Hardcover ed., 1994 Gibbs again assumed command of the Reserve Brigade, which saw much hard duty at the Battle of Todd's Tavern. At these battles, Merritt led the First Division of the Cavalry Corps and Gibbs was in command of the Reserve Brigade (which was the third brigade of three in the division). As the Battle of the Wilderness wound down, the commander of the Army of Northern Virginia, General Robert E. Lee, anticipated Union Army General-in-Chief, Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant's move to the south and west. Lee sent cavalry to block the roads in the direction of Spotsylvania Court House, Virginia, near Todd's Tavern, about a mile from the edge of the Wilderness battlefield.Longacre, Edward G. Lincoln's Cavalrymen: A History of the Mounted Forces of the Army of the Potomac. Mechanicsburg, PA: Stackpole Books, 2000. . p. 259 Todd's Tavern and the Brock Road, which had been abandoned on May 6, had to be retaken by Union forces on May 7. The fight at and near the tavern became the largest dismounted cavalry fight during the war. The 1st and 2nd brigades of the Army of the Potomac's 1st Cavalry Division drove the Confederate forces of Brig. Gen. John Gregg to the south across the Po River (Virginia) and the forces of Maj. Gen. Fitzhugh Lee back to Todd's Tavern.Longacre, 2000. p. 260 In the afternoon, Sheridan committed the Reserve Brigade, then under Gibbs, to the battle. Gibbs ordered the 6th Pennsylvania Cavalry to probe Fitzhugh Lee's line and to dismount and the other regiments to dismount and drive the Confederates back. By dark, Lee's men had been pushed so far south that the Brock Road was open to immediate use by Grant and Meade. Gibbs's brigade lost the majority of the 154 Union casualties. Most of them were in his own regiment, which suffered more than 80 casualties, the most casualties of any mounted Union regiment in a single engagement.Bowen, 1900, p. 143 After the Confederate infantry beat the Union infantry to Spotsylvania Court House, Sheridan was permitted to conduct a raid in the direction of Richmond in order to draw off the Confederate cavalry and to proceed against them.Longacre, 2000, p. 263 Confederate Cavalry Corps commander, Maj. Gen. J.E.B. Stuart learned of Sheridan's departure within hours and pursued his more than 10,000 Union cavalrymen with fewer than 5,000 troopers so as to leave General Robert E. Lee with cavalry support.Longacre, 2000, p. 264 On May 11, 1864, Stuart caught up to Sheridan at the Yellow Tavern, six miles north of Richmond and brought on a general engagement.Longacre, 2000, p. 266 Colonel Thomas C. Devin's brigade, assisted by Gibbs's brigade, held the Brook Turnpike while other units, including George Armstrong Custer's brigade fought with Stuart's forces. Stuart was mortally wounded by one of Custer's men, according to Longacre, and died the next day.Longacre, 2000, p. 267; Bowen, 1900, pp. 161-162 says that Shedrick L. Pealer of the 19th New York Cavalry, who was killed at Cold Harbor on May 31, 1864, fired the shot that killed Maj. Gen. Stuart. On May 24, 1864, Sheridan's force returned to the Army of the Potomac and just before the Battle of Cold Harbor, May 26-June 3, 1864, Torbert returned to command of the division, Merritt to command of the Reserve Brigade and Gibbs to command of the 19th New York Volunteer Cavalry Regiment.Rhea, Gordon C. Cold Harbor, Grant and Lee, May 26-June 3, 1864. Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 2007. (pbk.) Hardcover edition, 2002. They engaged in bloody preliminary battles at the Battle of Haw's Shop and the Battle of Old Church or the Battle of Matadequin Creek.Bowen, 1900, pp. 169-180 Then, they took Confederate positions at Cold Harbor, held them against a counterattack and turned them over to the infantry on June 1, 1964.Bowen, 1900, pp. 172-180 Gibbs and his regiment fought with distinction under Maj. Gen. Sheridan at the Battle of Trevilian Station, June 11-12, 1864, part of a diversionary operation by Sheridan against the Virginia Central Railroad during Union Lt. Gen. Grant's stealthy transfer of his forces from the lines after the Battle of Cold Harbor to the south side of the James River in an effort to take Petersburg and Richmond while they were only lightly defended.Boatner, 1988 ed., p. 848 Torbert and Merritt remained in command of the 1st Division and the Reserve Brigade, respectively, during Sheridan's Trevilian Raid.Wittenberg, Eric J. Glory Enough for All: Sheridan's Second Raid and the Battle of Trevilian Station. 2007. (pbk.) p. 332. Hardcover edition 2001 The Battle of Trevilian Station was the largest all-cavalry battle of the Civil War and it resulted in a victory by Confederate cavalry under the command of Maj. Gen. Wade Hampton.Wittenberg, 2007, p. xvii Confederate forces counterattacked the Reserve Brigade early on June 11, 1864, after elements of that brigade attacked advance Confederate pickets.Wittenberg, 2007, pp. 71-76 Gibbs quickly mounted his men who left their breakfast unfinished and sent them into battle.Wittenberg, 2007, p. 77 The Confederates killed and wounded several Union troopers and took several others prisoner, including Lieutenant Colonel Thorp of the 19th New York Cavalry (1st New York Dragoons). Later, Merritt's brigade had to cut their way through Confederate resistance to free Custer's brigade, which had become surrounded.Wittenberg, 2007, p. 136 Although the Reserve Brigade cut through to Custer, Custer lost 22 per cent of his men on that day, most of them missing or captured.Wittenberg, 2007, p. 303 After eight hours of fighting on a hot day without food or drink, Gibbs was overcome by sunstroke and had to leave the field.Wittenberg, 2007, p. 138 The Union forces sustained heavy losses again on June 12, 1864, and were turned back without achieving their objectives of doing significant damage to the Virginia Central Railroad and linking up with Union Maj. Gen. David Hunter and returning with his force to the Army of the Potomac.Wittenberg, 2007, pp. 304-305 After a period of rest, the brigade took part in the Battle of Darbytown Road on July 27-28, 1864 when it was attacked while dismounted by three brigades of Confederate infantry.Bowen, 1900, pp. 202-203 Then they marched to the Petersburg lines in time to witness the Battle of the Crater. Shenandoah Valley Gibbs's brigade was transferred to the Shenandoah Valley for service under Sheridan from August 6, 1864. He was with Sheridan in all the battles of the Shenandoah Valley Campaigns of 1864 from that date. Gibbs commanded the Reserve Brigade between August 6, 1864, and September 8, 1864, his regiment between September 9, 1864, and December 8, 1864, while it was with the Second Brigade, the Reserve Brigade between December 13, 1864, and December 30, 1864, the division between December 30, 1864, and January 15, 1864, the brigade between January 15, 1865, and January 18, 1865, and after a short leave of absence between January 19, 1865, and February 5, 1865, the division between February 5, 1865, and February 10, 1865, and the brigade between February 10, 1865, and March 25, 1865.Cullum gives the information about the first division command and the leave of absence. Other sources do not specifically account for these periods of time. Cullum (1891) states that Gibbs took a short leave of absence after his promotion to brigadier general, which appears to account for his time between January 19, 1865, and February 5, 1865. Gibbs was promoted to brigadier general of U.S. Volunteers as of the date of the 1864 Valley Campaign's decisive Battle of Cedar Creek, Virginia, October 19, 1864, but this promotion did not take effect until December 8, 1864, after it had been confirmed and communicated. Gibbs resigned as colonel of the 19th New York Cavalry on December 8, 1864, when his promotion to brigadier general came through.Bowen, 1900, p. 371 On August 11, 1864, the 19th New York Cavalry met an entire division of Confederate Lt. Gen. Jubal Early's force under Maj. Gen. John B. Gordon at the Battle of Newtown.Bowen, 1900, pp. 210-211 The depleted regiment, armed with 7-shot Spencer repeating rifles, held off the Confederates until they could be reinforced by the rest of the brigade.Bowen, 1900, p. 211 They suffered 29 killed and seriously wounded and several felled by sunstroke. On August 13, 1864, Confederate guerrilla forces under Col. John S. Mosby destroyed 75 of the brigade's wagons and captured 200 prisoners, including a few of the men of the 19th New York Cavalry.Bowen, 1900, p. 213 At the Battle of Shepherdstown, near Leetown and Kearneysville, on August 24, 1864,This should not be confused with the 1862 Battle of Shepherdstown. Custer came to the rescue of the surprised and nearly surrounded 19th New York Cavalry (1st New York Dragoons) much as he had been aided by their brigade at Trevilian Station. The brigade and Custer's brigade fought two more sharp engagements at Smithtown on August 28-29, 1864.Bowen, 1900, pp. 219-223 On September 9, 1864, the 19th New York Cavalry was transfer to the second brigade of Brig. Gen. Thomas C. Devin. The volunteers welcomed this move because the soldiers of the Regular regiments had fled from the field on more than one occasion and always seemed to get undeserved credit for actions won or carried by the volunteers, as Bowen and other writers from the volunteer ranks such as Capt. R. A. Britton, who is quoted by Bowen, observed.Bowen, 1900, p. 212 On September 19, 1864, Sheridan's forces attacked Early's forces at the Battle of Opequon or Third Battle of Winchester.Bowen, 1900, p. 227 The 19th New York Cavalry struck the Confederate outposts on the Opequon Creek at Sewer's Ford, about seven miles northeast of Winchester, Virginia.Bowen, 1900, p. 229 Captain Alexander K. Thorp, brother of the regiment's Lt. Col. Thomas Thorp, who had been taken prisoner at Trevilian Station, was killed near the beginning of this battle. At a key point in the battle, Devin sent his entire division charging into the Confederate infantry's line of battle inflicting a great number of casualties, including the taking of many prisoners.Bowen, 1900, p. 232 Devin wrote that Gibbs led his regiment in gallant style. The cavalry charges sent the remaining Confederate infantry fleeing from the field.Bowen, 1900, p. 233 After his promotion to brigadier general in December 1864, Gibbs took command of the Reserve Brigade, which became the Third Brigade of the 1st Division of the Cavalry Corps of the Army of the Shenandoah, under Brig. Gen. Wesley Merritt until Merritt's promotion to Sheridan's chief of staff in February 1865. The division then was under the command of Brig. Gen. Thomas Devin. Gibbs led the brigade on Sheridan's raid against the Virginia Central Railroad, the Richmond and Danville Railroad and the James River Canal between February 27, 1865, and March 20, 1865, including the actions against the North Anna and South Anna bridges on March 14-15, 1865. Petersburg; Appomattox Gibbs commanded the brigade after the division's reassignment to the Cavalry Corps of the Army of the Potomac between March 25, 1865, and May 25, 1865. Gibbs's brigade returned to the Siege of Petersburg with Sheridan on March 26, 1865.Burr, 1890, p. 263 The brigade included the First, Fifth and Sixth United States Cavalry Regiments, the Second Massachusetts Volunteer Cavalry Regiment and the 6th Pennsylvania Volunteer Cavalry Regiment (6 companies). On March 31, 1865, Lt. Gen. Grant placed General Sheridan in command of Gouverneur Warren's V Corps of Army of the Potomac infantry and of all cavalry.Burr, 1890, p. 273 The two divisions of cavalry from the Army of the Shenandoah in the cavalry corps were under the command of Brig. Gen. Wesley Merritt.Burr, 1890, p. 283. Gibbs headed the 3rd Brigade of the 1st Division under the command of Brig. Gen. Thomas Devin. The 3rd Division of this corps was under the command of Brig. Gen. George Custer. The 2nd Division, from the Army of the Potomac, was under the command of Maj. Gen. George Crook. Two cavalry brigades from the cavalry division of the Army of the James under the command of Brig. Gen. Ranald S. Mackenzie also were under Sheridan's overall command. Merritt's cavalry, including Devin's division which included Gibbs's brigade, played a significant part in the Union Army's near surrounding of the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia and stretching their lines to the breaking point in the last days of the Siege of Petersburg. The brigade fought in the Battle of Dinwiddie Court House on March 29, 1865, and in the action that forced the Confederates to abandon their Petersburg and Richmond, Virginia, defenses at the Battle of Five Forks on April 1, 1865. At the Battle of Dinwiddie Court House, the brigades of Gibbs and John Irvin Gregg were held in reserve until 4:00 when they fought a two-hour action to hold back Confederate Maj. Gen. George E. Pickett's advance toward Dinwiddie Court House. They then rallied with Custer's brigade about three-quarters of a mile from Dinwiddie. Pickett could not achieve a breakthrough before nightfall halted the battle. Both armies concentrated on defenses on March 31. Early on April 1, Pickett learned that Union infantry reinforcements were coming up, so he withdrew his forces northward to Five Forks, which Lee had ordered him to hold at all costs. Devin's cavalry, including Gibbs's brigade, hit the front of Pickett's defense on April 1, 1864, while Brig. Gen. Romeyn B. Ayres infantry division of V Corps hit the left flank and Brig. Gen. Custer's cavalry brigade attacked the right flank.Wilson, 2008, pp. 182-188 The attack led to the collapse of Pickett's position and required the Confederates to abandon Petersburg and Richmond. Additional infantry corps and accompanying cavalry were placed under Sheridan's command during the Appomattox Campaign.Burr, 1890, pp. 283-284 Gibbs's brigade fought at the Battle of Sayler's Creek, Virginia, on April 6, 1865, three days before the surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia by General Robert E. Lee at Appomattox Court House, Virginia, on April 9, 1865, where Gibbs was present. Devin's 1st Cavalry Division was the third division after Maj. Gen. Meade and his headquarters staff and General Merritt and his headquarters staff to march in the grand review in Washington on May 23, 1865. Gibbs's brigade marched first in the division. Only the volunteer regiments marched in the review with Gibbs. The 5th U.S. Cavalry Regiment marched as Maj. Gen. Merritt's headquarters escort. Gibb's old regiment, the 19th New York Cavalry (1st New York Dragoons) marched with the next brigade under their final brigade commander, Col. C. L. Fitzhugh. Brevet awards; Post-war service; Death Gibbs commanded the 1st Brigade Cavalry Forces, Military Division of the Gulf, between August 20, 1865, and October 17, 1865, and the 1st Division between October 17, 1865, and December 15, 1865. He was mustered out of the volunteer service on February 1, 1866, and became major of the 7th United States Cavalry Regiment. On January 13, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated Gibbs for the award of the honorary rank of brevet major general, United States Volunteers, to rank from March 13, 1865, and the U.S. Senate confirmed the award on March 12, 1866. On July 17, 1866, President Johnson nominated Gibbs for the award of the honorary rank of brevet major general, United States Army (Regular Army), to rank from March 13, 1865, and the U.S. Senate confirmed the award on July 23, 1866. Gibbs received his brevet awards for service at the Battle of Trevilian Station, the Third Battle of Winchester and the Battle of Five Forks. Gibbs remained in the regular army following the war. After a leave of absence between January 15, 1866, and April 30, 1866, and recruiting service between April 30, 1866, and September 30, 1866, he served in various forts around Kansas, being transferred 9 times in 14 months. General Gibbs died while on active duty as a major in the 7th U.S. Cavalry at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, of \\"congestion of the brain\\" on December 26, 1868. Alfred Gibbs is buried in Saint Mary's Episcopal Churchyard in Portsmouth, Rhode Island. Family Gibbs' son, Acting Assistant Surgeon John Blair Gibbs, USN (b. 1858), was killed in action at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba on June 12, 1898. He was one of the few U.S. Navy officers to die during the Spanish- American War. There is a monument to him, along with five Marines who died with him, at McCalla Hill at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Station. He was buried near to his father. Another son, Alfred W. Gibbs was a noted mechanical engineer.

It is one of the cleanest, greenest and quietest residential areas in New Delhi, making it an excellent living area, and the last attribute 'Quietest', makes this Colony an outstanding place for the children and students. To whom it may concern, quiet neighborhoods aren't always good neighborhood, often it is the opposite.

Education Lodhi Colony has many centres nearby, for higher education, such as the All India Management Association (AIMA) institute, the Alliance Fran√ßaise de Delhi and even an south-campus Delhi University college, the Dyal Singh College. Comparatively low amount of vehicular traffic except on the main colony road (Bhishma Pitamahah Marg) makes the colony a pedestrian/walker's heaven. There are also a couple of private schools in like Kendriya Vidyalaya Pragati Vihar, Air Force Bal Bharati School and The Banyan Tree School besides various government schools are also there. Visitor's attractions There are several places to visit in the vicinity such as the Sai Baba Temple of Lodhi Road, Ram Mandir at Bhishmah Pitamahah Marg India Habitat Centre, Najaf Khan's Tomb and Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium. Lodhi Garden is also very near and is probably one of the best gardens in New Delhi for morning walkers and joggers. The four main shopping markets in this area are Jorbagh Market, Khanna Market and Meherchand Market and Main Market. Chocolate Wheel Confectionery in the Jor Bagh area is a very popular bakery. Rajiv Gandhi used to buy cakes from here. Over 14 artists across the globe came ahead and painted walls of Lodhi Colony making it an India's first Open-air art district.  Opening of Indira Paryavaran Bhawan  Due to the inauguration of the Paryavaran Bhawan, there has been a dramatic sudden rise in the traffic in Lodhi Colony. At peak times the traffic is so much that the cars had to be parked inside the residential parks of Lodhi Colony. The traffic is worsening day by day.

The university has 185 professors, 640 additional academic staff and more than 7,000 students, of which 2,350 are of foreign origin from more than 100 nations.  History  The university was a school for construction engineering in the former GDR starting in 1954. After German reunification, the school became a Technical University and was later renamed \\"Brandenburg Technical University\\" in 1994. In the following years, the university underwent major construction efforts and the number of students continued to grow. In February 2013 the Landtag of Brandenburg decided to merge the BTU and the Hochschule Lausitz on July 1, 2013 to found the new university Brandenburgische Technische Universit√§t Cottbus-Senftenberg (abbreviated BTU).Gesetz zur Neustrukturierung der Hochschulregion Lausitz, Landtag Brandenburg (in German) Today, the university has 7,280 students, 2,190 of whom come from abroad.  Structure  The university is separated into six faculties (Fakult√§ten) each of them having a focus on certain study and research areas. Each faculty is further subdivided into institutes (Institute). The following faculties exist: * Faculty 1: Mathematics, Computer Science, Physics, Electrical Engineering and Information Technology * Faculty 2: Environment and Natural Sciences * Faculty 3: Mechanical Engineering, Electrical and Energy Systems * Faculty 4: Social Work, Health Care and Music * Faculty 5: Business, Law and Social Sciences * Faculty 6: Architecture, Civil Engineering and Urban Planning  Library  The modern university library The new library was opened in the year 2004 and is called Informations-, Kommunikations- und Medienzentrum (IKMZ). It was designed by the famous architects Herzog & de Meuron.  Study = Academic year  The central forum of BTU Like for most universities in Germany, the academic year at BTU is divided into two semesters. The winter term (Wintersemester) is the official beginning of the academic year and lasts from October 1 to March 31. The summer term (Sommersemester) lasts from April 1 to September 30. The teaching takes place in only 15 weeks per semester and is followed by an examination period (Pr√ºfungszeitraum) where usually no lectures are held.  Tuition and Fees  All students, regardless if German or non-German, need to pay a fee of 280.73 Euro per semester. The fee includes a student transit pass (Semesterticket) which allows the students to travel with all public transportation services in the states Berlin and Brandenburg for free. Free use of regional express train(RE 18) to Dresden-Neustadt is also included. There is no further fee collected as the parliament of the federal-state Brandenburg decided not to introduce further study fees (Studiengeb√ºhr)  International Partnerships  The BTU has a worldwide network of partner universities and allows students to take part in European Erasmus Programme or overseas programmes such as STUDEXA or GE4. Students who want to participate in an exchange programme do not need to pay the tuition fee of the hosting university.  Student Life  The BTU has several facilities for the students comfortableness and facilitation, including but not limited to Cafeteria, restaurant, football yard, carrier center, etc.  References  External links  * Category:Buildings and structures in Cottbus Category:Educational institutions established in 1991 Category:1991 establishments in Germany Category:Universities and colleges formed by merger in Germany Category:Universities and colleges in Brandenburg ","title":"Brandenburg University of Technology"},{"id":"10827266","text":"The Albanian Kingdom (Gheg Albanian: Mbretnija Shqiptare, Standard Albanian: Mbret√´ria Shqiptare) was the official name of Albania between 1928 and 1939. Albania was declared a monarchy by the Constituent Assembly, and President Ahmet Bej Zogu was declared King Zog I. The kingdom was supported by the fascist regime in Italy, and the two countries maintained close relations until Italy's sudden invasion of the country in 1939. Zog fled into exile and never saw his country again. The Communist Party of Labor of Albania gained control of the country toward the end of World War II, established a communist government, and formally deposed Zog. Zog's kingdom In 1928, Zogu secured the parliament's consent to its own dissolution. A new constituent assembly amended the constitution making Albania a kingdom and transforming Zogu into Zog I, \\"King of the Albanians\\". International recognition arrived forthwith. The new constitution abolished the Albanian Senate creating a unicameral Assembly. Although nominally a constitutional monarch, in practice King Zog retained the dictatorial powers he had held as President Zogu. Civil liberties remained more or less nonexistent, and political opponents were frequently imprisoned and killed. Thus, for all intents and purposes Albania remained a military dictatorship. Soon after his coronation, Zog broke off his engagement to Shefqet V√´rlaci's daughter, and Verlaci withdrew his support for the king and began plotting against him. Zog had accumulated a great number of enemies over the years, and the Albanian tradition of blood vengeance required them to try to kill him. Zog surrounded himself with guards and rarely appeared in public. The king's loyalists disarmed all of Albania's tribes except for his own Mati tribesmen and their allies, the Dibra. Nevertheless, on a visit to Vienna in 1931, Zog and his bodyguards fought a gun battle with would-be assassins on the Opera House steps (see ). Zog remained sensitive to steadily mounting disillusion with Italy's domination of Albania. The Albanian army, though always 15,600 strong, sapped the country's funds, and the Italians' monopoly on training the armed forces rankled public opinion. As a counterweight, Zog kept British officers in the Royal Albanian Gendarmerie despite strong Italian pressure to remove them. In 1931 Zog openly stood up to the Italians, refusing to renew the 1926 First Treaty of Tirana. During the crisis of 1929‚Äì1933, Zog asked the Italians for a loan of 100 million gold francs in 1931, and the request was approved by the Italian government. In 1932 and 1933, Albania could not make the interest payments on its loans from the Society for the Economic Development of Albania. In response, Rome turned up the pressure, demanding that Tirana name Italians to direct the Gendarmerie, join Italy in a customs union, grant Italy control of the country's sugar, telegraph, and electrical monopolies, teach the Italian language in all Albanian schools, and admit Italian colonists. Zog refused. Instead, he ordered the national budget slashed by 30 percent, dismissed the Italian military advisers, and nationalized Italian-run Roman Catholic schools in the northern part of the country. By June 1934, Albania had signed trade agreements with the Kingdom of Yugoslavia and Greece, and Benito Mussolini had suspended all payments to Tirana. An Italian attempt to intimidate the Albanians by sending a fleet of warships to Albania failed because the Albanians only allowed the forces to land unarmed. Mussolini then attempted to buy off the Albanians. In 1935 he presented the Albanian government 3 million gold francs as a gift. Zog's success in defeating two local rebellions convinced Mussolini that the Italians had to reach a new agreement with the Albanian king. Relations with Italy were improved in 1936. A government of young men led by Mehdi Frash√´ri, an enlightened Bektashi administrator, won a commitment from Italy to fulfill financial promises that Mussolini had made to Albania, and to grant new loans for harbor improvements at Durr√´s and other projects that kept the Albanian government afloat. Soon Italians began taking positions in Albania's civil service, and Italian settlers were allowed into the country. Economy The eleven-year rule of King Zog I is noted for a great wave of modernization of the country, which had suffered five centuries of harsh Turkish rule. To fulfill the modernization of a backward country, a great amount of money was needed. The money was obtained from Italian loans of 1.837 billion Italian Liras. In 1928, the Basic Statute was adopted, along with a Civil Code and agrarian reform was instituted, removing ferexhes√´. The Islamic law was replaced by the Swiss Civil Code, following the model of Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk in Turkey. King Zog supported the introduction of modern architecture, and sought to improve welfare, the balance of trade, and the education of Albanian youth. In 1929, the world was caught by a major crisis caused by overproduction. Its effects were very damaging to Albania. During this year, Zog saw the first signs of the crisis, mainly in the financial and monetary system; they became more sensitive in 1930. The peak of the crisis was between 1934 and 1935. Most industries were paralyzed or went bankrupt. The crisis deeply affected all credit systems. At this time, due to the ongoing budget deficit, and financial difficulties evident in many areas and sectors of the country, loans were taken from Western countries, but the majority were from Italy. In 1931, Albanian agriculture was affected by a major drought which caused serious consequences in the national food supply. In 1932, as a result of this situation, 33% more wheat and corn was imported. Zog of Albania The crisis of 1930‚Äì1934 differs in many ways: the percentage of the population living with non-agricultural employment was reduced from 15.9% in 1930 to 15.4% in 1938. Albanian exports grew from 2 million gold francs to 12 million between 1923 and 1931, but fell back to 1923 levels within the next two years. A difficult situation occurred between 1935 and 1936 when the government was forced to distribute emergency food aid in poor areas. Places that sold Albanian goods placed tariffs on imports of cheese and butter. The crisis affected the livestock industry, which accounted for 70% of total national exports. Another significant impact was the establishment of the so-called \\"tax xhelepit\\", which applied to head/livestock. In 1933, the state cut the taxes by 50%. Peasant farmers accounted for the vast majority of the Albanian population. Albania had practically no industry, and the country's potential for hydroelectric power was virtually untapped. Oil was the country's main extractable resource. The Italians took over the oil- drilling concessions of all other foreign companies in 1939 by creating the company \\"Sveja\\". A pipeline between the Ku√ßov√´ oil field and Vlor√´'s port expedited shipments of crude petroleum to Italy's refineries. This company dealt with Albania's natural resources. Albania also possessed: bitumen, lignite, iron, chromite, copper, bauxite, manganese, and some gold. Shkod√´r had a cement factory; Kor√ß√´, a brewery; and Durr√´s and Shkod√´r, cigarette factories that used locally grown tobacco. In 1934, the price of the grain reached the lowest level, at about 7.5 gold francs. A strong decline in prices, mainly in the agricultural and livestock industry, affected the monetary and credit policies of the National Commercial Bank. During the years of the crisis, the bank reduced the amount of currency in circulation, which worsened the deflation. The artificially increased value of the franc lowered the prices of products. In mid-1935, Albania entered a recovery phase. Industry recovered, and Zogu created tax incentives, especially for cement factories, which were made exempt from taxes for three years. Between 1933 and 1935, economic development emerged in the agriculture, livestock and industrial capital industries. Construction of roads and bridges began, along with fifty-three telegraph post links. During much of the interwar period, Italians held most of the technical jobs in the Albanian economy. Albania had four ports: Durr√´s, Sh√´ngjin, Vlor√´, and Sarand√´. Albania's main exports were petroleum, animal skins, cheese, livestock, and eggs. Primary imports were grain and other foodstuffs, metal products, and machinery. In 1939, the value of Albania's imports was four times that of its exports. About seventy percent of Albania's exports went to Italy. Italian factories furnished about forty percent of Albania's imports, and the Italian government paid for the rest. In 1938 there was a general activation of the national capital in industry. During this period the number of enterprises reached 244, while the number of employees at State administration rose up to 7.435. Industrial production rose, while agriculture declined. In 1938, the total area of agricultural land estimated at , about 39.5% of the occupied state and private property, while smallholders owned 60%. Cereal production in Albania did not meet its needs. Wheat production was estimated at about 38,000 tons, while production of maize was 143,000 tons. After the crisis, the production of industrial crops rose. Tobacco accounted for about . Cereal crops were also grown. Framers planted about 1.2 million roots for cereal crops, 100,000 citrus roots, 41.5 million vineyard roots, and 1.6 million olive trees roots. During the period between 1936‚Äì1938 the economy recovered. Trade amounted to 32.7 million gold francs, with 65% growth. Exports grew by 61.5% and imports by 67.3%. Exports in 1938 represented 66.3% of the 1928 level. During the 1936‚Äì1938 period the state budget had increased. The Albanian kingdom period was characterized by the growing number of utility works; in 1939 there were thirty-six enterprises in the construction industry. During this eleven-year period serious efforts were made to create a national road network using an investment of sixty million gold francs borrowed from the Italian Kingdom. During the ten-year period between 1929‚Äì1939 850 km of main roads, 456 km of secondary roads, 4,062 small bridges 10,250 miles long, and seventy-six major bridges 2,050 miles in length were constructed. This period also introduced the construction of a sewage network, and, for the first time, money was invested to build segments of roads in the northern part of Albania. The most important roads were: Shkod√´r- Puka, Mat-Bishop Bridge, Kruj√´-Mat, Tirana-Elbasan, Lushnj√´-Mbrostar, Kor√ß√´- Burrel, Burrel-Dib√´r, Tiran√´-Shijak-Durr√´s, Tiran√´-Ndroq-Durr√´s, and Tiran√´- Krrab√´-Elbasan. Engineers from Europe were employed to complete these projects. In 1938, the value of investments reached 150 million Albanian Lek (1961 currency prices). On the eve of the fascist invasion, Albania had 300 trucks, 20 buses, and 200 cars and pickups. During 1938, 95,000 tons of cargo were transported, equal to 1 million tons per kilometer. During the same period, the total turnover of goods in retail trade amounted to 3,900 million in 1947 prices. On 28 November 1938, Radio Tirana, the national radio station began broadcasting. Construction of the port of Durr√´s began. The construction of brace works, irrigation canals, etc., was interrupted by the beginning of World War II (1939‚Äì1945).  Military  163x163pxThe Royal Albanian Army was the army of the Albanian Kingdom and King Zogu from 1928 until 1939. Its commander-in-chief was King Zog; its commander was General Xhemal Aranitasi; its Chief of Staff was General Gustav von Myrdacz. The army was financed mainly by Italy during period between 1936‚Äì1939. The army had 15,600 deployed personnel and 29,860 reserve personnel. Social conditions Poor and remote, Albania remained decades behind the other Balkan countries in educational and social development. Only some 13% of the population lived in towns. Illiteracy plagued almost the entire population. About 90% of the country's peasants practiced subsistence agriculture, using ancient methods and tools, such as wooden plows. Much of the country's richest farmland lay under water in malaria-infested coastal marshlands. Albania lacked a banking system, a railroad, a modern port, an efficient military, a university, or a modern printing press. The Albanians had Europe's highest birthrate and infant mortality rate, and life expectancy for men was about thirty-eight years. The American Red Cross opened schools and hospitals at Durr√´s and Tirana, and one Red Cross worker founded an Albanian chapter of the Boy Scouts that all boys between twelve and eighteen years old were subsequently required to join by law. Although hundreds of schools opened across the country, in 1938 only 36% of all Albanian children of school age were receiving education of any kind. During the reign of Zog primary education became necessary. Despite meager educational opportunities, literature flourished in Albania between the two world wars. Substantial progress had been achieved in literature, and art publishing operations. Distinguished writers included: Fan Stilian Noli, Alexander Drenova, Esad Mekuli, Ndre Mjeda, Haki Stermilli, Lasgush Poradeci, Faik Konica, Sterjo Spasse, Ndoc Nikaj, Foqion Postoli, Migjeni and others. A Franciscan priest and poet, Gjergj Fishta, dominated the literary scene with his poems about the Albanians' perseverance during their quest for freedom. During this period 600 night schools were opened in an attempt to eradicate illiteracy, but in 1939 80% of the adult population was still illiterate. In 1939 Albania had 643 primary schools and 18 high schools. The most important high schools were: Pedagogical school of Elbasan, Lyceum of Kor√ß√´, Shkod√´r Gymnasium, and the Trade school of Vlor√´ with an enrollment of 5,700 pupils. Those who wanted to continue their education often went abroad to Italy, Austria, France etc... In 1939 about 420 Albanians were studying abroad. Among the literate population 446 people had a university degree and 1,773 had secondary schooling. Daily newspapers started publishing, including: Demokracia, Liria Komb√´tare, Besa, Hylli i Drit√´s, and Leka along with a large number of pedagogical and scientific publications. Organizations such as Gruaja Shqiptare attempted to modernize Albanian society and in 1938 the first national Radio station went on-air. These were the first steps toward modernization of the country, but Albania remained Europe's most backward nation in many respects. The lack of economic development prompted several strikes. In 1936, Albanian workers working for foreign companies in the Ku√ßov√´ Oil field held a strike that was organized by Puna. Another was held in Vlor√´ and in February 1936 a strike was held by workers and craftsmen in Kor√ß√´ which grew into a demonstration that was known as the \\"Hunger Strike\\". Migjeni's works describe the poverty and the social situation of that period. In 1929 a communist society was established but was not supported by Orthodox, Catholic or the Islamic because of its atheistic ideology. Religion Originally, under the monarchy, religious institutions were put under state control. In 1923, the Albanian Muslim congress convened at Tirana and decided to break with the Caliphate establishing a new form of prayer (standing, instead of the traditional salah ritual), banishing polygamy, and doing away with the mandatory use of veil (hijab) by women in public, which had been forced on the urban population by the Ottomans during the occupation. In 1929 the Albanian Orthodox Church was declared autocephalous (self-headed). A year later, in 1930, the first official religious census was carried out. Reiterating conventional Ottoman data from a century earlier which previously covered double the new state's territory and population, 50% of the population was grouped as Sunni Muslim, 20% as Orthodox Christian, 20% as Bektashi Muslim. and 10% as Catholic Christian. The monarchy was determined that religion should no longer be a foreign-oriented master dividing Albanians, but a nationalized servant uniting them. It was at this time that newspaper editorials began to disparage the almost universal adoption of Muslim and Christian names, suggesting instead that children be given neutral Albanian names. Official slogans began to appear everywhere. \\"Religion separates, patriotism unites.\\" \\"We are no longer Muslim, Orthodox, Catholic, we are all Albanians.\\" \\"Our religion is Albanism.\\" The national hymn characterized neither Muhammad nor Jesus Christ, but King Zogu as \\"Shp√´timtari i Atdheut\\" (Savior of the Fatherland). The hymn to the flag honored the soldier dying for his country as a \\"Saint\\". Increasingly the mosque and the church were expected to function as servants of the state, the patriotic clergy of all faiths preaching the gospel of Albanism. Monarchy stipulated that the state should be neutral, with no official religion and that the free exercise of religion should be extended to all faiths. Neither in government nor in the school system should favor be shown to any one faith over another. Albanism was substituted for religion, and officials and schoolteachers were called \\"apostles\\" and \\"missionaries.\\" Albania's sacred symbols were no longer the cross and the crescent, but the Flag and the King. Hymns idealizing the nation, Skanderbeg, war heroes, the king and the flag predominated in public- school music classes to the exclusion of virtually every other theme. The first reading lesson in elementary schools introduced a patriotic catechism beginning with this sentence, \\"I am an Albanian. My country is Albania.\\" Then there follows in poetic form, \\"But man himself, what does he love in life?\\" \\"He loves his country.\\" \\"Where does he live with hope? Where does he want to die?\\" \\"In his country.\\" \\"Where may he be happy, and live with honor?\\" \\"In Albania.\\" Italian occupation As Germany annexed Austria and moved against Czechoslovakia, Italy saw itself becoming a second-rate member of the Axis. The imminent birth of an Albanian royal child meanwhile threatened to give Zog a lasting dynasty. After Hitler invaded Czechoslovakia (March 15, 1939) without notifying Mussolini in advance, the Italian dictator decided to proceed with his own annexation of Albania. Italy's King Victor Emmanuel III criticized the plan to take Albania as an unnecessary risk. Rome, however, delivered Tirana an ultimatum on March 25, 1939, demanding that it accede to Italy's occupation of Albania. Zog refused to accept money in exchange for countenancing a full Italian takeover and colonization of Albania, and on April 7, 1939, Mussolini's troops invaded Albania. Despite some stubborn resistance, especially at Durr√´s, the Italians made short work of the Albanians. Unwilling to become an Italian puppet, King Zog, his wife, Queen Geraldine Apponyi, and their infant son Leka fled to Greece and eventually to London. On April 12, the Albanian parliament voted to unite the country with Italy. Victor Emmanuel III took the Albanian crown, and the Italians set up a fascist government under Shefqet Verlaci and soon absorbed Albania's military and diplomatic service into Italy's. After the German army defeated Poland, Denmark, and France, a still-jealous Mussolini decided to use Albania as a springboard to invade Greece. The Italians launched their attack on October 28, 1940, and at a meeting of the two fascist dictators in Florence, Mussolini stunned Hitler with his announcement of the Italian invasion. Mussolini counted on a quick victory, but Greek resistance fighters halted the Italian army in its tracks and soon advanced into Albania. The Greeks took Kor√ß√´ and Gjirokast√´r and threatened to drive the Italians from the port city of Vlor√´. The presence of the Greek troops fighting in Albania cooled the Albanians' enthusiasm for fighting the Italians and the Greeks, and Mussolini's forces soon established a stable front in central Albania. In April 1941, Germany and its allies crushed both Greece and Yugoslavia, and a month later the Axis gave Albania control of Kosovo. Thus Albanian nationalists ironically witnessed the realization of their dreams of uniting most of the Albanian-populated lands during the Axis occupation of their country. Legacy Zog, King of the Albanians was still the legitimate monarch of the country, but he would not get the throne back. The communist partisans during and after the war, backed by Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union, suppressed the Albanian nationalist movements and installed a Stalinist regime that would last for about 46 years. King Zog was banned from entering Albania by the communists and lived in exile for the rest of his life.

Copycat effect The copycat effect is the alleged tendency of sensational publicity about violent murders or suicides to result in more of the same through imitation.Loren Coleman, (2004) The copycat effect: How the media and popular culture trigger the mayhem in tomorrow's headlines, Simon & Schuster, NY. The term was first coined around 1916 due to the crimes that were inspired by Jack the Ripper. Due to the increase of replicated crimes, criminologists soon began to believe that media coverage played a role in inspiring other criminals to commit crimes in a similar fashion, and even for non-criminals to begin committing crimes when they otherwise might not have done so. There is also a book written by Loren Coleman called The Copycat Effect that describes the effect that the media has on crimes and suicides, which are inspired by crimes that have been widely covered across the media. Coleman's view on the media is that the constant coverage of these events, rather than the events with a positive message, gives these criminals a type of fame. The five minutes of fame, book or movie that is dedicated to these criminals provokes individuals with a tendency to behave in a similar way. Due to this type of fame, the \\"copycat effect\\" takes place. The US documentary television series CopyCat Killers investigates murders which appear to be based on Hollywood films.  Examples  Various criminal acts have been inspired by many television shows, movies, books as well as other criminals. A list of a few crimes that have been a result of the copycat effect are: Television seriesBreaking Bad= The television show Breaking Bad has been suspected of inspiring a number of crimes. The series depicts a high school chemistry teacher with cancer who begins making and selling drugs to obtain money for his costly medical treatment. A few crimes include the following: *In Kansas City, Missouri, police found in 2010 the dealing of blue coloured methamphetamine that seemed to be inspired by Walter White's meth. *A 27-year-old man, Jason Hart, was found guilty of strangling his girlfriend to death, and then used sulfuric acid in a plastic tub to dispose of the body. The incident had many similarities to various scenes in Breaking Bad, where White and Jesse Pinkman dispose of bodies in a similar fashion. It was later found out that he had been a fan of Breaking Bad. *In Alabama, a 55-year-old drug dealer was going by the name of \\"Walter White\\". *Stephen W. Doran, a teacher, and a former member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives from 1981 to 1995, was arrested in 2013 for methamphetamine trafficking when police found $10,000 in cash, as well as equipment. He appeared in court with a clean-shaven head, and it was later found that he had been battling with cancer. He had been inspired by the television show to take things into his own hands and earn cash so he could receive the surgery/therapy he needed.  Films  *Scream: A 24-year-old young man, Thierry Jaradin, stabbed a young girl, Alisson Cambier, 30 times; similar to the way the victim was stabbed in the movie. He had been wearing the Ghostface costume, and later confessed that he had planned the murder in a similar way to the movie. *Fight Club: There have been many incidents inspired by the movie. One of the incidents occurred in 2009 during the Memorial Day weekend in New York City. Bombs were set off in various locations supposedly representing their oppression. Kyle Shaw was found guilty, and was himself a member of the local fight club. *Saw: In Salt Lake City two teenage boys were turned in after they had been overheard that they were planning on kidnapping, torturing and murdering people. The boys had been planning on teaching a few people, who had been harming others, a lesson. They had also set up cameras around so they could record their killings. In Tennessee, two girls were charged with phone harassment after they had left a 52-year-old woman a voicemail (similar to the ones in the movie) stating that they had her friend and were about to release a toxic gas. The voicemail stated that the woman could either risk her life to save her friend, or let her friend die. *The Dark Knight has inspired many copycat crimes. In 2012, a mass shooting in a movie theatre filled with Batman fans occurred, wherein the perpetrator, when arrested, claimed he was 'the Joker'. In 2010, a Wisconsin man assaulted his cousin and girlfriend, dressed as the Joker, when he found them sleeping together. In 2009, a young girl attacked her teacher with a razor blade. Her face had been painted in a similar way to the Joker. * Several movies, including Basic Instinct, American Psycho, Casablanca and Catch Me If You Can, inspired Luka Magnotta to commit the 2012 murder of Concordia University student Jun Lin. Magnotta recorded the murder of the student whom he had recently met on Craigslist, and also posted the video online. On the video, you can hear New Order's \\"True Faith\\" playing in the background, which can also be heard in American Psycho. Jun Lin was stabbed multiple times while being tied up on bed, in the same way that Johnny Boz was tied up on Basic Instinct's main character Catherine's bed. The item Magnotta used to murder Jun Lin was a screwdriver, which was painted white to make it look like the ice pick Catherine used to kill Johnny Boz. Above the bed, Magnotta carefully hung a poster of the movie Casablanca, which he threw away after the murder. After the murder, Magnotta fled to Paris (which is also an important location in Casablanca), claiming that an individual named Manny forced him first to kill cats and then Jun Lin; Manny was the name of Catherine's fianc√© in Basic Instinct. In 2014 Magnotta was captured in Berlin and flown back to Canada. While in Europe, Magnotta changed his name to K. (Kirk) Trammel, which is another reference to Basic Instinct's main character Catherine Trammel. On the footage of the interrogation, Magnotta sits cross- legged while smoking a cigarette to complete his homage to Basic Instinct. Around 2010, when Magnotta first started uploading videos online of him killing kittens, he used different aliases and accounts. On one account, he posted the movie Catch Me If You Can, in which Leonardo DiCaprio is on the run from the FBI.  Fictional examples  Fictional series can reference the concept of copycat crimes. *Friday the 13th Part V: A New Beginning: Roy Burns uses the evidences of the main antagonist of most of the films Jason Voorhees to become a spree killer just like Jason himself as well as the latter's mother Pamela from the original film to kill everyone at Pinehurst which housed patients with all many kinds of disorders after he was devastated from seeing his son Joey killed by an annoyed Vic. *Quick Change: After Bill Murray's character robs a bank while wearing a clown costume, a policewoman (Davinia McFadden) reports that \\"two liquor stores and a laundromat were hit by copycat clowns\\" several hours after Murray and his accomplices escaped. *Detention: Sander committed serial killings in Grizzly Lake inspired by a horror movie Cinderhella and was disguised as such idol character, which brought the manager to confine the group of pupils who searched for him before being killed by Sander himself. Sander was actually killed when he grabbed Riley Jones while the company managed to lure him into the time machine after revealing his identity to them. *Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number: In this game, the characters \\"The Fans\\" are inspired by Jacket's killing sprees from the first game and become spree killers just like Jacket. They have many phones set up, but don't realize that the Russian mafia boss, the one in charge of the phone calls, was killed by Jacket in the first game. Because of this, they find out about odd jobs from friends and the news before ultimately dying to the son of the Russian mafia boss.  Criminals  *Zodiac Killer: In the late 1960s near San Francisco an unidentified man murdered at least five victims and wounded two more, also sending taunting letters and codes to the media. Twenty years later Eddie Seda attacked victims in a similar manner in New York City, killing his victims with a homemade gun. He left similar notes at the scene of the crime, as well as sent cryptic letters to the police. Unlike the Zodiac Killer, he was eventually caught because of the fingerprints that he had left behind on the notes. *Jack the Ripper: Derek Brown, 48, was found guilty of killing two young women in a similar way as the Ripper. He had targeted the two women, one a prostitute and the other a street vendor, because he believed that the two would not have been noticed missing. The two bodies were never found, but it is said that he may have dismembered the women in his bathtub and later disposed of the bodies. *Murder-suicide: Murder- suicides have inspired many notable mass shootings, in which the killer goes on a shooting rampage before shooting himself. There have been a wide range of similar cases that include many school shootings, work rampages etc. Most of these incidents happen in a particular time and area where incidents like these are common. *Chicago Tylenol murders: In 1982, seven people had died after taking the over-the-counter Tylenol after it had been laced with cyanide. Deaths in a similar fashion occurred a few years later. A woman was found dead after she had taken two Tylenol pills which had also been laced with cyanide. In another case, a woman was found guilty of tampering with Excedrin, which caused the death of two individuals, as well as her husband. *Richard Ramirez: In 1991, serial killer Jack Unterweger came to LA and stayed in exactly the same room that Richard Ramirez had been in at the Cecil Hotel while he murdered three street workers. During his trial, it was speculated that Jack committed these homicides as a homage to the Night Stalker. *Dunblane massacre: On March 13, 1996, Thomas Hamilton, 43, killed 16 children and one teacher at Dunblane Primary School before committing suicide. On April 28 of that same year, Martin Bryant committed another mass shooting at Port Arthur in Tasmania, killing 35 people and injuring 23 before his arrest. According to his lawyer, Bryant was motivated in large part by media coverage of the Dunblane shooting, particularly the attention given to the perpetrator. *The Columbine High School massacre has inspired numerous copycat crimes. *Vladimir Ionesyan: Between 2014 and 2015, Anushervon Rakhmanov murdered seven people in Moscow, Russia in a manner resembling Ionesyan's. He would even use the same method as the former to enter the chosen victim's premises: by presenting himself as an employee of Mosgaz who was sent to check the pipes.  Causes It has been shown that most of the people who mimic crimes seen in the media (especially news and violent movies) have in most cases prior criminal records, prior severe mental health problems or histories of violence suggesting that the effect of the media is indirect (more affecting criminal behaviour) rather than direct (directly affecting the number of criminals). However that indirect influence that the media has on the individual does give them the idea of how to commit the crime. The type of reaction that the media coverage gives crimes can determine the path another criminal might take. This is because most copycat criminals are intent on the shock value of their actions. They want to do something that will cause a high media coverage because of the attention that they will get, as well as the horror of the population. If going on a shooting rampage in a public space causes this attention (because of previous incidents), then an individual with the tendency to commit the crime will more likely take that path. The norms, heroes, anti-heroes and the spectacles of the time and place also influence how a crime is committed. In today's society, dressing up as one's favorite villain, and going to a public place armed is what some criminals do, or sometimes they even replicate their favorite movie or TV show scene, whereas in the Middle Ages, the crimes would be associated with the devil, snakes, or witches. But in both scenarios, it is the public interest that sparks what crime might be committed. Some researchers hold the view that an individual's interaction between violent media content and emotional development play a role in copycat behaviors. Individuals who are less emotionally developed will more likely commit the crimes that they see on TV. Characteristics such as demographic (age and sex), criminal factors (mental/personality disorders, failure in human bonding/lack of identity, social isolation and alienation) and relationship to Media (trust in media, Media literacy, identification with the perpetrators seen in media,) mixed with media characteristics and cultural-environment factors influences the copycat behavior in individuals. Media characteristics include the blur between fantasy and reality, positive response to violence and crime and how the crime is being committed. Cultural- environmental factors include the cultural view of fame and crime, reliance to the media for information and moral panics. Most offenders to likely be influenced by these characteristics are usually under the age of 25. However, these claims are an object of an ongoing debate in research on the effects of violence in mass media. Prevention American cryptozoologist Loren Coleman and author Zeynep Tufekci have suggested that copycat crimes can be prevented through a number of means, including the use of carefully selected, non- sensationalistic language on the part of law enforcement and the media when communicating news of crimes to the public; avoiding the release of both details on the methods of crimes and the name of suspects; avoiding the perpetuation of cliches and stereotypes about criminals and the causes of their behavior; emphasis on the effect of the crimes on the victims and their loved ones; and including protective factors like helplines when publishing stories on such crimes.

A sequel series, titled simply as Tough was introduced in 2004 which continues the story further after the first series ended its run. A spin-off series, Oton, was serialized in Business Jump in 2004. A third series, Ry≈´ wo Tsugu Otoko, starring one of illegitimate children of Kiryu Miyazawa, has been serialized in Shueisha's Weekly Playboy since December 21, 2015. An third-episode anime OVA series was released in 2002. In North America, Central Park Media licensed the OVA in 2004. Viz Media released six volumes of the first part of the manga in 2005.  Plot  The story revolves around Kiichi Miyazawa, a 17-year-old teenage high school student and his father, Seiko Miyazawa, who is training him in the family's secret martial art, Nadashinkage-ryu, a fighting style that was created around the end of the Meiji Era Japan. The style itself uses punches, kicks, throws, grappling, as well as knowledge of striking pressure points and vital points on the human body. With a passion for martial arts, Kiibo is striving to become strong by testing his skills against various fighters from different areas of Japan, as well as the world, via street fights and tournaments. In the second part of the story, The story starts two years later after the end of high school iron fist legend, the main protagonist Kiichi Miyazawa ‚ÄúKiibo‚Äù, became the heir of his family's martial art Nadashinkage-ryu after the previous one his father Seiko Miyazawa suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of his evil twin brother and Kiichi's uncle Kiryu. In order to pay for hospital bills Kiichi has turned to fighting in illegal underground matches called dark fights in which almost anything is allowed. Kiichi has become a mainstay in these fights, not only because of his outstanding victories but that he refuses to seriously injure any of his opponents, upholding his father's teachings of never killing anyone. During one particular match in which Kiichi was on the verge of losing, his uncle appeared only to see the progress of his nephew's training and to tempt him into using a killing technique on his adversary. Refusing to give into such treachery Kiichi manages to score a win, it was during this fight that we are revealed that Kiichi mistakenly killed an opponent during a mixed martial arts tournament using a technique that Kiryu taught him. That and the fact that he crippled his father are the main reasons that Kiichi must defeat his uncle. At the end of Kiichi's last match a secret sect of monks called the Hagyu have sent one of their own students to end the Nadashinkage style and its current practitioners, Suzuki ‚ÄúThe Wind‚Äù Minoru is the one chosen to defeat Kiichi. Elsewhere several benefactors have formed into starting another MMA tournament called the Hyper Battle, which is held once a year in order to find the world's strongest fighter, a title which is held by one called the Battle King. Kiichi at first seems uninterested but later relents and starts training in order to participate, after challenging students at a karate dojo he comes face to face with the one sent to eliminate him ‚ÄúThe Wind‚Äù Minoru. After testing their abilities Minoru starts to respect him and asks Kiichi to take him to meet his father. It is here that we are shown the consequences of losing to Kiryu. Seiko Miyazawa ‚ÄúThe Quiet Tiger‚Äù is shown in a childlike state, barely able to feed himself and at times necessitating the use of a wheelchair, he is suffering from apraxia. Wanting to help the man who once defeated the Hagyu, The Wind starts treating him himself with knowledge of acupuncture and pressure point massage, in the past Seiko was challenged by the Hagyu school but made the fight look like it ended in a draw in order to make the school not look bad, Minoru was one of the few to take notice.

Kiichi during the extent of 24 hours battles many opponents in order to guarantee a spot in the Hyper Battle, becoming a finalist. Meanwhile, Seiko is shown training once again but he seems to be wracked with feelings of revenge and anger towards Kiryu for what he did to him, and vows to get even with him. After being discharged from the hospital he goes to the apparent resting place of his oldest brother Son-O Miyazawa, who was thought to have been killed by Kiryu many years before and ends up being abducted by a mysterious group of individuals. Afterwards Kiichi travels to New York City where the Hyper Battle will be held. After meeting up with an old friend he goes to Madison Square Garden where the competition will take place, he encounters many fighters among them Minoru, Kiryu who will do an exhibition fight, his father Seiko who was training with a group called ‚ÄúTeam D‚Äù and the Japanese Brazilian fighter Mauricio ‚ÄúJet‚Äù Naito who is also a deaf mute.

Kiichi use of the tiger's paw strike to defeat his adopted father Seiko only raises further questions about who his biological father might be.

He served as a chancellor during the reigns of the emperors Gaozu and Taizong in the early Tang dynasty.  Background  Xiao Yu was born in 574, during the reign of his father Emperor Ming of Western Liang, who claimed the throne of Liang Dynasty but whose territory, known in history as the Western Liang, was limited to a small amount of territory around his capital Jiangling. Emperor Ming was at that time also a vassal of the much larger Northern Zhou, and received protection from Northern Zhou forces against rival Chen Dynasty. In 582, Xiao Yu was created the Prince of Xin'an. He was known for his filial piety. During the Sui Dynasty=During Emperor Wen's reign In or around 582, Xiao Yu's older sister married Yang Guang the Prince of Jin, a son of Sui's founder Emperor Wen of Sui, to be his princess. Xiao Yu followed her to the Sui capital Chang'an, and he became known for studiousness and proper actions there. He was particularly attentive in studying Buddhist sutras and became a devout Buddhist, spending much of his time discussing Buddhism with monks. Displeased with the work Essay on Predestination (ËæØÂëΩË´ñ, Bianming Lun), authored by the Liang Dynasty author Liu Xiaobiao (), he wrote a work entitled, Essay on Non-Predestination (ÈùûËæØÂëΩË´ñ, Fei Bianming Lun) intended to refute it. (Only the first paragraph of the preface survives, and it states, \\"Man is born from heaven and earth. Of course predestination is involved. However, good fortune and ill fortune also depend on man himself. If one believes that it is all predestination, he would be foolish.\\") The work was praised by the scholars on Yang Guang's staff. In 585, Emperor Ming died and was succeeded by his oldest son and Xiao Yu's older brother Xiao Cong (as Emperor Jing). In 587, when Emperor Wen summoned Emperor Jing to Chang'an to meet him, Xiao Yu's uncle Xiao Yan () and brother Xiao Huan (), believing that a Sui army sent to Jiangling was intending to attack it, surrendered to Chen. When Emperor Wen heard of this, he abolished Western Liang and annexed its territory, creating Emperor Jing the Duke of Ju. Western Liang was at its end, although its imperial clan members, including Xiao Yu, continued to be treated well by Emperor Wen. In 600, after Yang Guang displaced his older brother Yang Yong as crown prince, Xiao Yu continued to serve on Yang Guang's staff, as a guard commander. During Emperor Yang's reign In 604, Emperor Wen died‚Äîa death that traditional historians generally believed to be a murder ordered by Yang Guang but admitted a lack of direct evidence‚Äîand was succeeded by Yang Guang (as Emperor Yang). Xiao Yu, whose sister Crown Princess Xiao became empress, was made a military recruiting officer. When, at one point, Xiao Yu became suddenly ill, he ordered that no medical treatment be carried out, believing that this would be a good time for him to be relieved from governmental service. However, when Empress Xiao heard this, she visited him and rebuked him, pointing out that this kind of behavior might in fact bring punishment from Emperor Yang. After he recovered, he became more interested in governmental service, and was at one point made the Neishi Shilang (), the assistant head of the legislative bureau of government, and Emperor Yang entrusted him with many secret matters, as Xiao Yu was his brother-in-law. However, later on he was demoted because he often gave suggestions that offended Emperor Yang. In the fall of 615, Emperor Yang conducted a tour of the northern frontier, exposing himself to a surprise attack by Eastern Turkish (Dongtujue) forces under Shibi Khan, who was angered by various Chinese attempts to weaken his government. The Turks quickly overran most of Yanmen Commandery, but the khan's Chinese wife‚Äîan imperial relative who had been married to his predecessor and who had been well treated by the Empress Xiao during an earlier visit‚Äîsent warning to the emperor and empress of the attack. The imperial entourage was able to reach the commandery seat at present-day Daixian, Shanxi,. where they were besieged by the Turks on September 11.Â§ßÊ•≠ÂçÅ‰∏ÄÂπ¥ ÂÖ´ÊúàÁô∏ÈÖâ Academia Sinica Sima Guang, Zizhi Tongjian, Vol. 182. Emperor Yang panicked and did not know what to do. Xiao Yu, who had accompanied the emperor, suggested that messengers be sent to Princess Yicheng, as Turkish customs dictated that the khan's wife be in charge of military matters at home while he was away. Princess Yicheng subsequently sent false information to Shibi Khan, stating that the khaganate was under attack from the north, and the khan lifted the siege. After the siege was lifted, Emperor Yang, instead of rewarding Xiao Yu, became embarrassed, stating, \\"Turkish forces were simply being rebellious and lacked tactical cohesion and would have soon scattered. Just because they did not do so immediately, Xiao Yu was frightened; this is unforgivable.\\" He demoted Xiao Yu to the governorship of Hechi Commandery (Ê≤≥Ê±†, in modern Baoji, Shaanxi) and immediately ordered him to get on his way. When Xiao Yu got to Hechi Commandery, there were agrarian rebels in the mountains, numbering over 10,000, whom the commandery government was unable to control. Xiao Yu reorganized the commandery militia and attacked them, forcing them to surrender. Subsequently, when Xue Ju rebelled at Jincheng Commandery (ÈáëÂüé, roughly modern Lanzhou, Gansu) and attacked east, Xiao Yu blocked Xue's path, and Xue was not able to advance further at that point. During Yang You's reign In winter 617, the general Li Yuan the Duke of Tang, who had rebelled at Taiyuan earlier that year, captured Chang'an and declared Emperor Yang's grandson Yang You the Prince of Dai emperor (as Emperor Gong). Li Yuan assumed power as regent, and he wrote to Xiao Yu, requesting that Xiao submit. Xiao agreed, and was made the minister of census and created the Duke of Song. In spring 618, during an abortive campaign where Li Yuan sent his sons Li Jiancheng and Li Shimin with an army to the eastern capital Luoyang to try to get Sui officials there to submit, Xiao served on Li Shimin's staff. During the Tang Dynasty=During Emperor Gaozu's reign Also in spring 618, Emperor Yang was killed at Jiangdu (Ê±üÈÉΩ, in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu) in a coup led by the general Yuwen Huaji. When the news reached Chang'an, Li Yuan had Yang You yield the throne to him, establishing Tang Dynasty as its Emperor Gaozu. He made Xiao Yu Neishi Ling (), the head of the legislative bureau of the government (ÂÖßÂè≤ÁúÅ, Neishi Sheng) and a post considered one for a chancellor, and he entrusted Xiao with some of the most important matters of state. Whenever Emperor Gaozu held imperial gatherings, he would allow Xiao to sit next to him, and particularly, because Xiao had married a member of the Dugu clan, from which Emperor Gaozu's mother Lady Dugu also came, Emperor Gaozu referred to him endearingly as \\"Master Xiao.\\" Xiao took the matters of state seriously and was not afraid of offending others in offering suggestions, and people feared him. When Li Shimin was made the governor of the capital prefecture Yong Prefecture (ÈõçÂ∑û, i.e., Chang'an and its surrounding counties), Xiao was given the additional title of commandant of Yong Prefecture. In 619, he and Pei Ji were in charge of interrogating one of the major initial contributors to Emperor Gaozu, Liu Wenjing, who had been arrested on suspicion of treason. Both he and Li Gang (), as well as Li Shimin, tried to intercede on Liu's behalf, but Emperor Gaozu nevertheless executed Liu on Pei's recommendations. Later, after the legislative bureau was renamed Zhongshu Sheng () in 620, Xiao Yu remained its head with the new title of Zhongshu Ling (). Per Xiao's recommendations, Emperor Gaozu made Feng Deyi Zhongshu Ling as well, sharing the position with Xiao. In 621, he was similarly put in charge, along with Pei and Chen Shuda, of interrogating Li Zhognwen () the Duke of Zhenxiang, who was also charged with treason, and while Xiao's recommendations were unclear, Li Zhongwen was also executed. At times, when Emperor Gaozu issued edicts, he wanted the legislative bureau to promulgate them quickly, but Xiao did not do so. When Emperor Gaozu rebuked him, Xiao pointed out that during Emperor Yang's reign, the edicts were issued quickly, and while officials had valid reservations, they did not dare to speak against it. He wanted the edicts to be issued only after greater examination, and so was not issuing them as quickly. Emperor Gaozu agreed. Meanwhile, as Xiao's property was initially seized by Emperor Gaozu when he first entered Chang'an to be awarded to the military officers with accomplishments, Emperor Gaozu returned the property to Xiao. Xiao divided the property and distributed it to his clan members, only keeping the family shrine so thathe could sacrifice to the ancestors. After Li Shimin destroyed a major rival, Wang Shichong the Emperor of Zheng, in 621, Xiao, who served under Li Shimin during the campaign and was credited with some of the strategies (as well as charged with collecting the Sui imperial treasury stores at the Zheng capital Luoyang), was given 2,000 additional households as part of his fief and made one of the deputy heads of the important executive bureau of government (Â∞öÊõ∏ÁúÅ, Shangshu Sheng), Shangshu Pushe, still considered a chancellor position. As Shangshu Pushe, Xiao was considered diligent but biased, as well as harsh, and he did not have as good of a reputation. In 626, when Fu Yi () the director of the imperial astronomical observatory, a Confucian, submitted a proposal to ban Buddhism on the grounds that Buddhism was leading to corruption and abuses within the government, Xiao, as a devout Buddhist, debated with Fu earnestly before Emperor Gaozu. He was unable to prevail over Fu in the debate, and Emperor Gaozu issued an edict severely limiting the number of Buddhist temples, although the edict did not appear to be seriously carried out. =Incident at the Xuanwu Gate= Later in 626, Li Shimin, then in an intense rivalry with Li Jiancheng, who had been made crown prince as the oldest son, feared that Li Jiancheng was about to kill him. He submitted a secret petition to Emperor Gaozu accusing Li Jiancheng and another brother, Li Yuanji the Prince of Qi, who supported Li Jiancheng, of committing adultery with Emperor Gaozu's concubines and plotting to kill him. Emperor Gaozu, shocked by the accusations, summoned Xiao, along with Pei and Chen, to prepare to act on the accusations the next morning. Meanwhile, Li Shimin set an ambush for Li Jiancheng and Li Yuanji at Xuanwu Gate outside Emperor Gaozu's palace, and when Li Jiancheng and Li Yuanji approached Xuanwu Gate in the morning, Li Shimin killed them, and then sent his general Yuchi Gong into the palace, claiming to be protecting Emperor Gaozu. Emperor Gaozu, realizing how serious the situation was, asked Pei, Xiao, and Chen for advice, and Xiao and Chen advised him to create Li Shimin crown prince to placate him. Emperor Gaozu did so, and two months later passed the throne to Li Shimin, who took the throne as Emperor Taizong. During Emperor Taizong's reign Initially, Xiao Yu remained chancellor, but was soon conflicting with Feng Deyi, who was also chancellor, as Shangshu Pushe (by this point heads of the executive bureau, as Li Shimin had been head of the executive bureau, but his title Shangshu Ling had thus become a title that his subjects did not dare to take), over Feng's frequent changes of things that they had already agreed on, as well as some other new chancellors that Emperor Taizong had trusted and commissioned, including Fang Xuanling and Gao Shilian. In anger, Xiao submitted a secret petition to Emperor Taizong denouncing Feng, but the petition was inartfully written, offending Emperor Taizong. Meanwhile, an incident occurred where Xiao and Chen Shuda argued before Emperor Taizong, and both were removed from their posts. In summer 627, however, after Feng's death, Emperor Taizong again made Xiao Shangshu Pushe. Later that year, Emperor Taizong discussed attacking Eastern Tujue, which Xiao favored, but Zhangsun Wuji opposed, and therefore Emperor Taizong did not carry out the attack. However, when Emperor Taizong asked Xiao how he felt that the life of the dynasty could be extended, Xiao suggested enfeoffing the imperial princes, and Emperor Taizong agreed and began considering doing so. Around the new year 628, Xiao was again removed from his position, for reasons not stated in history, although in spring 630 he was made a de facto chancellor as imperial censor. Later that year, he accused the general Li Jing, after defeating and capturing Eastern Tujue's Jiali Khan Ashina Duobi, of allowing his soldiers to plunder Tujue's treasures, but Emperor Taizong took no actions against Li Jing, on account of Li Jing's great accomplishment. Meanwhile, Xiao continued to be arrogant and harsh and was again not getting along with the other chancellors. It was said that when Fang, Wei Zheng, and Wen Yanbo had minor faults, Xiao submitted accusations against them which Emperor Taizong did not act on, and Xiao became displeased from it. In fall 630, Emperor Taizong made him an advisor to his son and crown prince Li Chengqian, no longer a chancellor. In 634, Emperor Taizong commissioned 13 officials to examine the circuits in the empire, to see whether the local officials were capable, to find out whether the people were suffering, to comfort the poor, and to select capable people to serve in civil service. Xiao Yu was made the examiner of Henan Circuit (Ê≤≥ÂçóÈÅì, roughly modern Henan and Shandong), but on his mission, he overly punished an official who did not listen to the people under him about their suffering by putting him in a block, causing that official's death. Emperor Taizong, however, did not punish him. In 635, Emperor Taizong again made him de facto chancellor, once stating: :After the sixth year of the Wude era [i.e., 623], Emperor Gaozu considered deposing the crown prince and making me crown prince, but could not resolve to do so. I was not tolerated by my brothers, and I often feared that instead of being rewarded for my accomplishments, I would be punished. But Xiao Yu was not tempted by material goods or threatened by death, and he was truly a pillar for the empire. He also wrote a poem to Xiao Yu, including these two lines: :Only in a gust of wind can the strong among the grass be known, :Only in turmoil can the faithful subjects be seen. He further stated to Xiao, \\"Your faithfulness and honesty cannot be exceeded even by the holy men of old times. However, your overzealousness to distinguish good and bad sometimes makes you difficult to tolerate.\\" In 643, Emperor Taizong commissioned 24 portraits at Lingyan Pavilion to commemorate the contributions of the 24 great contributions to Tang Dynasty. Xiao's was one of the portraits. Later that year, Li Chengqian, fearful that Emperor Taizong was considering replacing him with his younger and more favored brother Li Tai the Prince of Wei, plotted with the general Hou Junji to overthrow Emperor Taizong. When the plot was discovered, Emperor Taizong commissioned Xiao, along with Zhangsun, Fang, Li Shiji, and officials from the supreme court, the legislative bureau, and the examination bureau, to investigate. As a result of the investigation, Hou and many other conspirators were ordered to commit suicide or were executed, while Li Chengqian was reduced to commoner rank. Soon thereafter, Emperor Taizong, believing that Li Tai had played a role in Li Chengqian's downfall, created another son, Li Zhi the Prince of Jin, crown prince, instead of Li Tai, and Xiao was made a senior advisor of the new crown prince. Xiao was given a newly created title for a de facto chancellor as well, Tong Zhongshu Menxia Sanpin (). In 645, when Emperor Taizong commanded a major campaign against Goguryeo, he put Xiao in charge of Luoyang as well as the logistics of shipping supplies to the frontline. In 646, Xiao was again in discord with the other chancellors, going as far as accusing Fang of factionalism bordering on treason. Emperor Taizong was also displeased with Xiao over his requesting to become a Buddhist monk at one point around this time and then changing his mind. In winter 646, he issued an edict extensively accusing Xiao of being overly obsessed with Buddhism‚Äîciting Xiao's ancestor Emperor Wu of Liang and Emperor Wu's son Emperor Jianwen of Liang as examples that Xiao was falling into the traps of. He demoted Xiao to the post of prefect of Shang Prefecture (ÂïÜÂ∑û, roughly modern Shangluo, Shaanxi), but also cancelled Xiao's title as Duke of Song. In 647, however, Emperor Taizong recalled Xiao to be an imperial advisor (but not chancellor) and restored his title of Duke of Song. Death In 648, while accompanying Emperor Taizong at Yuhua Palace (ÁéâËèØÂÆÆ, in modern Tongchuan, Shaanxi), Xiao grew ill and died. The ministry of ceremonies suggested, as a posthumous name, De (Âæ∑, meaning \\"virtuous\\"), while the executive bureau suggested Su (ËÇÖ, meaning, \\"solemn\\"). Emperor Taizong, however, disagreed with both, stating that posthumous names should be particularly reflective of people's characters, and he chose Zhenbian (Ë≤ûË§ä, meaning \\"honest but harsh\\") instead.

This ceremony is a late afternoon or early evening festival, at the couple's parental homes. It consists of many rites, including the Batna, Choora, Jaggo fireworks and sometimes the Ladies Sangeet and mehndi. In South Indian Weddings a similar ceremony takes place called the \\"Pithi\\" Ceremony  The Ceremony  One day before the wedding, the ceremony of mayian is performed at the couple's respective homes. The prospective bride or groom is seated on a wooden plank called a patri, and a red cloth is held above by four female relatives, while married women of the household and biradari, led by the mother, rub a paste of turmeric, flour and mustard oil on his or her face, arms and legs. During the ritual women sing traditional songs and those of the biradari receive the ritual gift of gogley (Punjabi sweets specially cooked for weddings) at the end of the ceremony. Choora On the morning before the wedding, a ritual of choora or chura is performed at the bride-to- be's residence, involving a set of ivory and red bangles. Her maternal uncle makes a gift of clothes, jewellery and some cash called nankey-shak. He puts the bangles on his niece while the women sing traditional songs depicting the role of maternal uncles. Before the wedding ceremony, the bride-to-be takes a ritual bath and dresses in the clothes in which she will be wed, provided by her maternal uncles. Similarly, the bridegroom-to-be also receives a set of clothes called sherwani from his maternal uncles which he, too, wears at the wedding ceremony. It signifies the importance of the role of the mother's natal family at the wedding rituals, and reinforces the alliance established at the mother's own wedding. Batna In the Batna rite, the couple's families rub yellow turmeric paste upon their legs, face, and arms while sitting on a patri (a special red board with embroidery) below a red cloth held by four women. This is done to cleanse and balance the body for married life. Jaggo In the Jaggo ceremony, the family dances and sings on the road in front and around the beautifully decorated wedding home. Jaggo is held in the last hours of the night. Copper vessels called \\"gaffers\\" are decorated with divas (clay lamps), filled with mustard oil, and lit. The bride/bridegroom's maternal aunt (mammi) carries it on her head, and another lady carries a long stick with bells, which she shakes. The ladies then go into other friends' and families' homes to be welcomed with sweets and drinks. They dance there and move on. It is a solemn ceremony filled with joy, dancing, fireworks, and food. The Ladies Sangeet (Ladies' Night of Singing) and mehndi might follow the mayian and dinner.

The production features Cliff Robertson, Ernest Borgnine, Henry Silva and James Blendick.. The film tells of Rex (Cliff Robertson), a gun enthusiast and military veteran who, with his buddies Lou (Ernest Borgnine) and Zeke (Henry Silva), go hunting in the forest. Plot After a frustrating day of hunting in Canada that has left a group of combat veterans empty-handed, their hunting party comes to a river. Another band of hunters appears on the other side, and stares them down. Suddenly a gun goes off, and Zeke retaliates by shooting and killing one of the men on the other riverbank. After an exchange of gunfire, Major Rex and his friends win the skirmish, driving the other group off. Deciding to keep the incident a secret from the police, they round up a posse of friends and pursue the other hunters through the woods in a bloody mini-war that only Lou questions.

He wrote: \\"[Shoot] apparently hopes to be making a statement about the mayhem that can be caused by easy access to weaponry, but most of the time the film doesn't believe in itself. When one character says to another, 'I can't believe it really happened', it's as if the film makers were trying to disassociate themselves from the melodramatic nonsense they've concocted.\\"Canby, Vincent. The New York Times, film review, \\"Shoot Misses Mark as Film On Gun Usage,\\" January 20, 1977. Access: July 26, 2013. More recently, AllMovie film critic Donald Guarisco wrote a favorable review, \\"This Canadian drama is modest but effective stuff. The most interesting aspect of Shoot is its cool, methodical approach: the script presents a story that slowly but surely builds, never going big peaks of drama or action as it builds toward an inevitable showdown ... Harvey Hart keeps things subtle with his direction, wrapping the film in atmospheric visuals and getting low-key performances from his cast. Cliff Robertson is excellent as the quietly mad protagonist, painting a chilling portrait of a man whose dissatisfaction with his post- military life leads to dangerous choices for himself and others in a tense situation ... [as] a result, it is worth a look to fans of offbeat 1970's cinema.\\"Guarisco, Donald. AllMovie by Rovi, film review, 2013. Accessed: July 26, 2013.

Chou titled Myth of the Model Minority: Asian Americans Facing Racism (2nd ed., Paradigm Publishers, 2014). The second edition of this popular book adds important new research on how racial stereotyping is gendered and sexualized. New interviews show that Asian American men feel emasculated in America‚Äôs male hierarchy. Women recount their experiences of being exoticized, subtly and otherwise, as sexual objects. The new data reveal how race, gender, and sexuality intersect in the lives of Asian Americans. The text retains all the features of the renowned first edition, which offered the first in-depth exploration of how Asian Americans experience and cope with everyday racism. The book depicts the ‚Äúdouble consciousness‚Äù of many Asian Americans‚Äîexperiencing racism but feeling the pressures to conform to popular images of their group as America‚Äôs highly achieving ‚Äúmodel minority.‚Äù *In 2007 he finished a book titled Two-Faced Racism: Whites in the Backstage and Frontstage with Leslie Houts Picca (Routledge, 2007). Two-Faced Racism examines and explains the racial attitudes and behaviours exhibited by whites in private settings. While there are many books that deal with public attitudes, behaviours, and incidences concerning race and racism (frontstage), there are few studies on the attitudes whites display among friends, family, and other whites in private settings (backstage). The core of this book draws upon 626 journals of racial events kept by white college students at twenty- eight colleges in the United States. The book seeks to comprehend how whites think in racial terms by analyzing their reported racial events. *In 1996, he published The Agony of Education: Black Students at a White University with Hernan Vera and Nikitah Imani (Routledge, 1996). The Agony of Education is about the life experience of African American students attending a historically white university. Based on seventy-seven interviews conducted with black students and parents concerning their experiences with one state university, as well as published and unpublished studies of the black experience at state universities at large, this study captures the painful choices and agonizing dilemmas at the heart of the decisions African Americans must make about higher education.

Named for Bayfield County, Wisconsin, she was the only U.S. Naval vessel to bear the name. Construction Bayfield was originally laid down as SS Sea Bass under a Maritime Commission contract on 14 November 1942 at San Francisco, California by the Western Pipe and Steel Company. The hull was assigned to the Navy as naval transport AP-78 and was redesignated attack transport APA-33 on 1 February 1943. APA-33 was launched on 15 February. The Navy acquired the vessel on 30 June, renamed it Bayfield, and placed it in reduced commission the same day. Bayfield left San Francisco on 7 July and arrived in Brooklyn, New York on 29 July, where it was decommissioned and converted by the Atlantic Basic Iron Works to an attack transport. The completed ship was then commissioned USS Bayfield (APA-33) on 20 November 1943 with Captain Lyndon Spencer, USCG, in command. Following a shakedown cruise in Chesapeake Bay and subsequent repairs at Norfolk Navy Yard, she conducted amphibious training in January 1944, underwent additional repair, and was declared ready for sea on 3 February. Amphibious operations in Europe=Invasion of Normandy She received orders to New York to embark troops for service in Europe. On 11 February the ship departed New York with a convoy bound for the British Isles and arrived at Glasgow, Scotland on 22 February. From there she moved south to the Isle of Portland, England to await orders. On 11 March Bayfield made the short run to Plymouth and joined a group of amphibious ships that then set course for western Scotland. The ships reached the River Clyde on 14 March and carried out landing exercises there through 21 March in preparation for the European invasion at Normandy. On 29 March she bore the flag of Commander, Force \\"U\\" (Rear Admiral Don Pardee Moon) and served as headquarters for planning the landings on \\"Utah Beach.\\" She joined with other Normandy-bound ships in practicing a variety of maneuvers and tactical operations during short underway periods until 26 April, when full-scale rehearsals took place through 4 May. Bayfield anchored again at Plymouth on 29 April and on 7 May began embarking troops of the 8th Infantry Regiment (U.S. 4th Infantry Division) and the 87th Chemical Battalion. By 5 June the invasion force completed all preparations and got underway for the Bay of the Seine. Passing along a swept channel marked by lighted buoys, Bayfield and the other transports reached their designated positions early on the morning of 6 June and debarked their troops. Hall of Fame baseball player Yogi Berra was a gunner's mate on-board Bayfield on D-Day. USS Bayfield (APA-33) loads landing craft for the \\"Utah Beach\\" landings on \\"D-Day\\", 6 June 1944. After disembarking her troops, Bayfield began service as a supply and hospital ship in addition to continuing her duties as a flagship. Those assignments kept her off the Normandy coast while other transports rapidly unloaded troops and cargo and then returned to England. On 7 June she shifted to an anchorage five miles off the beach and made smoke that night to protect Utah anchorage from Luftwaffe attacks. Invasion of Southern France On 25 June Bayfield returned to port, and on 5 July joined Task Group (TG) 120.6 bound for Algeria. Upon its arrival at Oran on 10 July the group was dissolved, and Bayfield continued on to Italy. At Naples, Rear Admiral Moon assumed command of Task Force 8 or \\"Camel\\" Force, for the invasion of southern France. Plans and procedures were refined, and full-scale rehearsals were held off beaches near Salerno between 31 July and 6 August. Following the suicide of Rear Admiral Moon, a victim of what would become known as \\"battle fatigue\\" on 5 August, Rear Admiral Spencer Lewis took command of TF 87 on 13 August, and Bayfield sailed for the southern coast of France. Early on 15 August, she put troops of the U.S. 36th Infantry Division ashore east of Saint-Rapha√´l in the Golfe de Fr√©jus. As its target, \\"Camel\\" Force assaulted the best defended section of the coast, an area where the Argens River flows into the Mediterranean, and the hard fighting there kept Bayfield in the vicinity of the Golfe de Fr√©jus for almost a month. She returned to Naples on 10 September and three days later received orders to join a transatlantic convoy at Oran. The attack transport steamed by way of Bizerte to embark passengers for transportation back to the United States and left Oran with her convoy on 16 September. She arrived in Norfolk on 26 September, disembarked her passengers, and entered the Norfolk Navy Yard for overhaul. Operations in the Pacific The attack transport spent the first week of November preparing for duty in the Pacific. She loaded supplies and got underway on 7 November for the Panama Canal, in transit to Hawaii. Bayfield arrived at Pearl Harbor on 26 November. The next day, she broke the flag of Commander, Transport Squadron (TransRon) 15, Commodore H. C. Flanagan. Between 6 December and 18 January 1945 the ship participated in five practice amphibious landings at Maui. Invasions of Iwo Jima and Okinawa Bayfield departed Pearl Harbor on 27 January and touched at Eniwetok for fuel before arriving at Saipan on 11 February. Following rehearsal off Tinian on 12 and 13 February, the Joint Expeditionary Force (TF 51) got underway on 16 February for Iwo Jima. Bayfield debarked troops from the 4th Marine Division on D-Day, 19 February, and while anchored off Iwo Jima for the remainder of the month served both as a hospital and a prisoner-of-war ship. Bayfield returned to the Marianas on 1 March to prepare for the Ryukyu Islands campaign. On 6 and 7 March she loaded supplies and equipment of the 2nd Marine Division and got underway on the 11th for rehearsal exercises preparatory to the invasion of Okinawa. Her task force left the Marianas on 27 March and hove-to off the southeastern coast of Okinawa on Easter morning, 1 April. As part of TG 51.2, the attack transport and other units of Demonstration Group \\"Charlie\\" simulated a landing on the south coast to draw attention away from the actual landings at the Hagushi beaches. Although the ruse failed to fool the Japanese, TG 51.2 received more Japanese air attacks than did the real landings. The and were both severely damaged by kamikazes. The group continued the demonstration the next day and then retired seaward to await orders. Bayfield's troops were not required at Okinawa, and on 11 April she got underway for Saipan, where they were disembarked on the 14th. She then remained at Saipan undergoing maintenance and repairs until 4 June. Bayfield sailed for the Solomons on 4 June to load cargo and move it closer to the fighting. She stopped at Tulagi on the 12th and at Espiritu Santo in the New Hebrides on the 17th. She sailed on 1 July for the Marianas and unloaded at Tinian on 9 July and Saipan on 13 July. After taking on passengers, Bayfield got underway for Guam where she arrived on 14 July. Two days later, the transport set course for California. Occupation and demobilization cruises In San Francisco on 30 July, Bayfield went into drydock for a major overhaul before the expected invasion of the Japanese home islands. However, hostilities ended on 15 August while the transport was still undergoing repairs. Ten days later, Bayfield departed San Francisco, bound via Eniwetok, Marshall Islands for Subic Bay and Zamboanga in the Philippines. At Eniwetok on 7 September, revised orders directed her to Tacloban, Philippines, where she arrived on 14 September and reported to Commander Amphibious Group 3 for duty in the occupation of Aomori, Japan. On 17 September Bayfield embarked soldiers and equipment of the U.S. 81st Infantry Division. The landings at Aomori took place according to schedule on 25 September. After discharging the troops, Bayfield returned to the Marianas on 4 October and joined the \\"Operation Magic Carpet\\" fleet. She embarked a full complement of returning veterans at Saipan and at Tinian before heading home on 7 October. Upon her arrival at San Pedro, California on 20 October, she disembarked passengers including the TransRon 15 staff. Following repairs, the ship carried occupation troops to Korea in November 1945 and January 1946, returning from each voyage with a full contingent of veterans. Post-World War II service=Atomic testing In March, the attack transport was ordered to Pearl Harbor for \\"Operation Crossroads\\", the atomic bomb tests scheduled to take place at Bikini Atoll in July. She set sail from Oahu on 2 April and proceeded via Kwajalein and Eniwetok to Bikini with supplies and equipment. She returned to Pearl Harbor early in May to take on more cargo and arrived back at Bikini on 1 June. Bayfield then served as a barracks ship for the crews of the target ships. On 30 June she took station 22 miles from the site of the initial Test \\"ABLE\\", an airburst detonated at 09:00 on 1 July 1946. After the explosion, Bayfield reentered the lagoon and anchored at 17:28 that day. She remained there until 18 July providing berthing spaces for members of the survey and monitoring teams until they were able to return to their own ships. She then got underway to participate in a one-day rehearsal for test \\"BAKER\\". On 24 July Bayfield again departed the lagoon and at 08:35 on the 25th, observed the underwater detonation from a distance of 15 miles. She returned to the anchorage at dawn the following morning and remained until 3 August. She stopped at Kwajalein to check contamination levels, resumed her journey on 8 August, and arrived at San Francisco on the 20th. On 28 August 1946, Bayfield arrived at Puget Sounds Naval Shipyard (PSNS) in Bremerton Washington for further decontamination as a result of the atomic blast test at the Bikini Atoll test site. 1946‚Äì1960 The transport continued to serve with the Pacific Fleet making two more cruises to China until joining the Atlantic Fleet in November 1949. Based at Norfolk, Virginia she operated along the eastern seaboard and in the West Indies until mid-August 1950, when the outbreak of hostilities in Korea on 25 June called her back to the Pacific. Bayfield arrived in Kobe, Japan, on 16 September and, the next day, got underway for Inchon, Korea. She spent the next seven months providing logistic support to the United Nations forces in Korea. She returned to San Diego on 26 May 1951 and, except for a cruise to Japan and back in September 1951, did not return to the Far East until March 1952, again to support troops in Korea. During the next two years, Bayfield made three more cruises to the Orient and performed special duty in August and September 1954, assisting in the evacuation of refugees that resulted from the partition of Vietnam into a communist north and a democratic south. As one of more than 40 amphibious ships employed in \\"Operation Passage to Freedom\\", the transport provided food, shelter, and care to the evacuees as she carried them south to Saigon. She returned to San Diego on 9 October and commenced a routine of alternating local training operations along the West Coast with deployments to the Far East. On 26 March 1955, Bayfield arrived at the site of the Pan Am Flight 845/26 ditching in the Pacific Ocean and rescued the 19 survivors. 1961‚Äì1968 In February 1961 Bayfield changed home port from San Diego to Long Beach where she served as the flagship for the Commander Amphibious Squadron (PhibRon) 7. Her first assignment saw her underway for a major amphibious exercise in Hawaii. During that operation, the transport received orders dispatching her to the western Pacific to bolster the 7th Fleet during the Laotian crisis. The tension soon subsided, however, and Bayfield returned to Hawaii to finish the interrupted training exercise before continuing on back to the West Coast. The ship deployed to the Far East again in January 1962 and spent most of the overseas tour participating in exercises and showing the flag. Near the end of the assignment, Bayfield received orders to Buckner Bay, Okinawa, where she stood by during another crisis in Laos. Late in July 1962 she returned to Long Beach and resumed operations out of her home port. In October she had to forego another major amphibious exercise in Hawaii because of the Cuban Missile Crisis. The transport embarked elements of the 1st Marine Division and headed through the Panama Canal to support forces engaged in the quarantine of Cuba. With the end of that crisis, Bayfield returned to Long Beach on 15 December. Following a regular overhaul at Willamette Shipyard in Richmond, California and refresher training out of San Diego until 6 June 1963, the attack transport resumed local training operations. On 17 September she embarked from Long Beach on another deployment to the western Pacific. Bayfield made a port call in Hawaii for three weeks, then resumed her cruise west on 16 October and arrived at Subic Bay in the Philippines on 31 October. She made a visit to Hong Kong during the latter part of November, returning to Subic Bay near the end of the month. The ship spent December operating in the waters between Okinawa and Japan, stopping in Numazu, Yokosuka, Nagoya and Sasebo. Bayfield also carried cold weather training called \\"Operation Backpack\\" at Pohang, South Korea and joined the Nationalist Chinese in exercises near Taiwan during the first two months of 1964. She disembarked her Marine contingent at Buckner Bay, Okinawa, in mid- March and headed back to the West Coast, arriving in Long Beach on 6 April. Bayfield operated out of Long Beach for more than a year and then deployed to South Vietnam in May 1965. Bayfield returned to the West Coast in December and resumed local training missions in the Long Beach and San Diego operating areas early in 1966. Later that spring, she began a five-month overhaul at the Todd Shipyard in Alameda, California. Getting underway from Todd Shipyard \\"Bayfield\\" sailed to Mare Island to take on ammunition then proceeding on to Hunters Point Naval Shipyard (San Francisco). \\"Bayfield\\" was in Hunters Point during the Race Riots and crew members were escorted back to ship under police escort from Market Street in San Francisco. The ship left the yard on 26 September and spent several weeks at San Diego for amphibious maneuvers and refresher training. Bayfield embarked on another tour of duty in the Far East on 28 December, refueled at Pearl Harbor early in January 1967, and continued on westward. She touched at Okinawa on 19 January and continued on to the Philippines. At Subic Bay, ComPhibRon 7 shifted his flag to the transport and she got underway for Vietnam on 31 January. Vietnam War The ship served as a floating barracks at Da Nang until 15 February 1967 and then sailed for Okinawa to take on Marines and equipment for rotation to the Vietnamese combat zone. During that operation, Bayfield anchored at the mouth of the Cua Viet River, and her embarked Marines went ashore to rotate with units that had been serving eight miles upriver at Dong Ha. Bayfield returned to Okinawa on 13 March. In April, she loaded troops for another landing and put them ashore south of Da Nang on 28 April. The transport continued to serve off the coast of Vietnam until 28 May, ferrying troops between points as needed and transporting casualties to the hospital ship . Relieved by the , Bayfield headed home, via Sasebo, Hong Kong and Pearl Harbor. In August 1965 she participated in Operation Starlite was the first major offensive regimental size action conducted by a purely U.S. military unit during the Vietnam War. Followed by Operation Piranha which was a US Marine Corps operation that took place on the Batangan Peninsula southeast of Chu Lai, lasting from 7 to 10 September 1965. Bayfield earned four battle stars for World War II service, four for Korean service, and two for service in Vietnam. Decommissioning USS Bayfield carried out exercises until 27 December, at which time she was placed in a reduced readiness status. Berthed next to the at Long Beach, Bayfield prepared for inactivation. She was placed out of commission, in reserve, on 28 June 1968. A board of inspection and survey found the transport to be \\"unfit for further service\\", and her name struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 October 1968. She was sold to the Levin Metals Corporation of San Pedro, California on 15 September 1969 and scrapped.

Lanham, Maryland, USA: Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, Inc., 2002. Pp. 74. Albania was declared a constitutional monarchy in 1928. Upon its inception, Italy demanded to be allies with the republic. This was done largely to increase Italy's influence in the Balkans, and to aid Italian and Albanian security in their territorial feuds with the Second Hellenic Republic and the Kingdom of Yugoslavia.  History  After defeating Fan Noli's government, Ahmet Zogu recalled parliament in order to find a solution for the uncrowned principality of Albania. Parliament quickly adopted a new constitution, proclaimed Albania a republic, and granted Zogu dictatorial powers that allowed him to appoint and dismiss ministers, veto legislation, name all major administrative personnel, and choose a third of the Senate's members. The new constitution provided for a parliamentary republic, with a powerful president serving as head of state and government. On January 31, 1925, Zogu was elected president for a term of seven years by the National Assembly, prior to his proclamation as King of Albanians. He ruled Albania using four military governors and appointed clan chieftains as reserve army officers who were kept on call to protect the regime against domestic or foreign threats. He also maintained good relations with Benito Mussolini's fascist regime in Italy and supported Italy's foreign policy. The Zog regime was said to be responsible for the disappearance of opposition parties and civil liberties. The press was also strictly censored during the regime. In early 1925, a series of reforms focused on the economy were initiated, but results were mixed. Some of the reforms included organizing private initiatives in industry, construction, and transportation. That same year, the first Albanian coin, the Albanian Gold Franga, was minted. Foreign capital was introduced as a part of the official policy of the government of Zog I, but the aim of his regime was actually to strengthen personal power, and to enrich his supporters. The foreign capital, loans and other forms, was used as a tool to provide income for the regime and was later used for overcoming economic crises. Fourteen new societies were created at about this time, with an initial capital of 7.6 million gold francs, about 28% more than the capital of the societies in the period 1921-1924. In 1928, the number of enterprises reached 127, and domestic capital was six times greater than in 1927, while the economy began to stabilise. In 1925, the Albanian National Bank was created and was awarded concessions to Italian investors. The Albanian state had a 49% share of the bank, while Italy had a 51% share. Under these conditions, Italy gained a stronger position in Albania. During the 1925-1928 period, the Albanian government also significantly increased its costs. In 1925, the SVEA society (Society for the Economic Development of Albania) was established, helping to facilitate a loan to Albania worth 50 million gold francs. In 1927, the loan was estimated at 65 million gold francs. Annual interest for this 40-year loan was 7.5%. Repayment amounts consisted of 30%-40% of the entire country's income. In 1925, agreements between Albanian financial agencies (such as SVEA) and Italian financial groups, financed 96.4% of the road building projects in Albania. These loans were not exclusively for the country's immediate economic needs, but to create conditions for further penetration of foreign capital into the country. Government departmental responsibilities were also shuffled to increase road- building. In 1928, fiefdoms occupied an area of 200,000 hectares (100,000 were private fiefdoms). Berat was the city with the largest number of fiefdoms, with about 36,000. Infrastructure was poorly maintained during this period. Roads could only carry lighter vehicles, while poorly maintained bridges hampered car transport. Maritime transport was primarily conducted by foreign companies. Mail air transport was operated by Italians. Trade was the largest element of the economy, and during this time the circulation of goods grew. Raw materials and livestock were the main exports. Many Italian, English, French, and American companies began to do business in the Albanian market, and they were helped by trade agreements or through direct investment. Italy's position was further strengthened by the Maritime Trade Treaty, which gave the state the status of \\"most favored nation\\". This legalized the Italian monopoly on foreign trade.  Italian penetration  In return for aiding Zogu's invasion, Belgrade expected repayment in the form of territory and influence in Tirana. Although Zogu promised Belgrade frontier concessions before the invasion, the Albanian leader continued to press Albania's own territorial claims. On July 30, 1925, the two nations signed an agreement returning the monastery of Saint Naum on Lake Ohrid, and other disputed borderlands, to the Yugoslavia. Yugoslavia, however, never reaped the dividends it hoped for when it invested in Zogu. He shunned Belgrade and turned Albania toward Italy for protection. Italian advocates of territorial expansion in Albania gained strength in October 1922 when Benito Mussolini took power in Rome. His fascist supporters undertook an unabashed program aimed at establishing a new Roman empire in the Mediterranean region that would rival Britain and France. Mussolini saw Albania as a foothold in the Balkans, and after the war the Great Powers effectively recognized an Italian protectorate over Albania. In May 1925, Italy began a penetration into Albania's national life that would culminate fourteen years later in its occupation and annexation of Albania. The first major step in this process was an agreement between Rome and Tirana that allowed Italy to exploit Albania's mineral resources. Soon, Albania's parliament agreed to allow the Italians to found the Albanian National Bank, which acted as the Albanian treasury even though its main office was in Rome, and Italian banks effectively controlled it. The Albanians also awarded Italian shipping companies a monopoly on freight and passenger transport to and from Albania. In late 1925, the Italian-backed Society for the Economic Development of Albania began to lend the Albanian government funds at high- interest rates for transportation, agriculture, and public-works projects, including Zogu's palace. In the end, the loans turned out to be subsidies. In mid-1926, Italy set out to extend its political influence in Albania, asking Tirana to recognize Rome's special interest in Albania and accept Italian instructors in the army and police. Zogu resisted until an uprising in the northern mountains pressured the Albanian leader to conclude the First Treaty of Tirana with the Italians on November 27, 1926. In the treaty, both states agreed not to conclude any agreements with any other states prejudicial to their mutual interests. The agreement, in effect, guaranteed Zogu's political position in Albania, as well as the country's territorial integrity. In November 1927, Albania and Italy entered into a defensive alliance, the Second Treaty of Tirana, which brought an Italian general and about forty officers to train the Albanian army. Italian military experts soon began instructing paramilitary youth groups. Tirana also allowed the Italian navy access to the port of Vlor√´, and the Albanians received large deliveries of armaments from Italy.

The school is for girls and boys aged 11 to 16 years. The school was founded as Sholing Middle Road Girls' School between 1910‚Äì1912. It became a specialist technical college in 2003, though still remained a girls school. It became an Oasis Charitable Trust academy in September 2018 with a mixed boys and girls entry. History The Middle Road school buildings originally housed a boys' school, but this was converted to a girls' school - then called Sholing Middle Road Girls' School - in the years 1910‚Äì1912. The buildings were further altered between 1914 and 1920. In 1938 the school was referred to as \\"Middle Road Senior Girls' School, Sholing\\" when Southampton Corporation were tendering for an electrical installation to take place there. During the war the girls were temporarily based in the nearby Merry Oak Boys School, built in 1935, as well as in St Monica Road Boys School. By 1954, the school was named \\"Sholing (Middle Road) Secondary Girls' School\\" and Southampton Town Council were seeking tenders for a constructor to build a new annexe. Sholing Girls School completed its transition to a specialist college of technology, under the name The Sholing Technology College, with an official ceremony in May 2003, though still remained an all girl school. By 2006 there were 999 girls in the school, and the Ofsted report was Good. An Ofsted inspection in May 2016 downgraded the school from 'Good' to 'Inadequate' and recommended special measures. The report stated \\"Underachievement has become widespread in core areas of the curriculum.

A successful businessman when they married, he credited her with encouraging him into political life, and rising to the premiership. Biography Anne de Vere Cole was born to Major William Utting Cole, of West Woodhay House. Her mother, Mary de Vere, was Irish, and traced her descent to the 15th Earl of Oxford; she inherited Issercleran, Craughwell, County Galway, in 1914. Her brother was the noted prankster Horace de Vere Cole (1881‚Äì1936), who inherited the family house sometime after 1889; it was later owned by John Huston and then Merv Griffin and is now known as St Cleran's House. From childhood Anne loved to travel, going abroad each year, later going to Canada and East Africa as a married woman. She married Neville Chamberlain in January 1911, and remained his wife until his death in November 1940. At the time of her marriage her husband, a successful businessman, was already 41 years old, and had expected to remain a bachelor. She encouraged and supported his entry into local politics and he was elected to the Birmingham City Council in November 1911. In 1914, just before the outbreak of the Great War, he was made an alderman and the following year was elected Lord Mayor of Birmingham. This marked the beginning of a public career in which Anne Chamberlain was to be Neville's constant companion, helper and trusted colleague, and to share in full his interests in housing and other political and social activities after his election as MP for the Birmingham constituencies of first Ladywood and then Edgbaston. The couple had many tastes in common: a love of music and art, of books and flowers (while at 10 Downing Street, she created a bright border where previously there had been some sad London shrubs), and especially of the countryside and wildlife. She would accompany him on his outdoor excursions (though not always the whole way, for he was a prodigious walker), and learned much from his collections and studies of Lepidoptera (butterflies), plants and birds. In literature she preferred Charles Dickens and William Makepeace Thackeray, and especially liked works on history, biography and ancient religious rites. Archaeology was also an enduring interest; one of the attractions of Chequers (the prime minister's country retreat) for her was that it lay on the Icknield Way. In his biography, Keith Feiling wrote: > Of what he felt of his debt to his wife, he often spoke in public and, as it > had been at Ladywood, so he repeats in a letter of 1937 on becoming Prime > Minister: \\"I should never have become P.M. if I hadn't had Annie to help > me.\\" While living in Edgbaston, the Chamberlains had two children: Dorothy Ethel (1911‚Äì1994) and Francis Neville (1914‚Äì1965), predeceasing his mother by two years. She was a widow for more than 26 years. Anne Chamberlain is interred in St Peter's Church, Harborne. In popular culture Anne is referenced in the popular television series Downton Abbey. In the last season, Violet, Dowager Countess of Grantham, informs her son Robert that Anne's godfather was her husband and she hopes that connection will help convince Chamberlain, as Minister of Health, to visit the estate and take her side in a dispute over a local hospital.

The Fort Fraser was intended to be a small prospecting craft that could service not only the Soda Creek to Fort George section of the upper Fraser River but also the Nechako River and some of its tributaries, enabling her to serve her namesake town of Fort Fraser. The Fort Fraser was launched in late June 1910 and was put under the command of Captain John Bonser, who was transferred from the company‚Äôs other sternwheeler, the Nechacco. Piloted by Bonser, the Fort Fraser pioneered the upper reaches of the Fraser River, not only successfully navigating the Grand Canyon of the Fraser but also travelling further upriver, thus becoming the first sternwheeler to reach the head of navigation at T√™te Jaune Cache. Because of her small size and ability to travel on rivers that were previously unnavigated, she was often chartered by pioneer surveyor, Frank Swannell. Despite these fine accomplishments, the Fort Fraser was never considered to have played a large role during the next few hectic years of rail construction, as the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway crossed the Alberta‚ÄìBC border in 1912 and made its way towards Fort Fraser, where the last spike would be driven on April 7, 1914. In 1911, Captain Bonser left the Fort Fraser and returned to the Skeena River to pilot the new sternwheeler, Inlander. The Fort Fraser was then put under the command of Captain George Ritchie, who was without a ship due to the loss of the Nechacco that April, in the ice at the Cottonwood Canyon. Under Ritchie's command, the Fort Fraser would work intermittently until the fall of 1913 when she would be rebuilt and renamed Doctor after Dr. JK McLennan, a new partner in the company which had also been renamed, and was now the Fort George Lumber and Transportation Company. Outside short local trips, it is not recorded that the Fort Fraser did any work on the upper Fraser after the fall of 1913.

He was probably born around 1562-1563 and that he died age eighty. Mir Fendereski was trained in the works of Avicenna as he thought the Avicennian medical and philosophical compendiums of al-Qanun (The Canon) and Al-Shifa (The Cure) in Isfahan.  Works  A number of works are attributed to him, although these have not been studied in detail. He made extensive commentary on the Persian translation of the Mahabharata (Razm-Nama in Persian) and the philosophical text of the Yoga Vasistha. \\"Res√¢le Sanaie\\", \\"Res√¢leh dar kimiy√¢\\" and \\"≈†ahre ketabe mah√¢rat\\", in Persian language, are some of his most famous works. Also, his criticism of the Persian translation of the Yoga Vasistha indicates he was familiar with Sanskrit. He was also a poet and composed a long philosophical ode (qa·π£ida ·∏•ekmiya) in imitation of and response to the Persian Isma øili thinker Nasir Khusraw. His best-known work is titled al-ResƒÅla al-·π£enƒÅ øiya, an examination of the arts and professions within an ideal society. The importance of this treatise is that it combines a number of genres and subject areas: political and ethical thought, mirrors-for-princes, metaphysics, and the critical subject of the classifications of the sciences.

The biscione (; Milanese: bisson , plural: \\"biscioni\\"), also less commonly known as \\"the vipera\\" (; \\"viper\\"), is a heraldic charge showing on argent an azure serpent in the act of consuming a human (usually a child and sometimes described as a Moor or an Ottoman Turk). It is a historic symbol of the city of Milan. History The bronzed serpent brought to Milan from Constantinople in the 11th century, today in the Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio, is thought to have inspired the biscione. The word \\"biscione\\" is a masculine augmentative of Italian feminine \\"biscia\\", \\"grass snake\\" (corrupted from \\"bistia\\", ultimately from Latin \\"bestia\\"). The charge became associated with the city after the Visconti family gained control over Milan 1277; Bonvesin da la Riva records it in his De magnalibus urbis Mediolani (On the Marvels of the City of Milan) as a Visconti symbol no later than the end of the 13th century. The symbol may in turn have been derived from a bronzed serpent brought to Milan from Constantinople by Arnolf II of Arsago (Archbishop of Milan 998-1018) in the 11th century. The biscione remained associated with the Duchy of Milan even after the Visconti line died out in the 15th century. Page 257 The House of Sforza incorporated the symbol into their armorial after taking the duchy. Contemporary use As a symbol of Milan, the biscione is used by multiple organizations associated with or based in the city. Football club Inter Milan is commonly represented by a biscione, and the team's 2010‚Äì11 away shirt prominently featured the symbol. Milan-based auto manufacturer Alfa Romeo (also known as the \\"Casa del biscione\\", Italian for \\"House of the Biscione\\" or \\"Biscione['s] marque\\") includes a biscione in its logo impaled with a red cross on white (derived from the flag of Milan), as does espresso machine manufacturer Bezzera. Silvio Berlusconi, who was born and remains based in Milan, uses stylized biscione symbols in the logos for his companies Mediaset and Fininvest (with the child replaced by a flower); his residential zones Milano Due and Milano Tre and the Mediaset-owned television channel Canale 5 all also use biscione-inspired imagery. Outside Milan, a similar design is found in the seals of the Hungarian nobleman Nicholas I Garai, palatine to the King of Hungary (1375‚Äì1385). Here the crowned snake devours a sovereign's orb, rather than a human. The arms of the towns of Sanok in Poland and Pruzhany in Belarus also feature the symbol, honoring the marriage of Bona Sforza to Sigismund I of Poland while both towns were part of Poland‚ÄìLithuania. The band Lacuna Coil used a biscione for the Black Anima album cover artwork and limited edition tarot cards. Similar symbols Comparable to the biscione are some depictions of the Hindu deity Matsya. While his form is referred to as anthropomorphically having a humanoid upper half, and his lower half as that of a fish, some depictions show him with his upper body emerging from the mouth of a fish. In early Christian art of the catacombs, the Old Testament prophet Jonah is depicted as a man being swallowed by a serpent-like Leviathan, a sea creature of Hebrew myth.

The station began broadcasting in July 1977 with a beautiful music format; the calls stood for We Mean Fine Quality, as in the station's \\"quality\\" music. The format evolved into adult contemporary by 1990, using the slogan \\"Q-Lite 92.9\\" and then \\"Q92.9.\\" The current oldies format was adopted in 2004. As an oldies station \\"Big Oldies 92.9\\", despite the \\"Biggest Hits of the 60s and 70s\\" slogan, the station also played a fair amount of music from the 1980s, having added artists like Madonna, Cyndi Lauper, Naked Eyes, George Michael, Tiffany, and Culture Club to its playlist. On August 1, 2011, WMFQ changed their format to hot adult contemporary, branded as \\"92Q\\". On June 1, 2013, JVC Broadcasting purchased WMFQ from Asterisk Communications along with WTRS, WBXY, WXJZ and WYGC. WMFQ was then re-branded as \\"Q92\\". With the new ownership and management, longtime morning man Bill Barr was promoted to Program Director. In October 2013, WMFQ made a shift to mainstream Top 40/CHR focusing on the biggest hits and new music.

This species is one of larger members of the genus Paravaejovis, which also includes Paravaejovis confusus. Description Paravaejovis spinigerus is a medium-sized scorpion with large adult males and females reaching nearly 60‚Äì70 mm, weighing approximately 9.5 g.Oscar, F.

It can be differentiated from the Arizona bark scorpion (Centruroides sculpturatus) by the brownish-tan stripes on the back of its tail along the keels or ridges; the tail is typically thicker than the hands and pedipalps, both of which are quite slender in the bark scorpions. Some others may have a base color of light yellow/golden brown with variable underlying ducky markings along its tail.Hughes, Garrett Brady. \\"Morphological analysis of montane scorpions of the genus Vaejovis (Scorpiones: Vaejovidae) in Arizona with revised diagnoses and description of a new species.\\" Journal of Arachnology 39.3 (2011): 420-438. The name spinigerus is derived from the spiniform granules at the ends of the dorsal keels of the tail. Paravaejovis spinigerus was a member of the genus Hoffmannius prior to 2013. Habitat Found in the Sonoran desert (Arizona, New Mexico and parts of California), commonly found under rocks and surface objects, such as sleeping bags or shoes, or on sandy soils in a variety of habitats, from desert floor to rocky hillsides. It seeks the most humid areas it can find.Wolf, Harold. The Pectine Organs of the Scorpion, Vaejovis Spinigerus: Structure and (glomerular) Central Projections. N.p.: Elsevier Ltd, 2007. PDF.

Venom Like all scorpions, Paravaejovis spinigerus is venomous Sissom, W. David. \\"A new species of Vaejovis (Scorpiones, Vaejovidae) from western Arizona, with supplemental notes on the male of Vaejovis spicatus Haradon.\\" Journal of Arachnology (1993): 64-68. however the venom of this species is not medically significant for humans or other mammals and is not considered dangerous. Mating/Reproduction Smell and vibrations are two ways the Paravaejovis spinigerus mate with other scorpions. When a couple find each other, they may display a dance with each other that can take a few minutes to hours. After they are finished dancing with each other, they will go their separate ways. If the male stays dancing longer than the female, the female will then attack him and eat him. The offspring grows inside of the female scorpion and be born alive from her body Warburg, Michael R. \\"Scorpion Reproductive Strategies, Allocation and Potential; a Partial Review.\\" European Journal of Entomology 108.2 (2011): 173-81. ProQuest. Web. 12 Nov. 2014. You will notice the females posture is different from any other scorpion during this gestation period, which usually lasts for 3‚Äì8 months. Her body will look very inflexible and rigid. Around the time of birth, her front legs will be lowered, allowing the offspring to come out of her body. Some will emerge one at a time with a few minutes apart, others will emerge all at once at a constant flow. Her stiff posture will remain until all of the offspring have left her body. She will care for them and carry them on her back up until they go through the first molting period. \\"Scorplings\\" (her offspring) can range anywhere from 1- 100 at a time. Depending on the species and their environmental factors, the mothers will either care for them or eat them. The reason for this behavior is unknown.

He won league championships in both England and Scotland, with Burnley and Dundee respectively. Playing career Seith began his professional career with Burnley, whom he joined in 1948 aged 16. He made his debut for the Clarets in 1953, in a 2‚Äì1 away victory against Manchester United, and soon became their regular right half. By 1959‚Äì60 Burnley had become a genuine title challenger and Seith played 27 games in that league campaign as they moved towards their first championship since 1920‚Äì21. However a defensive blip in a game against challengers Wolves saw him dropped in March 1960 and he was still absent from the side when they eventually clinched the title. That summer, a dispute with the Burnley chairman led to Seith's transfer back to Scotland, where he joined Dundee for ¬£7,500. The Dens Park side contained famous names such as Alan Gilzean, Gordon Smith and Ian Ure and was a potent threat to the traditional dominance of the Old Firm, eventually winning the League title in the 1961‚Äì62 season. This allowed Seith the opportunity to compete in the European Cup which had been denied him by his acrimonious departure from Turf Moor and he featured prominently in the Dark Blues run to the semi-final, where they eventually lost to eventual winners A.C. Milan. Coaching career Seith retired from playing in 1964, joining the Dundee coaching staff before moving to a similar role with Rangers; he was to resign from his Rangers post in protest at the sacking of manager Scot Symon in 1967. He earned his first opportunity as a manager when appointed to replace Jimmy Milne at Preston North End but left in 1970. He had a brief period in charge of the Scottish national youth team before being hired as manager of Heart of Midlothian. It was Seith who brought striker Drew Busby to Tynecastle. The Maroons had endured several seasons of mediocrity prior to Seith's appointment but gradually improved under his charge and in the 1973‚Äì74 season topped the League for several months following a 13-match unbeaten run. An inconsistent finish saw them narrowly miss out on European qualification though and following a 10 games winless streak at the beginning of 1974‚Äì75, he was dismissed. Seith left the football business following his departure from Tynecastle and has since worked as a chiropodist, based in Broughty Ferry. He was belatedly awarded a medal for his efforts in Burnley's 1959‚Äì60 league title win in 1999, having been denied one at the time due a dispute with the then club chairman. He was presented with this medal in a public ceremony prior to a Burnley home match in October 1999.

Like the other species in the order Psilotales, it lacks roots. It is found in tropical Africa, Central America, tropical and subtropical North America, South America, tropical Asia, Australia, Hawaii, southern Japan, Lord Howe Island, New Zealand, with a few isolated populations in SW Europe (\\"Los Alcornocales\\", Spain, C√°diz province). Its name, Psilotum nudum, means \\"bare naked\\" in Latin, because it lacks most of the organs of typical vascular plants, as a result of evolutionary reduction. In tropical areas, this plant is often epiphytic, whilst in more temperate areas, such as south-eastern Australia, it is usually found growing in rock crevices. Thousands of people per day walk by these plants at the Sydney Opera House forecourt.Les Robinson - Field Guide to the Native Plants of Sydney, page 303 Cultivation and uses The plant, which grows wild in southern Japan, was once much cultivated in Japanese gardens as an ornamental plant. Slightly over 100 garden varieties were given fantastic names.Rouffa, A. (1971) \\"An Appendageless Psilotum. Introduction to Aerial Shoot Morphology.\\" American Fern Society 61(2), 75-86 Called matsubaran (\\"pine-needle orchid\\") in Japanese, it was one of the noble plants in the Edo period (1603‚Äì1867). Psilotum nudum at the Sydney Opera House, Australia The species is naturally found on all the main Hawaiian Islands. Known locally as Moa because of its chicken feet like stems, the Hawaiians collected large quantities of the spores and used them like talcum powder, under the loincloth to prevent chafing. The spores were also used medicinally as a purge. Children would play a game called 'moa nahele' or cockfighting with the branch stems. Twigs of the Moa were interlocked and the players pulled on the ends. The loser's twig broke and the winner crowed like a rooster. The species is still often used in making traditional Hawaiian leis. Its common name, whisk fern, alludes to its use in the past as a small broom, made by tying a handful of its branches together. It is sometimes found in cultivation (either accidentally, as a weed in greenhouses, or deliberately, in the form of a number of cultivars). It may prove to be a good source of antimicrobial chemicals.

It is a very diverse group; distributed over most of the world, it contains many familiar species. Some authors include the scarab subfamilies Euchirinae and Pachypodinae as tribes in the Melolonthinae. Unlike some of their relatives, their habitus is usually not bizarre. They resemble the Rutelinae in being fairly plesiomorphic in outward appearance. Like in many Scarabaeidae, males have large fingered antennae, while those of the females are smaller and somewhat knobby. In the Melolonthinae, this sexual dimorphism is particularly pronounced. Many species have striking - though rarely brilliant or iridescent - hues and bold patterns of hairs. Being often quite sizeable and swarming in numbers at certain times, for example the Amphimallon, Phyllophaga and Polyphylla \\"june beetles\\" or the Melolontha cockchafers - all from tribe Melolonthini - feature widely in folklore. Some Melolonthinae are economically significant pests. Other than the Melolonthini, the most diverse tribes are the Ablaberini, Liparetrini, Macrodactylini, Pachydemini and Sericini.
