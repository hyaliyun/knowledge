History  Tortured Soul's origins date back to 2001 while Urich was steering Cooly's Hot Box, an acid jazz outfit also featuring under-the-radar indie soul vocalist Angela Johnson. After putting Cooly's Hot Box on hiatus, Urich composed Might Do Something Wrong which was quickly picked up by New York-based deep house label Central Park Recordings, and Tortured Soul was born. Thanks to the cool laidback mix provided by Osunlade, the song quickly became an underground staple at the iconic Club Shelter and helped jumpstart the development of a full-length disc generating more soulful house. Urich began playing his compositions \\"Might Do Something Wrong\\", \\"When You Find Your Love Hold On\\", \\"Fall In Love\\" and \\"How's Your Life\\" with his bandmates from the rhythm section of NYC's acid-jazz band Topaz: bassist Jason \\"JKriv\\" Kriveloff and keyboardist Ethan White. Eventually they broke away to form the trio Tortured Soul. They began touring in 2003, and have become one of the premier live dance acts of this generation. While touring nearly every continent, they have played venues as diverse as the Montreal Jazz Festival, Zouk Singapore, Bonnaroo in Tennessee, Fabric in London, and the Cape Town International Jazz Festival in South Africa. They have shared the stage with world-renowned DJs like Carl Cox, Miguel Migs, Jazzanova, and Louie Vega. They have also performed with many legendary live acts such as Chaka Kahn, The Wailers, The Brand New Heavies, and Pharcyde. A succession of 12-inch singles followed Might Do Something Wrong, including Alix Alvarez's mix of How's Your Life and the romantic dance-pop of Fall in Love. Billboard dance critic Michael Paoletta lauded the latter track by calling it \\"a sterling, soul-slammed house jam\\". Each of the singles impressed the bevy of the world's dance halls, allowing the band to tour heavily with appearances at clubs and festivals across the US. With 2006's Introducing Tortured Soul, the band was able to piece together their debut album using all their earlier singles while also incorporating a few new studio additions. The follow-up album, 2009's Did You Miss Me, released on the band's own label, TSTC Records, ushered in a new wave of critical acclaim, climactically winning accolades from various music publications like Blues and Soul, SoulTracks and SoulBounce. Home to You, In My Fantasy and Your Dream Is My Dream were all given the 12‚Ä≥ and 7‚Ä≥ singles' treatment. Continuing their regimen for clubland rituals, Tortured Soul employed an attractive A-list of DJs and remixers to carefully handle the mixes for their latest batch of uptempo dancefloor fillers, including Mark de Clive-Lowe, Quentin Harris, Jon Cutler, DJ Spinna, Dimitri From Paris and remix pioneer Tom Moulton. In 2015 the band released a third album, Hot For Your Love Tonight, with a music video for the single \\"Don't Lead Me On\\". Most recently two new singles, \\"Makin' Me Better\\" and \\"U Live 2 Far Away\\", along with remixes of both by JKriv, Lounge Lizards, Ron Trent and more. In 2010, Kriveloff departed the group to focus on his new record label. On March 3, 2015, keyboard player and band member Ethan White died. Urich continues to compose and tour as Tortured Soul with the help of bassist Jordan Scanella and keyboardist Isamu MacGregor. Tortured Soul has still got the dance floor groovin' and its popularity continues to spread across intercontinental boundaries as its touring schedules broaden with every single measure. They continue to wow audiences at some of the world's biggest music festivals like the Cape Town Jazz Festival (South Africa), Java Jazz Festival (Indonesia), Detroit Electronic Music Festival (USA), Pukkelpop (Belgium), Big Chill Festival (UK) and Montreal International Jazz Festival (Canada). Touring abroad has not hindered them from making their bicoastal US rounds at Bonnaroo, Milwaukee's Summerfest and at popular live venues like Hollywood's Vanguard, Chicago's Double Door, Atlanta's Center Stage and Washington D.C.‚Äôs 930 Club. Their prowess has even won the praises of Barry Manilow and Lenny Kravitz. AllMusicGuide wrote that Tortured Soul's songs are unapologetically poppy, explaining why their music has appeared on All My Children, A&E;'s The Glades, Showtime's Huff and Canada's version of So You Think You Can Dance. Their music has become the soundtrack of retail shopping in stores like Gap, American Eagle Outfitters and Hollister, while even landing in a popular demo trial for Bose headphones. Over the years Tortured Soul‚Äôs music has been documented on a wide range of dance compilations and has been licensed to Universal Japan, Defected, BMG Ariola, Dome and a host of other labels. The band is living Gilles Peterson‚Äôs prophecy and staying at the forefront of House. Topping things off, their commitment to hard work and travel has been left unfazed. They are focused to reach as many converts as possible ‚Äì one tortured soul at a time., Biography by J. Matthew Cobb.  Style  Rocker Lenny Kravitz once described them as \\"something I'd wake up to on a Saturday morning when the sun is coming through the window. There aren't enough people [like this] singing about love and honesty\\". Influenced by the classic songcraft of Prince, Heatwave and Kool & The Gang, the members of Tortured Soul are three distinctive guys with three different backgrounds, united under a groove-centered rhythm. The band's frontman and principal songwriter, John- Christian Urich, can be seen simultaneously drumming and singing with effortless mastery, while the rest of the collective, made up of keyboardist Ethan White and bassist Jordan Scannella, virtuosically generate the pulsating accompaniment. Inside the group's mystique, the acid jazz is reminiscent of Jamiroquai funk, while deeply saturated in the contemporary freshness of house purveyors like Joey Negro, Kenny Dope, Soul Clap and Jamie Jones. Even the legendary tastemaker Gilles Peterson, dubbed them \\"the future of house music\\".

Before she married, she had an established career as an artist and teacher under the name Catherine Ann Drinker. Early life Catherine Ann Drinker (Janvier), Blessed are the Meek, 1871, three-color lithograph, Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts Catherine Ann Drinker was born on May 1, 1841 in Philadelphia to (Henry) Sandwith Drinker and Susannah Budd Drinker (n√©e Shober). Her father commanded ships involved in East India trade and then established a partnership called James and Drinker in Hong Kong and Macao. He was a merchant or adjacents-ports agent for organizations in New York, Boston, and Philadelphia. Janvier was the oldest of four children. She had a sister and two brothers. Her brother Robert was born in 1845, Henry was born in 1850, and Elizabeth in 1853. Sandwith Drinker lived in Hong Kong by 1845 and the rest of the family was there about 1849. Janvier was a friend and correspondent of student Townsend Harris, who became the first Minister to Japan for the United States. Janvier studied oriental arts, the French and Latin languages, literature, and mathematics. She was also interested in horse-back riding and dancing. At ten or fifteen years of age, one of her father's business associates and a powerful merchant, Hukwa, tried unsuccessfully to arrange a marriage between Janvier and his son. The Drinkers were living in the orient during the Opium Wars when the relationships between foreign traders and the Chinese was difficult. The Drinkers lived in Macao by 1857. In January 1857, Sandwith Drinker was poisoned and died of dysentery, believed to be the result of a politically motivated mass poisoning of bread at a bakery. About 400 foreigners \\"suffered great impairment of health\\" due to arsenic poisoning. Susannah Drinker sailed with her children from China to Baltimore. During the trip, when the captain was drunk, Janvier navigated the ship because the First Officer did not have the sufficient ability to read the charts. Her mother established Mrs. Drinker's Academy for Young Ladies in Baltimore. She had a tumor in her uterus and died in March 1860. Janvier kept the school open for a time, and then closed it to pursue a career in art. She took the responsibility for providing for the family, also included her grandmother. Education and art career Catherine A. Drinker (Janvier), James Madison, 1875, Independence National Historical Park, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Janvier, who studied and worked under the name Catherine Ann Drinker, studied art at the Maryland Institute with Adolf van der Whelan. In 1865, Janvier and the other Drinker children moved to their cousin Ann Elmslie's house in Philadelphia at 1906 Pine Street. Cathrine Drinker took classes at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, where she studied under Thomas Eakins. A life drawing class was established for women at the school in 1868. Ida Waugh and Emily Sartain were among her fellow students. Janvier taught art at Miss Sanford's School in 1870 and through private lessons. One of her private students was Cecilia Beaux, with whom she had much in common and became good friends. Cecilia's sister, Aim√©e Ernesta Beaux, married Henry Sturgis Drinker, Janvier's brother. From 1873 to 1874, she ran Francis Adolf Van der Wielen's school, and Beaux was her student at that time. In the mid 1870s she studied under Thomas Eakins at the Pennsylvania Academy. In New York, she studied at the Art Students League. Catharine Ann Drinker Janvier, Old-fashioned Music (Guitar Player), 1880, Neville-Strass Collection, Florida Aside from teaching, Janvier also created marketable paintings of people, still-life, and genre scenes that sold for about $300 () each painting in New York City. The paintings of Geoffrey Rudel and the Countess of Tripoli (1870), James Madison (1875), Daniel at Prayer (1876) and the lithograph Blessed Are the Meek (1871), all helped to develop her reputation as an artist. Geoffrey Rudel and the Countess of Tripoli was exhibited at the Union League of Philadelphia and James Madison was purchased by the city of Philadelphia and is now in the collection of the Independence National Historical Park. She exhibited her works of art at PAFA from 1876 to the mid-1880s. Drinker won the Mary Smith Prize in 1880 for The Guitar Player, which in 1922 was among the collection of the Neighborhood Guild at Peace Dale, Rhode Island. At the age of 27, she was the first woman to teach at the academy in 1878. Janviers gave lectures about perspective and wrote the book Lessons in Perspective. Marriage On September 26, 1878, Catherine Ann Drinker married journalist Thomas Allibone Janvier in Drifton, Pennsylvania at St. James Church. By the mid-1880s, the Janviers had moved to New York City and Catherine has begun a transition from artist to writer. The Janviers enjoyed a happy marriage in which they lived in England among literary circles and in Provence between 1883 and 1890. Their friends included poets and writers Roumanille, Felix Gras, and Mistral. Besides Europe, the Janviers also traveled to Mexico. When they were not out of the country, they lived in New York City. They were close friends of William Sharp, who they met in 1892. Catherine was among the first to know that Fiona Mcleod was his secret pseudonym. Career transition Janviers translated a book about painting china that French ceramist Camille Piton-who moved to Philadelphia in 1878 and established an art school- wrote in 1878. Janviers titled the book China Painting in America (1879). She taught pottery. In 1880 the book Practical Keramics for Students was published. Janvier translated two books by Felix Gras: The White Terror and The Reds of the Midi. They royalties for the books went to Gras, which helped to fund the education of his sons. Janviers enjoyed Homer and had an interest in Greek history, partially realized in her manuscript Captain , which was published in 1935 as Captain Dionysios, A Romance of Old Marseilles under Janvier's name by her brother Henry. In 1904, her book London Mews was published. Both Thomas and Catherine Janviers wrote for Harper's Weekly. Janvier was a member of the Society for the Promotion of Hellenic Studies, London's Pioneer Club, and the Woman's Cosmopolitan Club in New York City. Death Thomas died on June 18, 1913.

Early lives  There were six brothers in the gang: Leo (the leader), Pius \\"the Brain\\", Ignatius (who was a good dresser), Lucien (who had an explosive temper), Willie (the quiet one), and Teo \\"the Baby\\" Lanzetta (who was the youngest and made women swoon because of his good looks). It is not known when the brothers were born, but what is known is that they were born to Italian parents, that Leo Lanzetta was the oldest, and that Teo Lanzetta was the youngest of the six.  Prohibition and bootlegging  When Prohibition went into effect in January 1920, the Lanzettas organized an \\"Alky Cooking\\" supply network by providing a contingent of row house dwellers with home stills and paying them to produce saleable liquor. The brothers then sold the liquor at higher prices. Their most trusted associates included Louis \\"Fats\\" Delrossi and Mike Falcone. The brothers' criminal careers were marked by frequent arrests and brutal violence. At various times, the brothers feuded with several different groups of racketeers in South Philadelphia, as well as Mickey Duffy and some of his partners. Between 1924 and 1939, at least one brother was involved as a suspect or a material witness in no less than fifteen murder cases, including Pius' imprisonment and dismissal during the early stages of the investigation into the murder of Mickey Duffy. The brothers were also rivals of Max Hoff's criminal organization. Leo and Ignatius killed rival dope peddler and bootlegger Joe Bruno on August 18, 1925, at 8th and Catherine Streets. Bruno was also a made man in the Philadelphia crime family. Deaths and conviction Leo was killed on August 22, 1925, as he left a barber shop at 7th and Bainbridge Streets, in retaliation for the murder of Joe Bruno. Sicilian Philadelphia family boss Salvatore Sabella was Leo's suspected killer. Pius was killed in a luncheonette on December 31, 1936 at 726 South Eighth Street. Willie was found with his head in a burlap bag and a bullet in his brain on July 2, 1939. Teo was convicted on drug trafficking charges and sent to Levenworth Prison in 1940. Along with Delrossi and Falcone, Ignatius was sent to prison in 1936 for breaking New Jersey's \\"Gangster Law\\" and released in 1940; even though their sentences (according to C. Ronald Huff in \\"Gangs in America III\\") were, \\"not more than 10 years and not less than 5 years of imprisonment\\". When Ignatius was released, he fled to Detroit, Michigan with Lucien and their mother. Television In the first season of the HBO series Boardwalk Empire, the Lanzetta brothers are the basis for Nucky Thompson's main rivals, the D'Alessio brothers. The D'Alessio brothers try to take over Atlantic City, New Jersey's bootlegging operations along with Mickey Doyle, Lucky Luciano, Meyer Lansky, and Arnold Rothstein. In the show, the brothers' names are Leo, Ignatius, Matteo, Lucien, Sixtus, and Pius. In the show, Ignatius and Pius are killed by freelance assassin Richard Harrow, Matteo is killed by Atlantic City North Side leader Albert \\"Chalky\\" White, Lucien and Leo are killed by James \\"Jimmy\\" Darmody, and Sixtus is killed by South Side Gang bouncer Alphonse \\"Scarface\\" Capone in Chicago, Illinois.

The Dutch-language author has published novels, drama and poetry, and in December 2015 was announced as the winner of the P. C. Hooft Award, considered the most important literary prize in the Netherlands and Belgium, which was presented in May 2016.\\"Astrid Roemer wins prestigious PC Hooft literary award\\", Dutch News, 15 December 2015.\\"Dutch Caribbean Writer Astrid Roemer Wins Prestigious Dutch Literary Award\\", Afro Republic, 15 December 2015.Peter Jordens, \\"Author Astrid H. Roemer Receives 2016 P.C. Hooft Prize\\", Repeating Islands, 27 May 2016. Biography Roemer was born in Paramaribo, capital of Suriname, and attended the city's Kweekschool, a teaching college, where in 1965, she was discovered as a poet. She travelled to the Netherlands the following year, and went back and forth between Suriname and the Netherlands (she lived in Den Haag for a while) until the 1970s. In 1970, she published her first book of poetry, Sasa mijn actuele zijn. Her first novel, Neem mij terug Suriname (Take me back Suriname, 1974), was very successful in Suriname, and was rewritten as Nergens ergens (\\"Nowhere somewhere\\", 1983). She took up residence permanently in the Netherlands in 1975, after being fired from her teaching job for refusing to celebrate the Sinterklaas celebrations, which include a blackface character named Zwarte Piet. From the 1970s on, she was a prolific writer, publishing novels, drama, and poetry; her breakthrough in the Netherlands was the fragmentary novel Over de gekte van een vrouw (\\"On the madness of a woman\\"), a work investigating identity and the oppression of women, which established her as a feminist writer and made her a role model for lesbians. She spent some time in the city council of Den Haag for the GroenLinks party, in 1989, but left quickly after a dispute with the party. Between 1996 and 1998, she published a trilogy that is now among the best-known of her works, though no longer in print: Gewaagd leven (1996), Lijken op liefde (1997) and Was getekend (1998). The novels were published together as Roemers drieling (\\"Roemer's triplets\\", 2001). The German translation of Lijken op liefde was awarded the LiBeratur Prize. From 2006 to 2009, Roemer lived in Suriname again. In her later years, she has published little. Her autobiography, Zolang ik leef ben ik niet dood (\\"As long as I'm living I'm not dead\\"), appeared in 2004, and a collection of love poems called Afnemend (\\"Diminishing\\") was published in 2012, in only 125 copies. Roemer disappeared from the public eye, and travelled the world for 15 years, with \\"cat, laptop, and backpack\\". Her first public appearance in a long time was planned for the 2015 premiere of De wereld heeft gezicht verloren, a biographical documentary by Cindy Kerseborn; Kerseborn had looked for her on the island Skye but finally found her in a Belgian monastery. Roemer did not show up for the premiere but sent a text message urging people to love one another. Roemer won the P. C. Hooft Award for 2016 over the favoured candidate, Arnon Grunberg, becoming the first Caribbean author to win the award. According to the jury, Roemer's novels are a literary imagining of the history of Suriname, a history that is not very well known in the Netherlands outside of the topics of slavery and the December murders but is \\"inextricably intertwined with the history of our country...and thus, by way of Roemer's unique oeuvre, with our literature\\". The jury added, \\"political engagement and literary experiment go hand in hand with Roemer\\".

Sir James Ramsay (1589 ‚Äì 11 March 1638), known as \\"Black Ramsay\\", was a Scottish soldier in the Swedish service. Biography Ramsay a native of Scotland, born about 1589, was the eighth of nine children of Robert Ramsay of Wyliecleuch. James was nearly related to John Ramsay, viscount Haddington and earl of Holderness. A brother David is noticed separately. James accompanied James VI to England on his accession to the English throne, and was an attendant in the privy chamber of the king and Prince Henry. Subsequently he sought military service abroad and under Gustavus Adolphus. At the battle of Breitenfeld, Ramsay, as eldest colonel, had the command of three regiments of chosen musketeers forming the vanguard. At the capture of W√ºrzburg in October 1631 he headed a storming party, and was shot in the left arm. The wound prevented him from accompanying his regiment during the rest of the campaign and the succeeding year. Gustavus rewarded Ramsay with a grant of lands in the duchy of Mecklenburg and with the government of Hanau. James Ramsay by Sebastian Furck, after Johannes Nicolas Cressius, 1636. In 1634 Sir George Douglas, ambassador from Charles I to Poland, visited Ramsay at Hanau. In 1635 the imperialists besieged Hanau, which Ramsay defended with the greatest skill and pertinacity. The besieged were reduced to feeding on cats and dogs, but in June 1636 William, landgrave of Hesse, aided by the Swedes under Sir Alexander Leslie, raised the siege. Ramsay utilised the respite which this victory gave him to victual the place against a new siege, and to send provisions to the French garrison of Ehrenbreitstein or Hermanstein. In June 1636 Hermanstein surrendered, and in the following month Hanau was besieged by the forces of the elector of Mainz and the bishop of W√ºrzburg under Baron Metternich. At the same time Philip Maurice, count of Hanau, made his peace with the emperor, and relinquished the Swedish cause. Seeing the impossibility of maintaining himself in Hanau, Ramsay agreed to evacuate the city on honourable terms. He was to receive fifty thousand reichsthalers (about 15,000l.), to be paid to his wife in Scotland, to be secured an equivalent for his lands in Mecklenburg, and to be conducted safely to the Swedish quarters. Till the terms were carried out he was to be allowed to stay in Hanau as a private man. In a few weeks, however, Ramsay saw reason to believe that the agreement would not be fairly executed, and in December 1637 he made the count of Hanau prisoner, and retook possession of Hanau. He was not strong enough to hold it, and on 12 February 1638 it was surprised by Henry, count Nassau Dillenburgh. Ramsay, who defended himself to the last, was severely wounded, and died a prisoner in the castle of Dillenburgh on 11 March 1638. An engraved portrait by Sebastian Furck, representing Ramsay in armour, and dated 1636, describes him as aged 47 in that year. But in the version of the same portrait prefixed to Dalrymple's memoir his age is given as 57. Monro describes Ramsay as ‚Äòcalled the black,‚Äô apparently to distinguish him from another Sir James Ramsay, ‚Äòcalled the fair,‚Äô who was also in the service of Gustavus Adolphus. This second Sir James Ramsay was colonel of a regiment of English foot in the Swedish army, and returned to England with the Marquis of Hamilton in 1632. He died at London before 1637, the date of the publication of Monro's book. Probably he was the Ramsay who commanded a regiment in the expedition to Rh√©. A third Sir James Ramsay commanded the left wing of the parliamentary horse at the battle of Edgehill. His troops ran away at the first charge, and he was tried by court- martial at St. Albans on 5 November 1642. The court reported that he had done all that it became a gallant man to do. In December 1642, Essex sent Ramsay to fortify Marlborough, and he was taken prisoner at its capture by the royalists on 5 December. Ramsay subsequently commanded a regiment of horse in Essex's expedition to relieve Gloucester, and did good service.

CBC News, March 1, 2015. Plot The main objective of the film was to explain the story behind rock phenomenon, Alice Cooper. Childhood The film starts by introducing the childhood of Vincent Furnier, who later becomes better known as American singer, songwriter and actor, Alice Cooper. Narrated by Furnier himself, he claims to have had an all American childhood, describing himself to have been the perfect 50s kids who did not lie, cheat or swear and attended church two times a week. Furnier was and continues to be very in touch with God, his father was a pastor, which enabled him to grow up with a strong moral compass. He grew up in Detroit, Michigan, however, due to childhood illnesses such as severe asthma, his family moved to Phoenix, Arizona to try to reduce the symptoms. He discusses an appendicitis attack that he had as a child, claiming that doctors couldn't guarantee he would make it out from the surgery alive. However, the next day he was fine, which he believes to be the result of God and his parents prayers. Every time he looked at his scar from the operation, he knew he was a miracle. High School & The Creation of the Spiders The film moves to discuss Furnier's life as a teenager. He discusses having a strong passion for high school art class, where he met and created his friendship with Dennis Dunaway. They were both interested in surrealism, especially artists such as Ren√© Magritte and Georges Braque. Salvador Dal√≠ was also a huge influence for them, they state he was outrageously different and created an artistic statement that had an impact. During this time, the Beatles were becoming a huge sensation, both Furnier and Dunaway became what they call ‚ÄúBeatles maniacs‚Äù. They state that they loved everything about them, including their style, sound, look and especially the fact that parents didn't understand them. Furnier and Dunaway decided that they wanted to do a spoof of the Beatles at their school talent show, however, at the time they did not know how to play any instruments. Dunaway knew a guitar player, Glen Buxton, who he approached and asked if he would be willing to play in the show with them. Buxton agreed and they performed the show, which received a big reaction. This began the start of their career as a band, which they originally named, the Earwigs. The following summer, they focused on becoming a real band, where they purchased instruments, learned how to play them and started songwriting. Dunaway focused his time learning the bass, where Furnier focused on vocals. They went to play for the owner of a teenage rock and roll dance hall known as the VIP Club, who suggested they come up with a new name. From there, they soon renamed themselves as the Spiders and ended up being the house band at the VIP Club. They focused their time on playing loud rock music, such as songs from the Yardbirds, the Rolling Stones and the Who. They started to become more well known, they opened for the Yardbirds, and the audience actually left after The Spiders were done playing. They also got their record to #2 on the charts, while still in high school. Music became the priority, they wanted to become rockstars and Furnier grew out his hair to fit the part. Furnier claims that church became the last thing on his mind, and the people at his church thought he was going off the deep end. Moving to LA & Becoming Alice Cooper The film follows the band on their move to Los Angeles, California in 1967. At the time, it was the heart of The Love Generation, and the Hippie Movement. Once they arrived in Los Angeles, they realized that everything was not going to just fall into place for them, there were thousands of other bands from other states trying to accomplish the same thing that they were. While in Los Angeles, they met the GTOs, a girl band who Furnier describes as professional partiers, girls from another planet. Miss Pamela, one of the members from the GTO's describes the boys to have been reserved, gentle and innocent in the midst of stoned people. However, that began to change, as they hung out more, much drug and alcohol experimentation was going on. Once again, they renamed themselves from the Spiders to Nazz, stating that The Spiders became dated. However, they soon found out that Todd Rundgren also had a band called Nazz, and found themselves in need of another stage name. One night, while experimenting with drugs they consulted the ouija board, asking it questions, which eventually led to Furnier spelling out Alice Cooper. They found the name humorous, stating it sounded like an older lady, who had dark secrets. From there, they started to create an image for themselves. They realized that everyone was wearing the same kind of hippie based outfits and to stand out they needed to be outrageous. The GTO's helped in the creation of the band's early onstage look by styling the boys with their own personal clothing items, describing the look as ‚Äúfull size Barbie dolls‚Äù. From there, the boys started to buy outfits from vintage stores, which would create a shock factor. Furnier states they knew they weren't as musically good as many of the other bands so the image and theatrics of Alice Cooper was necessary to create attention. They would take whatever items they could find and incorporate them into their shows. Furnier asks, how do you become Alice Cooper? You create it. Miss Christine and Miss Pamela, from the GTOs, were able to introduce Alice Cooper to composer and renowned record producer Frank Zappa. Zappa suggested the band come over to his house at ‚Äú7 o‚Äôclock‚Äù. Mistakenly, the band assumed he had meant 7am, while being awoken by rock music, Zappa was impressed that the band could play such intense music so early. Zappa then asked if they had a manager, in which they said they did not. Meeting Shep Gordon Shep Gordon had moved to California and made many connections. He was living in a hotel room, paid by money he was collecting through drug dealing. He became conscious of the risks that drug dealing brought and from there, decided to become a manager. Gordon approached the band after hearing them play an unsuccessful gig, claiming he could help turn them in the right direction. Furnier describes their first meeting, stating that they walked in to see major stars, including Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix all getting high. From there, they knew almost instantly that they needed to sign with Gordon. They signed with Zappa's label, Straight Records and produced their first album, Pretties for You. Zappa's vision for the album was for it to sound live, like he was driving by a garage and heard them playing. They recorded the entire album in a day, but received many negative reviews. They describe playing a show in Los Angeles for 6,000 hippies, which ended up to be a disaster with everyone running for the doors. There was an obvious personality crisis, the band knew their options were moving forward into what would become their iconic sound, or staying put with the trite psychedelia/ art-rock of the time/region. Leaving Los Angeles The band decided to leave Los Angeles, they described themselves as stray dogs without a home. They played wherever they could, stating that they would move into the first city that they got a standing ovation. Shep said he was able to get them on a festival list in Detroit, where they would play in front of 5,000 people. They played after the MC5, Iggy Pop and the Stooges, thinking there was no way they could entertain the audience after them. They described the show to be odd, weird and full of theatrics, something that nobody else was doing at the time. Finally, the audience got it and they received a standing ovation. Shep was able to get the band on the list for the Toronto Revival Festival in 1969. The deal was they did not get have to get paid, but they needed to open for John Lennon. This was huge for the band, who was strongly influenced by the Beetles. They state that the audience was bewildered by the band, however, they understood the energy behind them. They knew they needed to do something that would stand out, at the end of the show, their idea was to open three feather pillows and a CO2 cartridge to make the appearance of snow. However, for some reason Furnier found a chicken backstage, he grabbed it and threw it off the stage thinking it would fly. The audience grabbed the chicken, tore it apart and threw it back on stage. Both the audience and the band were shocked, Furnier saying ‚Äúthey just killed a chicken in front of 70,000 hippies‚Äù. This became a changing moment for the band, they became known as very notorious and something everyone wanted to learn about. Meeting Bob Ezrin, 1970 The band became something that everyone wanted to learn about, however, at this time they still did not have a record on the radio. Shep got in contact with a Toronto company that made records, Bob Ezrin worked there at the time. Ezrin states that his boss did not want Alice Cooper, but they were persistent and he agreed to meet with them in New York City to hear them play. Ezrin describes the concert to have been an underground scene, the show started and the band made the appearance of their eyes and mouth to be filled with blood. He describes it to have been the most amazing thing he'd ever seen, the beginning of a cultural movement. Ezrin agreed to produce records with them. They started to create different characters and theatrics to get into the songs that they were playing. Ezrin decided that \\"I'm Eighteen\\" would become their first song to put them on the map. The band talks highly of Ezrin, Dunaway states that he brought focus, and enthusiasm, and confidence to the band. On the way to rehearsal, they heard \\"I'm Eighteen\\" on the radio for the first time, and got everyone they knew to frequently request it. They became an overnight sensation. Their audience was new, consisting of kids who were left out and finally had someone who represented them. Theatrics They saw a lack of entertainment in rock music, they wanted to do something that would shock people, especially parents. This led to many representations on stage, which consisted of exaggerated, nightmarish imagery that includes monsters, blood, violence toward women, and executions. They also used many objects in their performances, which has included wearing a boa constrictor on stage and baby dolls, which they then chopped up. They picked up ideas like sponges, inspiration came from everything and anything. Much of their inspiration came from television, where they describe hearing an advertisement that said ‚Äúschools out‚Äù. Hearing that led them to the creation of ‚ÄúSchool's Out‚Äù, which somehow to their belief became a bigger sensation than \\"I'm Eighteen\\". The Hollywood Bowl The band played the Hollywood Bowl at this show they paid for a helicopter to go over the crowd and drop panties into the audience. Elton John was in the audience, where he claims people were fighting to get a pair of these panties. Elton describes the band as becoming more famous than others, where girls were dying over them and parents hated them. Inner Circle Shattering The dynamic started to change with success. The band started to get treated like outsiders and the focus was placed mainly on Furnier, or the character of Alice. He started getting private cars, solo invitations to parties, solo interviews at radio stations, etc. Salvador Dal√≠ contacted saying he wanted to do a moving holograph of Alice, but the band was not included. They decided they needed to go back to their roots, they played Ezrin a song they had written years before. Ezrin did not like the song, and suggested that he did not want to work with the band, however, if Furnier wanted to go out on his own to contact him. They did their next album without Ezrin, but the vibe was different, Furnier needed a break and became distant from the band while working on the album. The band started to fall apart without Ezrin, and they knew if they were going solo that Alice Cooper would be given to Furnier as he was the only one who could truly play him. 1975, Solo Furnier started working on his first solo album as Alice Cooper, which he later released, known as \\"Welcome to My Nightmare\\". He knew it was harder for lead singers who broke out of their band to become successful, so he needed to make a statement, a new beginning. Everything he could get he put into his show. Eventually, he began a relationship with one of his dancers, Sheryl, and they later got married. The Character & Alcoholism It is very common for performers to ‚Äúadopt onstage personae with the purpose of contributing to an authentic‚Äù connection between the performers and their respective audiences, and the character of Alice started to become iconic. However, it forced Furnier to be in a constant state of what Furnier described as ‚Äúmessed up‚Äù, including much alcohol use. The character wasn't necessarily a representation of Furnier, but he got caught up in the character, the things he couldn't do based on his moral compass became something that Alice could do instead. He ended up going to a rehabilitation center for alcoholism and once released, he believed to have been cured. 1978, working with Bernie Taupin Alice got the chance to work with singer Bernie Taupin, where they developed a strong friendship. They created an album together, which was based on characters from Alice's rehabilitation experience. The album came as a confession, Furnier states that the audience had been through the alcoholism with him, so he wanted to let them be through the cure as well. However, during his time of rehabilitation, new artists had taken over the music scene. Furnier was sober, something he'd never been while playing as Alice and he wasn't ready to fight that. Bernie, at the time was experimenting with cocaine, and Alice caught wind of it. He started to sink into an abyss that is described to be more tragic than any of his previous drinking. Bernie had to leave recording, because he knew he would also go down a bad path if he stayed. Personal life During the time of his cocaine addiction, Sheryl gave birth to their first daughter. Sheryl did not want her daughter to be around him in the state he was in. She began divorce proceedings. Furnier went through a very bad high for a few days, he isolated himself and did not want anyone to see him in the state he was in. He eventually got up, looked in the mirror and saw that his eyes were bleeding. He knew that the situation he had placed himself in was turning into life or death. He packed up and left for Phoenix, where his parents helped him as much as they could, though his condition was very bad. He went to seek professional help, once he was out, he contacted Sheryl and said he was done with drugs. Sheryl agreed to counselling on the basis that he organized it. Alice Cooper Rises Again, 1986 The world had moved on for the second time since Alice's break, he didn't fit in anymore and was worried about how he would make a statement, especially sober. After five years away, he returned to the stage on Halloween night for a live MTV broadcast. As soon as the band started, he began and was back at it. This was Furnier's realization that the character of Alice didn't want to live in his world, he just wanted to be on stage. As soon as the curtain was gone, so was Alice. Alice could be Alice Cooper with a healthy Vincent Furnier behind him.

APF provides fellowships for Israeli physicians training in North America and coordinates American and Canadian medical emergency volunteers with the government of Israel. Overview APF was founded in 1950 by a group of American Jewish physicians in New England led by Dr. Morton Robbins of Manchester, New Hampshire in order to support their professional colleagues in the newly founded State of Israel. In announcing the creation of the organization, Dr. Robbins said, \\"Through this Fellowship Committee, members of the medical profession of this country will have the opportunity to provide assistance and cooperation to the physicians in Israel, to provide post- graduate scholarships for physicians from Israel and to help teach them American medical techniques and know-hows in this country.\\" In 1952, APF sponsored its first fellow in the U.S., Dr. Haim Cohen, a refugee from Greece and a survivor of the 1948 Hadassah medical convoy massacre. To date, APF has granted fellowships for specialty medical training to more than 1,500 Israeli physicians, many of whom today fill senior positions in Israel‚Äôs hospitals and medical schools. During the 1967 Six-Day War and the 1973 Yom Kippur War, APF brought its members to Israel to volunteer in hospitals to assume the duties of Israeli doctors that had been called up to military service.

He was the last known surviving veteran of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade. Early life and education Born in Anaheim, California, Berg was originally a farmer, but was inspired to enlist when he saw a sign indicating that the government was looking for people to fight fascism. Berg briefly trained with the Oregon National Guard prior to going to Spain in 1937. He served in the United States Army during World War II and was stationed at Morotai Island.Abraham Lincoln Brigade Archives-Delmer Berg Berg profile, alba-valb.org; accessed January 23, 2016. He became a member of the Communist Party of the United States while in a Spanish hospital, while recuperating from a shrapnel wound to his liver. He remained an interested and active party member up to the time of his last interview in 2014. Career In the years following his demobilization, Berg returned to work the farm on which he had been raised. He fathered two sons from two different marriages. He began serving as a union organizer in the 1950s, and, in a 2007 interview, described the steps he took to discourage the attention of Federal Bureau of Investigation agents. Berg became an official of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), when he was elected the Vice President of the Stanislaus County branch. In the 1950s during the Red Scare, he was often harassed. In a 2007 interview with the Union Democrat, Berg described delivering a petition to the racist county sheriff, demanding his resignation. Berg described testifying at a hearing in Washington, D.C. on farm conditions as a representative of the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee. As his comrades died Berg was sought out for more frequent interviews. Berg's decision to volunteer to travel to a foreign country to fight fascism has been described as symbolic and inspirational. He was interviewed for an episode of the PBS show History Detectives to provide background about the experience of American volunteers when a segment was focused around an artifact from the Spanish Civil War. As of 2007, Berg lived in Columbia, California. He became a centenarian in December 2015 and died on February 28, 2016, aged 100, in Columbia, California. On March 25, 2016, approximately a month after Berg's death, United States Senator John McCain published an op-ed in the New York Times saluting him and his comrades, who had fought for the good values they believed in, in Spain, and when they returned home to the U.S. References External links * Category:1915 births Category:2016 deaths Category:People from Anaheim, California Category:People from Columbia, California Category:Members of the Communist Party USA Category:Oregon National Guard personnel Category:Abraham Lincoln Brigade members Category:American army personnel of World War II Category:Military personnel from California Category:American centenarians Category:NAACP activists Category:United Farm Workers people Category:Foreign volunteers in the Spanish Civil War Category:International Brigades personnel Category:American people of the Spanish Civil War Category:Activists from California Category:American communists Category:Communists from California ","title":"Delmer Berg"},{"id":"45693160","text":"The SNCF Class BB 12000 were electric locomotives operated by SNCF, the French railway operator. The first examples arrived on the railway in 1953, operating on the 25 kV 50 Hz line to the coal mines of the Houill√®res de Lorraine in the north-east of France. History BB 12001 arrived in Mohon on July 17, 1954. Tried first along the Valenciennes ‚Äì Lumes line, specifications called for a locomotive capable of pulling 750 tonne trains along a grade of 10 ‚Ä∞. The 12000 Class proved more than capable, pulling 1100 tonne then 1400 tonne trains. BB 12006 using a different system of gears could pull 2000 tonne trains. The 12000s integrated well with the SNCF CC 14100 series. SNCF would own 148 of this type of locomotive and another 20 were delivered to the Soci√©t√© Nationale des Chemins de Fer Luxembourgeois in Luxembourg as their Class 3600, which had a longer life than their French counterparts: the last examples of this class were withdrawn in March 2005, by that point having served on shunting and local train duties. Two notable units, namely BB 12131 and BB 12141 were sent to Romania, where they were briefly used between 30 April 1963 and 30 June 1963. The Romanian Railways at the time evaluated them, being notable for pulling the first electric train under trials on 9 June 1963, between Bra»ôov and Predeal, with Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej being present at the ceremony. Technical Details Each locomotive weighed 84 tonnes. They used ignitrons as current rectifiers. After the graduator and the transformer, single phase current is rectified by eight ignitrons feeding series-wired electric motors. Smoothing chokes produced a \\"wavy\\" a current that was well accepted by the motors. The locomotives started slowly and smoothly over wet rails. The electric engines can support a very large overload current of 1800 amps, well over the 1000 amp design. They suffered very little wheel slip; they could pull 1756 tonnes trains on a 10 ‚Ä∞ grade and 2885 tonnes trains on a 5 ‚Ä∞ grade. The locomotives had few flaws, none of which related to the electrical components. They had cramped cabins, poor braking and couldn't work as multiple-unit sets.

Known to be a very precocious kid, he learned to play the drums at five years old, the piano at eight, and showcased his talents weekly as a church musician. He was a reluctant singer, to say the least. However, in high school, he began to break out of his shell; eventually, sharing his talents with the public rather than singing alone in his living room. He attended Whitney Young Magnet High School, where not only did he become known for his musical talents, but also learned how to record and produce music, as a member of the school's podcast initiative. Those skills would prove to be significant in college as he recorded his first songs including his first viral hit \\"No Gray\\" in his dorm room. Music career His music career was started in 2012, with the release of Life Music on September 25, 2012, by Light Records and Entertainment One Music. This was his breakthrough released on the Billboard charts, and it placed at No. 98 on Billboard 200 along with Gospel Albums at No. 3, and at No. 23 on the Independent Albums chart.

He preached in favour of Hutchinsonian ideas. Career He earned a Bachelor of Laws degree but chose not to enter law; rather, he was ordained as deacon and priest, and gave up a fellowship of St John's College, Oxford, to take up the position of headmaster at Bristol Grammar School, where he and his predecessor William Goldwin were responsible for increasing enrollment from 20 to 70. From 1743 to his death in 1749 he was the rector of St Stephen's Church, Bristol. His piety was admired by John Wesley, and he was considered, by a local antiquary, to be \\"a good poet, profound linguist, well skilled in Hebrew and Scripture philosophy, and a judicious schoolmaster\\". Catcott also preached at St Mark's Church, Bristol, where he was appointed in 1729. Scientific doctrine Catcott had been corresponding since 1733 with John Hutchinson, who saw the Old Testament as a repository of scientific as well as divine knowledge. Catcott preached a sermon in St Mark's Church (also called \\"Mayor's chapel\\") on 16 April 1735 (The Supreme and Inferior Elahim, published London, 1736); this sermon, preached before Chief Justice Philip Yorke, 1st Earl of Hardwicke, provoked \\"the first serious debate about Hutchinsonianism and the scientific evidence contained in the Old Testament\\". He preached another controversial sermon in August 1735, this one presenting linguistic analysis based on Hutchinson's work. The geologist and theologian Alexander Catcott, also a Hutchinsonian, was his son. One theory of Catcott's, prompted by a challenge made by Hutchinson, attempted to explain the earth's declination and its position in relation to the sun; Catcott proposed that the sun and the moon emitted particles of light that held the earth in equilibrium, eliminating the need for accepting the theory of gravity. Personal papers Papers of Alexander Stopford Catcott, including correspondence, manuscripts, newspaper cuttings and maps are held at Bristol Archives (Ref. 44801) (online catalogue).

The painting is hosted in the collection of the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg. The style of the painting was characteristic of the French Rococo period and was favoured by the wealthy art patrons of his time.  History  The Stolen Kiss, by Nicolas Fran√ßois Regnault after Fragonard (ca. 1788) The earliest known evidence of The Stolen Kiss comes from the June 1788 issue of the Mercure de France magazine, where an engraving by Nicolas Fran√ßois Regnault of Fragonard's painting has been advertised as a pendant to The Bolt. Shortly later in the 1790s, the work was purchased by Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski, the last sovereign of the first Rzechpospolita; it was present in the catalogue of the Royal Picture Gallery at the Lazienki Palace in Warsaw in 1795. Perhaps it was bought at one of the auctions, which sold goods of the French aristocracy following the Revolution of 1789. This would explain the silence of the sources about the acquisition of the work and its certain formal and thematic incompatibility with the other works of the collection. Poniatowski highly valued The Stolen Kiss, and was willing to have it taken from Warsaw to Saint Petersburg upon his abdication in 1795; the shipment did not take place, though, and the painting remained in the Lazienki Palace until 1895, when it was acquired by Emperor Nicholas II of Russia, and was taken to the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg together with four other paintings from Stanis≈Çaw August's collection. After regaining independence in 1918 first, and later after the end of World War II in 1945, the Polish government made diplomatic efforts to recover the painting. In the light of international law and arrangements with the authorities of the Soviet Union, the painting as work of art of national importance taken by Russians from Poland in the 19th century, or during World War II, was a subject to legal restitution. However, the Soviet authorities refused to release the painting, retaining it in the Hermitage collection, and arbitrarily compensated it (among with several others valuable paintings) with several works of lesser value. In 1922, The Stolen Kiss was specifically compensated with the smaller La femme polonaise, a painting of the 1720s formerly attributed to Jean-Antoine Watteau, from the Hermitage collection (originally purchased in 1772 from Louis Antoine Crozat's collection by Tsarina Catherine the Great of Russia, now in possession of the National Museum in Warsaw). Painting The painting depicts a kiss between two lovers, showing a young lady in cream-coloured silk gown who appears to have left her company for a secret meeting with a young man. The composition is diagonal, made up by an axis composed through her leaning figure, the shawl and the balcony door opening from the outside, ending with the table the shawl is draped over. The painting offers an array of compositional contrasts between colours and shadows: the spatial intersections are complex. Jean- Honor√© Fragonard's works display the kind of eroticism and voluptuousness and the liking for romantic folly that was popular before the French Revolution among French aristocrats. Fragonard includes scenes of voyeurism in his paintings. This scene is depicting the stolen kiss in lavish surroundings, containing luxurious details of textures, silks and lace, like the rug with flower pattern, silk draperies, her shawl on the chair, the elegantly clad ladies that are visible through the open door. The dominant French culture influenced how Fragonard chose his themes, that were mostly erotic or love scenes, painted for Louis XV's pleasure-loving court's enjoyment.

This prevents the formation of acyl carnitines, a step that is necessary for the transport of fatty acyl chains from the cytosol into the intermembrane space of the mitochondria. This step is essential to the production of ATP from fatty acid oxidation. Etomoxir has also been identified as a direct agonist of PPARŒ±. An off-target effect has been demonstrated at high concentrations of etomoxir on Coenzyme-A (CoA) metabolism. A double-blind crossover study in human adult males showed that treatment with etomoxir enhanced feelings of hunger and increased meal portion size by 22%. Etomoxir has been reported to decrease the incorporation of palmitic acid and oleic acid into cardiolipin, although it does not affect the activities of cardiolipin biosynthesis and remodeling. Etomoxir has off-target effects. At high concentrations, etomoxir inhibits complex I of the electron transport chain.Yao, C. H., G. Y. Liu, et al. (2018). \\"Identifying off-target effects of etomoxir reveals that carnitine palmitoyltransferase I is essential for cancer cell proliferation independent of beta-oxidation.\\" PLoS Biol 16(3): e2003782. Caution should be exercised when interpreting the metabolic effects of this compound.  Licensing and clinical development  Etomoxir has already been through phase II clinical development for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and heart failure. Etomoxir went through preclinical trials by Byk Gulden laboratories (now Altana Pharma AG) from 1981 to 1984. From 1984 to 1993, etomoxir was developed through phase I and II trials that showed favorable effects on the heart and a good safety profile. In 1999, the patent was out-licensed to MediGene for further trials. In 2001, MediGene was granted extended patent rights for the use of etomoxir for the treatment of congestive heart failure. In 2002, MediGene announced that it terminated a phase II trial for the use of etomoxir for heart failure due to adverse side effects. MediGene funded a study of etomoxir as a treatment of heart failure in 2007, but the study was once again terminated prematurely. Four of the 226 patients taking the drug showed unacceptably high liver transaminase levels, which was determined by the experimenters to likely be due to the treatment. The University of Colorado currently holds patents for the use of etomoxir as an anti-inflammatory and anticarcinogenic agent.Newell, Martha K., Evan Newell, and Elizabeth Villobos-Menvey.

When first described there was a single named species, E. hichensi. History and classification When described, Eoprephasma was known from two isolated wings which are compression-impression fossils preserved in a layer of soft sedimentary rock. Along with other well preserved insect fossils, the Eoprephasma specimens were collected from layers of Ypresian age Lagerst√§tte lake sediments Washington, USA, and an additional three partial Susumanioidea fossils were recovered from British Columbia, Canada. The partial Susumanioidea specimens were found in an unnamed formation belonging to the Kamloops group that outcrops at the McAbee Fossil Beds near Cache Creek, BC. The two E. hichensi wing were recovered from the Tom Thumb Tuff member of the Klondike Mountain Formation in Republic, Washington which is designated the type locality for the species, with the holotype recovered from the \\"Boot hill\\" site #B4131, and the paratype from the \\"Corner lot\\" site #A0307. At the time of description, the species type series consisted of the holotype specimen, SR 12-004-007 and paratype specimen SR 93-10-02 were preserved in the Stonerose Interpretive Center fossil collections. The three Susumanioidea fossils, part/counterpart F-846 and F-951 plus F-1392 and F-1393 are deposited in the Thompson Rivers University. The counterpart specimen F-1099 is also in the Thompson Rivers University collections, while the part side, PB-3825 is at the Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture. All the insects were first studied by Canadian entomologist S Bruce Archibald and German entomologist Sven Bradler, with their 2015 type description of the new genus and species being published in the journal Canadian Entomology. Archibald and Bradler noted the genus name to be a combination of \\"eo\\", from Eocene, \\"pre\\" and \\"Phasma\\", referencing the status of the genus as a stem group phasmatodean. The specific epithet hichensi is in honor of Keir Hichens, who first found the specimen in 2012 and donated it to the Stonerose Interpretive Center. The fossils were described by Archibald and Bradler as the youngest members of the Phasmatodea stem group lineage Susumanioidea. Prior to the 2015 paper, Susumanioidea had been known from Chinese fossils dating to the Jurassic. The youngest member of the superfamily dated to the Paleocene Paskapoo Formation in Alberta, Canada. Due to the incomplete nature of the McAbee fossils, it was not possible for Archibald and Bradler to distinguish them from the Canadian fossils, which are also incomplete. Description The Eoprephasma hichensi specimens are both well preserved, though partial, forewings. The overall length of the holotype forewing is long and has an estimated width of . The paratype is notably smaller, being approximately and only about wide. Both wings have a dark coloration, light veins of varying width, and numerous cross-veins. The wings are distinguished from other Susumanioidea members by both the CuA, apical cubitus vein, and the CuPŒ±, posterior cubitus alpha vein, being forked.

(August 21, 1953 ‚Äì April 12, 2012) was an American serial killer who confessed to, and was convicted of, six murders in Vero Beach and Indian River County, Florida in the 1980s. Gore was executed by lethal injection in 2012, having been on Florida's death row for 28 years. Gore had an accomplice, his cousin Fred Waterfield, and the pair were dubbed the \\"Killing Cousins\\". Waterfield was convicted of two murders, and is currently serving two consecutive life sentences. In 1976 (prior to their committing any murders), police jailed and questioned both Gore and Waterfield after Angela Hommell Austin (age 20) accused them of raping her at gunpoint. The cousins insisted the sex was consensual, and they were not charged in her case. Gore targeted at least four additional women who escaped with their lives.  Background  David Alan Gore was born on August 21, 1953 in Florida. When he was a teenager, he was fired from his first job as a gas station attendant after his boss found a hole that allowed Gore to look into the women's bathroom. Gore was an auxiliary sheriff's deputy and used his badge to commit some of his crimes. Gore also worked as a caretaker of a citrus grove that provided a secluded area in which to rape and murder his victims. Fred Waterfield was born on September 29, 1952 in New Jersey. He is a former high school football player. Gore and Waterfield came to an arrangement, namely that Gore would spot, stalk, and secure potential victims for himself and Waterfield, in exchange for cash payments from Waterfield.  Victims  Their first rape victim was Waterfield's sister. Gore helped hold down the victim and watched as Waterfield raped his own sister. Hsiang Huang Ling and Ying Hua Ling Gore's and Waterfield's first two murder victims were Ying Hua Ling (age 17) and her mother Hsiang Huang Ling (age 48). On February 19, 1981, Gore accosted Ying Ling and brandished his auxiliary police badge to lure the teenager into his truck, after which he drove her to her own home. Once there, he encountered Hsiang Ling and kidnapped both women. Gore later claimed that the mother, tied to a tree, slowly choked to death while he and Waterfield raped the daughter. The pair dismembered the two women and stuffed their body parts into oil drums, which they buried. Judith Kay Daley  The pair's third victim was Judith Daley (age 35), a former Fort Pierce resident visiting from California. On July 15, 1981, Gore disabled Daley's car at the beach, and then offered her a ride to the nearest telephone. Gore drove Daley to a secluded area and met Waterfield, whereupon both men raped Daley. Gore claimed to have disposed of Daley's body in a swamp. One week after Daley's murder, Gore unsuccessfully attempted to abduct a teenage girl using his auxiliary badge. The girl's father filed a complaint, and Gore was stripped of his badge. Days later, police spotted Gore hiding in the back seat of a woman's car, carrying a police scanner, handcuffs, and a pistol. Gore was convicted of armed trespassing and sentenced to five years in prison, but was released on parole in March 1983. Barbara Ann Byer and Angelica LaVallee On May 20, 1983, Gore and Waterfield encountered Orlando hitchhikers Angelica LaVallee and Barbara Ann Byer (both age 14) and picked them up. Gore and Waterfield raped, killed and dismembered both girls. These are the only two crimes for which Waterfield was convicted; he was sentenced to two consecutive life sentences for the two murders. Lynn Elliott and Regan Martin Lynn Elliott (age 17) and Regan Martin (age 14), students at Vero Beach High School, were hitchhiking to Wabasso Beach when Gore and Waterfield picked them up on July 26, 1983. They took both girls to a house owned by Gore's parents. Waterfield soon left, spooked by having seen his sister during the drive. Gore later told police that he bound and placed the girls in different rooms prior to raping them. As he was assaulting Martin, Lynn Elliot‚Äînude, with her hands tied behind her back‚Äîescaped to the driveway, until she lost her footing. According to Gore, \\"I kept running after her then she tripped and fell and then I caught up to her\\". Gore told police \\"I started dragging her back and she was trying, like, resisting, fighting me, so I threw her to the ground. That's when I shot her in the head\\". Gore shot her twice at point-blank range only to realize that a neighbor boy riding his bicycle had witnessed the entire incident. The neighbor boy alerted police, which led to a 90-minute standoff between Gore and law enforcement. Cops arrested Gore and rescued Martin, who was found in the attic naked, handcuffed, and with electrical cords tied around her legs. On December 7, 1983, Gore led police to the remains of three of his six murder victims. These victims were Barbara Ann Byer, Hsiang Huang Ling and her daughter, Ying Hua Ling. He also admitted to killing three girls and two women.  Case timeline  On August 10, 1983, a grand jury charges Gore with first-degree murder with two counts of kidnapping and two counts of sexual battery. On January 6, 1984, Gore's trial is moved from Vero Beach to St. Petersburg, Florida. Two months after on March 16, 1984 the jury convicts him of first-degree murder and after an 11-1 vote he receives the death sentence. On August 22, 1985, the Supreme Court affirms Gore's first-degree murder conviction and death penalty. On January 21, 1985, Waterfield was convicted of the murders of Byer and LaVellee, receiving two consecutive life sentences. On March 3, 1988, Governor Bob Martinez signs Gore's death warrant. On July 5, 2007, the Florida Supreme Court confirms Gore's death sentence.  Death  Gore was executed by lethal injection at 6:19 p.m. on Thursday, April 12, 2012, having exhausted all legal appeals. As Gore lay strapped to a gurney in the death chamber, he said: \\"I'm sorry. I've had remorse....I'm not the man I was back then. I don't fear death.\\"  See also  * List of serial killers in the United States  References  Category:1953 births Category:2012 deaths Category:20th-century American criminals Category:American male criminals Category:American serial killers Category:Executed American serial killers Category:Male serial killers Category:American rapists Category:American murderers of children Category:American people convicted of murder Category:People convicted of murder by Florida Category:21st-century executions by Florida Category:21st- century executions of American people Category:People executed by Florida by lethal injection Category:Executed people from Florida Category:Violence against women in the United States Category:People executed for murder ","title":"David Alan Gore"},{"id":"45693580","text":"Santiago Gonz√°lez and Scott Lipsky were the defending champions, but Gonz√°lez did not participate.

She won 40 national tennis titles and made 37 appearances in the Dutch national hockey team. Early life and sports career Madzy Rollin Couquerque was born on 14 April 1903 in The Hague, Netherlands. Her father Louis Marie Rollin Couquerque was a jurist. Her mother died in 1918. After she returned from a boarding school in Bloemendaal in 1921 she started a bookkeeping job at an insurance company which provided her with the income that allowed her to pursue her sports career. Tennis Rollin Couquerque became Dutch singles tennis champion 14 times between 1927 and 1947. In 1959, aged 56, she reached her last singles final at the Dutch Championships which she lost to Mientje Vletter-Tettelaar who was half her age. In addition she won 14 doubles titles and 12 mixed doubles titles, making a total of 40 national championship titles during her career. Her best singles results in a Grand Slam tournament were achieved at the French Championships. At the 1928 Championships she reached the quarterfinal which she lost in straight sets to eventual champion and World no.1 Helen Wills. In 1935 she again reached the quarterfinal and was defeated by Margaret Scriven. At the 1936 Championships she was seeded sixth but lost in the third round to Marie-Louise Horn. Her best result came at the 1938 Championships when, seeded seventh and at age 35, she made it to the semifinal in which she was beaten by Nelly Adamson. Between 1928 and 1951 she participated in 15 Wimbledon Championships. Her best result in the singles event was reaching the fourth round in 1937, losing to fifth-seeded Alice Marble. In the doubles she reached the quarterfinal in 1929 partnering compatriot Kea Bouman. With Joop Knottenbelt she reached the fourth round of the mixed doubles in 1932 and equalled that result with Henk Timmer in 1933 and 1936. In 1929 she won the singles title at the Spanish International Championships, played at the Real Club de Tenis Barcelona, after a three-sets victory in the final against Ida Adamoff. She took part in the 1956 Australian Championships, losing in the first round to eventual champion Mary Carter. Hockey In the winter months she played field hockey for HOC (HHV-ODIS Combinatie) in The Hague. She made the first team in 1921 which became national champion that year. HOC, with Rollin Couquerque, remained the undefeated national champion until 1935. Rollin Couquerque made her first appearance in the Dutch national team in 1926, playing against Belgium in Brussels as a leftback. She would make 37 national appearances and captained the team in the 1930s until the outbreak of the World War II interrupted her hockey activities.

During his brief 15-year career, he penned the scripts for 24 films, as well as producing over 20 film shorts. In 1935, he began work on a script entitled Harlem Cavalcade. He authored another half-dozen films during the remaining years of the 1930s, before devoting his efforts full-time to this manuscript. Harlem Cavalcade was an epic story of life among Black-Americans, beginning with their relationship to the Dutch community of New Amsterdam in 1626, through 1938. A series of vignettes, it incorporated the real-life stories of such notable Americans as Booker T. Washington, Frederick Douglas, George Washington Carver, Joe Lewis, Satchel Paige, and Cab Calloway. Lipton worked on the script right up until his death in 1961.

This material is used in the radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) that power Voyager 1, Voyager 2, Galileo, Ulysses, Cassini, and New Horizons spacecraft. SiGe thermoelectric material converts enough radiated heat into electrical power to fully meet the power demands of each spacecraft. The properties of the material and the remaining components of the RTG contribute towards the efficiency of this thermoelectric conversion.  Properties  Components of the SiGe unicouple Heavily doped semiconductors, such as silicon-germanium (SiGe) thermoelectric couples (also called thermocouples or unicouples), are used in space exploration. SiGe alloys present good thermoelectric properties. Their performance in thermoelectric power production is characterized by high dimensionless figures-of-merit (ZT) under high temperatures, which has been shown to be near 2 in some nanostructured-SiGe models. SiGe alloy devices are mechanically rugged and can withstand severe shock and vibration due to its high tensile strength (i.e. >7000 psi) and low dislocation density. SiGe material is malleable with standard metallurgical equipment and bonds easily to construct components. SiGe alloy devices can operate under high temperatures (i.e. >1300 ÀöC) without degradation due to their electronic stability, low thermal expansion coefficient and high oxidation resistance. Near the sun, solar cell performance deteriorates from high incident particle flux and high temperatures from heat flux. However, thermoelectric energy conversion systems that use thermoelectric materials (e.g. SiGe alloys) as a supplemental source of power for missions near the sun can operate unprotected in vacuum and air environments under high temperatures due to their low sensitivity to radiation damage. Such properties have made SiGe thermoelectrics convenient for power generation in space. The multifoil cold stack assembly, composed of molybdenum, tungsten, stainless steel, copper, and alumina materials, provides the insulation between the electrical and thermal currents of the system. The SiGe n-leg doped with boron and SiGe p-leg doped with phosphorus act as the intermediary between the heat source and electrical assembly.  Power generation  SiGe thermocouples in an RTG convert heat directly into electricity. Thermoelectric power generation requires a constantly maintained temperature difference among the junctions of the two dissimilar metals (i.e. Si and Ge) to produce a low power closed circuit electric current without extra circuitry or external power sources. A large array of SiGe thermocouples/unicouples form a thermopile that was incorporated into the design of radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) used in the missions Voyager, Galileo, Ulysses, Cassini, and New Horizons. On these spacecraft, Pu-238 dioxide fuel undergoes natural decay. The SiGe thermocouples/unicouples convert this heat to hundreds of Watts of electrical power.  Thermocouple/unicouple assembly  Conceptual diagram of a thermocouple (unicouple) The thermocouples/unicouples attached to the outer shell consist of a SiGe alloy n-leg doped with boron and a SiGe p-leg doped with phosphorus to provide thermoelectric polarity to the couple.Bennett, G.L; Lombardo, James; Hemler, Richard; Silverman, Gil; Whitmore C.; Amos, Wayne; Johnson, E.; Schock, Alfred; Zocher, Roy; Keenan, Thomas; Hagan, James; and Richard Englehart. Mission of Daring: The General-Purpose Heat Source Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator, AIAA 2006-4096, 4th International Energy Conversion Engineering Conference and Exhibit (IECEC), 26‚Äì29 June 2006, San Diego, California (Accessed 10 February 2015) The electrical and thermal currents of the system are separated by bonding the SiGe alloy thermocouple to a multifoil cold stack assembly of molybdenum, tungsten, stainless steel, copper, and alumina components. Several layers of Astroquartz silica fiber yarn electrically insulate the legs of the SiGe thermocouples. In between the inner insulation system and the outer shell, copper connectors form the electrical circuit, which uses a two-string, series-parallel wiring design to connect the unicouples. The circuit loop arrangement minimizes the net magnetic field of the generator.  Application history  RTG Space Exploration Timeline SiGe has been used as a material in RTGs since 1976. Each mission that has used RTG technology involves exploration of far-reaching regions of the solar system. The most recent mission, New Horizons (2005), was originally set for a 3-year exploration, but was extended to 17 years.  Multi-hundred-watt (MHW) applications  Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 spacecraft launched in August and September 1977 required multi-hundred-watt (MHW) RTG containing plutonium oxide fuel spheres for an operational life appropriate for exploration of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Conversion of the decay heat of the plutonium to electrical power was accomplished through 312 silicon-germanium (SiGe) thermoelectric couples. A hot junction temperature of 1273 K (1832 ¬∞F) with a cold junction temperature of 573 K (572 ¬∞F) compose the temperature gradient in the thermoelectric couple in the RTG. This mechanism provided the total electrical power to operate the spacecraft's instruments, communications and other power demands. The RTG on Voyager will produce adequate electrical power for spacecraft operation until about the year 2020. Similar MHW-RTG models are also used on the two U.S. Air Force communications Lincoln Experimental Satellites 8 and 9 (LES-8/9).  General Purpose Heat Source (GPHS) applications  The Galileo spacecraft launched on October 18, 1989, the Ulysses on October 6, 1990, the Cassini on October 15, 1997, and the New Horizons on January 19, 2006. All of these spacecraft contain the general purpose heat source (GPHS) RTG commissioned by the U.S. Department of Energy. The GPHS-RTG employs identical heat-to-electrical conversion technology used in the MHW-RTGs from the Voyager missions, using SiGe thermocouples/unicouples and the Pu-238‚Äìfueled GPHS. New Horizons made its historic flyby past Pluto and its moons on July 14, 2015 (see JHU Applied Physics website). The spacecraft's next destination will be a small Kuiper Belt object (KBO) known as 486958 Arrokoth that orbits nearly a billion miles beyond Pluto.https://www.nasa.gov/feature/nasa-s-new-horizons-team-selects- potential-kuiper-belt-flyby-target Based on performance, data and modeling for the SiGe alloy RTGs, the GPHS-RTGs on Ulysses, Cassini and New Horizons are expected to meet or exceed the remaining power performance requirements for their deep-space missions.  RTG alternative  Missions after 2010 requiring RTGs will instead use the Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (MMRTG) containing lead telluride (PbTe) thermocouples and Pu-238 dioxide for spacecraft power applications.

The leaves have a distinctive, wing-like shape and the flowers are in white or cream-coloured heads at the ends of its branches. It is classified as a vulnerable species. Description Melaleuca biconvexa grows to a height of (sometimes to ) and has fibrous to papery bark. Its leaves are arranged in alternating pairs (decussate), long and wide, narrow oval in shape. The leaves are distinctive in having the mid-vein in a groove with either side of the leaf blade curving up wing-like from this vein. The flowers are cream to white, at or near the ends of the branches in heads of 2 to 10 flowers, the heads up to in diameter. The stamens are arranged in five bundles around the flower with 10 to 20 stamens per bundle. Flowering occurs over 3 to 4 weeks in September and November and is followed by fruit which are urn-shaped, woody capsules about in diameter and long with the sepals remaining as teeth on the rim. Taxonomy and naming The name Melaleuca pauciflora Turcz. was misapplied to this taxon for many years before a review by the botanist Norman Byrnes. It was first formally described in 1984 in the journal Austrobaileya. The specific epithet (biconvexa) is from the Latin bi‚Äë meaning \\"two\\" and convexus, \\"convex\\", in reference to the shape of the leaves in cross section. Distribution and habitat This melaleuca occurs in scattered populations in coastal areas from Port Macquarie to Jervis Bay. It grows in damp places, often near streams or low-lying areas, often in eucalypt forest on sandy alluvial soil, on low slopes and sheltered places. Conservation status Melaleuca biconvexa is able to resprout after fire but faces a number of threats to its survival including land clearing, alteration of drainage patterns and swamp reclamation, grazing and trampling by stock and competition from noxious aquatic weeds such as Sagittaria platyphylla. Most populations are on private land, making conservation efforts difficult and the species has been classified as vulnerable under the Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995.

They are a product of RxSport.  History  Furniture maker David Chandler opened of Chandler bats in 2010. David started RxSport in Germantown, Pennsylvania, and quickly turned around to get into making Chandler bats in Norristown. In the first year that Chandler bats were available on the public market, they sold 11,000 bats out of a warehouse. Chandler has increased production every year since their opening. In 2013, the company received a $500,000 investment from Benjamin Franklin Technology Partners of Southeastern Pennsylvania for expansion. A large portion of these funds was put towards purchasing more raw materials, maple and ash wood, in an effort to further increase production of bats. Chandler has partnered with EvoShield, a baseball apparel and equipment company, to make a new bat, the EvoShield Swing Series. They are also looking to expand beyond strictly wood bats, and are exploring the idea of creating metal bats.

The lower knowledge consists of all textual knowledge - the four Vedas, the science of pronunciation etc., the code of rituals, grammar, etymology, metre and astrology. The higher knowledge is by which the immutable and the imperishable Atman is realized, which knowledge brings about the direct realization of the Supreme Reality, the source of All. The knowledge of the Atman is very subtle; it cannot be obtained out of one's own effort; the Atman cannot be intuitively apprehended by mere intellectual equipments. Thus, Angiras draws the distinction between the way of knowledge and the way of realization, as between opinion and truth. For understanding this for realizing the Reality the aspirant must seek a teacher. The teacher who has already realized his identity with the Atman alone can impart this much sought-after wisdom on the strength of his own experiences. A human being is blessed with the faculty of self-knowledge which is Apara Vidya or logical reasoning and also with the faculty of understanding and self-awareness which is Para Vidya or quantum logic. Para Vidya is defined as the intuitive vision of non-duality; it is the transcendental knowledge which is beyond all limits of knowledge, experience and reason, which is, beyond intellect, mind and sense. The Absolute, which is Truth, which is Reality, is neither an expression nor a reflection of itself; it is non-dual being devoid of otherness, and it cannot be an object of knowledge in the ordinary sense as it surpasses the intellect in subtleness. Knowledge is truth and truth is correspondence of an apprehension with its object. It is the intellect which moves within the sphere of duality resulting in delusion, wrong identification etc. Para Vidya is the intuitive level of vidya that stems from a unity, and manifests as a vision, manifests as an experience. The vision of the Nirguna Brahman is gained through Para Vidya, it is the highest of all knowledge. The method of self-realization involves sravana , manana and nididhyasana , and not rituals. Para Vidya is samyagdarcanam, the pure philosophic esoteric doctrine which teaches that Brahman is without attributes (gunas), without any distinction (vicesha) and without limitations (upadhis), that it undefinable, alone and without a second. Reality is incapable of increase; it does not change into anything else. When the true identity becomes known then the existence of the transmigrating soul and of Brahman as the creator, both vanish. Para Vidya, concerned with Brahman, the highest reality and value, and the final terminus, cannot be conceived as an inquiry; all scientific and ethical inquiries are Apara Vidya, nevertheless, the scientists engaged in such inquiries not only guide the selection of means to an end but also guide choice of the ends. Vedanta deals with the transition from avidya to vidya, that is, from the imagined life to the life of true perception. Maya is avidya. Vidya is tattvavidya, the knowledge of reality as it is in itself. Apara Vidya is rooted in \\"adhyasa\\" and \\"ignorance\\", Para Vidya is transcendent of the Apara Vidya and aims at realizing Reality as it is and not as it appears, and it supplants and corrects conventional knowledge and conventional belief, both. Shankara's concept of adhyasa involves the logical interpretation of the vedic vakyas. He explains that all epistemic, practical and socio-cultural distinctions are based on the mis-identification of the self as non-self (anatman) and of the non-self as the self. Para Vidya is absolute knowledge. Avidya lapses into Apara vidya, and again into Para Vidya. Avidya, Apara Vidya and Paravya are three fold phases of experience, the three transitions in knowledge of the transforming cognizer. Para Vidya alone is pramarthika jnana beyond all illusory appearances. Para Vidya is the knowledge of the Absolute whereas Apara Vidya is the knowledge of the world; the former has Reality as its content and possesses a unique quality of ultimacy which is singular and free from reason, senses, etc., but the latter has the phenomenal world as its content. Para Vidya does not require any support or proof, and is irrefutable. The aim of integral education is to integrate all dichotomies, to integrate the material and spiritual dimensions of the human personality; it does not recognize the description of vidya as Para Vidya (higher spiritual knowledge) and Apara Vidya (the knowledge of the senses and the surface mind) because the latter without the light and influence of the former is avidya or false knowledge.

The Apollo space mission immediately prior to the moon mission explodes on the launchpad. AXE Chief, David Hawk, suspects sabotage and sends Nick Carter, agent N-3, to investigate. The saboteur is identified as a member of the launchpad crew but he is soon found dead ‚Äì his murder staged to look like suicide. He was last seen in a high-end nightclub in West Palm Beach with NASA physician and prime suspect, Dr Joy Sun. Carter and his inexperienced young assistant, Candy Sweet, investigate the nightclub. They discover a sophisticated covert surveillance operation run by The Syndicate ‚Äì an organized crime gang. They also discover compromising photographs of Dr Sun with Reno Tree ‚Äì former hitman for the Las Vegas mob and owner of the nightclub. Hawk informs Carter that NASA is secretly preparing to launch a replacement mission (Phoenix One) in the next few days using the reserve crew. The leader of the reserve crew, Colonel Glenn Eglund, has been seriously injured in an assassination attempt at Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston. Carter is to impersonate Eglund as it is expected that the assassin will strike again knowing that they failed the first time. Carter, heavily made up to resemble Eglund, resumes training at Houston. He is attacked on the moon surface simulator by an unknown assailant but manages to break his assailant's wrist and escape. AXE discovers that the secret information about the Phoenix One launch has been leaked by someone high up in NASA. As the Phoenix One crew flies from Houston to Cape Canaveral for the launch, Carter confronts Dr Sun with the photograph. She is aware Carter is not Eglund and may be a US government agent. She denies trying to have Carter killed. An explosion causes the plane to decompress at high altitude but the crew manages to land the plane safely. Carter realises that the Apollo program security chief, Major Sollitz, is the saboteur. Candy Sweet asks for Carter's help searching the swamps at the edge of the Kennedy Space Center. Major Sollitz is forced to crash a remotely controlled helicopter into them and is killed in the process. Carter traces the radio transmitter that controlled the helicopter to a nearby gas station. He discovers two men packing away electronic equipment on to a boat. Carter kills them both. Candy Sweet pulls a gun on Carter. Carter dives over board and escapes. Carter returns to the nightclub in West Palm Beach posing as conman and gambler, Mickey Elgar, looking for a high-stakes poker game. He discovers Candy Sweet in a relationship with Reno Tree. Carter is beaten and awakens in the Riviera Beach home of Alex Simian ‚Äì owner of NASA contractor, General Kinetic. He is invited to play cards with Simian and the leaders of The Syndicate. It is clear from the discussions that Simian is greatly in debt to The Syndicate. Simian needs General Kinetic to displace rival contractor Connelly and secure the US$20 billion Apollo program funding to refloat his holdings. Simian has kidnapped the families of the Apollo program electronic guidance crew and held them captive in the General Kinetic medical center in Miami. The Phoenix One launch has been sabotaged to alter course after lift-off and crash into Miami. Carter and Joy Sun head for the medical center. Carter leaves Joy Sun to recuperate in a cheap hotel while he surveils the medical center. When he returns he finds Joy Sun missing and Candy Sweet in her place ‚Äì murdered. Carter is captured, drugged and taken to the medical center. When he regains consciousness there are only 4 minutes to the sabotaged launch of Phoenix One. Simian taunts him via a closed-circuit TV link from his beachfront home. Carter escapes and manages to contact NASA mission controllers to delay the launch for 24 hours. Carter races to Simian's home. He breaks in and confronts Simian who tries to escape by motor launch. Carter kills Reno Tree. Simian loses control of the motor launch and crashes it killing himself. The next day, Carter relaxes in a Miami hotel watching the launch of Phoenix One in bed with a girlfriend.

The CPA is an agency that helps Chinese immigrants assimilate into American culture through citizen classes, English classes, and involvement in local activism. The organization has engaged in political action as the motive force behind Boston's Unemployed Workers Rights Campaign (UWRC) during the decade of the 1980s. Members have also protested for affordable housing in Boston's Chinatown following mass construction of luxury condos. Additionally, in 2014, the CPA has created partnerships with Boston supermarkets in order to bring job opportunities for Asian immigrants into Boston.  History  The Chinese Progressive Association (CPA) was first opened in Boston, MA in 1977. The founders of the organization were American-born Chinese youth returning to the community, immigrant workers and retired residents living in New England who longed for a connection to their home country.May Louie, \\"With One Heart Toward the New Era,\\" Chinese Progressive Association Records, 1976-2006. M163 Archives and Special Collections Department, Northeastern University, Boston, Massachusetts, Box 1, Folder 34 Today, the CPA consists of fluent Chinese speakers, manual labor workers, and low income families.Chinese Progressive Association, \\"About Us: History,\\" www.CPA.org, accessed January 30, 2015. The organization was first located in an abandoned garment factory loft in Boston, MA where many social activities were held such as apple picking, group dinners, and ping pong. Along with the social aspects, the organization also holds citizen classes and youth programs. The CPA strives to create more working opportunities and better, more affordable living environments for Chinese immigrants residing in the greater Boston area.  CPA's mission  The Chinese Progressive Association holds a set of goals for their community. Its founding principles were: * Unite with and work for the interests of the Chinese community * Promote friendship between people of the United States and China * Support other organizations working for the interests of the peopleChinese Progressive Association Workers Center Proposal, Northeastern Archives and Special Collections, Box 1, folder 29, M163 Northeastern University Libraries, Boston, MA., 1976-2006. Current literature describes the organization's mission as: The Chinese Progressive Association (CPA) is a grassroots community organization which works for full equality and empowerment of the Chinese community in the Greater Boston area and beyond. Our activities seek to improve the living and working conditions of Chinese Americans and to involve ordinary community members in making decisions that affect our lives.  Membership and activities  In order to become a member of the Chinese Progressive Association, a basic form must be completed. The document asks for contact information, as well as preference on activities. Also, interested parties are asked to list their favorite films and their availability for meeting with other members.Chinese Progressive Association, Northeastern Archives and Special Collections, Box 1, folder 40 membership forms, M163, Northeastern University Libraries, Boston, MA., 1977-1985. The CPA organizes a variety of activities for its members including community services such as assistance with tax forms and immigration documents. An emphasis is placed on seamlessly assimilating members into American culture. Also, the organization offers its members an opportunity to become involved in community issues such as the displacement and retraining of garment workers. Additionally, many recreational activities are offered including the celebration of film and theatrical performances from China. The goal of this wide range of activities is for Chinese immigrants to feel as though they are equal members of American society while still maintaining the ethnic identity of their heritage.Chinese Progressive Association, Records 1976-2006, M163, Box 1, Folder # 40, Membership forms 1977-1985 The CPA holds joint events with the PRC government.  Activism  Affordable housing One of the main issues the Chinese Progressive Association is concerned with is affordable housing in Boston's Chinatown. In 2012, 33 residents were evicted from a large apartment complex, named the See Sun building, due to unfit living conditions. Most of the tenants were elderly and of lower class status. After being evicted, the residents sought public housing but many had difficulty finding an affordable place to live.Bryan Marquard, \\"Protestesters highlight Chinatown's affordable housing crisis,\\" Boston Globe, Feb. 9, 2014. This has been a recent trend in Chinatown and replacing these affordable rents are new luxury condos, leaving no room for those on a lower income. Specifically, on Chinatown's Washington Street, Millennium Place, a new development is offering condos starting at $1 million.Yvonne Abraham, \\"Longtime residents are lost in Chinatown's building boom,\\" Boston Globe, Feb. 6, 2014. In February 2014, the CPA led a rally to protest the new luxury condos and gathered 70 Chinatown residents to the event. Many of the activists held banners that stated, 'Remain, Reclaim, Rebuild Boston'. Before the rally ended, participants hung poster boards on the evicted See Sun building and displayed quotes from the residents who were evicted.  Health  The Chinese Progressive Association does grassroots level research and work to protect the health of low-wage workers and communities of color. They acknowledge the fact that many come to America because they believe that it gives them a better life, but they often fall through the cracks of the system and do not get the media attention they deserve. Due to this, CPA creates publications and data reports, called community-based participatory research, to educate people of the little-known stories of the low-income and working-class immigrant Chinese community in San Francisco. Several of these reports showcase that many immigrant workers are struggling to survive in sweatshop-level working conditions that are often hazardous and stressful. CPA is advocating for healthier jobs for immigrant restaurant workers in San Francisco‚Äôs Chinatown.  Wage Theft  CPA fights against restaurant workers paid below minimum wage, denied overtime pay, deducted pay when sick, and not paid at all. They believe that, even though labor laws exist, they are not enforced enough. In their 2010 report, they revealed that almost 60% of workers reported wage theft in one way or another and 1 in 2 workers received less than minimum wage. CPA called for a Wage Theft Task Force after the report and the San Francisco Board of Supervisors created the taskforce on June 12, 2012 to address their concerns amidst others addressed by various community organizations. Job opportunities Along with affordable housing, the CPA has been active in providing job opportunities for Chinese immigrants in the Boston area through their Workers Center, founded in 1987. After factories in Chinatown had been closed down, unemployment skyrocketed in the area, specifically for women. In 1989 the unemployment for Chinese women in Boston was double that of other women workers in the area. The CPA along with other organizations, worked to increase the unemployment benefits. This was all part of the 1989 Unemployed Workers Rights Campaign, which strived to create more job opportunities for the unemployed.Chinese Progressive Association, Records 1976-2006, M163, Box 1, Folder # 29, (1989, Feb). Boston Briefs. In 1989, Chinese immigrants rallied at Boston's State House to try to get Legislature to reform unemployment benefits. The goal of the activists was to call for the support of two bills. One would increase the unemployment rate and the other would require that translators were hired at the Department of Employment Training for non-English speakersMichael Bonn, \\"Immigrants Rally at State House,\\" The Harvard Crimson, April 5, 1989. In 2014, the CPA led an effort to provide Chinatown and South End residents with job opportunities in new stores in the area. The group worked with City Councilor, Ayanna Pressley, and the City Office of Economic Development to initiate goals for local hiring and establish a multilingual application and interview process. The CPA, specifically, partnered with the new Whole Foods market in the South End, and worked with the company in order to create opportunities for Chinatown residents. By 2015, Whole Foods market hired 108 new employees, 26% of which were Chinese Americans working at a $11 per hour rate. Lydia Lowe, the director of the Chinese Progressive Association stated that the reason behind the success of this partnership was the clear monitoring and reporting that went on during the collaboration. Also, she highlighted the importance of the multilingual application process that allowed immigrants to communicate and fully showcase their skills and talents. The CPA's collaboration with Whole Foods will extend beyond the new hiring opportunities. The supermarket provides English classes for immigrants and customer service training for their employees.

Geography Phou Xang He National Protected Area is located about east of Savannakhet, near the village of Phalan and covers parts of Assaphone, Thaphalanxay, Phin, Xepon and Viraboury districts. The park's area has been estimated at . Flora and fauna The park's main forest types are evergreen, mixed deciduous and dry dipterocarp forests. Mixed deciduous forest has the largest coverage at 44% of the park's area. Pygmy slow loris Threatened animal species in the park include elephant, tiger, leopard, clouded leopard, black crested gibbon, Fran√ßois' langur, giant muntjac, gaur, pygmy slow loris, dhole, Asian black bear, sun bear, banteng and large-spotted civet. Phou Xang He's large area and relatively pristine state make the park important in conserving these species in an undisturbed habitat. Other park species include macaque and douc langur. Mountain fulvetta Bird life includes the threatened red-collared woodpecker. Other less vulnerable species include ratchet-tailed treepie and mountain fulvetta. Threats Phou Xang He faces a number of environmental threats. Local poverty has resulted in hunting and forest product harvesting in the park. Some habitat loss has resulted from expansion of lands for agriculture. Road development and improvement may increase opportunities for illegal trade in wildlife and forest products.

Augur is developed by Forecast Foundation, which was founded in 2014 by Jack Peterson, Joey Krug, and Jeremy Gardner. Forecast Foundation is advised by Ron Bernstein, founder of now-defunct company Intrade, and Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin. Operation Augur allows any user to create a prediction market on any topic. There are two kinds of markets. Categorical markets have up to 7 options; for example, \\"Will Alice win X election?\\" with \\"yes\\" and \\"no\\" as options, or \\"Who will win X election?\\" with 5 candidates as options. These markets are winners take all, making them similar to binary options. Scalar markets offer a spectrum of numerical outcomes; for example, \\"What will the closing price of Apple's stock be on January 1 2021?\\" Traders can \\"long\\" or \\"short\\" any value, i.e. bet that the result will be higher or lower than a certain value. If a trader longs at X value, the more above X the result is, the more money they make (and similarly for shorts). Note that \\"Invalid\\" is one of the outcomes in all markets, to help prevent scam markets and ensure that market questions & resolutions are unambiguous. To resolve markets, \\"reporting\\" fees are used to incentivize the reporting of market outcomes. Augur uses an ERC-20 token called REPv2 to incentivize reporters on its network to back their reports with tokens. The REPv2 token holders are entitled to the trading fees generated on the platform. Augur's security model has been rigorously quantified and shown to be secure. Augur runs on Ethereum. History After a crowdfunding in August 2015, the project launched in July 2018. Soon after the platform launched, users had created death pools ‚Äî or assassination markets ‚Äî on famous people. Augur's user numbers dropped off sharply after launch in 2018: from 265 daily users in early July, to 37 on 8 August. In July 2018, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission noted resemblance of the Augur contracts to binary options, which would fall under its jurisdiction. Augur's decentralised design may allow it to sidestep regulatory difficulties, because Augur is just a protocol that allows users to set up their own prediction market, which developer Joseph Krug says \\"shift(s) legal responsibility to bettors\\". In July 2020, Augur v2 was released. It included dramatic changes including the usage of DAI (a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar) for trading, faster resolution of market outcomes (24 hours vs. v1's 7 days), a more user-friendly interface, making \\"Invalid\\" a tradeable outcome, allowing market creators to add affiliate fees to encourage others to share the market, and allowing the creation of orders without any fees. Forbes described Augur v2 as \\"a significant leap forward in the world of decentralized applications that function similar to the internet but without the need for trusted third parties. If successful, the profound upgrades could be used to more than just place horse-bets without a bookie; they could mark a turning point in the next generation of the internet.

Autor (born 1967) is an American economist and professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where he also acts as co- director of the School Effectiveness and Inequality Initiative.Curriculum Vitae of David Autor Although Autor has contributed to a variety of fields in economics his research generally focuses on topics from labor economics.  Education  David Autor received a B.A. in psychology from Tufts University in 1989, followed by an M.A. and Ph.D. in public policy from the John F. Kennedy School of Government (Harvard University) in 1994 and 1999.  Academic career  After completing his Ph.D. David Autor was hired as assistant professor at MIT's economics department, where he became the Pentti J.K. Kouri Career Development Assistant Professor of Economics in 2002 before being promoted to associate professor in 2003 and receiving tenure in 2005. He finally was made full professor at MIT in 2008. In parallel to his position at MIT Autor is or has been affiliated with several research institutions, including the National Bureau of Economic Research, the Poverty Action Lab and IZA, is or has been the editor of economic academic journals such as the Journal of Economic Perspectives (2009‚Äì14), Journal of Labor Economics (2007‚Äì08), Journal of Economic Literature (2004‚Äì06) and the Review of Economics and Statistics (2002-2008). Finally, he is (together with Joshua Angrist and Parag Pathak) a co-director of the MIT School Effectiveness and Inequality Initiative (SEII), a research program focusing on the economics of education and the relationship between human capital and the American income distribution, as well as an associate director of the NBER Disability Research Center.  Research  David Autor's research can be broadly categorized into five strands: (1) Inequality, technological change, and globalization; (2) disability and labor force participation; (3) labor market intermediation; (4) neighborhoods, housing market spillovers, and price controls; and (5) labor market impacts of wrongful discharge protections.Classification of Autor's research on his MIT webpage The economics bibliographic database IDEAS/RePEc ranks him among the top 5% of economists under a number of criteria, including average rank score, number of works and number of citations.IDEAS profile of David Autor His most cited article, co-authored with Alan B. Krueger and Lawrence F. Katz, studies the effect of skill-biased technological change in the form of computerization on the diverging U.S. education wage differentials and finds evidence suggesting that computerization has increased skill-based wage premia in the U.S. by requiring rapid skill upgrading, which in turn has increased the labor demand for college graduates relative to workers without tertiary education as well as the wage premium associated with a college degree.Autor, D., Katz, L.F., Krueger, A.B. (1998). Computing Inequality: Have Computers Changed the Labor Market? Quarterly Journal of Economics, 113(4), pp. 1169-1213. In an influential 2013 study co-authored with David Dorn and Gordon H. Hanson, Autor showed that U.S. exposure to Chinese trade competition \\"caused higher unemployment, lower labor force participation, and reduced wages in local labor markets that house import-competing manufacturing industries\\". The study nonetheless finds that trade is a net gain for the population as a whole, and Autor has been an advocate for the Trans-Pacific Partnership as a means to protect U.S. workers. In 2020, Dr. Autor received the 25th Anniversary Special Recognition Heinz Award for his work and also received attention for his work with Elisabeth Reynolds on the adverse impacts of coronavirus disease 2019 on the office economy.

She was a major contributor to 1980s Qu√©b√©coise feminist language theory, known as √©criture au f√©minin, which explores the relationship between language, bodies, and feminist politics.

Guernica Editions, 2002. . p. 231. Scott was raised in a bilingual community in rural Eastern Ontario and educated in English and Modern Languages and French literature at Queen's University and the University of Grenoble, respectively, before moving to Montreal, Quebec in 1967, where she was involved in leftist and ind√©pendantiste movements of the 1970s. Initially working as a journalist, she was a founding editor of publications such as The Last Post, Des luttes et des rires des femmes, Spirale and Tessera. Beginning in 1980, she taught journalism at Concordia University until 1991, and published novels and essay collections. Many of Scott's works explore her experience as an anglophone involved in Qu√©b√©coise political and literary movements. Scott, along with other Qu√©becoise feminist literary theorists like Nicole Brossard and France Th√©oret, published La th√©orie, un dimanche, a collection of essays and creative work that explores the gendered writing subject in language. Her prose work draws heavily on poetic forms and structures, and was anthologized in Prismatic Publics: Innovative Canadian Women's Poetry and Poetics (2009). In an interview published on Lemon Hound, Scott said: \\"I like to think of each sentence‚Äîas much as possible‚Äîas a performative unit. A call. The space between the sentences is where the audience or reader bridges with her energy, and in her way, the gap. My debt to poetry has to do with resisting the passive reader.\\" Her works have been noted for their experimental sentence structures and their emphasis on syntax.

The team is named after the mountain range that runs through the Pacific Northwest and their mascots are gender-neutral Sasquatches (a.k.a. Big Foots), named Casey and Kid Casey, both colored blue and gray. The team's stated core values are integrity, community, and athletic excellence.  AUDL team (open roster)  During the season, the Cascades play 12 regular season games, with up to four post-season games dependent on results. In its inaugural season in 2015, the team placed 2nd in the AUDL West Division, losing in the final round of the playoffs to eventual champion San Jose Spiders. In 2016 the team beat the San Francisco Flamethrowers to win the West Division and advance to AUDL Championship Weekend in Madison, Wisconsin. There the Cascades staged a victory against the hometown favorite Madison Radicals and advanced to the championship game, where they lost to the undefeated Dallas Roughnecks. In 2017, the Cascades placed third in the West Division and did not qualify for the divisional playoff. In 2018, they placed fifth (last) in the West Division and did not qualify for the divisional playoff.

Yusei Kurusu is \\"Luck Stealer\\", a Japanese assassin with the ability to drain a target of their \\"luck\\" and leave them only with misfortune. Soon after the target dies following an unfortunate series of events (example: a collapsing roof, an out of control car, or falling sign). He does so in order to sustain his daughter, Karin, who was born without any luck, and will die if Kurusu does not keep giving her it. She is the only person who can \\"receive\\" Kurusu's luck. Characters Main characters Yusei Kurusu aka \\"Luck Stealer\\" - Protagonist of the story. He was born with the ability to drain people of their luck by touching them. Left with bad luck, the person is doomed to die an unfortunate or accidental death. Kurusu himself accidentally killed his parents and uncle by unknowingly absorbing their luck. He also ended up killing a bully at the orphanage he lived in after his family's death, as well as a school mate who had picked a fight with him. After leaving the gang he had joined and marrying Rika Kinoshita, his steady girlfriend, Kurusu gets a job at \\"Flamingo\\" as an assassin to collect luck. Initially he carried out any hit, but after his wife died he swore to only steal from \\"bad guys\\" so as to honor her memory. While leaving a person with nothing but bad luck, Kurusu will become extremely lucky if he absorbs enough. It can reach a point where he is able to walk through speeding traffic, or dodge oncoming bullets without so much as trying. Though he is often sharp, and distant towards people, he loves his daughter, whom he must give luck to or else she will die. Kurusu has the appearance of a \\"foreigner\\", silver or white hair and blue eyes, and often wears sunglasses. He is also in possession of a cross that belongs to the church of ____. Karin: Kurusu's daughter, who was born without luck. Though somewhat ignorant of her condition and her father's power, she understands that she needs \\"a charm\\" (which in reality is her father's touch) to stay safe. Despite all of this, she is a very bright and happy child, who always looks out for others. She lives with her maternal grandparents, as Kurusu is often too busy with his \\"work\\". Supporting characters Nakato: A former assassin himself for the mob, he is now the manager of the Flamingo bar, and a small group of hitmen. His number one is the Luck Stealer. He first encountered Kurusu while carrying out a job. Intrigued by Kurusu, he lets him live, and later allows him to work as an assassin. Shinya Amasaki: Flamingo's former number one hitman, Shinya trained Kurusu during his early days as an assassin. Despite his normally calm demeanor and charm, he is a sadist and can be very violent. He is also very manipulative and cunning. Shinya is from a rich yakuza family, and therefore lives an extravagant lifestyle. This also makes him a target of police investigation. In order to avert attention, he sets Kurusu up so that the detective watching him would instead go after Kurusu. Rika Kinoshita: Kurusu's deceased wife and Karin's mother. She and Kurusu first met when both were visiting the crash sight of their friend ____. Kurusu hides the fact that he's in a gang because he knows Rika despises violence. They start dating, and eventually Rika finds out Kurusu is the \\"death god\\" she had heard about from ___. Despite this she still loves him, especially so after he saves her life from a rival gang. Kurusu gives up his former ways and tries to become a better person for her (i.e. he starts going back to school he quits the gang, and he gets a job) They move in together, against the wishes of Rika's father, and soon have a child. She dies after giving all of her luck to Kurusu, who had been injured while \\"working\\". Manaka: The childhood friend of Kurusu, he is a smart geek, and asocial. He is studying the mysterious power, and wants to find a way save Karin, whom he has an odd attraction to. He ignores the fact that Kurusu is an assassin. Inspector Himiyama: An intelligent inspector with some effective, yet questionable methods. Because he was targeting Shinya, he encounters Kurusu, who had been sent to kill someone on Shinya's orders. Himiyama then goes after Kurusu, as he witnessed the victim make contact with Kurusu and then immediately die. He tails Kurusu, and confronts him, just as Kurusu finishes collecting luck from another target. The apartment of the victim explodes, and when Himiyama rushes in he finds the man dead, just as Kurusu had said he would be. He is trapped inside by wreckage and smoke but is saved by Kurusu, and sees him perform \\"miracles\\" as he exits the building. He concludes that Kurusu must be a shinigami or a God. Masaharu Kinoshita: Kurusu's father-in-law, Rika's father and Karin's grandfather. He previously had a company job, but now runs a restaurant with his wife so he can spend more time with his family. At first, he forbid Rika to see Kurusu because he thought he was \\"a no good kid\\". He came around after witnessing Kurusu's kindness towards a distressed and crying child. Kanae Kinoshita: Mother-in-law to Kurusu, and wife of Masaharu. She and her husband are Karin's guardians because of Kurusu's work.

It was published from 1890 to 1950. History The paper had its origin in The Hummer,\\"Hummer\\" was a synonym for bull-roarer, an Australian Aboriginal instrument, which may have been used as a call to assemble. \\"Official organ of the Associated Riverina Workers\\", a newspaper produced in Wagga Wagga in the depths of the 1890s depression on 19 October 1891. The paper was jointly funded by the Wagga branches of the Amalgamated Shearers' Union of Australasia and the General Workers' Union, which merged in 1894 to form the Australian Workers' Union. The Hummer was the first union- owned newspaper in New South Wales (there was a privately owned pro-labor paper called The Shearers' Record published by Andrews and Taylor), and was born out of the perception that many or most mainstream newspaper proprietors and editors were sufficiently hostile to Unionism to suppress or mutilate letters and news items sympathetic to workers' rights, and to come down heavily on the side of business owners in any dispute. The men behind this bold move, which may have contravened the constitutions of the unions involved, were Wagga Branch officials Walter Head, Arthur Rae and J. J. Mooney. Later a share was sold to the Labor Electoral League. and the last issue 3 September 1892. An arrangement was arrived at with a similar institution, The Worker, founded by William Lane in Brisbane in 1890, to share resources, and the resulting paper The Worker, \\"with which is incorporated The Hummer\\" in Wagga, associated with The Worker in Brisbane, Queensland began in Sydney on 24 September 1892, with each company supplying half the content of each issue. Wagga Branch continued the publication of The Worker until March, 1893, when six other N.S.W. Branches agreed to join in, and the plant was removed to either 1 Palmer Street Woolloomooloo or 217 Palmer Street, Sydney. J. A. Ross was Manager and W. Head and A. Rae performed most of the editorial work. From July 1893 the whole of the paper was printed in-house, the Queensland agreement having come to an end. J. Medway Day, of the South Australian Register and The Voice, was brought in as editor in 1894, and around this time Ross resigned as manager and Medway Day was obliged to take on that role as well. For the 1894 general election it was decided to issue The Worker daily during the campaign, so The Daily Worker was published for three weeks commencing 2 July 1894. This proved financially disastrous; a loss being incurred of almost ‚Ç§2,000, which the annual levy of 1s. per member was insufficient to meet. By May 1896 it was realized that strong measures were called for and in June Hector Lamond took over management. From November 1896 publication went from weekly to fortnightly, then in February, 1897 ceased altogether. Publication resumed in a reduced size on 31 August 1897, operated by the Bourke Branch of the AWU and with artwork generously provided by its Queensland counterpart. Little by little its financial position became more secure, and The Worker emerged from the depression on a sound footing. They purchased The Australian Workman (1890-1897), which covered city workers, from its private owners. The plant moved to Castlereagh Street, Sydney and a new double-royal flatbed press. William Lane was appointed editor in February 1900. In 1900 they moved to 311 Kent Street, Sydney, and a Cox-duplex flat-bed rotary press, capable of printing 5000 sheets per hour was installed. In 1900 an agreement was reached where the paper was supported by a 2/6d annual levy on all members of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia, with State representation on the board. A linotype machine was purchased in 1901, enabling the paper to be expanded to 6 pages, then 8 in 1902. In that year the member levy was increased to 5s., which enabled the employment of additional literary staff and the purchase of freehold property at 129 Bathurst Street, so the business was no longer at the mercy of the landlord. A second linotype was installed in 1904. A Hoe press was installed, and the first issue came out on 13 December 1907. H, E. Boote became editor in 1911 In 1913 the masthead changed from The Worker \\"An Australian Paper for Australian People\\" to The Australian Worker \\"An Australian Paper for Australian Homes\\". Managing editor was H. Lamond. Its circulation peaked in 1917, when Billy Hughes was running the conscription referendum; the Worker was solidly behind the NO case. The newspaper next moved to a building on Kent Street (now St. Andrews Place) where it remained until its 1939 sale to the Church of England for occupation by St Andrew's Cathedral School. Its final move was to the former Protestant Hall on Castlereagh Street, roughly opposite its old building. Tim Donovan retired and new manager Bob Browne was appointed.

He was known to make frequent visits to his parishes and worked to support the religious education and religious involvement among the youth. Pope John Paul II beatified him in 1996 and he was canonized in 2011 by Pope Benedict XVI. Biography Guido Maria Conforti was born in Casalora di Ravadese in the diocese and province of Parma, Italy, in 1865, the eighth of ten children of Rinaldo and Antonia Adorni Conforti. He attended an elementary school run by the De La Salle Brothers from 1872 and each day on his way to the school he would stop by the church of Santa Maria della Pace, his parish church, where he used to have conversations with the crucified Jesus Christ. This was when his vocation became apparent. He later recalled: \\"I looked at Him and He looked at me and seemed to say so many things\\".\\"The Life of our Founder\\", Xaverian Missionaries USA Although his father would have preferred that he stay and manage the farm, Conforti enrolled in the seminary in Parma in November 1876. He began reading the works of Saint Francis Xavier which inspired a desire to be a missionary, but his requests to join the Society of Jesus or the Salesians of Saint John Bosco were denied. At the time, the rector of the seminary was Andrea Carlo Ferrari, future cardinal and Blessed. Ferrari became his mentor. Conforti was appointed vice-rector.\\"Saint Guido Maria Conforti\\", Pontifical Missionary Societies Conforti was ordained to the priesthood on 22 September 1888 at Fontanellato. Conforti then served as a professor at the local seminary. He became the Vicar-General of the Diocese of Parma on 7 March 1896. Founder Conforti established the Xaverian Missionaries on 3 December 1895 and the organization received the approval of Pope Leo XIII on December 3, 1898. In 1899, he sent the order's first missionaries to China. Leo XIII appointed him Archbishop of Ravenna in May 1902 following the death of Cardinal Agostino Gaetano Riboldi. He was consecrated bishop on June 11th, 1902 at the Church of St. Paul outside the Walls in Rome. Conforti submitted his resignation due to his ill health in October 1904. On 14 November, he was made both the Coadjutor Bishop of Parma and Titular Archbishop of Stauropolis. In 1907 he became Bishop of Parma, retaining his personal title of Archbishop. He traveled to all parishes via horseback or other means to inspect his diocese. He had a particular focus on religious education. Conforti is said to have provided the initiative behind Pope Benedict XV's encyclical Maximum illud, issued on 30 November 1919. That document is called the Magna Carta of modern Catholic missionary work. He travelled to China in 1928 to visit the Xaverian Missionaries working there. He arrived in Shanghai on 26 October 1928 and met with his contacts to inspect their work. Conforti returned to Parma and fell ill in October 1931. He died a month later and he was interred in Parma. His tomb was later relocated in 1942 and in 1996. Sainthood The cause of sainthood was introduced in Parma on 29 May 1959 under Pope John XXIII and the work done on a diocesan level culminated on 11 February 1982 with Conforti being declared Venerable by Pope John Paul II on account of his life of heroic virtue. A tribunal for a miracle needed for his beatification opened and closed in 1993 and John Paul II recognized the healing as a miracle on 6 April 1995. It led to his beatification on 17 March 1996. A second tribunal for a miracle needed for canonization opened on 4 October 2005 and closed on 16 November 2005 and Pope Benedict XVI signed the decree for the miracle on 10 December 2010, leading to his canonization on 23 October 2011.

Gellner discussed nationalism in a number of works, starting with Thought and Change (1964), and he most notably developed it in Nations and Nationalism (1983). Characteristics Gellner defined nationalism as \\"primarily a political principle which holds that the political and the national unit should be congruent\\"Gellner, Nationalism, 1983, p. 1. and as > the general imposition of a high culture on society, where previously low > cultures had taken up the lives of the majority, and in some cases the > totality, of the population. It means the general diffusion of a school- > mediated, academy supervised idiom, codified for the requirements of a > reasonably precise bureaucratic and technological communication. It is the > establishment of an anonymous impersonal society, with mutually sustainable > atomised individuals, held together above all by a shared culture of this > kind, in place of the previous complex structure of local groups, sustained > by folk cultures reproduced locally and idiosyncratically by the micro- > groups themselves.Gellner, Nations and Nationalism p. 57 Gellner analyzed nationalism by a historical perspective. He saw the history of humanity culminating in the discovery of modernity, nationalism being a key functional element. Modernity, by changes in political and economic system, is tied to the popularization of education, which, in turn, is tied to the unification of language. However, as modernization spread around the world, it did so slowly, and in numerous places, cultural elites were able to resist cultural assimilation and defend their own culture and language successfully. For Gellner, nationalism was a sociological condition and a likely but not guaranteed (he noted exceptions in multilingual states like Switzerland, Belgium and Canada) result of modernisation, the transition from agrarian to industrial society. His theory focused on the political and cultural aspects of that transition. In particular, he focused on the unifying and culturally homogenising roles of the educational systems, national labour markets and improved communication and mobility in the context of urbanisation. He thus argued that nationalism was highly compatible with industrialisation and served the purpose of replacing the ideological void left by both the disappearance of the prior agrarian society culture and the political and economical system of feudalism, which it legitimised. Thomas Hylland Eriksen lists these as \\"some of the central features of nationalism\\" in Gellner's theory: * Shared, formal educational system * Cultural homogenisation and \\"social entropy\\" * Central monitoring of polity, with extensive bureaucratic control * Linguistic standardisation * National identification as abstract community * Cultural similarity as a basis for political legitimacy * Anonymity, single-stranded social relationships Gellner also provided a typology of \\"nationalism-inducing and nationalism-thwarting situations\\". Gellner criticised a number of other theoretical explanations of nationalism, including the \\"naturality theory\\", which states that it is \\"natural, self- evident and self-generating\\" and a basic quality of human being, and a neutral or a positive quality; its dark version, the \\"Dark Gods theory\\", which sees nationalism as an inevitable expression of basic human atavistic, irrational passions; Elie Kedourie's idealist argument that it was an accidental development, an intellectual error of disseminating unhelpful ideas, and not related to industrialisation and the Marxist theory in which nations appropriated the leading role of social classes. Influence Gellner is considered one of the leading theoreticians on nationalism. Eriksen notes that \\"nobody contests Ernest Gellner's central place in the research on nationalism over the last few decades\\". O'Leary refers to the theory as \\"the best-known modernist explanatory theory of nationalism\\". Criticisms Gellner's theory has been subject to various criticisms: *It is too functionalist, as it explains the phenomenon with reference to the eventual historical outcome that industrial society could not 'function' without nationalism. *It misreads the relationship between nationalism and industrialisation. *It accounts poorly for national movements of Ancient Rome and Greece since it insists that nationalism is tied to modernity and so cannot exist without a clearly defined modern industrialisation. *It fails to account for either nationalism in non- industrial society and resurgences of nationalism in post-industrial society. *It fails to account for nationalism in 16th-century Europe. *It cannot explain the passions generated by nationalism and why anyone should fight and die for a country. * It fails to take into account either the role of war and the military in fostering both cultural homogenisation and nationalism or the relationship between militarism and compulsory education. * It has been compared to technological determinism, as it disregards the views of individuals. Philip Gorski has argued that modernization theorists, such as Gellner, have gotten the timing of nationalism wrong: nationalism existed prior to modernity, and even had medieval roots.

There is a different theme each year and every event requires its participants to take an item with them and contribute it to the concert. Items collected will then be sent to the targeted organisation of the year to aid those in need. It is hoped that through such sharing sessions, the awareness of general public for the marginalized groups among the society will be aroused. 2015 is already the third edition of the event. Background of the main organizer group (DE TESLA) Lee, the founder, is the pianist for a local independent band De Tesla, which was established in 2010. Their music circumvolves the notion of dream-realization and local social issues. They emphasise on creating the conditions they need to make their dream happen if the society does not provide them with what they need. After several fatal incidents of his friends, Lee attempts to probe the relationship between medical care and life. Lee acknowledges the capability of medical profession in curing patients physically, yet has reservations on the extent of help the medical crew offers psychologically to patients. With collected efforts, Lee expects that through Barter Concert, more and more in the society are willing to care about the mental health of patients. Past events Barter Concert 2013 2013 was the first edition of Barter Concert. In response to the aim, audience were asked to bring three kinds of food, namely canned food, a bag of biscuits and one single tetra pak drink. Food and beverages gathered were re-distributed to the homeless and people living in cramped quarters by two cooperating units: ‚ÄòÂπ≥Á≠âÂàÜ‰∫´Ë°åÂãï‚Äô (Sharing for Equality Scheme) and 'ÈùíÊá∑Á§æÂçÄÁµÑÁπî' (a social council service for teenagers). Lee expressed that Barter Concert is a chance for the public to reflect on what they can do for the society and to explore the potential of Hong Kong to become a better society. The four cooperation units would be Ng Cheuk Yin (a famous musician), Jim Lau (a well-known composer and producer), ChU SzE mAgiC (a band established in 2007) and Fair Oaks Trio (a jazz music group). Barter Concert 2014 This is the second edition of Barter Concert, with the theme being ‚Äòsharing music between the poor and the rich‚Äô. Audiences were encouraged to donate their old piano scores to the concert so that they could be given to grass-root children whose families are facing financial difficulties but would like their children exposed to better education. WeWah Music, partner of the year, volunteered to teach those children free of charge for three years. Lee said that he hoped others could find their life goals and story through music.

The whole concert was a series of events, including 100 minutes music performances, sharing stories about caring patients and reflect the result of the past two concerts held. There were four voluntary organizations responsible for the sharing section of around 25 minutes. The four organisations were Hong Kong West Cluster, society of Pastoral Care Company Limited., Caring CLOWN and ‚ÄòÂπ≥Á≠âÂàÜ‰∫´Ë°åÂãï‚Äô(Sharing for Equality Scheme).

It continues southward and intersects Dike Street and Obunagu Road. Further down, the road is joined by streets such as Dr. S.M. Okeke Avenue, Nwibor Street, Ken Okoli Street and Chukwuogor Street. It reaches Bishop Crowther Seminary then turns east towards Anambra State Ministry of Works, Housing and Transport, eventually terminating at the junction with Zik Avenue near Amawbia. Other information Works Road was constructed to ease traffic congestion on Zik Avenue, which serves as an alternative route for vehicles travelling to and from other parts of the state. The road is maintained by Anambra State Road Maintenance Agency (ARMA). Besides residential buildings, some small-scale businesses like clothing boutiques, upholstery shops, hair stylist salons, mini-supermarkets, barber shops, pharmacy and liquor stores have also sprung up along the street. Transportation As with most areas in Awka, transportation in this part of the city is based primarily on motorcycle taxis and occasionally by auto rickshaws. There are also several roads, such as Dike Street and SM Okeke Avenue that connects to Works Road and leads outwards from Amikwo to the various suburbs of the city. Although considered less busy compared with Zik Avenue, the street at times, has traffic congestions as a result of the growing population of Awka South and the road's narrow nature. On June 1, 2015, the Anambra State government imposed a ban on motorcycles and auto rickshaws to restrict them from plying all major roads.

ClassPass has locations in the United States, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Europe, New Zealand, India, Thailand, Singapore, United Arab Emirates, Hong Kong, Indonesia, and Malaysia. As of its latest financing in January 2020, the company was valued at $1 billion. History In 2011, after spending over an hour searching online for an open ballet class in New York City, 28-year old Payal Kadakia, an Indian American graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and employee of Warner Music Group, realised she was tired of corporate life and allocated herself fourteen days to come up with an idea for her very own company. During this time, she had the idea to create a search engine and reservation system for fitness classes. In September 2012, Mary Biggins was hired. In June 2012, Kadakia released Classtivity to the public, with Sanjiv Sanghavi. In January 2014, Classtivity was rebranded as ClassPass. Sanghavi left in January 2014. An earlier version of the company's product was intended to sell a better registration system to fitness studios but this did not receive much interest. After participating in the TechStars accelerator, the company switched to offering a package deal where users could pay $49 for 10 classes in a year, a model that Kadakia likened to Groupon. However, users of the service wanted to take more than 10 classes per year, so the company switched to offering a 10-class subscription service for $99 per month. The company enforces a cancellation fee of $20 for missing classes. By April 2016, the company had booked over 17 million fitness reservations. The company also added additional pricing tiers such as 3 or 5 classes per month. In March 2017, Payal Kadakia swapped roles with Fritz Lanman, with Lanman becoming CEO and Kadakia becoming Executive Chairman. By June 2017, the company had booked 35 million reservations and by December 2017, the company had booked 45 million reservations. In August 2017, the company announced expansion to New Orleans, Pittsburgh, San Antonio, Cincinnati, Calgary, Honolulu, Indianapolis, Milwaukee, Riverside, California, and Salt Lake City. In 2017, the company was ranked #2 on the Deloitte Fast 500 North America list. In March 2018, ClassPass launched live-streamed fitness classes for $15 per month. In October 2018, ClassPass was launched in Thailand. In January 2019, Classpass acquired Guavapass. All of guavapass account transferred to classpass membership. When gyms were ordered to shut during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, ClassPass started to stream classes online. Despite the popularity of this service, the company lost 95% of revenue and halved its staff. Financing ClassPass received seed funding of $2 million in March 2014, then attracted $12 million in Series A round funding from entrepreneur Fritz Lanman in September 2014. In 2015, it received $40 million of Series B funding from General Catalyst and Thrive Capital. The company was valued as over $200 million. Classpass received an additional $30 million of funding in November 2015 led by Google Ventures. ClassPass announced a $70 million Series C led by Temasek Holdings in May 2017 that valued the company at $470 million. In early 2019, there were rumours the company was in the process of an IPO. It raised $285 million in funding during the beginning of 2020 that put the company's valuation at $1 billion. Criticism ClassPass has been criticized for undercutting the business model of the health clubs that it relies on, with an article in The New York Times describing it as a \\"middleman\\" between consumers and health clubs, and arguing that a \\"power imbalance\\" exists between the health clubs' owners and ClassPass which mirrors the relationship with other digital intermediary services such as Amazon.com and Uber. The service has accounted for lower margins at some gyms where owners limit the number of members \\"to prevent being cannibalized\\".

He collaborated with the designer William Morris, who visited his dyeworks in Leek, Staffordshire to learn how to use natural dyes. He was knighted by Queen Victoria for his services to the silk industry. Early life Wardle was born in Macclesfield, Cheshire, a silk manufacturing town. He was the eldest son of Joshua Wardle, who in 1830 had opened a silk dyeing business near Leek in the Staffordshire Moorlands, south of Macclesfield. Silk weaving had begun in Leek in the late 17th century and silk dyeing began during the 18th century. Leek became celebrated for its black dyes, in particular a \\"raven-black\\" (blue- black) dye. The water of the local River Churnet was agreed to be a key ingredient in this product. Aged about 16 Wardle joined his father's business. In 1872 he bought two dyeworks in the town (Hencroft and Mill Street dyeworks) from Samuel Tatton, a local businessman.

Tussar silk Wardle was interested in tussar silk, a type of wild silk. He became involved in making this silk commercially successful, after George Birdwood, a doctor and naturalist in India, who became known for his book Economic Vegetable Products of the Bombay Presidency, pointed out in 1860 its commercial potential. There was a great supply of tussar silk but it was resistant to dyeing. After much experimentation, Wardle in 1867 was able to treat the fibre, to overcome its resistance to dyes. At the Paris Exhibition of 1878, Wardle exhibited various samples of tussar silk; he was subsequently appointed a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour. Collaboration with William Morris From 1875 to 1877 William Morris, of the Arts and Crafts movement, visited Wardle's dyeworks to experiment with indigo dyeing, and printing with this sort of dye. They became good friends, and remained so. Their aim was to produce a depth of colour with natural dyes, such as they found in Indian textiles. They succeeded in making vegetable dyeing important in the dyeing industry. By 1876 Wardle was printing a range of Morris's designs. At Morris & Co. at Merton Abbey Mills, Morris established his own textile printing while Wardle continued to print Morris's early designs. The Wardle Heritage, accessed 23 December 2016. Wardle also collaborated with other designers such as L√©on-Victor Solon. In Bengal and Kashmir In 1885, Wardle accepted a Government invitation to visit Bengal Province (part of the then British Raj in India), to investigate the state there of sericulture; the quality of silk from there was not as good as silk from producers in other countries. He found that a great proportion the silkworms were dying of preventible diseases, and that reeling from cocoons was not done well. He set up training courses for local silk farmers, and for local technicians, and got the dyestuffs more organized; these changes much improved the silk industry in Bengal.Thomas Wardle of Leek Peakland Heritage, accessed via the Wayback Machine, 23 December 2016. On the same visit he went in 1886 to Kashmir, where silk production was in a poor state. He had ideas for its revival, which on his return home he presented to the government; eventually in 1897 he purchased in Europe large amounts of silk-worm eggs and cocoon-reeling machinery for Kashmir, which revived the silk industry there. Family and local interests In 1857 he married Elizabeth Wardle, a distant cousin, daughter of Hugh Wardle. They had fourteen children, of whom five sons and four daughters survived to adulthood. Lady Wardle was an accomplished embroiderer, and founded the Leek Embroidery Society. The Society's work was sold in 1880s in a Wardle shop in New Bond Street, London; it was also involved in a full-scale replica of the Bayeux Tapestry. She died at Leek, Staffordshire on 8 September 1902. Wardle was interested in geology, and became a fellow of the Geological Society of London. He had a collection of Carboniferous Limestone fossils, and wrote about geology, particularly of his local area. He was active in local church affairs: he was churchwarden of St Edward's Church in Cheddleton, and he wrote some church music. Shortly before his death he donated a new chancel to Warslow church. Oscar Wilde, in a lecture he gave in Leek in 1884, paid tribute to Thomas Wardle's work. In 1887 he helped to found the Silk Association of Great Britain and Ireland, of which he was president during his lifetime. He was a fellow of the Chemical Society. He wrote several monographs about silk, and he received a knighthood in 1897 for services to the silk industry. The businesses developed by Wardle in his lifetime continued in Leek, with changes of name, in the twentieth century. He died in Leek in 1909 and was buried in Cheddleton churchyard. Centenary Wardle's centenary in 2009 was marked by exhibitions in Leek, London's William Morris Gallery (Experiments In Colour), and Manchester's Whitworth Art Gallery.

There are at least sixteen Korean food shops in Kimberly Street.

The major visitors of Kimberley Street in the 1990s were the Korean immigrants. 80% of the customers was Korean. Yet, the target customers of the Korean shops have been altered from Korean immigrants into Hongkongers since the Korean television drama---Dae Jang Geum was broadcast in 2005.

An FBI examination of Clinton's server found over 100 emails containing classified information, including 65 emails deemed \\"Secret\\" and 22 deemed \\"Top Secret\\". An additional 2,093 emails not marked classified were retroactively classified by the State Department. Some experts, officials, and members of Congress contended that Clinton's use of a private messaging system and a private server violated federal law, specifically 18 U.S. Code ¬ß 1924, regarding the unauthorized removal and retention of classified documents or materials, as well as State Department protocols and procedures, and regulations governing recordkeeping. Clinton responded that her use complied with federal laws and State Department regulations, and that former secretaries of state had also maintained personal email accounts. News reports by NBC and CNN indicated that the emails discussed \\"innocuous\\" matters already available in the public domain. For example, the CIA drone program has been widely discussed in the public domain since the early 2000s; however, the very existence of the program is technically classified, so sharing a newspaper article that mentions it would constitute a security breach according to the CIA. The controversy was a major point of discussion and contention during the 2016 presidential election, in which Clinton was the Democratic nominee. In May, the State Department's Office of the Inspector General released a report about the State Department's email practices, including Clinton's. In July, FBI director James Comey announced that the FBI investigation had concluded that Clinton had been \\"extremely careless\\" but recommended that no charges be filed because Clinton did not act with criminal intent, the historical standard for pursuing prosecution. Clinton's opponent, Donald Trump, used the nickname \\"Crooked Hillary\\" to criticize Clinton. On October 28, 2016, days before the election, Comey notified Congress that the FBI had started looking into newly discovered emails. On November 6, Comey notified Congress that the FBI had not changed its original conclusion. Comey's timing was contentious, with critics saying that he had violated Department of Justice guidelines and precedent, and prejudiced the public against Clinton. The controversy received more media coverage than any other topic during the presidential campaign. Clinton and other observers argue that the reopening of the investigation contributed to her loss in the election. Comey said in his 2018 book A Higher Loyalty that, in hindsight, he wondered about whether his decision was unconsciously influenced by the fact that he thought it extremely likely that Clinton would become the next president. On June 14, 2018, the Department of Justice's Office of the Inspector General released its report on the FBI's and DOJ's handling of Clinton's investigation, finding no evidence of political bias and lending support for the decision to not prosecute Clinton. A three-year State Department investigation concluded in September 2019 that 38 individuals were \\"culpable\\" in 91 instances of sending classified information that reached Clinton's email account, though it found \\"no persuasive evidence of systemic, deliberate mishandling of classified information.\\" In October 2020, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he would release unspecified Clinton emails. Background Clinton's use of BlackBerrys Clinton holding a Blackberry phone in 2009 Prior to her appointment as Secretary of State in 2009, Clinton and her circle of friends and colleagues communicated via BlackBerry phones. State Department security personnel suggested this would pose a security risk during her tenure. The email account used on Clinton's BlackBerry was then hosted on a private server in the basement of her home in Chappaqua, New York, but that information was not disclosed to State Department security personnel or senior State Department personnel. Setting up a secure desktop computer in her office was suggested, but Clinton was unfamiliar with their use and opted for the convenience of her BlackBerry, not the State Department, government protocol of a secured desktop computer. Efforts to find a secure solution were abandoned by Clinton, and she was warned by State Department security personnel about the vulnerability of an unsecured BlackBerry to hacking. She affirmed her knowledge of the danger, and was reportedly told that the Bureau of Diplomatic Security had obtained intelligence about her vulnerability while she was on a trip to Asia, but continued to use her BlackBerry outside her office. Domain names and email server A screenshot of the default Outlook Web App login page that is displayed when navigating to Clinton's email service At the time of Senate confirmation hearings on Hillary Clinton's nomination as Secretary of State, the domain names clintonemail.com, wjcoffice.com, and presidentclinton.com were registered to Eric Hoteham, (The name Eric Hoteham is similar to that of Eric Hothem, a former Clinton aide.) with the home of Clinton and her husband in Chappaqua, New York, as the contact address. The domains were pointed to a private email server that Clinton (who never had a state.gov email account) used to send and receive email, and which was purchased and installed in the Clintons' home for her 2008 presidential campaign. The email server was located in the Clintons' home in Chappaqua, New York, from January 2009 until 2013, when it was sent to a data center in New Jersey before being handed over to Platte River Networks, a Denver-based information technology firm that Clinton hired to manage her email system. The server itself runs a Microsoft Exchange 2010 server with access to emails over the internet being delivered by Outlook Web App. The web page is secured with a TLS certificate to allow information to be transmitted securely when using the website. However, for the first two months of its use ‚Äì January 2009 through March 29, 2009 ‚Äì the web page was reportedly not secured with a TLS certificate, meaning that information transmitted using the service was unencrypted and may have been liable to interception. Initial awareness As early as 2009, officials with the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) expressed concerns over possible violations of normal federal government record-keeping procedures at the State Department under then-Secretary Clinton. In December 2012, near the end of Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State, a nonprofit group called Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, or CREW, filed a FOIA request seeking records about her email. CREW received a response in May 2013: \\"no records responsive to your request were located.\\" Emails sent to Clinton's private clintonemail.com address were first discovered in March 2013, when a hacker named \\"Guccifer\\" widely distributed emails sent to Clinton from Sidney Blumenthal, which Guccifer obtained by illegally accessing Blumenthal's email account. The emails dealt with the 2012 Benghazi attack and other issues in Libya and revealed the existence of her clintonemail.com address. Blumenthal did not have a security clearance when he received material from Clinton that has since been characterized as classified by the State Department. In the summer of 2014, lawyers from the State Department noticed a number of emails from Clinton's personal account, while reviewing documents requested by the House Select Committee on Benghazi. A request by the State Department for additional emails led to negotiations with her lawyers and advisors. In October, the State Department sent letters to Clinton and all previous Secretaries of State back to Madeleine Albright requesting emails and documents related to their work while in office. On December 5, 2014, Clinton lawyers delivered 12 file boxes filled with printed paper containing more than 30,000 emails. Clinton withheld almost 32,000 emails deemed to be of a personal nature. Datto, Inc., which provided data backup service for Clinton's email, agreed to give the FBI the hardware that stored the backups. As of May 2016, no answer had been provided to the public as to whether 31,000 emails deleted by Hillary Clinton as personal have been or could be recovered. A March 2, 2015 New York Times article broke the story that the Benghazi panel had discovered that Clinton exclusively used her own private email server rather than a government-issued one throughout her time as Secretary of State, and that her aides took no action to preserve emails sent or received from her personal accounts as required by law. At that point, Clinton announced that she had asked the State Department to release her emails. Some in the media labeled the controversy \\"emailgate.\\" Use of private server for government business According to Clinton's spokesperson Nick Merrill, a number of government officials have used private email accounts for official business, including secretaries of state before Clinton. State Department spokesperson Marie Harf said that: \\"For some historical context, Secretary Kerry is the first secretary of state to rely primarily on a state.gov email account.\\" John Wonderlich, a transparency advocate with the Sunlight Foundation, observed while many government officials used private email accounts, their use of private email servers was much rarer. A notable exception was during the Bush administration, when dozens of senior White House officials conducted government business via approximately 22 million emails using accounts they had on a server owned by the Republican National Committee. Dan Metcalfe, a former head of the Justice Department's Office of Information and Privacy, said this gave her even tighter control over her emails by not involving a third party such as Google and helped prevent their disclosure by Congressional subpoena. He added: \\"She managed successfully to insulate her official emails, categorically, from the FOIA, both during her tenure at State and long after her departure from it‚Äîperhaps forever,\\" making it \\"a blatant circumvention of the FOIA by someone who unquestionably knows better.\\" According to Harf, use by government officials of personal email for government business is permissible under the Federal Records Act, so long as relevant official communications, including all work-related emails, are preserved by the agency. The Act (which was amended in late 2014 after Clinton left office to require that personal emails be transferred to government servers within 20 days) requires agencies to retain all official communications, including all work-related emails, and stipulates that government employees cannot destroy or remove relevant records. NARA regulations dictate how records should be created and maintained, require that they must be maintained \\"by the agency\\" and \\"readily found,\\" and that the records must \\"make possible a proper scrutiny by the Congress.\\" Section 1924 of Title 18 of the United States Code addresses the deletion and retention of classified documents, under which \\"knowingly\\" removing or housing classified information at an \\"unauthorized location\\" is subject to a fine, or up to a year in prison. Experts such as Metcalfe agree that these practices are allowed by federal law assuming that the material is not supposed to be classified, or at least these practices are allowed in case of emergencies, but they discourage these practices, believing that official email accounts should be used. Jason R. Baron, the former head of litigation at NARA, described the practice as \\"highly unusual\\" but not a violation of the law. In a separate interview, he said, \\"It is very difficult to conceive of a scenario‚Äîshort of nuclear winter‚Äîwhere an agency would be justified in allowing its cabinet-level head officer to solely use a private email communications channel for the conduct of government business.\\" Baron told the Senate Judiciary Committee in May 2015 that \\"any employee's decision to conduct all email correspondence through a private email network, using a non-.gov address, is inconsistent with long-established policies and practices under the Federal Records Act and NARA regulations governing all federal agencies.\\"  May 2016 report from State Department's inspector general  In May 2016, the Department's Office of the Inspector General Steve A. Linick released an 83-page report about the State Department's email practices. The Inspector General was unable to find evidence that Clinton had ever sought approval from the State Department staff for her use of a private email server, determining that if Clinton had sought approval, Department staff would have declined her setup because of the \\"security risks in doing so.\\" Aside from security risks, the report stated that \\"she did not comply with the Department's policies that were implemented in accordance with the Federal Records Act.\\" Each of these findings contradicted what Clinton and her aides had been saying up to that point. The report also stated that Clinton and her senior aides declined to speak with the investigators, while the previous four Secretaries of State did so. The report also reviewed the practices of several previous Secretaries of State and concluded that the Department's record keeping practices were subpar for many years. The Inspector General criticized Clinton's use of private email for Department business, concluding that it was \\"not an appropriate method\\" of document preservation and did not follow Department policies that aim to comply with federal record laws. The report also criticized Colin Powell, who used a personal email account for business, saying that this violated some of the same Department policies. State Department spokesman Mark Toner said the report emphasized the need for federal agencies to adapt \\"decades-old record-keeping practices to the email- dominated modern era\\" and said that the Department's record-retention practices had been improved under the current Secretary of State John F. Kerry, Clinton's successor. The report also notes that the rules for preserving work-related emails were updated in 2009. Inspector General Linick wrote that he \\"found no evidence that staff in the Office of the Legal Adviser reviewed or approved Secretary Clinton's personal system,\\" and also found that multiple State employees who raised concerns regarding Clinton's server were told that the Office of the Legal Adviser had approved it, and were further told to \\"never speak of the Secretary's personal email system again.\\" Clinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon issued a statement saying: \\"The report shows that problems with the State Department's electronic record-keeping systems were long-standing\\" and that Clinton \\"took steps that went much further than others to appropriately preserve and release her records.\\" However, the Associated Press said, \\"The audit did note that former Secretary of State Colin Powell had also exclusively used a private email account. ... But the failings of Clinton were singled out in the audit as being more serious than her predecessor.\\" The report stated that \\"By Secretary Clinton's tenure, the department's guidance was considerably more detailed and more sophisticated, Secretary Clinton's cybersecurity practices accordingly must be evaluated in light of these more comprehensive directives.\\"  Server security and hacking attempts  Encryption and security In 2008, before Hillary Clinton became Secretary of State, Justin Cooper, a longtime aide to Clinton's husband, former President Bill Clinton, managed the system. Cooper had no security clearance or expertise in computer security. Later, Bryan Pagliano, the former IT director for Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign, was hired to maintain their private email server while Clinton was Secretary of State. Pagliano had invoked the Fifth Amendment during congressional questioning about Clinton's server. In early 2016, he was granted immunity by the Department of Justice in exchange for cooperation with prosecutors. A Clinton spokesman said her campaign was \\"pleased\\" Pagliano was now cooperating with prosecutors. As of May 2016, the State Department remained unable to locate most of Pagliano's work-related emails from the period when he was employed by that department under Secretary Clinton. Security experts such as Chris Soghoian believe that emails to and from Clinton may have been at risk of hacking and foreign surveillance. Marc Maiffret, a cybersecurity expert, said that the server had \\"amateur hour\\" vulnerabilities. For the first two months after Clinton was appointed Secretary of State and began accessing mail on the server through her BlackBerry, transmissions to and from the server were apparently not encrypted. On March 29, 2009, a digital certificate was obtained which would have permitted encryption. Former Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency Michael T. Flynn, former United States Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, and former deputy director of the Central Intelligence Agency Michael Morell have said that it is likely that foreign governments were able to access the information on Clinton's server. Michael Hayden, former Director of the National Security Agency, Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence, and Director of the Central Intelligence Agency said \\"I would lose all respect for a whole bunch of foreign intelligence agencies if they weren't sitting back, paging through the emails.\\" Hacking attempts Clinton's server was configured to allow users to connect openly from the Internet and control it remotely using Microsoft's Remote Desktop Services. It is known that hackers were aware of Clinton's non-public email address as early as 2011. Secretary Clinton and her staff were aware of hacking attempts in 2011, and were reportedly worried about them. In 2012, according to server records, a hacker in Serbia scanned Clinton's Chappaqua server at least twice, in August and in December 2012. It was unclear whether the hacker knew the server belonged to Clinton, although it did identify itself as providing email services for clintonemail.com. During 2014, Clinton's server was the target of repeated intrusions originating in Germany, China, and South Korea. Threat monitoring software on the server blocked at least five such attempts. The software was installed in October 2013, and for three months prior to that, no such software had been installed. According to Pagliano, security logs of Clinton's email server showed no evidence of successful hacking. The New York Times reported that \\"forensic experts can sometimes spot sophisticated hacking that is not apparent in the logs, but computer security experts view logs as key documents when detecting hackers,\\" adding the logs \\"bolster Mrs. Clinton's assertion that her use of a personal email account ... did not put American secrets into the hands of hackers or foreign governments.\\" In 2013, Romanian hacker Marcel Lehel LazƒÉr (aka \\"Guccifer\\") distributed private memos from Sidney Blumenthal to Clinton on events in Libya that he had acquired by hacking Blumenthal's email account. In 2016, LazƒÉr was extradited from Romania to the U.S. to face unrelated federal charges related to his hacking into the accounts of a number of high-profile U.S. figures, pleading guilty to these charges. While detained pending trial, LazƒÉr claimed to the media that he had successfully hacked Clinton's server, but provided no proof of this claim. Officials associated with the investigation told the media that they found no evidence supporting LazƒÉr's assertion, and Clinton press secretary Brian Fallon said \\"There is absolutely no basis to believe the claims made by this criminal from his prison cell.\\" FBI Director James Comey later stated in a congressional hearing that Guccifer admitted his claim was a lie. According to security researchers at Secureworks the email leak was caused by Threat Group-4127, later attributed to Fancy Bear, a unit that targets governments, military, and international non-governmental organizations. The researchers report moderate confidence that the unit gathers intelligence on behalf of the Russian government. Deletion of emails In 2014, months prior to public knowledge of the server's existence, Clinton chief of staff Cheryl Mills and two attorneys worked to identify work-related emails on the server to be archived and preserved for the State Department. Upon completion of this task in December 2014, Mills instructed Clinton's computer services provider, Platte River Networks (PRN), to change the server's retention period to 60 days, allowing 31,830 older personal emails to be automatically deleted from the server, as Clinton had decided she no longer needed them. However, the PRN technician assigned for this task failed to carry it out at that time. After the existence of the server became publicly known on March 2, 2015, the Select Committee on Benghazi issued a subpoena for Benghazi-related emails two days later. Mills sent an email to PRN on March 9 mentioning the Committee's retention request. The PRN technician then had what he described to the FBI as an \\"oh shit moment,\\" realizing he had not set the personal emails to be deleted as instructed months earlier. The technician then erased the emails using a free utility, BleachBit, sometime between March 25 and 31. Bloomberg News reported in September 2015 that the FBI had recovered some of the deleted emails. Since this episode, Clinton critics have accused her or her aides of deleting emails that were under subpoena, alleging the server had been \\"bleached\\" or \\"acid-washed\\" by a \\"very expensive\\" process in an effort to destroy evidence, with candidate Donald Trump stating the day before the 2016 election that \\"Hillary Clinton erased more than 30,000 emails as part of a cover-up.\\" Trump reiterated his position as late as August 2018, asking \\"Look at the crimes that Clinton did with the emails and she deletes 33,000 emails after she gets a subpoena from Congress, and this Justice Department does nothing about it?\\" Classified information in emails In various interviews, Clinton has said that \\"I did not send classified material, and I did not receive any material that was marked or designated classified.\\" However, in June and July 2016, a number of news outlets reported that Clinton's emails did include messages with some paragraphs marked with a \\"(c)\\" for \\"Confidential.\\" The FBI investigation found that 110 messages contained information that was classified at the time it was sent. Sixty-five of those emails were found to contain information classified as \\"Secret;\\" more than 20 contained \\"Top-Secret\\" information. Three emails, out of 30,000, were found to be marked as classified, although they lacked classified headers and were only marked with a small \\"c\\" in parentheses, described as \\"portion markings\\" by Comey. He added it was possible Clinton was not \\"technically sophisticated\\" enough to understand what the three classified markings meant which is consistent with Clinton's claim that she wasn't aware of the meaning of such markings. Clinton personally wrote 104 of the 2,093 emails that were retroactively found to contain information classified as \\"confidential.\\" Of the remaining emails that were classified after they were sent, Clinton aide Jake Sullivan wrote the most, at 215. According to the State Department, there were 2,093 email chains on the server that were retroactively marked as classified by the State Department as \\"Confidential,\\" 65 as \\"Secret,\\" and 22 as \\"Top Secret.\\" An interagency dispute arose during the investigation about what constitutes ‚Äúclassified‚Äù status when information acquired and considered ‚Äúowned‚Äù by intelligence agencies is also independently and publicly available through ‚Äúparallel reporting‚Äù by the press or others. In one reported instance, an email chain deemed by the intelligence community to contain classified information included a discussion of a New York Times article that reported on a CIA drone strike in Pakistan; despite wide public knowledge of the drone program, the CIA ‚Äî as the \\"owning agency\\" ‚Äî considers the very existence of its drone program to be classified in its entirety. Assistant Secretary of State for Legislative Affairs Julia Frifield noted, \\"When policy officials obtain information from open sources, ‚Äòthink tanks,‚Äô experts, foreign government officials, or others, the fact that some of the information may also have been available through intelligence channels does not mean that the information is necessarily classified.‚Äù State Department inspector general reports and statements A June 29, 2015, memorandum from the Inspector General of the State Department, Steve A. Linick, said that a review of the 55,000-page email release found \\"hundreds of potentially classified emails.\\" A July 17, 2015, follow-up memo, sent jointly by Linick and the Intelligence Community (IC) inspector general, I. Charles McCullough III, to Under Secretary of State for Management Patrick F. Kennedy, stated that they had confirmed that several of the emails contained classified information that was not marked as classified, at least one of which was publicly released. On July 24, 2015, Linick and McCullough said they had discovered classified information on Clinton's email account, but did not say whether Clinton sent or received the emails. Investigators from their office, searching a randomly chosen sample of 40 emails, found four that contained classified information that originated from U.S. intelligence agencies, including the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the National Security Agency (NSA). Their statement said that the information they found was classified when sent, remained so as of their inspection, and \\"never should have been transmitted via an unclassified personal system.\\" In a separate statement in the form of a letter to Congress, McCullough said that he had made a request to the State Department for access to the entire set of emails turned over by Clinton, but that the Department rejected his request. The letter stated that none of the emails were marked as classified, but because they included classified information they should have been marked and handled as such, and transmitted securely. On August 10, 2015, the IC inspector general said that two of the 40 emails in the sample were \\"Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information\\" and subsequently given classified labels of \\"TK\\" (for \\"Talent Keyhole,\\" indicating material obtained by aerial or space-based imagery sources and NOFORN). One is a discussion of a news article about a U.S. drone strike operation. The second, he said, either referred to classified material or else was \\"parallel reporting\\" of open-source intelligence, which might still be classified by the government \\"owning agency\\" that sourced the information by secret means even though the same information was also available in the public domain. Clinton's presidential campaign and the State Department disputed the letter, and questioned whether the emails had been over-classified by an arbitrary process. According to an unnamed source, a secondary review by the CIA and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency endorsed the earlier inspectors general findings concluding that the emails (one of which concerned North Korea's nuclear weapons program) were \\"Top Secret\\" when received by Clinton through her private server in 2009 and 2011, a conclusion also disputed by the Clinton campaign. The IC inspector general issued another letter to Congress on January 14, 2016. In this letter he stated that an unnamed intelligence agency had made a sworn declaration that \\"several dozen emails [had been] determined by the IC element to be at the CONFIDENTIAL, SECRET, and TOP SECRET/SAP levels.\\" Other intelligence officials added that the several dozen were not the two emails from the previous sample and that the clearance of the IC inspector general himself had to be upgraded before he could learn about the programs referenced by the emails. NBC News reported on January 20, 2016 that senior American officials described these emails as \\"innocuous\\" because‚Äîalthough they discussed the CIA drone program that is technically classified TOP SECRET/SAP‚Äîthe existence of the CIA drone program had been widely known and discussed in the public domain for years. These officials characterized the IC inspector general as unfair in how he had handled the issue. On January 29, 2016, the State Department announced that 22 documents from Clinton's email server would not be released because they contained highly classified information that was too sensitive for public consumption. At the same time, the State Department announced that it was initiating its own investigation into whether the server contained information that was classified at the time it was sent or received. In February 2016, State Department IG Linick addressed another report to Under Secretary of State Kennedy, stating his office had also found classified material in 10 emails in the personal email accounts of members of former Secretary Condoleezza Rice's staff and in two emails in the personal email account of former Secretary of State Colin Powell. None of the emails were classified for intelligence reasons. PolitiFact found a year earlier that Powell was the only former secretary of state to use a personal email account. In February 2016, Clinton's campaign chairman issued a statement claiming that her emails, like her predecessors,' were \\"being inappropriately subjected to over- classification.\\" FBI investigation =July 2015 ‚Äì Security referral= The State Department and Intelligence Community (IC) inspector generals' discovery of four emails containing classified information, out of a random sample of 40, prompted them to make a security referral to the FBI's counterintelligence office, to alert authorities that classified information was being kept on Clinton's server and by her lawyer on a thumb drive. As part of the FBI's Midyear investigation, at the request of the IC inspector general, Clinton agreed to turn over her email server to the U.S. Department of Justice, as well as thumb drives containing copies of her work-related emails. Other emails were obtained by the United States House Select Committee on Benghazi from other sources, in connection with the committee's inquiry. Clinton's own emails are being made public in stages by the State Department on a gradual schedule. The New York Times ran a front-page story on July 24, 2015 with the headline \\"Criminal Inquiry Sought In Clinton's Use of Email,\\" with the lead sentence stating, \\"Two inspectors general have asked the Justice Department to open a criminal investigation into whether Hillary Rodham Clinton mishandled sensitive government information on a private email account she used as secretary of state, senior government officials said Thursday.\\" Shortly after the publication of the story, the Inspectors General of the Intelligence Community and the Department of State issued a statement clarifying, \\"An important distinction is that the IC IG did not make a criminal referral - it was a security referral made for counterintelligence purposes.\\"https://www.stateoig.gov/system/files/statement_of_the_icig_and_oig_regarding_review_of_clintons_emails_july_24_2015_0.pdf The Times later made two corrections, first that Clinton was not a specific target of the referral, then later that the referral was not \\"criminal\\" in nature. Clinton's IT contractors turned over her personal email server to the FBI on August 12, 2015, as well as thumb drives containing copies of her emails. In a letter describing the matter to Senator Ron Johnson, Chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, Clinton's lawyer David E. Kendall said that emails, and all other data stored on the server, had earlier been erased prior to the device being turned over to the authorities, and that both he and another lawyer had been given security clearances by the State Department to handle thumb drives containing about 30,000 emails that Clinton subsequently also turned over to authorities. Kendall said the thumb drives had been stored in a safe provided to him in July by the State Department. =August 2015 ‚Äì Investigation continues; email recovery= On August 20, 2015, U.S. District Judge Emmet G. Sullivan stated that Hillary Clinton's actions of maintaining a private email server were in direct conflict with U.S. government policy. \\"We wouldn't be here today if this employee had followed government policy,\\" he said, and ordered the State Department to work with the FBI to determine if any emails on the server during her tenure as Secretary of State could be recovered. Platte River Networks, the Denver-based firm that managed the Clinton server since 2013, said it had no knowledge of the server being wiped. \\"Platte River has no knowledge of the server being wiped,\\" company spokesman Andy Boian told the Washington Post. \\"All the information we have is that the server wasn't wiped.\\" When asked by the Washington Post, the Clinton campaign declined to comment. In September 2015, FBI investigators were engaged in sorting messages recovered from the server. In November 2015, the FBI expanded its inquiry to examine whether Clinton or her aides jeopardized national security secrets, and if so, who should be held responsible. Conflicting media sources sized the FBI investigation from 12 to 30 agents as of March 2016. =May‚ÄìJuly 2016 ‚Äì Public statements= In May 2016, FBI Director James Comey said he was \\"not familiar with the term 'security inquiry'\\" as the Clinton campaign was characterizing the probe, adding that the word investigation is \\"in our name\\" and \\"We're conducting an investigation ... That's what we do. That's probably all I can say about it.\\" Comey noted in his 2018 memoir that he did not publicly contradict Clinton's characterization of the investigation as a \\"security inquiry\\" while it was underway despite being directly prompted by a reporter to do so in May 2016. In April 2017 it became known that the FBI had, in fact, opened a criminal investigation on July 10, 2015, telling The New York Times they had received a \\"criminal referral,\\" although the following day they issued a public statement: \\"The department has received a referral related to the potential compromise of classified information. It is not a criminal referral.\\" In late June 2016, it was reported that Bill Clinton met privately with Attorney General Loretta Lynch on her private plane on the tarmac at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport. Officials indicated that the 30 minute meeting took place when Clinton became aware that Lynch's plane was on the same tarmac at the airport. When the meeting became public, Lynch stated that it was \\"primarily social\\" and \\"there was no discussion of any matter pending for the department or any matter pending for any other body.\\" Lynch was criticized for her involvement in the meeting and was called on by some critics to recuse herself from involvement in the FBI's investigation of the email case. In response, she stated \\"The F.B.I. is investigating whether Mrs. Clinton, her aides or anyone else broke the law by setting up a private email server for her to use as secretary of state,\\" but \\"the case will be resolved by the same team that has been working on it from the beginning\\" and \\"I will be accepting their recommendations.\\" On July 1, 2016, the New York Times reported in the name of a \\"Justice Department official\\" that Attorney General Loretta Lynch will accept \\"whatever recommendation career prosecutors and the F.B.I. director make about whether to bring charges related to Hillary Clinton's personal email server.\\" Clinton maintained she did not send or receive any confidential emails from her personal server. In a Democratic debate with Bernie Sanders on February 4, 2016, Clinton said, \\"I never sent or received any classified material.\\" In a Meet the Press interview on July 2, 2016, she stated: \\"Let me repeat what I have repeated for many months now, I never received nor sent any material that was marked classified.\\" =July 2016 ‚Äì Investigation concludes= On July 5, 2016, FBI Director Comey announced in a statement he read to press and television reporters at FBI headquarters in Washington, DC, that the FBI had completed its investigation and was referring it to the State Department with the recommendation \\"that no charges are appropriate in this case.\\" He added, \\"Although there is evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information, our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case.\\" With regard to mishandling of classified information, Comey said, \\"there is evidence that they [Clinton and her team] were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information.\\" The investigation found 110 emails that should have been regarded as classified at the time they were sent; another 2,000 emails were retroactively classified which means they were not classified at the time they were sent. Comey said that \\"any reasonable person in Secretary Clinton's position, or in the position of those government employees with whom she was corresponding ... should have known that an unclassified system was no place for that conversation.\\" The FBI learned that Clinton used her personal email extensively while outside the United States, both sending and receiving work-related emails in the territory of sophisticated adversaries. The FBI did not find \\"direct evidence that Secretary Clinton's personal e-mail domain ... was successfully hacked;\\" they assessed it \\"possible that hostile actors gained access\\" to it. Investigators found that State Department employees often used private emails to conduct business. Comey noted, \\"We also developed evidence that the security culture of the State Department in general, and with respect to use of unclassified e-mail systems in particular, was generally lacking in the kind of care for classified information found elsewhere in the government.\\" On July 6, 2016, Lynch confirmed that the investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of private email servers while secretary of state would be closed without criminal charges. =October 2016 ‚Äì Additional investigation= In early October 2016, FBI criminal investigators working on a case involving former Congressman Anthony Weiner allegedly sending sexually explicit texts to a fifteen-year-old girl discovered emails from Weiner's estranged wife, Huma Abedin, vice chair of Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign, that they considered potentially relevant to the Clinton server investigation. FBI officials reportedly decided to disclose the development despite its potential effect on the pending presidential election to preempt the possibility that it would be leaked in another way. On October 28, 2016, Comey informed Congress that \\"in connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear pertinent to the investigation.\\" He said the FBI will take \\"appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation.\\" He added that the FBI \\"cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant.\\" The FBI obtained a new search warrant to allow them to review Abedin's emails. Comey informed Congress of this additional investigation despite having been advised by Justice Department officials that such an announcement would violate department policies and procedures, including a policy not to comment on investigations close to an election. Comey later explained, in a letter to FBI employees, \\"We don't ordinarily tell Congress about ongoing investigations, but here I feel an obligation to do so given that I testified repeatedly in recent months that our investigation was completed.\\" Law enforcement sources added that he feared he would be accused of concealing relevant information if he did not disclose it. News of this renewed investigation being revealed shortly before the U.S. presidential election led to the announcement being described as an \\"October surprise,\\" and prompted statements from both the Democratic and Republican campaigns. Donald Trump repeated his characterization that Hillary Clinton's email usage as secretary of state was \\"worse than Watergate.\\" Clinton called for the FBI to immediately release all information about the newly discovered emails and said she was confident the FBI would not change its earlier conclusion that there is no basis for criminal prosecution. Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) said she was \\"shocked\\" by the letter, saying it \\"played right into the political campaign of Donald Trump.\\" On November 6, in another letter to Congress, Comey stated that, after working \\"around the clock\\" to review all of the newly discovered emails, the FBI had not changed the conclusion it reached in July. An unnamed government official added that the newly discovered emails turned out to be either personal or duplicates of emails previously reviewed, and that Comey's letter represents a conclusion of the investigation. The following day, stock and currency markets around the world surged in response. On November 12, during a conference call to top donors, Hillary Clinton attributed her presidential election loss to Comey's announcements, saying they stopped her momentum. In January 2017, the US Justice Department started an investigation of Comey's announcements. A 2019 study found that Comey's letter substantially increased Trump's probability of winning the 2016 election.  Senate probes Loretta Lynch interference  According to Comey's June 8, 2017, testimony to the Senate Intelligence Committee, then- Attorney General Loretta Lynch had asked him to downplay the investigation into Clinton's emails by calling it a \\"matter\\" rather than an investigation. He said the request \\"confused and concerned\\" him. He added that Lynch's tarmac meeting with Bill Clinton also influenced his decision to publicly announce the results of the FBI probe. On June 23, 2017, several members of the Senate Judiciary Committee opened a bipartisan inquiry into whether former Attorney General Lynch interfered in the FBI's investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server. Internal State Department investigation On July 7, 2016, the internal State Department resumed its review of whether classified information had been mishandled. The review had been suspended until the completion of the Justice Department investigation. The United States Department of State finished its investigation in September 2019, citing 588 security violations. The review found that 38 current and former State Department officials ‚Äì some of whom may be punished ‚Äì were culpable of mishandling classified information, but in 497 cases the culpability could not be established. The material was considered classified then or later, but none of the violations involved information marked classified. The investigation found Clinton's use of personal email server increased the risk of compromising State Department information, but \\"there was no persuasive evidence of systemic, deliberate mishandling of classified information\\".  Department of Justice Inspector General's report  The Inspector General of the Department of Justice (IG) launched an investigation into how the DOJ and FBI had handled the investigation into Clinton's email. On June 14, 2018, the IG issued a report that was highly critical of Comey's actions. Regarding his July press conference, in which he criticized Clinton even while announcing the investigation was over, the IG said it was \\"extraordinary and insubordinate for Comey to conceal his intentions (about the press conference) from his superiors,\\" and that \\"we found none of his reasons to be a persuasive basis for deviating from well-established Department policies.\\" Comey's October decision to send a letter notifying Congress that the investigation had been re-opened one week before the election was described as \\"ad-hoc\\" and \\"a serious error in judgment.\\" However, in June 2018 the IG concluded that the decision to not prosecute Clinton was not affected by bias and \\"was consistent with the Department‚Äôs historical approach in prior cases under different leadership, including in the 2008 decision not to prosecute former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales for mishandling classified documents.\\"A Review of Various Actions by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Department of Justice in Advance of the 2016 Election, Office of the Inspector General, p. vi: https://www.justice.gov/file/1071991/download The IG report also commented on \\"highly classified information\\" in a purported Russian intelligence document obtained by the FBI that included an unconfirmed allegation that Attorney General Loretta Lynch assured a Clinton staffer that she would prevent the FBI investigation from digging too deeply into Clinton's affairs. The FBI long considered the document unreliable and a possible forgery, and Comey told IG investigators he knew the information was not true. The IG report stated: \\"Comey said that he became concerned that the information about Lynch would taint the public's perception of the [Clinton] investigation if it leaked, particularly after DCLeaks and Guccifer 2.0 began releasing hacked emails in mid-June 2016,\\" explaining why Comey chose to bypass Lynch and deputy AG Sally Yates to announce the FBI investigation findings himself. The Washington Post also stated that \\"current and former officials\\" told them that Comey relied on the questionable document in making his July decision to announce on his own without his superiors approval that the investigation was over. Opinions of journalists and experts According to the New York Times, if Clinton was a recipient of classified emails, \\"it is not clear that she would have known that they contained government secrets, since they were not marked classified.\\" The newspaper reported that \\"most specialists believe the occasional appearance of classified information in the Clinton account was probably of marginal consequence\\". Steven Aftergood, director of the Project on Government Secrecy at the Federation of American Scientists, said that inadvertent \\"spillage\\" of classified information into an unclassified realm is a common occurrence. Reuters' August 2015 review of a set of released emails found \\"at least 30 email threads from 2009, representing scores of individual emails,\\" which include what the State Department identifies as \\"foreign government information,\\" defined by the U.S. government as \\"any information, written or spoken, provided in confidence to U.S. officials by their foreign counterparts.\\" Although unmarked, Reuters' examination appeared to suggest that these emails \\"were classified from the start.\\" J. William Leonard, a former director of the NARA Information Security Oversight Office, said that such information is \\"born classified\\" and that \\"[I]f a foreign minister just told the secretary of state something in confidence, by U.S. rules that is classified at the moment it's in U.S. channels and U.S. possession.\\" According to Reuters, the standard U.S. government nondisclosure agreement \\"warns people authorized to handle classified information that it may not be marked that way and that it may come in oral form.\\" The State Department \\"disputed Reuters' analysis\\" but declined to elaborate. The Associated Press reported, \\"Some officials said they believed the designations were a stretch‚Äîa knee-jerk move in a bureaucracy rife with over-classification.\\" Jeffrey Toobin, in an August 2015 New Yorker article, wrote that the Clinton email affair is an illustration of overclassification, a problem written about by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan in his book Secrecy: The American Experience. Toobin writes that \\"government bureaucracies use classification rules to protect turf, to avoid embarrassment, to embarrass rivals‚Äîin short, for a variety of motives that have little to do with national security.\\" Toobin wrote that \\"It's not only the public who cannot know the extent or content of government secrecy. Realistically, government officials can't know either‚Äîand this is Hillary Clinton's problem. Toobin noted that \\"one of Clinton's potentially classified email exchanges is nothing more than a discussion of a newspaper story about drones\\" and wrote: \\"That such a discussion could be classified underlines the absurdity of the current system. But that is the system that exists, and if and when the agencies determine that she sent or received classified information through her private server, Clinton will be accused of mishandling national-security secrets.\\" In an analysis of the Clinton email controversy published by the Brookings Institution, Richard Lempert wrote that \\"security professionals have a reputation for erring in the direction of overclassification.\\" Elizabeth Goitein, co-director of the liberty and national security program at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law, says that \\"The odds are good that any classified information in the Clinton emails should not have been classified,\\" since an estimated 50 percent to 90 percent of classified documents could be made public without risking national security. Nate Jones, an expert with the National Security Archive at George Washington University, said: \\"Clinton's mistreatment of federal records and the intelligence community's desire to retroactively overclassify are two distinct troubling problems. No politician is giving the right message: Blame Clinton for poor records practices, but don't embrace overclassification while you do it.\\" =Russian intelligence and Comey's pronouncements= A number of journalists (Philip Ewing and Jane Mayer Karoun Demirjian and Devlin Barrett) have commented on the connection between the alleged Russian intelligence document given to the FBI that suggested Attorney General Loretta Lynch would prevent the FBI investigation from digging too deeply into Clinton's affairs (see above), and Comey's July announcement of the FBI investigation findings by himself without Lynch's permission, which was later called \\"extraordinary and insubordinate\\" by the Department of Justice Inspector General's report. \\"Current and former officials\\" told Washington Post reporters Demirjian and Barrett that ‚ÄúComey relied on the document in making his July decision to announce on his own,‚Äù because he feared its contents would be leaked, tainting the public's perception of the FBI investigation. This was despite the fact that Comey himself told investigators ‚Äúhe knew from the first moment‚Äù that the document ‚Äúwasn't true‚Äù and the FBI was later unable to corroborate the document. Ewing and Mayer note the document's effect on the election. According to Ewing, \\"to the degree\\" that the document \\"was intended to help disrupt the election, it worked\\". Jane Mayer describes the work of political scientist Kathleen Hall Jamieson who argues that Comey‚Äôs \\"damaging public pronouncements\\" on Clinton‚Äôs handling of classified e-mails\\" in July and later ten days before the election can \\"plausibly be attributed to Russian disinformation\\". While it is difficult to determine how many voters Clinton lost from the pronouncements, Mayer also quotes the Democratic ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, Adam Schiff, who states that if \\"the fake intelligence\\" motivated Comey, then the document was \\"probably was the most measurable\\" and \\"the most significant way in which the Russians may have impacted the outcome of the election.\\" House Oversight Committee hearing On July 7, 2016, Comey was questioned for 5 hours by the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. Comey stated that there was \\"evidence of mishandling\\" of classified information and that he believed that Clinton was \\"extremely careless; I think she was negligent.\\" He defended the FBI's recommendation against bringing charges because it \\"... would have been unfair and virtually unprecedented ...\\" Responses and analysis Clinton's initial response UN Headquarters on March 10, 2015 Clinton's spokesman Nick Merrill defended Clinton's usage of her personal server and email accounts as being in compliance with the \\"letter and spirit of the rules.\\" Clinton herself stated she had done so as a matter of \\"convenience.\\" On March 10, 2015, while attending a conference at the headquarters of the United Nations in Manhattan, Clinton spoke with reporters for about 20 minutes. Clinton said she had used a private email for convenience, \\"because I thought it would be easier to carry just one device for my work and for my personal emails instead of two.\\" It was later determined that Clinton had used both an iPad and a BlackBerry while Secretary of State. Clinton turned over copies of 30,000 State Department business-related emails from her private server that belonged in the public domain; she later explained that she instructed her lawyer to err on the side of disclosure, turning over any emails that might be work-related. Her aides subsequently deleted about 31,000 emails from the server dated during the same time period that Clinton regarded as personal and private. State Department employees do have the right to delete personal emails. Clinton has used humor to try to shrug off the scandals. In August 2015, when asked by a reporter whether she had \\"wiped\\" her server, Clinton laughed and said: \\"What? Like with a cloth or something? I don't know how it works digitally at all.\\" In September 2015, Clinton was asked in an interview with Jimmy Fallon on The Tonight Show about the content of the emails. She laughed it off, saying there was nothing interesting and joking that she was offended people found her emails 'boring.' =Later responses= Clinton's responses to the question, made during her presidential campaign, evolved over time. Clinton initially said that there was no classified material on her server. Later, after a government review discovered some of her emails contained classified information, she said she never sent or received information that was marked classified. Her campaign claimed other emails contained information that is now classified, but was retroactively classified by U.S. intelligence agencies after Clinton had received the material. See also the section above on the May 2016 IG report for a number of Clinton statements that were contradicted by the report, and how she and her supporters responded afterward. Campaign spokesman Brian Fallon said: \\"She was at worst a passive recipient of unwitting information that subsequently became deemed as classified.\\" Clinton campaign spokeswoman Jennifer Palmieri has \\"stressed that Clinton was permitted to use her own email account as a government employee and that the same process concerning classification reviews would still be taking place had she used the standard 'state.gov' email account used by most department employees.\\" Palmieri later stated: \\"Look, this kind of nonsense comes with the territory of running for president. We know it, Hillary knows it, and we expect it to continue from now until Election Day.\\" In her first national interview about the 2016 presidential race, on July 7, 2015, Clinton was asked by CNN's Brianna Keilar about her use of private email accounts while serving as Secretary of State. She said: On September 9, 2015, Clinton apologized during an ABC News interview for using the private server, saying she was \\"sorry for that.\\" Appearing on NBC's Meet the Press on September 27, 2015, Clinton defended her use of the private email server while she was secretary of state, comparing the investigations to Republican-led probes of her husband's presidential administration more than two decades ago, saying, \\"It is like a drip, drip, drip. And that's why I said, there's only so much that I can control.\\" Clinton and the State Department said the emails were not marked classified when sent. However, Clinton signed a non-disclosure agreement which stated that classified material may be \\"marked or unmarked.\\" Additionally, the author of an email is legally required to properly mark it as classified if it contains classified material, and to avoid sending classified material on a personal device, such as the ones used exclusively by Clinton. Clinton maintained that she did not send or receive any confidential emails from her personal server. In a Democratic debate with Bernie Sanders on February 4, 2016, Clinton said, \\"I never sent or received any classified material.\\" In a Meet the Press interview on July 2, 2016, Clinton stated: \\"Let me repeat what I have repeated for many months now, I never received nor sent any material that was marked classified.\\" In an interview with Fox News in late July 2016, Clinton stated \\"Director Comey said my answers were truthful, and what I've said is consistent with what I have told the American people, that there were decisions discussed and made to classify retroactively certain of the emails.\\" The Washington Post awarded Clinton four \\"Pinocchios\\", its worst rating, for her statement saying \\"While Comey did say there was no evidence she lied to the FBI, that is not the same as saying she told the truth to the American public.\\" In her 2017 book What Happened?, Clinton argued that the email controversy and FBI Director James Comey's actions contributed to her loss. A 2019 study in the journal Perspectives on Politics found little evidence to support the hypothesis. In Venice at the \\"Hillary: The Hillary Clinton Emails,\\" a work on display in a balcony jutting out over a supermarket at the Despar Teatro Italia during the 58th Biennale of Visual Arts, Clinton made a surprise visit on Tuesday September 10, 2019, to this work of political theater and performance art. The exhibition created by the American poet and artist Kenneth Goldsmith was displayed from May 9, 2019, until November 24, 2019, curated by Francesco Urbano Ragazzi. During her appearance, she said that the attention given to her emails was one of the \\"strangest\\" and most \\"absurd\\" events in U.S. political history, adding, \\"Anyone can go in and look at them. There is nothing there. There is nothing that should have been so controversial.\\" Democratic response In August 2015, the New York Times reported on \\"interviews with more than 75 Democratic governors, lawmakers, candidates and party members\\" on the email issue. The Times reported, \\"None of the Democrats interviewed went so far as to suggest that the email issue raised concerns about Mrs. Clinton's ability to serve as president, and many expressed a belief that it had been manufactured by Republicans in Congress and other adversaries.\\" At the same time, many Democratic leaders showed increasing frustration among party leaders of Clinton's handling of the email issue. For example, Edward G. Rendell, former governor of Pennsylvania, a Clinton supporter, said that a failure of the Clinton campaign to get ahead of the issue early on meant that the campaign was \\"left just playing defense.\\" Other prominent Democrats, such as Governor Dannel P. Malloy of Connecticut, were less concerned, noting the campaign was at an early stage and that attacks on Clinton were to be expected. At the October 2015 primary debate, Clinton's chief rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, defended Clinton, saying: \\"Let me say this. Let me say something that may not be great politics. But I think the secretary is right. And that is that the American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails!\\" Sanders later clarified that he thought Clinton's emails were a \\"very serious issue,\\" but Americans want a discussion on issues that are \\"real\\" to them, such as paid family and medical leave, college affordability, and campaign finance reform. \\"But her emails!\\" became a meme during and following the 2016 election, often used in a joking or mocking way. Clinton herself echoed the phrase in June 2018, when the Justice Department's Inspector General issued a report on how the investigation of her use of email was conducted. It revealed that FBI Director Comey had used a personal email account to conduct FBI business; Clinton's response was a Twitter comment, \\"But my emails!\\" Republican response Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus said, in a statement regarding the June 30, 2015 email releases, \\"These emails ... are just the tip of the iceberg, and we will never get full disclosure until Hillary Clinton releases her secret server for an independent investigation.\\" Trey Gowdy said on June 29, 2015, that he would press the State Department for a fuller accounting of Clinton's emails, after the Benghazi panel retrieved 15 additional emails to Sidney Blumenthal that the department had not provided to the Committee. On September 12, 2015, Republican Senators Charles Grassley and Ron Johnson, chairmen of the Senate Judiciary and Homeland Security committees, respectively, said they would seek an independent review of the deleted emails, if they were recovered from Clinton's server, to determine if there were any government related items among those deleted. Comparisons and media coverage Analyses by Columbia Journalism Review, the Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University, and the Shorenstein Center at the Harvard Kennedy School show that the Clinton email controversy received more coverage in mainstream media outlets than any other topic during the 2016 presidential election. The New York Times coverage of the email controversy was notoriously extensive; according to a Columbia Journalism Review analysis, \\"in just six days, The New York Times ran as many cover stories about Hillary Clinton's emails as they did about all policy issues combined in the 69 days leading up to the election (and that does not include the three additional articles on October 18, and November 6 and 7, or the two articles on the emails taken from John Podesta).\\" In attempting to explain the lopsided coverage, the Columbia Journalism Review speculates, \\"In retrospect, it seems clear that the press in general made the mistake of assuming a Clinton victory was inevitable, and were setting themselves as credible critics of the next administration.\\" Media commentators drew comparisons of Clinton's email usage to past political controversies. Pacific Standard Magazine published an article in May 2015, comparing email controversy and her response to it with the Whitewater investigation 20 years earlier. In August 2015, Washington Post associate editor and investigative journalist Bob Woodward, when asked about Clinton's handling of her emails, said they remind him of the Nixon tapes from the Watergate scandal. On March 9, 2015, liberal columnist and Clinton supporter Dana Milbank wrote that the email affair was \\"a needless, self-inflicted wound\\" brought about by \\"debilitating caution\\" in \\"trying to make sure an embarrassing e-mail or two didn't become public,\\" which led to \\"obsessive secrecy.\\" Milbank pointed out that Clinton herself had justifiably criticized the George W. Bush administration in 2007 for its \\"secret\\" White House email accounts. On Fox News Sunday, political analyst Juan Williams contrasted the media coverage of Clinton's emails to the coverage of the 2007 Bush White House email controversy which he claimed received \\"just about zero press coverage.\\" PolitiFact found Williams' assertion to be \\"mostly false,\\" concluding \\"We found hundreds of articles and television transcripts referencing the issue. Still, Williams has something of a point that compared to the extensive recent coverage of Clinton's use of private email, media coverage of the 2007 Bush White House email controversy was thin.\\" The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel published an editorial opining that \\"the only believable reason for the private server in her basement was to keep her emails out of the public eye by willfully avoiding freedom of information laws. No president, no secretary of state, no public official at any level is above the law. She chose to ignore it, and must face the consequences.\\" Pascal-Emmanuel Gobry wrote in The Week that \\"Clinton set up a personal email server, in defiance or at least circumvention of rules, with the probable motive of evading federal records and transparency requirements, and did it with subpar security.\\" On November 2, 2016, Fox News anchor Bret Baier reported that according to Fox's anonymous sources the FBI had discovered that Clinton's private server had been hacked by \\"five foreign intelligence agencies.\\" Baier further reported that according to an anonymous source an FBI investigation of the Clinton Foundation was \\"likely\\" to lead to an indictment of Hillary Clinton. On November 4, 2016, he acknowledged that his assertions were a mistake, saying, \\"indictment obviously is a very loaded word,\\" and that he was sorry. House Select Committee on Benghazi On March 27, 2015, Republican Congressman Trey Gowdy, Chairman of the Select Committee on Benghazi, asserted that some time after October 2014, Clinton \\"unilaterally decided to wipe her server clean\\" and \\"summarily decided to delete all emails.\\" Clinton's attorney, David E. Kendall, said that day that an examination showed that no copies of any of Clinton's emails remained on the server. Kendall said the server was reconfigured to only retain emails for 60 days after Clinton lawyers had decided which emails needed to be turned over. On June 22, 2015, the Benghazi panel released emails between Clinton and Sidney Blumenthal, who had been recently deposed by the committee. Committee chairman Gowdy issued a press release criticizing Clinton for not providing the emails to the State Department. Clinton had said she provided all work- related emails to the State Department, and that only emails of a personal nature on her private server were destroyed. The State Department confirmed that 10 emails and parts of five others from Sidney Blumenthal regarding Benghazi, which the Committee had made public on June 22, could not be located in the Department's records, but that the 46 other, previously unreleased Libya-related Blumenthal emails published by the Committee, were in the Department's records. In response, Clinton campaign spokesman Nick Merrill, when asked about the discrepancy said: \\"She has turned over 55,000 pages of materials to the State Department, including all emails in her possession from Mr. Blumenthal.\\" Republican Committee members were encouraged about their probe, having found emails that Clinton failed to produce. Clinton campaign staff accused Gowdy and Republicans of \\"clinging to their invented scandal.\\" In response to comments that House Republican Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy made on September 29, 2015, about damaging Clinton's poll numbers, Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi threatened to end the Democrats' participation in the committee. Representative Louise Slaughter (D-NY) introduced an amendment to disband the committee, which was defeated in a party-line vote. On October 7, the editorial board of The New York Times called for the end of the committee. Representative Alan Grayson (D-FL) took step towards filing an ethics complaint, calling the committee \\"the new McCarthyism\\", alleging it was violating both House rules and federal law by using official funds for political purposes. Richard L. Hanna, (R-NY), and conservative pundit Bill O'Reilly acknowledged the partisan nature of the committee. Hillary Clinton's public hearing before the House Select Committee on Benghazi On October 22, 2015, Clinton testified before the Committee and answered members' questions for eleven hours before the Committee in a public hearing. The New York Times reported that \\"the long day of often-testy exchanges between committee members and their prominent witness revealed little new information about an episode that has been the subject of seven previous investigations ... Perhaps stung by recent admissions that the pursuit of Mrs. Clinton's emails was politically motivated, Republican lawmakers on the panel for the most part avoided any mention of her use of a private email server.\\" The email issue did arise shortly before lunch, in \\"a shouting match\\" between Republican committee chair Trey Gowdy and two Democrats, Adam Schiff and Elijah Cummings. Late in the hearing, Republican Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio accused Clinton of changing her accounts of the email service, leading to a \\"heated exchange\\" in which Clinton said that she had erred in making a private email account, but denied having dealt with anything marked classified, instead seeking \\"to be transparent by publicly releasing her emails.\\" Freedom of Information lawsuits Judicial Watch v. U.S. Department of State Huma Abedin and Hillary Clinton Judicial Watch, a conservative activist group, filed a complaint against the Department of State in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on September 10, 2013, seeking records under the federal Freedom of Information Act relating to Clinton aide Huma Abedin (a former deputy chief of staff and former senior advisor at the State Department). Judicial Watch was particularly interested in Abedin's role as a \\"special government employee\\" (SGE), a consulting position which allowed her to represent outside clients while also serving at the State Department. After corresponding with the State Department, Judicial Watch agreed to dismiss its lawsuit on March 14, 2014. On March 12, 2015, in response to the uncovering of Clinton's private email account, it filed a motion to reopen the suit, alleging that the State Department had misrepresented its search and had not properly preserved and maintained records under the act. U.S. District Judge Emmet G. Sullivan granted the motion to reopen the case on June 19, 2015. On July 21, 2015, Judge Sullivan issued supplemental discovery orders, including one that Clinton, Abedin, and former Deputy Secretary of State Cheryl Mills disclose any required information they had not disclosed already, and promise under oath that they had done so, including a description of the extent Abedin and Mills had used Clinton's email server for official government business. On August 10, 2015, Clinton filed her declaration, stating \\"I have directed that all my emails on clintonemail.com in my custody that were or potentially were federal records be provided to the Department of State,\\" and that as a result of this directive, 55,000 pages of emails were produced to the Department on December 5, 2014. She said in her statement that Abedin did have an email account through clintonemail.com that \\"was used at times for government business,\\" but that Mills did not. The statement was filed as Clinton faced questions over fifteen emails in exchanges with Blumenthal that were not among the emails she gave to the department the previous year. She did not address the matter of those emails in the statement. On September 25, 2015, several additional emails from her private server surfaced which she had not provided to the State Department. These emails between Clinton and General David Petraeus, discussing personnel matters, were part of an email chain that started on a different email account before her tenure as Secretary of State, but continued onto her private server in late January 2009 after she had taken office. The existence of these emails also called into question Clinton's previous statement that she did not use the server before March 18, 2009. In February 2016, Judge Sullivan issued a discovery order in the case, ruling that depositions of State Department officials and top Clinton aides were to proceed. On May 26, 2016, Judicial Watch released the transcript of the deposition of Lewis Lukens, on May 31, 2016, the transcript of Cheryl Mills, on June 7, 2016, the transcript of Ambassador Stephen Mull, and on June 9, 2016, Karin Lang, Director of Executive Secretariat Staff. The testimony of Clarence Finney, who worked in the department responsible for FOIA searches, said that he first became curious about Clinton's email setup after seeing the Texts from Hillary meme on the Internet. Jason Leopold v. U.S. Department of State In November 2014, Jason Leopold of Vice News made a Freedom of Information Act request for Clinton's State Department records, and, on January 25, 2015, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia seeking to compel production of responsive documents. After some dispute between Leopold and the State Department over the request, U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras ordered rolling production and release of the emails on a schedule set by the State Department. Over the next several months, the State Department completed production of 30,068 emails, which were released in 14 batches, with the final batch released on February 29, 2016. Both the Wall Street Journal and WikiLeaks independently set up search engines for anyone who would like to search through the Clinton emails released by the State Department. It was revealed in October 2017 that during the 2016 US Presidential election, Cambridge Analytica funder and GOP mega-donor Rebekah Mercer had proposed creating a searchable data base for Hillary Clinton emails in the public domain and then forwarded this suggestion to several people, including Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix, who personally emailed a request to Julian Assange for Clinton's emails. Assange responded to the report by saying he denied Nix's request. The emails showed that Blumenthal communicated with Clinton while Secretary on a variety of issues including Benghazi. Associated Press v. U.S. Department of State On March 11, 2015, the day after Clinton acknowledged her private email account, the Associated Press (AP) filed suit against the State Department regarding multiple FOIA requests over the past five years. The requests were for various emails and other documents from Clinton's time as secretary of state and were still unfulfilled at the time. The State Department said that a high volume of FOIA requests and a large backlog had caused the delay. On July 20, 2015, U.S. District Judge Richard J. Leon reacted angrily to what he said was \\"the State Department for four years dragging their feet.\\" Leon said that \\"even the least ambitious bureaucrat\\" could process the request faster than the State Department was doing. On August 7, 2015, Leon issued an order setting a stringent schedule for the State Department to provide the AP with the requested documents over the next eight months. The order issued by Leon did not include the 55,000 pages of Clinton emails the State Department scheduled to be released in the Leopold case, or take into account 20 boxes given to the State Department by Philippe Reines, a former Clinton senior adviser. Other suits and coordination of email cases In September 2015, the State Department filed a motion in court seeking to consolidate and coordinate the large number of Freedom of Information Act lawsuits relating to Clinton and Clinton-related emails. There were at the time at least three dozen lawsuits pending, before 17 different judges. In a U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia order issued on October 8, 2015, Chief U.S. District Judge Richard W. Roberts wrote that the cases did not meet the usual criteria for consolidation but: \\"The judges who have been randomly assigned to these cases have been and continue to be committed to informal coordination so as to avoid unnecessary inefficiencies and confusion, and the parties are also urged to meet and confer to assist in coordination.\\" In 2015, Judicial Watch and the Cause of Action Institute filed two lawsuits seeking a court order to compel the Department of State and the National Archives and Records Administration to recover emails from Clinton's server. In January 2016, these two suits (which were consolidated because they involved the same issues) were dismissed as moot by U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, because the government was already working to recover and preserve these emails. In March 2016, the Republican National Committee filed four new complaints in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia stemming from Freedom of Information Act requests it had filed the previous year. These new filings brought the total number of civil suits over access to Clinton's records pending in federal court to at least 38. In June 2016, in response to the Republican National Committee's complaints filed in March 2016, the State Department estimates it will take 75 years to complete the review of documents which are responsive to the complaints. It has been observed that a delay of this nature would cause the documents to remain out of public view longer than the vast majority of classified documents which must be declassified after 25 years.

It was founded in 2010 by Ismail Ahmed, Catherine Wines, and Richard Igoe. As of 2018, WorldRemit had around 3 million users. Its primary competitors include Remitly and TransferWise.  History  WorldRemit was founded in 2010 by Dr. Ismail Ahmed, a former compliance advisor to the United Nations Development Programme. Ahmed began developing WorldRemit while studying for an MBA at London Business School. He has said that the idea of an online money transfer service was partly influenced by his own frustrating experience of sending money to relatives in Somaliland using offline, agent-based services. In October 2018, WorldRemit announced that founder Ahmed would be stepping into the role of executive chairman and the company would be bringing in Breon Corcoran as CEO.  Operations  WorldRemit was one of the first online money transfer start ups to focus heavily on mobile-to-mobile money transfer. From the outset, on the sending side WorldRemit has been 100% cashless. For those receiving money, WorldRemit offers a wide range of options including bank deposit, mobile money, mobile airtime top-up and cash collection. While money transfer to developing countries reached an all-time high of $690 billion in 2018, they have traditionally been costly and inconvenient for families worldwide that rely on these funds for education, healthcare, and basic survival. WorldRemit helps address this issue with a network of 6,700 corridors ‚Äì one of the biggest networks for digital money transfers worldwide. The company is connected to the major mobile money services globally, including M-Pesa (Kenya), MTN (Africa and Asia), and bKash (Bangladesh). Digital remittances reduce dependency on sending cash through informal channels such as the hawala system, and improve security to address with global compliance requirements. As of October 2019, WorldRemit can send funds instantaneously to 115 different countries. WorldRemit also offers money transfer services to all African countries except for Sudan, South Sudan, Eswatini, Eritrea, Libya, and Algeria.  Funding  WorldRemit is backed by venture capital companies Accel Partners and Technology Crossover Ventures (TCV). In March 2014, WorldRemit secured a Series A investment of $40m from Accel Partners, an early backer of Facebook and Spotify, and Project A Ventures. Following the investment, Accel's Harry Nelis joined the WorldRemit board. In February 2015 WorldRemit announced a $100m Series B funding round led by TCV. It was also announced that TCV General Partner John Rosenberg would join the WorldRemit board. In 2017, the company received a $40 million investment in their Series C round of funding. LeapFrog Investments was the lead investor for this round of funding. In 2019, WorldRemit raised a $175 million Series D funding round, led by TCV, Accel and Leapfrog Investments.

It has been shown to have physiological effects, such as increased heart rate, blood pressure and cortisol, in daily life as well as under controlled laboratory conditions. Because of these physiological effects, the psychological concept of perseverative cognition helps to explain how psychological stress, such as work stress and marital stress, leads to disease, such as cardiovascular disease. Definition The definition of perseverative cognition is: \\"the repeated or chronic activation of the cognitive representation of one or more psychological stressors\\". Worry, rumination and all other forms of thought (cognition) involving stressful events, in the past or in the future, fall under the definition of perseverative cognition. 'Just thinking about your problems, without calling it worrying or rumination', is also perseverative cognition, as is mind wandering when it concerns negative topics. Importantly, there is a large body of knowledge about the typical constituents of perseverative cognition, such as worry, rumination, repetitive thinking and (negative) mind wandering (reviewed in Watkins, 2008). Perseverative cognition may partly be unconscious. Just as people are not aware of the larger part of their thoughts (cognition), they may also not be aware of the cognitive representation of stressors.  Perseverative cognition hypothesis  The perseverative cognition hypothesis holds that stressful events begin to affect people's health when they think about them repetitively or continuously (that is, 'perseverate cognitively'). Stressful events themselves are often too short, as are the physiological responses to them. Therefore the physiological responses during these stressors are unlikely to cause bodily harm. More importantly, many stressful events are merely worried about, or feared in the future, while they often do not happen or do not have the feared consequences. Nevertheless, the body reacts with prolonged physiological responses to continuous thoughts (perseverative cognition) about these stressors. Therefore it is the perseverative cognition, and not the stressors that can eventually lead to disease. In scientific terms, it is said that perseverative cognition is a mediator of the detrimental effects of stress on one's health. Since its publication scientific evidence for this hypothesis has been accumulating.  Physiological effects and disease  Perseverative cognition is involved with a ‚Äústress-disease link\\". Further, it is the thinking about the stress, or rather the obsessing over it, that establishes a link between stress and disease. Perseverative cognition also focuses on the effects that worrying over anticipated events have on the physical body and mind. This could suggest that obsessive worrying over past events or the future could lead to physical issues. There are some physical evidences of the effects of perseverative cognition, as noted in an analysis article. The article found that cortisol levels, as well as the average heart rates of individuals, were higher when perseverative cognitive processes were present. Another article says that ‚Äúworrying about stressful events increases the total amount of time that stress has a ‚Äòwear and tear‚Äô effect on the human body.‚Äù Studies have been done that show links between cognitive perseverance and increased heart rates. The consistent, ruminating thoughts circulating in one‚Äôs mind could lead to physical responses. It is also discussed in another article that these worries create psychological issues that in turn create physical negative outcomes. It is not, as the article claims, the events themselves that create the physical issues, but rather the consistent worrying about them that causes the issues. In another article, it is discussed that perseverative cognition increases heart rate, and also impacts parts of the brain, notably in the prefrontal and amygdala areas. There is a connection between the brain and the heart when it comes to perseverative cognition. When present, it impacts not only mental facilities, but also physical components. One article describes the physical components as a response to the thoughts, ‚Äúas if the individual were facing an external stressor‚Äù. The article also talks about how obsessive thoughts of worry lead to greater depression. Cognitive perseverance leads to multiple issues, ranging from mood to heart rate. Cognitive perseverance not only impacts mental and physical processing, but it also has the possibility of impacting sleep, as explored in one article. In this article, the impact of obsessive worrying regarding jobs, therefore creating perseverative cognition, on sleep was explored. They found that there was a correlation between excessive job centered perseverative cognition and a lack of good sleep. Perseverative cognition impacts several parts of life. Another article talks about how poor sleep could happen when one had perseverative cognition. The article uses the term mind wandering to talk about ‚Äúpersistent and repetitive‚Äù thoughts and correlates with other mental disorders. Perseverative cognition can affect more than physical components, as stated earlier. The same article also talked about how mental rigidity ties in with perseverative cognition and impacts individuals in multiple ways. In addition, perseverative cognition has potential to make other mental illnesses worse. In another article, on its effect on PTSD, it was found that with severe PTSD and the perseverative cognition, it correlated with less recovery regarding cardiovascular disease.

Far up in the Himalayas, a couple of hours drive (75 km) from the border town of Kargil, further north from the grand Srinagar-Leh Highway lie the ruins of what once was a majestic fort. Rumored to be taller and older than its famous cousin ‚Äì the Leh Palace, the Chiktan fortress is shrouded in many mysteries. Legends of its making, numerous sinister and violent events, magical tales of wondrous creations and a heart-wrenching tailspin of destruction and apathy encompass the story of this fabulous fortress set in an almost fantastical location. Initiated By Tahtah Khan, Prince of Baltistan who ran away after a failed attempt was made to kill him. He took Shelter in Chiktan area, He was awestruck by the place and decided to construct a fort here in the 8th century but managed to build only a small palace. Built in the 16th century by Balti craftsmen, the castle served as a royal residence for centuries despite shifts in rulers as the region was amalgamated with neighboring kingdoms. Today, the neglect and natural forces have reduced the fort to rubble. Chiktan Castle is located deep inside a valley, by the Indus river, with the mountains in the background. It is composed of rammed earth and stone masonry with mud mortar. Following the designs of architect and carpenter Shinkhen Chandan, the castle used timber to support the ceilings of the structure as well as to frame the doors and windows. The Palace was one of the Masterpieces of Ladakh and Tibetian Architecture which was famous across Lhasa, Tibet. It reportedly had a rotating room which used to rotate with support of air blowing. The Chiktan Palace was Inhabited by the King until Dogra King of Jammu annexed the area, He tried to suppress the Influence of King and started destroying the fort. Prepared for impending attacks, Chiktan Castle was a symbol of unity, strength, brotherhood, and community for the peoples of the region. The castle was attacked several times during its history, but was not abandoned until the late 19th century. Neglect and natural elements have left the castle in an advanced state of decay. Large portions of the outer walls have collapsed, partially due to the removal of stone in the mid 20th century for a local government hospital which was Sanctioned and allotted for the Royal Family to construct but Father in Law of the King decided to keep the money and decided to use bricks of the wall of the fort beside the Wood Carving. Seeing the Negligence, people of Village started using wood as resource which slowly destroyed the Fort. Stories of Hauntings were spread to stop people from exploiting the Fort As the capital of the Chiktan region, the castle was a significant political center and military fortification, and remains an important symbol of shared history and culture in the region.

For example, polyaniline vanadium (V) oxide (PAni/V2O5) can be incorporated into the nitroxide-polymer lithium iron phosphate battery, PTMA/LiFePO4. Together, they improve the lithium ion intercalation capacity, cycle life, electrochemical performances, and conductivity of batteries. PAni/V2O5 Oxides, like V2O5, are used as cathodes in rechargeable lithium batteries. Crystalline V2O5 has a weaker rechargeability or cyclability than amorphous V2O5 because the crystal structure is damaged during discharge/charge cycles.Ng, S. H., Chew, S. Y., Wang, J., Wexler, D., Tournayre, Y., Konstantinov, K., & Liu, H. K. (2007). Synthesis and electrochemical properties of V 2 O 5 nanostructures prepared via a precipitation process for lithium-ion battery cathodes. Journal of Power Sources, 174(2), 1032-1035. However, amorphous oxides, in particular the V2O5 xerogel, allows lithium ions to diffuse faster and thus have a better cyclability. Hybrid is formed by combining a conducting organic polymer (e.g. polyaniline) with an oxide (e.g. V2O5). Figure 1: Diagram of charging and discharging of hybrid battery Figure 3: Exact protocol for V2O5 gels Figure 2: Polyaniline/V2O5, where V2O5 is represented in black and polyaniline is represented in red V2O5 gels are prepared using the ion-exchange method.Liu, D., Liu, Y., Garcia, B. B., Zhang, Q., Pan, A., Jeong, Y. H., & Cao, G. (2009). V2O5 xerogel electrodes with much enhanced lithium-ion intercalation properties with N 2 annealing. Journal of Materials Chemistry, 19(46), 8789-8795. doi:10.1039/b914436f. Vanadium (V) polymerizes aniline. Before synthesis of a hybrid battery, potentiometric titration of V2O5 gel with (NH4)2Fe(SO4)2*6H2O is carried out; this determines the amount of V(V) present in the gel. Aniline solution is slowly added onto the V2O5*\\\\mathit{n}H2O gel. The following procedure is demonstrated in Figure 3. V2O5 is used because of its high specific capacity, high thermal stability, and high structural flexibility with lithium.Chao, D., Xia, X., Liu, J., Fan, Z., Ng, C. F., Lin, J., ... & Fan, H. J. (2014). A V2O5/Conductive‚ÄêPolymer Core/Shell Nanobelt Array on Three‚ÄêDimensional Graphite Foam: A High‚ÄêRate, Ultrastable, and Freestanding Cathode for Lithium‚ÄêIon Batteries. Advanced Materials, 26(33), 5794-5800. doi:10.1002/adma.201400719. Up to three moles of lithium ions can be added into the V2O5 lattice to create different structures.Swider-Lyons, K. E., Love, C. T., & Rolison, D. R. (2002). Improved lithium capacity of defective V2O5 materials. Solid State Ionics, 152, 99-104. doi:10.1016/S0167-2738(02)00350-8. The structures created give the hybrid a long battery life. However, the intercalation capacity depends on the moderate electrical conductivity and low diffusion coefficient of the lithium ions in the vanadium oxide matrix.Li, G., Lu, Z., Huang, B., Huang, H., Xue, R., & Chen, L. (1995). An evaluation of lithium intercalation capacity into carbon by XRD parameters. Solid state ionics, 81(1), 15-18. doi:10.1016/0167-2738(95)00166-4. Polyaniline is easily produced to have controlled structural and electronic properties.Molapo, K. M., Ndangili, P. M., Ajayi, R. F., Mbambisa, G., Mailu, S. M., Njomo, N., ... & Iwuoha, E. I. (2012). Electronics of conjugated polymers (I): polyaniline.International Journal of Electrochemical Science, 7(12). Polyaniline eliminates the coordinated water of the V2O5 xerogel, so more lithium ions can be integrated into the structure. The organic part of the PAni/V2O5 hybrid degrades with the increase of temperature.Lira-Cantu, M., Gomez-Romero, P. (1999), The Organic- Inorganic Polyaniline/V2O5 System: Application as a High Capacity Hybrid Cathode for Rechargeable Lithium Batteries. Journal of the Electrochemical Society, 146(6): 2029-2033. doi:10.1149/1.1391886. V(V) is reduced to V(IV), and aniline is oxidized to polyaniline.Lira-Cantu, M., Gomez-Romero, P. (1999), The Organic-Inorganic Polyaniline/V2O5 System: Application as a High Capacity Hybrid Cathode for Rechargeable Lithium Batteries. Journal of the Electrochemical Society, 146(6): 2029-2033. doi:10.1149/1.1391886. Re- oxidizing V(IV) to a higher oxidation state of V(V) increases initial cell voltage and specific capacity. Since polyaniline is an electrochemically active component, it improves the specific charge of the hybrid material. Combining polyaniline with V2O5 yields a larger specific charge difference. Thus, a greater total capacity contribution than V2O5 alone. Furthermore, the hybrid has a higher specific capacity than that of the V2O5 xerogel. Electrical conductivity is as high as 0.09 S/cm for 15 days.Park, K., Song, H., Kim, Y., Mho, S., Cho, W., and Yeo. I. (2009), Electrochemical Preparation and Characterization of V2O5 / Polyaniline composite Film Cathodes for Li Battery. Electrochimica Acta: Emerging Trends and Challenges in Electrochemistry, 55(27): 8023-8029. doi:10.1016/j.electacta.2009.12.047. As a result, PAni/V2O5 hybrid is a conducting network and an electroactive material in the composites, which improves electrochemical behavior. It also prevents the irreversible structural changes made by redox cycling when the lithium ions enter the lattice. Moreover, this hybrid also has a high specific capacity and improved cyclability without capacity deterioration. PTMA/LiFePO4 PTMA is an organic nitroxide radical electrode-active polymer, and LiFePO4 is the inorganic electrode-active material. PTMA is used because it has a high capacity and a long cycle life.Guo, W., Yin, Y., Xin, S., Guo Y., and Wan, L. (2011), Superior Radical Polymer Cathode Material with a Two-electron Process Redox Reaction Promoted by Graphene. Energy and Environmental Science, 5(1): 5221-5225. doi: 10.1039/c1ee02148f. To synthesize organic radical-inorganic hybrid electrodes, electrode environments for each component must be optimized. PTMA and LiFePO4 were combined with entire PTMA and LiFePO4 electrode with different weight ratios: 25/75, 50/50, and 75/25.Huang, Q., Cosimbescu, L., Koech, P., Choi, D., and Lemmon, J. (2013), Composite Organic Radical-Inorganic Hybrid Cathode for Lithium-Ion Batteries. Journal of Power Sources, 233(3): 69-73. doi:10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.01.076. Figure 4: Synthesis of PTMA- MTMP monomer (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine methacrylate) The cell was prepared by using a working electrode to assemble a half-cell configuration dry glove box with Li metal as an anode, ethyl carbonate/dimethyl carbonate as an electrophile, and a Celgard 3501 membrane as a separator. Using Arbin BT-200 Battery Tester, the cell was electrochemically cycled at room temperature. By using a Solarton workstation, the cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy of cells were performed. A focus ion beam-scanning electron microscope was used to determine the morphology of the electrodes before and after the high rate pulse discharge (HRPD) cycling.Huang, Q., Cosimbescu, L., Koech, P., Choi, D., and Lemmon, J. (2013), Composite Organic Radical-Inorganic Hybrid Cathode for Lithium-Ion Batteries. Journal of Power Sources, 233(3): 69-73. doi:10.1016/j.jpowsour.2013.01.076. After testing, pure PTMA and LiFePO4 electrode give a sharp redox peak and decrease the voltage gap between oxidation and reduction.Vlad, A., Singh, N., Rolland, J., Melinte, S., Ajayan, P. M., & Gohy, J. F. (2014). Hybrid supercapacitor-battery materials for fast electrochemical charge storage.Scientific reports, 4. doi:10.1038/sren04315. Therefore, PTMA and LiFePO4 improve the rate and reversibility of the redox couples. Furthermore, the hybrid cathodes have a lower charge-transfer resistance, allowing easier migration of Li ions through the electrode interface. Moreover, PTMA/LiFePO4 has a longer life cycle compared to pure LiFePO4 or PTMA systems.

She then became the model for many painters, including Jean Ag√©lou, Amedeo Modigliani and Chaim Soutine, who persuaded her to study painting and art history at the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux- Arts. In March 1917, she met the Japanese artist Tsuguharu Foujita at the Caf√© de la Rotonde in Montparnasse, who fell madly in love with her and married her thirteen days later. In 1918 the couple moved to escape the German bombs to Cagnes-sur-Mer, where she spent a year painting and meeting many friends. During this period, she became friends with Jeanne H√©buterne, the bride of Modigliani. When Modigliani died of tuberculosis in 1920, Barrey tried in vain to console the new widow, but Jeanne, eight months pregnant, committed suicide. During the year 1925, the couple led a very open relationship, both having relations with people of both sexes. The painter did not forgive Fernande after she had a love affair with his cousin, Koyanagi, a painter. He then locked himself with the Belgian artist Lucie Badoul (called Youki) for three days during which Fernande desperately sought her husband in the Parisian morgues. In 1928, the couple divorced and she lived with Koyanagi in Montmartre. When Koyanagi was separated himself in 1935, his relationship with Tsugouharu Foujita improved; he helped her financially until her death. Some sources link Fernande Barrey and the famous Miss Fernande, favourite model of the female photographer Jean Ag√©lou, who appeared on many erotic postcards, although this has never been proven. As a painter, she exhibited the paintings Josiane and Les P√™ches at the Salon d'Automne in 1929.

The church, dedicated to Saint Thomas of Canterbury, was built between 1607 and 1669. The church is a listed historical monument since 1932. Eglise Saint-Thomas-de-Cantorb√©ry History The clock tower was built in 1607 and on the small bell-tower attached to the sacristy, the date 1669 is inscribed. The church was listed on the 11 May 1932. Only the church and ossuary remain of the original parish enclosure. The original sanctuary or priory dates back to around 1200 when it was established by Herv√© 1st of L√©on and dedicated to Saint Thomas Becket, who had been assassinated by Henry II of England. Historians suggest that the choice of Becket as the patron saint was a demonstration of Herv√© 1st's determination to avoid English domination and to remove the stigma left by his father's defeat and death at the hands of the English in 1167. When Brittany began to prosper in the 16th and 17th centuries, the existing church was replaced by something more substantial and the resultant church included a bell tower with porch, a nave with five transepts and two aisles and a flat chevet in the Flamboyant Gothic style, so typical of the region's churches in the 16th century. The √âglise Saint- Houardon is also an important church in Landerneau. The porch The arched porch has a leaf-shaped keystone and has three niches topped with the carving of a crescent moon, a design attributed to Philibert Delorme and common to the area. The porch interior has 12 niches to accommodate statues of the apostles but these niches are empty. There is however a stoup carved from Kersanton stone, this having a fluted bowl. The sabli√®res These have both Renaissance type motifs with masks, putti and vases and some more bizarre and humorous carvings such as a sow drinking from a barrel whilst a woman has taken a knife and attempts to carve a piece from the sow's bottom. The altar This takes the shape of a tomb. The altar was built in 1711 and is surmounted by a five-lancet window, and on one side of the altar there is a statue of Saint Thomas of Canterbury and on the other Saint Blaise. Under each statue there is a bas-relief depicting their martyrdoms. Above the steps of the altar are two reliefs. One depicts the Last Supper and the second Jesus washing the disciples' feet. Statues The church has many fine statues in the nave and choir areas. There is a sculpture in wood of the Virgin Mary dating from 1430 to 1450 and a statue in Kersanton stone dating from the 16th century. File:Sainte Anne-LANDERNEAU.jpgStatue of Saint Anne. She holds the Virgin Mary and baby Jesus File:Vierge m√®re couch√©e-LANDERNEAU.jpgWood carving depicting the Virgin Mary The ossuary The ossuary dates to 1635 and stands on the west side of the church. It is dedicated to Saint Cadou, a 16th-century monk. The building's fa√ßade has four windows separated by ionic pilasters.

Life and work  Early on, Schneider showed a keen interest in photography often shooting and processing up to one hundred feet of black & white film a week. Growing increasingly tired of the representational aspects of photography, through darkroom manipulations, Schneider began to essentially abstract the \\"objectivity\\" of the camera lens. One of his professors at the University of South Florida suggested he enroll in a figure drawing and art theory class. Not long after these initial steps into fine art, Schneider attended the 1980 Picasso Retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. This exhibition confirmed his desire to become an artist. After he received his BFA in 1983 from Miami University, he worked as an Art Director in commercial design with the John K. Howe Company, painting at night in garages and basements until he acquired a studio in downtown Cincinnati. Soon after, he received a scholarship to the graduate painting program at the University of Cincinnati. Working with Robert Knipschild and Frank Herrmann he received his master's degree of Fine Art in 1989. Schneider moved to New York City in 1990 to pursue his career in art and quickly became an integral part of the vibrant painting scene there. Early in New York, Schneider worked as a studio assistant for many of New York's most recognized artists, notably Moira Dryer, Ron Gorchov, Dorothea Rockburne, Janet Fish, Chuck Close and David Salle. By taking advantage of their generational perspectives, this allowed the young artist to see first hand the inner workings of not only their relevant studios but also the gallery system that these artist‚Äôs worked within. His early exhibitions included \\"Presentational Painting\\" curated by Sanford Wumfeld and Eileen Roaman at Hunter College and the ‚ÄúEast-West Cultural Studies‚Äù painting show curated by Robert Storr, a relationship that led to numerous projects with Storr at the Museum of Modern Art. As scenes shifted, Schneider began to show his work with a gallery in Williamsburg, Brooklyn formed by Leah Stuhltrager and Cris Dam, which would lead to three group exhibitions. Schneider‚Äôs work was seen as ‚ÄúA blending of male androgyny and American pop cultural‚Äù his reference to the \\"Cowboy Philosopher\\" \\"...reinforced the patriarchal power dynamic juxtaposed with the sometimes vulnerable and otherwise unassuming female character.‚Äù His canvases, \\"...Sophisticatedly staged by the artist, draw on inferences through association in our society and culture.\\" The narratives struck an accord in the Brooklyn art scene as Schneider continued to exhibit throughout the borough as well as, Manhattan. The relationship with the Dam Stuhltrager Gallery led to his first international exhibition in Madrid, Spain. Schneider, along with Loren Munk, Cris Dam and William Powhida exhibited at Galeria ArteVeintiuno, curated by Javier Duero from the Museo Reina Sofia. After the exhibition in Madrid Schneider continued to focus on the European art scene which led to numerous exhibitions with Hillsboro Fine Art in Dublin, Ireland. Aidan Dunne of the Irish Times declared Schneider‚Äôs work as ‚Äúlively explorations of the mythology of the cowboy-gunslinger, treated humorously and with deftness of touch.‚Äù Schneider has continued to exhibit in art fairs and galleries throughout Europe, as well as, exhibitions in Chicago, Miami and New York. He has exhibited with noted artists, Julian Schnabel, Ross Bleckner and Donald Baechler as well as other New York artists and has lectured on his work at Hunter College in New York and the Dun Laoghaire Institute of Art in Dublin. The Oliver Sears Gallery represents Schneider‚Äôs work in Europe and in the United States. Schneider currently resides and works in New York City.

It takes its name from the Ticket of Leave issued to convicts when they were released from jail on parole. A recently returned convict is blackmailed by another man into committing a robbery, but is rescued thanks to the intervention of a detective. It has been described as probably being the first play about a detective. The play introduced the character of Hawkshaw the Detective, with \\"Hawkshaw\\" becoming a synonym for a detective. It was not well received by critics, but proved very popular with audiences and was constantly revived, becoming one of the standard works of Victorian melodrama.Lachman, p. 4 First production The play was first produced in March 1863 at the Olympic Theatre in London. The cast included Henry Gartside Neville as Robert Brierly, Horace Wigan as Hawkshaw, Robert Soutar as Green Jones and Kate Saville as May Edwards.Tom Taylor, The Ticket- of-Leave Man, accessed 1 November 2015. A reviewer in The Spectator wrote, \\" Mr. Tom Taylor, one of our ablest dramatic writers, has treated a great social question with a definite purpose, a degree of artistic skill, and a depth of earnestness... which render The Ticket-of-Leave Man to be viewed in no ordinary light.\\"30 May 1863, page 15 The Spectator archive, accessed 15 February 2016. Plot Robert Brierly, a young man from Lancashire, is enjoying his first visit to London. Two criminals, Melter Moss and James Dalton, pretend to lend him money, giving him a forged note. Brierly is arrested when he tries to exchange the note for currency and is sentenced to four years in prison. He had been kind to May, a young woman, who waits for his release from prison, even though Brierly's forged note caused the ruin of May's landlady Mrs Willoughby. Brierly secretly repays the money to Mrs Willoughby. May and Brierly are planning to marry, but on the day of his wedding, his employer finds out that he is an ex-convict, and he is fired. Brierly cannot find work, and Moss and Dalton try to force him to help them rob the brokerage firm where he had worked. Brierly plays along but reports them to the police; a detective uses a disguise to help him. Brierly is wounded in a fight in a churchyard, but the criminals are arrested, and Brierly's honour is restored. Film adaptations It has been turned into a number of film adaptations, mostly in the silent era. This included The Ticket of Leave Man (1912), The Ticket-of-Leave Man (1918) and the 1937 Tod Slaughter melodrama The Ticket of Leave Man. The 1914 film The Ticket-of-Leave Man is not an adaptation of the play, but is based on the 1869 novel Foul Play written by Taylor's frequent collaborator Charles Reade.

The three-movement work was published by Artaria in 1780 in a set of six sonatas dedicated to the sisters Katharina and Marianna Auenbrugger. The sonata has three movements: #Allegro moderato (E-flat major) #Adagio (C minor) #Finale: Allegro (E-flat major) The first movement is in sonata form. It is monothematic, in that the movement only presents and significantly develops one distinct theme. The second movement is a siciliana. The third is in da capo form, akin to a minuet and trio. The two movements are linked by an attacca direction: the second movement has an open ending on a G-major chord; the third movement follows immediately, and that chord becomes the submediant triad (with raised third) of the new movement's key of E-flat major.

ON Power also provides water for space heating in Reykjav√≠k and surrounding areas. Traditionally, ON Power's main service area is Reykjav√≠k and surrounding areas in the south-west part of Iceland, although households and businesses can buy electricity from any supplier in Iceland, regardless of location.  History  ON Power was founded on 1 January 2014 as a subsidiary of Reykjavik Energy ‚Äì which is owned by the city of Reykjav√≠k and the municipalities of Akranes and Borgarnes. To comply with Icelandic law no. 65/2003 that effectively call for the de-regulation of the Icelandic electricity market, Reykjavik Energy moved its production and sales of electricity ‚Äì including power plants ‚Äì into the ON Power subsidiary.  Power Plants  Nesjavellir Geothermal Plant ON Power owns and operates the Nesjavellir and Hellishei√∞i Geothermal Plants. The plants provide electricity and hot water to industry and households in Iceland. 99% of housing in the Reykjav√≠k area is space-heated with hot water provided by geothermal sources. Both plants are situated in the Hengill region; an active volcanic ridge in the south-west part of Iceland. ON also operates the Andak√≠ls√°rvirkjun hydrostation, situated in Borgarfj√∂r√∞ur. The Nesjavellir Geothermal Plant has been operating since 1990 and the Hellishei√∞i Plant since 2006, with a combined output of 423 MWe and 433 MWth. The Andak√≠ls√°rvirkjun has been operating since 1947 and has a total output of 8 MWe. The Elli√∞a√°r hydrostation ‚Äì commissioned in 1921 ‚Äì was operated by ON (and Reykjavik Energy prior to that) until 2013 when Icelandic laws 104/2001 declared the station, including machinery and pipelines, a historic preservation. As a result, the Elli√∞a√°r station was decommissioned.  Fast- Charging Stations for Electric Cars  In March 2014, ON Power opened the first DC fast-charging stations for electric cars in Iceland. Electric cars that classified under the CHAdeMO and Type 2 CCS quick charging method can use the stations, free of charge(although pricing will begin in 2017). Most stations also have an AC 43Kw Type 2 charger. Since opening, the network has slowly expanded and now operates 16 fast charging stations. In December 2016, The Icelandic Ministry of Industry and Innovation allocated funding of 57.100.000kr over 3 years to ON in order to set up 14 individual 50Kw DC fast charging stations around the country. ON plan to place chargers around the Ring Road with this funding. As a result, in May 2017 the company opened 3 additional chargers along Route 1 at Sta√∞arsk√°li, Bl√∂ndu√≥s and Varmahl√≠√∞; completing the route between Reykjav√≠k and Akureyri.Fast-Charging Station at Selfoss ON operates 16 chargers in the following locations: * Reykjav√≠k Area(x6) * Reykjanesb√¶r * Hellishei√∞i Power Station * Selfoss * Akureyri(x2) * Varmahl√≠√∞ * Bl√∂ndu√≥s * Sta√∞arsk√°li * Borgarnes * Akranes  Emissions from Hellishei√∞i  With the geothermal plants situated at Hengill ‚Äì an active volcanic area ‚Äì emissions of H2S (hydrogen sulfide) and CO2 (carbon dioxide) are released naturally from the area. Harnessing the geothermal resources has increased the concentration levels of those emissions with the expansion of the Hellishei√∞i Plant in recent years. ON Power has worked to reduce those emissions by injecting H2S and CO2 back into the bedrock. The process dissolves H2S in condensate water and injects it back into the high- temperature geothermal reservoir. Once injected, water-rock reactions taking place in the high-temperature geothermal reservoir will mineralize the H2S. This method continues to be tested at industrial scale at the Hellishei√∞i Power Plant since early 2014.

That is to say, a user can only see those likes and comments made by conjunct friends between the user and the author, while cannot see the expressions made by people beyond their friend lists. Except this general principle, individual setting for blocking certain friends from seeing owners' posts can be made by users.Tomar,A. Kakkar,A.

Its giant user group and mode of ‚Äúcontent proceeding from relationship‚Äùenables the development of particular culture in Moments, which can be summarized as ‚Äúcircle culture‚Äù. ‚ÄúCircle culture‚Äù can further include some specific cultures such as the culture of sharing and‚Äúlike‚Äù and the culture of grouping. Circle culture Circle CultureMoments has strict verification for participants, which makes one‚Äôs virtual social circle more intimate and tightly formed, and more integrated into real-life social circle. Only mutual friends can set up communication in one circle, which indicates the high reciprocity and exclusivity among acquaintances. Moments accords with the Chinese-style interpersonal structure, which was described as the ripples generating circle by circle when a stone is thrown into water and everyone is in the center of a series of circles. The ties get weaker as the circles spread further.Fei,X.T.

People can decide in every single sharing that who can see while others not, and all these will be kept to themselves. Grouping provides some people with the opportunity of living in parallel space-time, the right of gaining admiration and the possibility of escapism.What is Moments?

(2014) Research on Model of Online Knowledge Sharing for CoPS R&D; Team based on WeChat Platform Negative Impacts *Spreading of false informationFalse Information in Moments is Illegal,Relevant Polices will be made.(People Net,August 7,2014) As a social platform, Moments contains risks of misinformation, for example, \\"Ten secrets about Bo Xilai\\", \\"drinking milk leads to cancer\\". False information also spreads rapidly through reposts and sharing websites. Since most Moments friends are acquaintances, messages delivered by them can seem more convincing. Such false information misleads the public as well as causes negative social influence, even panic. *Viral MarketingChen,H.M.(2006) Discussion about Viral Marketing Marketing becomes a problem because some users operate online stores by using their Wechat accounts. To advertise goods, viral marketing methods including utilizing acquaintances network and posting advertisements several times a day in Moments are widely used.Liang,Y.(2014) Introduction to the WeChat Marketing Advantages and Development Prospects However, the existence of commercial advertising impacts the pureness of Moments and annoy most of users. To reduce advertisements, users have to block their friend-traders, though which will hurt their relations. Also, due to the absence of relevant policies, quality and service of those goods can hardly be guaranteed. *Barrage of information Except false information and advertisements, inspirational articles and Chicken Soup for the Soul(ÂøÉÈùàÈõûÊπØ) style stories elicit repugnance as well. It is because that almost all those stories follow similar ideal patterns and express similar thoughts. At first, such stories can inspire readers, but after a while, it is proved as nothing but placebo. Furthermore, some of them even make up experience or dicta of great men to persuade others to believe in their themes.

Education  Louis Euzet was a high-school student in Narbonne, France, and a student of the University of Montpellier (in the then ‚ÄúFacult√© des Sciences‚Äù). He obtained his bachelor's degree (Licence) in 1947. He prepared his doctoral thesis in the Station de Biologie Marine at S√®te, under the direction of Paul Mathias and Jean-George Baer; the thesis, on tetraphyllidean cestodes, was accepted on 16 June 1956.  Career  The Station de Biologie Marine in S√®te Louis Euzet was a junior lecturer at the Station de Biologie Marine in S√®te in 1947. He was appointed Professor in the recently created ‚ÄúColl√®ge Scientifique Universitaire‚Äù at Perpignan in 1959. He moved in 1969 to the University of Montpellier, where he established his Laboratoire de Parasitologie Compar√©e (Laboratory of Comparative Parasitology). He retired in 1991, became an Emeritus Professor in 1992 and pursued his scientific work at the Station de Biologie Marine in S√®te, where he was still active in 2012, aged 89. He occupied the same room in the Station de Biologie Marine at S√®te for more than 60 years.  Scientific work and influence  After a doctoral thesis on parasitic cestodes, Euzet progressively extended his expertise to monogeneans and a variety of fish parasites. He authored about 200 scientific publications between 1951 and 2012, described more than 60 new species of cestodes and more than 200 new species of monogeneans, and worked on the life-cycles and evolution of parasites. With his students, he also worked on monogeneans of freshwater fishes from several countries in Africa (Benin, Chad, C√¥te d'Ivoire). He also wrote seminal work on parasite specificity and the speciation of both monogeneans and cestodes. Louis Euzet created the concept of alloxenic speciation, i.e. the speciation of parasites linked with the behaviour and ecology of the host, and was one of the first to propose schemes of coevolution between monogeneans and elasmobranchs. His laboratory in Montpellier was a hub where many students and researchers visited, and his small laboratory in the Station de Biologie Marine at S√®te was still much frequented 10 years after his official retirement. Most of Louis Euzet's scientific work was devoted to the Mediterranean, but he also worked on parasites from almost all of the world's seas. He travelled and collected parasites in many countries, including Africa (Senegal, Benin, Cameroon, Mali, Madagascar, Morocco, Tunisia), the United States, Mexico, India, Indonesia, French Polynesia and New Caledonia. Louis Euzet created a school of parasitology named ‚Äúmontpelli√©ro-perpignanaise‚Äù (from both Montpellier and Perpignan, France) and his students are now researchers or university professors in many countries. He supervised more than twenty theses and co- supervised about fifty more. These studies concerned many and various aspects of the relationships between marine organisms and parasites, including systematics, ecology, life-cycles, life history, phylogeny, studies on vector molluscs, modelling and population dynamics. Among his students who continued a successful career in parasitology were Academician Claude Combes, Guy Oliver, Claude Maillard, Alain Lambert, Alain Pariselle and Jean-Lou Justine (France), Isaure de Buron (United States), Mohamed Hedi Ktari, Fadhila Mokhtar-Maamouri, Lamia Gargouri, Lobna Boudaya and Lassad Neifar (Tunisia), Nezha Noury-Sra√Øri (deceased) and Ouafae Berrada-Rkhami (Morocco), Fa√Øza Amine, Nadia Kechemir-Issad and Fadila Tazerouti (Algeria), and Branko M. Radujkoviƒá (Montenegro). In 2003, many of his former students and several researchers from all parts of the world happily contributed to a two-volume Festschrift in his honour entitled ‚ÄúTaxonomy, Ecology and Evolution of Metazoan Parasites‚Äù. Louis Euzet's huge collections of parasitic worms, consisting in more than 10,000 fully labelled, stained and mounted specimens of Monogenea and Cestoda on microscope slides prepared by himself, are deposited in the Mus√©um National d‚ÄôHistoire Naturelle in Paris.

Madero, president of Mexico 1911‚Äì1913, until his assassination in a counter- revolutionary coup by Victoriano Huerta. Arias is noted for her defense of Madero's tomb in Mexico City, despite the threat of the Huerta regime. Biography Born in Mexico City in 1884, Arias Bernal received her schoolteacher's diploma with honors in 1904. She began teaching and in 1910 became a school superintendent. Eulalia Guzm√°n, Dolores Sotomayor and Arias founded the Corregidor de Quer√©taro Vocational School with a curriculum of reading, writing, arithmetic, cooking, drawing and sewing designed to help women improve their economic circumstances. Arias served as deputy headmistress for a short period of time, but soon she joined the Madero movement. She participated in the educational literacy drive and became the private secretary of Sara P√©rez de Madero, wife of the president. Together with Elena Arizmendi Mejia, she promoted the work of the Neutral White Cross. When President Francisco I. Madero was captured, Arias and Eulalia Guzm√°n attempted a meeting with coup leader, Victoriano Huerta, to plea for the life of the president and his vice president. Following Madero assassination, she founded the Women's Loyalty Club (Club Femenil Lealtad) in order to provide support for the cause around Madero's tomb, hoping to overthrow the Mexican president Huerta. Every Sunday, she arranged demonstrations in La Piedad in the north of Mexico City around his tomb. Arias purchased a printing press to print flyers and she and Julia Nava de Ruis√°nchez distributed anti-Huerta manifestos throughout the city. In 1913, she was arrested after attacking Jorge Huerta, son of the president, who was caught vandalizing the grave of Madero. When General √Ålvaro Obreg√≥n arrived in Mexico City in 1914, he asked who had taken care of the tomb of the deceased president. Recognizing that it was Mar√≠a Arias, he took out his gun, raised it up and declared: \\"Those men who are able to take up arms but refused to do so for fear of abandoning their homes and their children, have no excuse. I abandoned my children without hesitation in order to serve the national cause. As evidence that I am able to admire the valour of others, I hand my pistol to se√±orita Arias, because she is the only one worthy of wielding it; this gun, which has served in defence of the popular interests is as good in her hands as it has been in mine.\\" As a result, the press called her \\"Mar√≠a Pistolas\\" (Mar√≠a Pistols). Mar√≠a Arias Bernal died in November 1923 in Mexico City when she was 39 years old. Movie Maria Arias Bernal's life was immortalized in film when Maria Pistolas, a Mexican film directed by Rene Cardona, was released in 1963 by Cinematografica Filmex S.A. and Estudios America. Arias Bernal was played by Dolores Camarillo. The movie was released in the United States in 1965.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0279949/ References Category:1884 births Category:1923 deaths Category:Mexican women's rights activists Category:Mexican revolutionaries Category:People of the Mexican Revolution Category:People from Mexico City Category:Mexican feminists Category:Mexican educators Category:20th-century Mexican educators ","title":"Mar√≠a Arias Bernal"},{"id":"45695972","text":"Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas Douglas Sutherland (1892 - 1946) was a decorated British Army officer of the First and Second world wars.

He received the Military Cross during the Battle of the Somme in 1916 for successfully retrieving the body of his commanding officer from no man's land and assuming command of his company. Sutherland was wounded during the Battle of Messines on 7 June 1917, but by August was in command of 'B' Company of his battalion. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order for his action on 22 August 1917 in the Battle of Passchendaele, successfully rallying a beleaguered company of men and effectively securing a position he had just taken. He was awarded a Bar to his DSO for gallantry and leadership during fighting on the Grand Honnelle River on 6 and 7 November 1918.Colonel F. G. Spring, Appendix II, The History of the 6th (Service) Battalion Lincolnshire Regiment 1914 - 1919 (Poacher Books, 2009), p.95-6.

The system is thought to be made up of a neutron star that has an accretion disk that draws material from its companion, a star less massive than the Sun. The disk is asymmetrical. The variability of the system is complex, with several periods identified: the two components orbit each other every 111 minutes, while there is another period of 112.6 minutes.

It is found from the south-western United States, through Mexico, El Salvador, Honduras, Costa Rica to Panama. The northernmost record is north-eastern Colorado. The length of the forewings is 50‚Äì58 mm. There are two maize-yellow bands on the forewings: a central band of nine spots from the apex to the basal third at the inner margin and a sub-marginal band of three to seven spots. There are several smaller maize-yellow spots near the costa at the end of the discal cell. There is a background-colored dark oval spot of variable size inside or at the anterior edge of the yellow central band spot, sometimes dividing the yellow spot into two. The marginal pale spots at the dips between the veins are small or almost absent. The hindwings have two maize-yellow bands extending from the forewings. There is a maroon-red to orange-red eyespot near the tornus with a blue crescent above. The center of the tail tip is yellow. Eggs are laid singly on young leaves and shoots of Zanthoxylum fagara, Ptelea trifoliata, Amyris texana and Casimiroa greggii, Ruta graveolens and Citrus species. The colour of the egg is pale yellow when laid, gradually changing to dull orange- brown. First instar larvae are 3‚Äì5 mm in length with a yellow-brown head capsule. The body pattern resembles bird-droppings. The second instar is 5‚Äì11 mm with a uniformly brownish head. Third instars are 11‚Äì16 mm, fourth 16‚Äì30 mm and fifth instar 30‚Äì50 mm. When a late instar larva is startled, it lifts its head and inflates the thorax, revealing the eyespots on the meta-thorax. If disturbed further, it everts red osmeterium from behind the head. Early instar larva tends to use osmeterium right away when disturbed, and osmeterium of the first instar is yellowish. Pupation takes place in a pupa of 26‚Äì36 mm in length. It is mottled pale to greyish and dark brown, resembling the surface of a tree or branch it is attached to. The darkness of a pupa is frequently determined by the color of the surface it rests on. Taxonomy The species was known for over a century as Papilio cresphontes and only recognized as a different species in 2014, primarily based on DNA evidence; it is named in honour of the wife of the first author of the study that described it.A new Heraclides swallowtail (Lepidoptera, Papilionidae) from North America is recognized by the pattern on its neck Gallery File:Giant swallowtail on california buckwheat.jpgadult on California buckwheat (Eriogonum fasciculatum) File:Papilio rumiko larva.jpgP. rumiko caterpillar on lemon leaf File:Heraclides rumiko vs Heraclides cresphontes - eggs and 1st instar (36241).jpgPapilio rumiko vs Papilio cresphontes eggs and 1st instar File:Heraclides rumiko vs Heraclides cresphontes - 2nd and 3rd instar (36242).jpgPapilio rumiko vs Papilio cresphontes 2nd and 3rd instar File:Heraclides rumiko vs Heraclides cresphontes-4th and 5th instar (36243).jpgPapilio rumiko vs Papilio cresphontes 4th and 5th instar File:Heraclides rumiko vs Heraclides cresphontes- 5th instar and prepupae (36244).jpgPapilio rumiko vs Papilio cresphontes 5th instar and prepupae File:Heraclides rumiko vs Heraclides cresphontes- pupae (36245).jpgPapilio rumiko vs Papilio cresphontes pupae References rumiko Category:Butterflies described in 2014 ","title":"Papilio rumiko"},{"id":"45696190","text":"Rainey-Skarland Cabin, also known as Rainey's Cabin, Skarland's Cabin and Ivar's Cabin, is a historic log cabin on the campus of the University of Alaska Fairbanks in College, Alaska. A single-story three-room log structure with massive stone fireplace on one gable end, it is used today as extended lodging for a permanent or visiting anthropology faculty member or student. History The cabin was built in 1936 on a ridge overlooking the school for Froelich Rainey, the first professor of the university's Anthropology Department. During his tenure the cabin played a significant role as a social center of the university, hosting a number of pioneering archaeologists and anthropologists, including J. Louis Giddings and Frederica de Laguna. When Rainey left in 1942 the university bought the cabin to use as faculty housing. Beginning in the late 1940s it was occupied by a successor as department chairman, former student Ivar Skarland, who continued Rainey's social practices. Upon Skarland's sudden death in 1965, university students requested that the cabin, ski trails, and a residence hall be named in his memory, resulting in the Rainey-Skarland Cabin. Today, a permanent or visiting anthropology faculty member or student lives there. The building was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. A major 1982 renovation was highlighted by roof replacement, insulation, and installation of an alarm system.

They were both returned safely after a ransom of ZAR 140,000 (South African Rand) was paid to the kidnappers. The kidnapper's house was quickly identified by police, and four suspects were arrested, with most of the ransom money been retrieved.  Kidnapping  On the morning of 30 March 1966, Etty Glazer dropped her two daughters, Michelle (7) and Ella (5) at the Sandown Public School. On her way back about a half mile from home, she came across three men with apparent car trouble. When she stopped alongside them, one man grabbed her, while another attempted to open the passenger side door. After a brief struggle in which Mrs Glazer's lip was cut, both men entered the vehicle. When asked \\"What do you want of me?\\" \\"We are political refugees. We need your car, we need you too.\\" Mrs Glazer was manually blindfolded for the short journey to the kidnappers' house, and only once the vehicle was closed inside the garage was she allowed to see. She and son Sammy were then taken into the house, in which they were held for the rest of the time. The kidnappers then ordered her to contact Bernard, \\"we want ¬£70,000 (South African pound)\\". As Mr Glazer was on a business trip to Swaziland, Etty contacted her mother first, and then Mr Glazer's secretary, Mr Davis. She explained that the kidnappers wanted R140,000 for her release. Mr Davis promptly set off to contact Mr Glazer en route to Swaziland. Once contacted, Mr Glazer returned home, where Etty's mother was waiting for him. That evening he spoke to his wife, after which one of the kidnappers told him; \\"Mr Glazer, we want ¬£70,000 for your son's and wife's release. If you want your wife and child alive you must pay ¬£70,000 - and Mr Glazer, no tricks, no marked money and no police if you want your wife and child alive.\\"  Ransom drop  Mr Glazer contacted his bank manager from the Pretoria bank and arranged to withdraw the cash after hours. He arrived at the bank around 23:00, where he withdrew the R140,000 he needed. However the manager made a list of some of the banknotes' serial numbers. Later that night Mr Glazer received a phone call with instructions on the ransom money drop, where he was told to park at bus stop 50 on Corlett Drive, and wait by the public telephone booth for additional instructions. He was then told to leave the money in the unlocked vehicle and \\"go for a walk down the street.\\" When he later returned to his vehicle, the money had been taken. At 2AM, he received a call where the kidnappers informed him that Etty and Sammy would be \\"home in half an hour.\\" The kidnappers then took Etty and Sammy for a drive in her own vehicle, and at some distance from where they had been held, the kidnappers exited the vehicle and left. Mrs Glazer then drove herself home.  Police investigation  Because of the mysterious circumstances of the large cash withdrawal, the bank manager contacted the police. The head of the Security Police, Brigadier Hendrick van den Bergh, arrived at the Glazer home, just as Mr Glazer returned from the money drop. Mr Glazer insisted that the police do not act until his wife and child were safe. The following day, Sergeant Jannie Nel from the South African Crime Bureau was taken to speak to Mrs Glazer. He was tasked to extract a floor plan of the house in which she had been kept. When he first met Mrs Glazer, she was still shaken, unable to respond properly, and almost a total wreck. Sergeant Nel was able to coax useful information from her, and eventually got her to draw a rough outline of the house, which was later described as \\"little more than an elaborate squiggle\\". Days later the squiggle was redrawn as a detailed floor plan. The police had three more critical pieces of information that assisted in narrowing the search. *At Mrs Glazer's request, a telegram was sent to Israel; it was later backtraced to the Bramley post office. *The kidnappers bought a dummy and baby food from a Bramley pharmacy. *Mrs Glazer estimated the house to be about two miles away from the scene of the abduction. The floor plan was duplicated and given to 500 select policemen from Pretoria, with instruction to pose as telephone personnel and inspect the 6,000 houses with in the search area.  Capture and trial  On the first day a matching house was identified. The owner, Mr Leonard Landou Levy was positively identified by Mrs Glazer as one of the kidnappers. Leonard denied his involvement, but did admit that his brother, Ephraim, and friend, Stanley Ivan Jawitz, asked to lend them his house for seven days. On the 29 March he eventually agreed to lend the two men his house for which he would be paid R10,000. Later Leonard took police to a safe deposit box, where R6,990 of the ransom money was recovered. The police also arrested his Brother Ephraim Levy in Cape Town and R58,500 more was recovered. Kenneth Levy, the third brother was also arrested, as he was also implicated in the kidnapping. While being questioned by police in an apartment block in Berea, Johannesburg, Stanley Jawitz committed suicide by jumping from the top. The next day, 13 April, police recovered a further R60,000 in a safe deposit box in Stanley Jawitz name. On 1 June 1966, the trial of Ephraim, Leonard, and Kenneth Levy began at the Rand Supreme Court in front of Justice Hiemstra. They were each charged with kidnapping and child stealing. Each pleaded not guilty, but Ephraim changed his plea to guilty on the second day of trial. On 10 June, Justice Hiemstra convicted all three brothers on the charge of kidnapping and sentenced each to imprisonment: Ephraim, 16 years; Kenneth, 6 years; and Leonard, 5 years. Kenneth Levy maintained his innocence, despite the fact that he drove the car that was used in the abduction. He claimed that he was not involved: \\"I was recovering from a motor-car accident at the time, I had sustained serious head injuries and had suffered brain haemorrhage...I did not even know my own name...how on earth could I have known that I was being drawn into a kidnapping?\\" Justice Hiemstra was convinced of Kenneth Levy's guilt: \\"You [Kenneth] were an active participant to a greater extent than your brother Leonard. You were on the scene of the kidnapping and knew what was going on. You saw fit to deny that you knew anything about it and by so doing forfeited much of the compassion one could have had for you in your present predicament.\\" Bernard Glazer instituted a civil case against Kenneth Levy, and in June 1967, the Rand Supreme Court ordered Kenneth to pay Glazer R2,500. Ephraim and Leonard Levy were exonerated from liability. Historical context The ransom of R140,000 which was paid was four times as much as the US$50,000 paid in the famous Lindbergh kidnapping, which at the time was the highest ransom demand in the world. John Vorster, the Minister of Justice, issued a special statement: \\"The full story of the investigation reads like a work of fiction. If there is a detective force in the world that can do better, I should like to hear of it.\\"  References  Category:Kidnapped South African children Category:1966 in South Africa Category:Kidnappings in South Africa Category:Kidnapped South African people ","title":"Etty Glazer"},{"id":"45696389","text":"Epicephala tertiaria is a moth of the family Gracillariidae first described by Hou-Hun Li in 2015.

This 1-1/2 story Cape style house was built in 1829 by Samuel Holden (1772-1858), the first white settler of the region, and is the oldest known house standing on the \\"Canada Road\\", built around that time to join central Maine to Quebec. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995. Description and history The Holden House stands on the east side of United States Route 201 in the rural center of the town of Moose River. It is set on the fringe of the Moose River Golf Club, a nine-hole golf course set on lands formerly belonging to the Holden family. The house is a 1-1/2 story wood frame Cape style house, set facing south on a stone foundation and clad in weatherboard siding. The main facade is five bays wide, with a center entrance framed by pilasters and topped by a transom window. A single small gable-roof dormer pierces the roof above the entrance. Southeast of the house stands a gable-roofed barn that appears to date to the late 19th century. The house has undergone a significant number of alterations since its construction. In the early 20th century (and possibly earlier) it was used as a boarding house for travelers on the road, for which purposes ells were added to the east side of the house. Although these were present when the house was surveyed for listing on the National Register of Historic Places, they have since been removed. The house was listed by Maine Preservation as an endangered property in 1998, and in 2008 a preservation plan was developed. The house has since undergone a careful restoration to its early-19th-century appearance. Built in 1829, the house was the third home built by Samuel Holden, a Massachusetts native who was the first white settler of the area, arriving in 1820 with a family of nine children. Tradition has it that Holden built his first log cabin in 1819, at a location north of this house, moving the family to the area the following year. His first cabin was destroyed by fire in 1820, and was rapidly replaced by another, built at this location. That cabin was replaced by the present frame house in 1829, and is fashioned from mill-sawn lumber. Holden's house was a major focal point of the community in its early years, serving as a site for school classes prior to the construction of the community's first schoolhouse, and as its first post office. The house was owned by Holden descendants until 1872, and underwent a succession of owners until it was acquired by the town in 1993.

Events and festivals The music festival Nerdapalooza (2007‚Äì13) described itself as \\"the first of its kind to invite all genres of the nerd music movement under one roof, including nerd rock, nerdcore hip hop, chiptunes, and video game music.\\" Other conventions and events have since hosted nerd music acts of a range of styles.

Synopsis  Tabataba tells the story of a small Malagasy village during the independence uprising which took place in 1947 in the south of the country. For several months, part of the Malagasy population revolted against the French colonial army in a bloody struggle. The repression in villages that followed was terrible, leading to fires, arrests and torture. Women, children and the elderly were the indirect victims of the conflict and suffered particularly from famine and illness. One leader of the MDRM, the party campaigning for independence, arrives in a village. Solo (Fran√ßois Botozandry), the main character, is still too young to fight but he sees his brother and most of the men in his clan join up. His grandmother, Bakanga (Soavelo), knows what will happen, but Solo still hopes his elder brother will return a hero. After months of rumours, he sees instead the French army arrive to crush the rebellion.

Built in 1765 on Court Street, it is one of the oldest houses in Castine, and a well-preserved example of Georgian architecture; it was moved to its present location in 1968-69 and restored. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1969. It is open for tours on a limited basis during July and August. Description and history The Perkins House stands on the south side of Perkins Street, between the street and the Bagaduce River. It faces west, toward the main Wilson Museum building. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, five bays wide, with a central chimney. A 1-1/2 story ell extends to the rear of house; it also has a gable roof and a chimney. Its timbers are hand-hewn and joined by mortise and tenons, the lath used in the walls is made of split wood. The front entry is framed by sidelight windows and pilasters, and topped by an entablature and gabled pediment. The house has a construction history dating to 1763 when John Perkins, a native of York, Maine, moved here with his bride. The house Perkins built was located on what is now Court Street, and initially consisted of a single-story structure corresponding to the rear ell of the house. The present two-story main block was built sometime thereafter. The original ell was replaced about 1783 by a two-story structure. By the mid-20th century the building had deteriorated in condition, and had been condemned as a fire hazard. It was rescued by the Wilson Museum, carefully disassembled, and reassembled on the present site. The 1783 ell was too badly rotted to save, and was replaced by the present reconstruction of the original single-story ell. The main downstairs rooms of the house have been restored to their appearance circa 1783. The house is the only known house in Castine to predate the American Revolutionary War. The house was occupied by British troops in 1779, and survived bombardment by American forces of the Penobscot Expedition, the disastrous attempt to dislodge the British. It was again occupied by British troops during the War of 1812.

Gordon (14 July 1861‚Äì 24 August 1932) was an American suffragist, civic leader, and one of the leading advocates of women's voting rights in the Southern United States. Gordon was the organizer of the Southern States Woman Suffrage Conference and directed the 1918 campaign for woman suffrage in the state of Louisiana, the first such statewide effort in the American South. Early years Kate M. Gordon was born July 14, 1861, in New Orleans, Louisiana, the daughter of George Hume Gordon, a Scottish-born schoolmaster, and Margaret (Galiece) Gordon. She had two sisters, Jean and Fanny, as well as two brothers, George M. and W. A. Gordon. Kate's mother was herself an early advocate of women's right to vote, having attended a women's rights meeting in New York as early as 1853.B.H. Gilley, \\"Kate Gordon and Louisiana Woman Suffrage,\\" Louisiana History, vol. 24, no. 3 (Summer 1983), pg. 290. Her father was similarly committed to the principle of equal rights between women and men. Career Gordon initially became involved in the women's rights movement in 1896 when she heard a lecture by Colorado suffragist Mary C. C. Bradford at a local Unitarian meeting. Soon after Gordon joined the pioneer New Orleans women's rights organization, the Portia Club, organized in 1892, and joined with her sister Jean and other local women in establishing the Era (Equal Rights Association) Club that same year. The two New Orleans-based organizations would subsequently merge to form the Louisiana State Suffrage Association, which Gordon headed from 1904 until 1913.Gilley, \\"Kate Gordon and Louisiana Woman Suffrage,\\" pg. 291. Gordon's first public organizing effort came in 1899, when she turned out women entitled vote by virtue of being property taxpayers in a special bond election to finance improvements in New Orleans' sewage and drainage system ‚Äî a particularly critical concern in the city, much of which lay below sea level. Through the Era Club, a Women's Sewerage and Drainage League was established, with Gordon taking her place at the head of this electoral association. In large measure through Gordon's efforts, the bond measure was passed over conservative opposition. In 1900, she addressed the annual convention of the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA), where she met new president of the organization Carrie Chapman Catt. Catt was impressed with Gordon and when a vacancy occurred as the organization's national corresponding secretary in 1901, Gordon was tapped to fill the position. She would continue to serve in that role until 1909.A. Elizabeth Taylor, \\"Kate M. Gordon,\\" in John D. Buenker and Edward R. Kantowicz (eds.), Historical Dictionary of the Progressive Era, 1890‚Äì1920. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1988; pg. 181. After leaving NAWSA in 1909, Gordon returned to her native New Orleans, where she became engaged in establishing the first hospital in the state of Louisiana for the treatment of victims of tuberculosis.\\"Kate Gordon Dead: Pioneer Suffragist,\\" New York Times, August 25, 1932, pg. 19. Gordon worked tirelessly raising funds for Camp Hygiea, located near Covington, Louisiana, and for the Louisiana Anti-Tuberculosis Hospital in New Orleans. She also served as Secretary of the Louisiana Anti- Tuberculosis Society and as Vice President of the New Orleans Anti- Tuberculosis League. She attended and made a presentation at the Kentucky Equal Rights Association's annual meeting in Louisville in 1911. In 1913, Gordon had returned full-time to activity on the issue of women's suffrage. By this time Gordon had shifted her thinking from top-down national voting rights change ‚Äî proposed constitutional amendments having been introduced unsuccessfully in every Congressional session since that of 1868 ‚Äî to a state and regional perspective. In November 1913 she was a key organizer of the Southern States Woman Suffrage Conference, of which she would serve as president until its termination in 1917. She was also editor of the group's official organ, the New Southern Citizen. Although an outspoken advocate of women's right to vote, Gordon did not believe that this right should be created by constitutional amendment, instead favoring the establishment of voting rights on a state by state basis. When the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution was submitted in June 1919, Gordon ‚Äî somewhat astonishingly ‚Äî stood in opposition to ratification of the proposal. Such a dissonant states' rights perspectiveKenneth R. Johnson, \\"Kate Gordon and the Woman Suffrage Movement in the South,\\" Journal of Southern History, vol. 38, no. 3 (Aug. 1972), pg. 367. generated controversy. During her life Gordon also drew criticism from many of her peers for expressing barely concealed racist views.Marjorie Spruill Wheeler (ed.), Votes for Women!: The Woman Suffrage Movement in Tennessee, the South, and the Nation. Knoxville, TN: University of Tennessee Press, 1995; pg. 51, fn. 56. Gordon assisted in establishing the New Orleans Anti-Tuberculosis Hospital in 1926, serving as the latter's vice president. She also was superintendent of the Milen Home for Feeble-minded Girls from February 1931 until the time of her death. Death and legacy Gordon died August 24, 1932, in New Orleans from a cerebral hemorrhage and was buried in the Metairie Cemetery in New Orleans. She was 71 years old at the time of her death.

She wrote the second book-length history of the University of Michigan and the one that was most frequently cited thereafter, History of The University of Michigan, in 1885.Ann Arbor : Register Publishing House, 1885 Prior to that she served as Assistant Librarian at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan, from 1878 until 1884 at a time when that position and the University Librarian were the only full-time positions in the Library and both were listed among the ‚Äúfaculty‚Äù positions in the University's General Register. In a seemingly surprising career change, she left the Library after being accepted to the University's Medical School from which she received an M.D. degree in 1887. After a year's residency training at the Woman's Hospital in Detroit she spent the rest of her life in private medical practice in Port Huron, Michigan, where she died in 1900.  Early life  Farrand was born in Ann Arbor, Michigan, on March 31, 1852, the daughter of Lucius S. and Frances Shaw Farrand, members of a pioneering Michigan family. Her grandfather, Bethuel Farrand moved from New York State to Detroit in 1825 and from there to Ann Arbor in the same year. At the time of his arrival there were 26 families in the city. After being involved in various businesses, including the Water Works of the City of Detroit he became the first probate judge of Washtenaw County, Michigan, of which Ann Arbor is the county seat and he served as a leader in a variety of local religious and social organizations.Michigan Historical Collections. Lansing [etc.]: 1876, VI, 1883, 443-446 contains Bethuel Farrand's story of these years Elizabeth Farrand attended the public schools in Ann Arbor, graduating from the Ann Arbor High School. Her father died in October 1851 at the age of 38 just before she was born. In the 1870 census she and her mother and sister lived together in the family home along with three college student boarders.Year: 1870; Census Place: Ann Arbor Ward 4, Washtenaw, Michigan; Roll: M593_707; Page: 83B; Image: 171; Family History Library Film: 552206 In that year the 18-year-old Elizabeth was ‚Äúteaching school‚Äù according to the census. Her sister, Frances M., died in 1871 and her mother died in 1875. By the 1880 census she was single and without immediate family, living as a boarder herself in another Ann Arbor home.Year: 1880; Census Place: Ann Arbor, Washtenaw, Michigan; Roll: 608; Family History Film: 1254608; Page: 32C; Enumeration District: 223; Image: 0369. Her name is incorrectly listed here as Martha E., but her age and occupation are correct. Her uncle, David Osborne Farrand (1837-1883) had, meanwhile, become one of the best known doctors in the area, working as a partner in a medical practice in Detroit with Zina Pitcher, one of the Regents of the University of Michigan who played a founding role in the University of Michigan Medical School. Known locally as D. O., David Farrand was born in 1837 and had graduated from the Literary College at the University of Michigan in 1857. After studying in Germany and working in the Detroit wholesale drug business of his brother, Jacob, he graduated from the New York College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1862 and entered the Union army as an assistant surgeon. In 1866 he returned to Detroit to begin his local medical practice with Pitcher who himself died in 1871. He was involved in many activities in Detroit, including serving as president of the early Board of Health, as surgeon for the Detroit Police Department, and as Surgeon in Chief of the Michigan Central Railroad. When D. O. Farrand died in 1883 University of Michigan President James B. Angell presided over his Ann Arbor funeral.Michigan Historical Collections. Lansing [etc.]: 1876, VII, 1886, 602-611. D. O. Farrand's brother Jacob Farrand (1815-1891) became a substantial businessman in Detroit and served as President of the Board of the Harper Hospital there from 1860 until his death in 1891. The Farrand School for Nurses training at Harper was named after D. O. Farrand.Woodford, Frank B, and Philip P Mason. Harper of Detroit: the Origin And Growth of a Great Metropolitan Hospital. Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1964, 303 give brief biographies of the brothers (who were actually half brothers). Their brother Bethuel (1820-1901), known as B. C., became a well known lawyer in Port Huron, Michigan.  Work at the university library  The University of Michigan had relocated from Detroit to Ann Arbor in 1837, opening to its first students in September 1841. Even before classes began there the Board of Regents began preparing for the University Library, appointing a librarian, the Rev. Henry Colclazer, at their first meeting in 1837 and buying the books and collections that would undergird the teaching. Colclazer would not arrive on campus, however, until 1841 although a home for the books was provided on the third floor in the ‚Äúmain‚Äù campus building opened in 1840 and named Mason Hall in 1843. The Library contained about 4,000 volumes there. Colclazer served as Librarian until 1845, after which the title rotated among members of the faculty for 11 years. The next person to hold the title was John L. Tappan, son of then University President Henry P. Tappan, who was given the post in 1856. When President Tappan was removed from office by the Regents in 1863 they also removed his son as Librarian. He was replaced by former faculty member Andrew Ten Brook, who served from 1864 through 1877 when he resigned. Raymond Cazallis Davis replaced him and served from 1877 until 1905. Over these years the Library expanded in Mason Hall, moved to the newly built Haven Hall in 1863 and moved into its own purpose built building in 1883. By 1890 there were 75,000 volumes there.For a useful summary of this history, see Shaw, Wilfred Byron. The University of Michigan, an Encyclopedic Survey .... Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1942. Vol. 4, p 1369-1373 http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015020573609?urlappend=%3Bseq=25 retrieved from Hathitrust on April 11, 2015. Farrand began working part-time as an hourly assistant at the Library under Andrew Ten Brook in the academic year 1870/71 for $.15 per hour. One historian of the Library's early years, John Cushman Abbott, has written that, in hiring Farrand and another woman at this time Ten Brook was ‚Äúa pioneer in a difficult field.‚Äù In his report to the Regents for the 1870-71 academic year Ten Brook wrote that ‚Äútwo young ladies have also been employed for a portion of the time...to aid in completing and revising the catalog. The experiment in the case of these ladies‚Äî viz: Miss Mary Pepper and Miss Lizzie Farrand‚Äî is decisive in favor of the policy of employing female assistance for some kinds of labor. There are indeed some services for which they cannot be called upon‚Äî for instance, taking down and replacing books belonging upon the higher shelves, ‚Äî yet in industry and fidelity, and in quickness and accuracy of perception and execution, they are quite in advance of the average young men who could be obtained, and in consequence of there being fewer remunerative place /sic/ open to females they are ready to do faithful service at a pay much lower.‚ÄùAbbott, John Cushman. Raymond Cazallis Davis and the University of Michigan General Library, 1877-1905. 1957, p 54. The task of cataloging was important and difficult in these years because at that time there was no accepted system for doing so. Melville Dewey's decimal classification system was not published until 1876 and not adopted at the University of Michigan Library until 1897. In the meantime the Library used a so-called ‚Äúfixed‚Äù location system, introduced by Ten Brook, organizing shelves and the catalog according to the principle that each book should have a specific fixed place. According to Abbott this meant that books were arranged by topic and more or less in chronological order within topic. Each time a new book was received, though, the entire section's locations and catalog information had to be redone. So it was little surprise that the job of cataloger became important.Abbott, John Cushman. Raymond Cazallis Davis and the University of Michigan General Library, 1877-1905. 1957, pp. ii, 196-213. With the encouragement of Davis the Regents appointed Farrand full-time Assistant Librarian, a position normally held by a man and previously held by Davis himself, at an annual salary of $400 in January 1878.Proceedings of the Board of Regents. Ann Arbor: The University, 1863. 1878-1880, p. 182. By June 1878 she was included on the list of \\"revised\\" salaries set by the Board at $500 per year.Proceedings of the Board of Regents. Ann Arbor: The University, 1863. 1878-1880, p. 268-269. In November 1883 her salary was raised to $600 per year.Proceedings of the Board of Regents. Ann Arbor: The University, 1863. 1881-1885, p. 417. Writing university history It may seem somewhat ironic that each of the first three histories of the University of Michigan was written by authors connected to the University Library: Andrew Ten Brook, who had been University Librarian, C. K. Adams, who had been chair of the faculty Library Committee, and Farrand. But at a time when library materials did not circulate often, this connection made sense. All the primary and secondary sources for such histories were located in the Library. The first book-length history of the University of Michigan was American state universities, their origin and progress; a history of congressional university land-grants, a particular account of the rise and development of the University of Michigan, and hints toward the future of the American university system written by Andrew Ten Brook (1814-1899) and published in 1875.Ten Brook, Andrew. American State Universities, Their Origin And Progress: a History of Congressional University Land-grants. Cincinnati: R. Clarke & co., 1875. Because the lengthy title of this book was frequently shortened to \\"American State Universities, their Origin and Progress; a History of Congressional University Land-Grants,\\" only the most thorough realized that the book also contained a history of the University. A second brief history of the University, Historical Sketch of the University of Michigan. 1876, by C. K. Adams was, in fact, just that, a 57-page pamphlet sketching its history invited by the U.S. Commissioner of Education as part of broader effort of the Department of the Interior to celebrate the nation's centennial in 1876.Adams, Charles Kendall. Historical Sketch of the University of Michigan. Ann Arbor, Mich.: University of Michigan, 1876. Ten Brook spent more pages than Adams‚Äô entire account on the period before the establishment of the University and on speculations about the future of higher education (210 pages on these topics). Adams‚Äô portrayal of the interior development of the University‚Äîschools, curricula, buildings, scientific teaching and apparatus‚Äîis better developed than Ten Brook's even though the sketch is substantially shorter. In part these differences in emphases occurred because their times at the University were different. Ten Brook had been the pastor of the Baptist church in Detroit when he came to the University as Professor of Philosophy in 1844. He resigned that position in 1851 during a controversy over secret fraternal societies on campus. He returned to the University as Librarian in 1866 and then resigned that position in 1877. Adams had graduated from the University of Michigan in 1861 and remained there teaching history until 1885. He generously acknowledged the influence of Ten Brook's work on the first page of his own. He served as faculty chair of the University Library Committee for many years. Farrand's History of the University of Michigan was the first, therefore, written by someone who was neither a former student nor a former faculty member and the first written primarily from documents about University history, including newspapers and diaries. In part this was from necessity, of course. She had not been born when Ten Brook joined the faculty and would have been only nine years old when Adams did so. So while the first two authors had been participants in the history about which they wrote her perspective was necessarily more distant. But her self- consciousness about sources was evident from her first pages, where she wrote, unlike the other two, that ‚Äúthe attempt has been made to collect from many documents into one volume the story of the University,‚Äù and laments the relative paucity of sources for the story.Farrand, Elizabeth Martha. History of the University of Michigan.. Ann Arbor: Register Publishing House, 1885. p iii The three volumes differ as well in tone and coverage. Ten Brook's is by far the most ponderous and its general topic requires long stretches of reading to pick up the history of the University itself. Adams‚Äô is crisp and balanced if somewhat boosterish on the University itself. Farrand's is the warmest, expressing the hope that ‚Äúit will also excite a disposition for tale telling among the whole body of the alumni‚Ä¶‚Äù Perhaps reflecting the fact that his first departure from the University was, to some extent, welcomed if not required by the Regents, Ten Brook's account is the most critical of the Regents (who would force him out of the Librarian position just one year after his account was published). Differences can be seen in their accounts of one of the most famous episodes in the University's early history, the hiring and firing of the visionary, if somewhat imperious, first president, Henry P. Tappan. All historians of the University have seen the hiring of Tappan in 1852 as a bold and fortunate stroke by the Regents and his firing without notice by another board in 1863 as unfortunate and badly handled at least. Ten Brook, who was not on campus at the same time as Tappan spends the least amount of time on this period; Adams, who was both student and faculty member under Tappan writes admiringly of his accomplishments, but emphasizes the smooth transition to his successor, Erastus Haven as a tribute to the continuing strength of the University. Farrand offers the most detailed and balanced account of this period, albeit from the standpoint that his accomplishments were many and his departure unfortunate. Ten Brooks is the most dubious about the admission of women, Adams the briefest, Farrand the most thorough, concluding that for the female students ‚Äúit was unpleasant to be looked upon as eccentric, but that was a trifling matter when compared with the satisfaction arising from each day‚Äôs achievement.‚ÄùFarrand, History, 203 Farrand's account also has the most to say about the extracurricular activities of students in the period, again, because it is based in reading of the various student publications. The strengths of her work in documentary evidence at times become a weakness, as does her organization of her account by Presidential administration. As has been typical of all other accounts of the University's history there is no overarching interpretive theme to her account and topics appear to be longer or shorter depending on their documentation. Long quotations from documents can be extremely valuable today, but her account contains many of these which make for less smooth reading. But, on balance, hers is the most comprehensive and balanced account of the three. Only one review of her book was published in its own time (a not untypical number at a time when outlets for book reviews were few) and that declared the book provided \\"circumstantial fidelity.\\"\\"Review 2 -- no Title.\\" 1885.The Literary World; a Monthly Review of Current Literature (1870-1904), Apr 04, 114. Although a very rough proxy for influence, Google Scholar in 2015 reports 20 citations to her work (more than to either Ten Brook or Adams) in works that are themselves cited 884 times.Retrieved from Google Scholar, April 21, 2015. Entering medical school In her history of the university Farrand ironically declared there that was one ‚Äúserious evil‚Äù awaiting remedy in the University of Michigan Medical School: ‚Äúits requirements for admission are very low. A slight examination is required, and trifling as it is, it excludes each year a few applicants.‚ÄùFarrand, History, 232. But it was possible she wrote from experience because as she was finishing her book in 1884 the Regents approved her request to move to part-time status during the 1885/85 academic year so she could attend the University's medical school.Proceedings of the Board of Regents. Ann Arbor: The University, 1863. 1881-1886, 482. There is no firm evidence of why she made this decision but its timing might have been related to the death of her uncle, D. O. in 1883. The out-pouring of grief and tributes to him at his Ann Arbor funeral was striking. If one had any interest in medical practice at all his life demonstrated the impact it could have. When Farrand joined the medical school as a student in it had no academic prerequisite requirement except a high school diploma but the medical degree program took two years, longer than at many other medical schools at the time. Courses, including anatomy, were taught with both sexes in the same room and repeated the same material in the first and second years. By the late 1870s there had been more female graduates of the Medical School than any other School or College at the University and in the class of 1887 in which Farrand graduated, there were 81 who received their degrees, 16 of them women.General Catalogue of Officers And Students, 1837-1911. Ann Arbor, Mich.: The University, 1912., 335-336. The 1880s would be a high point for female medical students until the 1980s, according to historian Ruth Bordin.Bordin, Ruth Birgitta Anderson. Women At Michigan: the \\"dangerous Experiment,\\" 1870s to the Present. Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1999. Farrand's near classmate, Bertha Van Hoosen, who graduated in 1888, noted in her autobiography, ‚ÄúPetticoat Surgeon‚Äù that resistance to women in the medical school was minimal and the derogatory term ‚Äúhen medics‚Äù was normally used to refer to the female medical students only by those outside the medical school. But she also quoted the lectures of the famous and beloved Medical School Professor Corydon Ford as containing statements like ‚ÄúInguinal region, gentlemen, inguinal region,‚Äù as if the women were not in the room.Van Hoosen, Bertha. Petticoat Surgeon ... Chicago: Pellegrini & Cudahy, 1947. Both Farrand and Van Hoosen took traineeships at the Detroit Woman's hospital after their graduation from medical school. Van Hoosen may have replaced Farrand at the end of hers. These positions offered primarily training in obstetrics and gynecology according to Van Hoosen, because the Detroit Women's hospital dealt only with ‚Äúdelinquent‚Äù girls who had become pregnant without husbands.Van Hoosen, Surgeon, 78. Upon completion of that training Farrand moved to Port Huron to open a private medical practice. Her uncle, B. C., practiced law in the same city. In the 1890 Port Huron City Directory she is listed as practicing and living at 624 Court Street in Port Huron.Port Huron City & Fort Gratiot Directory, Sherman, 1890 Death When the census taker arrived at the home of attorney Bethuel C. Farrand in Port Huron in June 1900 the residents included him, his wife, and his niece, Elizabeth M., a doctor, along with one servant and one nurse. Elizabeth Farrand was dying that summer and had moved in with her uncle.Year: 1900; Census Place: Port Huron Ward 2, Saint Clair, Michigan; Roll: 741; Page: 5A; Enumeration District: 0095; FHL microfilm: 1240741. She had been diagnosed with breast cancer in 1898, treated for it twice during lengthy stays at Harper Hospital, and would die of it just two months later on August 17, 1900. She is buried in the Farrand family plot in Forest Hill Cemetery, Ann Arbor, Michigan. Honors and Impact When she died, two male Port Huron doctors wrote a tribute to her declaring that she was a ‚Äútruly noble woman,‚Äù who numbered among her friends ‚Äúpractically everyone in Port Huron who had the honor and privilege of her acquaintance.‚Äù They noted that she had been president of the Northeastern District Medical Society, the Ladies Library Annex, and the Academy of Science. Her obituaries in the Ann Arbor newspaper were headlined ‚ÄúRespected By Everyone,‚Äù and noted as well that her history of the University of Michigan had received much commendation for its accuracy.‚Äù Alumni Necrology Files. , 1841. Farrand, Elizabeth Martha Aug. 17, 1900 M.D. 1887 Box 205 Bentley Historical Library, University of Michigan contains her obituaries and tributes. In fact she had been a kind of ‚Äútriple‚Äù pioneer. It was remarkable that she became the first female to be appointed by the Board of Regents to the Assistant Librarian positions only eight years after the first women were admitted to the University. At that time she would have been one of the highest ranking women on the campus. And she was the only woman to hold that position in the nineteenth century. She joined the socially pioneering women who came to the University of Michigan Medical School in its first fifteen years of co- education. And she was the first and ‚Äì to date‚Äîonly woman to write a general history of the University of Michigan.

Slabynko was murdered in his home by two unidentified assailants on a contract killing. Slabynko was one of over 562 contract murders that happened over the course of three years.  Personal  Oleg Slabynko was born in 1962 in St. Petersburg, Russia. Slabynko was interested in journalism all of his life and by the age of 24 was already in a position of importance in his chosen profession. He was divorced and lived together with his parents and elder daughter in an apartment in Moscow.  Career  By the time he was 33, Slabynko became the producer of multiple TV programs on Russian Television Channel 2, including Forgotten Names and the Moment Istiny (Moment of Truth). Slabynko came to work for Channel 2 at the time Boris Yeltsin was in political control of the Channel and wanted it used for his political goals. His appointed head of Russian television, Chairman Vyacheslav Bragin, who wanted to clean up broadcasting from corruption. To pursue this goal, Bragin hired two young associates to replace an experienced executive. This was why Bragin hired the 30-year-old Slabynko as chairman of the Ostankino television station without Slabynko having any previous experience in television. Slabynko had only worked for Bragin for two months as his press secretary but he had earned the trust of his boss. Three years later, Slabynko was the producer of two news programs, Moment Istiny or the Moment of Truth and Forgotten Names on Russian Television Channel 2. The Moment of Truth program allowed for Russian civilians to ask questions of prominent public figures. He was also a general manager of Time Moves Forward, an advertising agency. He employed strong, hard-hitting journalists to give the Moscow public the news. He was a main contributor for the freedom of speech movement in Russia.  Death  A map of the Moscow Oblast region where Slabynko was assassinated.Oleg Slabynko was shot dead by two unidentified individuals in his own apartment in Moscow on 25 January 1996 at 10:30pm. The apartment was located on Klinskaya Ulitsa. Before Slablynko was attacked at his front door, his assassins called his apartment to make sure he was there. The gunmen approached his apartment and shot Slabynko four times at close range with a 9mm gun, according to Moscow Police. Slabynko was known to air hard hitting, abrasive news and Moscow in the 1990s was not the safest place for journalists. An unidentified group was contracted to kill leaders and people of influence in Moscow. Over a twenty-year period, 562 Russian officials were murdered.  Context  During the years 1992‚Äì2012, 562 journalists were murdered in Russia. Russia does not have the right to freedom of press like the United States. According to Freedom of the press in Russia, the right is in Russia's constitution but the government has implemented many laws to force the press to censor themselves when it comes to controversial issues. Many journalists in Russia were at risk, due to the many groups disagreeing with the issues they were reporting. Anna Politkovskaya was one of these journalists that was murdered in 2006. She attacked the Russian government and Vladimir Putin of not protecting or thoroughly investigating the murders of 562 journalists. A vast majority of these murders, Slabynko and Politkovskaya's included, have gone cold, unsolved for the past 23 years.  Impact  Oleg Slabynko's murder called light to the contract murders of Russian journalists. Many prominent business owners and public figures were murdered in 1996 alone. Slabynko's death rose awareness of the eminent danger that public figures were in all across Russia. Russians were reminded by Slabynko's murder of a previous murder of Vladislav Listyev, a famous talk- show host and State Television executive, who was also shot to death at his home in March 1995. The publication of criminal activity that goes on in Russian television and advertising was brought to Russian civilians following this murder. A special police unit was created after these two high-profile murders.  Reactions  It took a month for the Russian general prosecutor to assign a police task force to investigate the murders of Slabynko and three other Russian journalists. Slabynko's former boss did not believe that Slabynko would have been murdered for what he chose to air on television but police reports have proven otherwise. The UNESCO Director-General Federico Mayor condemned the assassins of Oleg Slabynko and said the following: \\"I learned with dismay about the murder of Oleg Slabynko and condemn it in the strongest terms. UNESCO defends the existence in its Member States of an independent and pluralistic press, an essential component for any democratic societies. I call on Russian authorities to do everything within their power to guarantee the conditions of security for journalists to carry out their profession.\\"  See also  *List of journalists killed in Russia *Freedom of the press in Russia *Human rights in Russia  References  Category:1962 births Category:1996 deaths Category:Assassinated Russian journalists Category:Deaths by firearm in Russia Category:Journalists killed in Russia Category:People murdered in Russia Category:Russian journalists Category:Russian murder victims Category:20th-century journalists ","title":"Oleg Slabynko"},{"id":"45696918","text":"Gasha (possibly from Quechua kasha thorn or spine) is a mountain in the northern part of the Huayhuash mountain range in the Andes of Peru.

Her award-winning writing include poetry, nonfiction and fiction. She is the author of a collection of poems, A Nation In Labour, published in 2015. Anena's poetry has been described as \\"highly evocative and visual\\". The Economist described her poetry performance as \\"an arresting evocation of love and war\\". In 2019, Short Story Day Africa Prize Founder Rachel Zadok said: [Anena] has an unexpected onstage persona that is only given away by the twinkle of mischief in the eye of the quiet woman one meets off-stage. A twinkle one soon learns the meaning of when she performs her work. It means humour, it means power. Anena is a feminine force of nature that takes no prisoners. Feminist. Scathing. Sensitive. Sharp. She has no blurred edges. Her prose is not like a knife, it is the blade that cuts into the patriarchy and incises its scars from the female body.\\" Early life and education Anena was born to Acholi parents and raised in the Gulu District of Uganda. She grew up during the two-decade war led by the Lord's Resistance Army rebels, an episode that birthed and influenced her early writing. Anena attended Gulu Public Primary School, Sacred Heart Secondary School, and Gulu Central High School. She graduated with a Bachelor of Mass Communication degree from Makerere University in 2010 and completed a Master of Arts degree in human rights from the same institution in 2018. She is pursuing the MFA Writing program at Columbia University in New York.  Journalistic work  Anena worked with the Daily Monitor newspaper as a reporter, sub-editor, and deputy chief sub-editor from 2009 to September 2014. She joined the African Centre for Media Excellence in 2014 and worked as a journalism trainer, media researcher, program coordinator and online content producer until 2019. In August 2019, Anena joined Columbia Journal as its Online Copy Editor. Her journalistic articles have been published in the Daily Monitor, New Vision, The Observer, Columbia Journal, The Atlantic and Popula. She has also taught Specialized Writing to journalism students at Islamic University in Uganda. Writing Anena wrote her first poem, \\"The plight of the Acholi child\\", in 2003. It won a writing competition organised by the Acholi Religious Leaders Peace Initiative and helped secure her a bursary for A-Level education. She attended the 2013 Caine Prize workshop held in Uganda, and her story \\"Watchdog Games\\" was published in the anthology A Memory This Size and Other Stories: The Caine Prize for African Writing, 2013. In 2013, she was shortlisted for the \\"Ghana Poetry prize\\" for her poem \\"We Arise\\". A Nation In Labour, published in 2015, is her debut book, a \\"socially conscious\\" collection of poems. The New Vision wrote that \\"Anena and her buffet of poetry will keep you hooked.\\"Caroline Ariba (27 June 2016), \\"Book review: A nation is in labour\\", New Vision. As described by Tomiwa Ilori, \\"A Nation in Labour is a four-part treatise that uses elevated language to tell of horror. Anena‚Äôs collection of poetry warns society about its warped value system through a disciplined use of satiric responses that resonate. Each part of the treatise soaks our desiccated humanity in fluid cadences.\\"Tomiwa Ilori, \\"Rhetoric of Pain and Other Resources\\", Wawa Book Review, 27 October 2015.

The Political Intelligence Department was in the twenties and thirties of the last century, certainly the most famous part of the colonial police. The PID had the reputation of being omnipresent and omniscient, at least with regard to the organizations and individuals who posed a threat to the peace and order. Obviously the work of that PID was largely a case that took place in the seclusion. Very little is known on its activities in publications and the archives and PID employees are no longer with us to provide information. History The PID existed officially from 1916 to 1919 and was then abandoned. Its duties were a few years later assigned to the General Investigation Service (Dutch: Algemeene Recherche Dienst) or ARD. The name PID remained in use, because in Surabaya and Semarang urban police department were still instituted under the name of PID. Among the major tasks of the PID were overseeing the rules of the right of association and assembly and control of the press. Both focused primarily on the activities of Indonesian organizations who were critical of the government, from \\"loyal\\" opposition to efforts to overthrow colonial rule. For that task - at meetings and in the press - the participation of Indonesian personnel was essential, because of lack of competent Dutch. The wedana and mantri's police could therefore run the gauntlet at meetings where they were sitting in the front row. They could give speakers a warning or even dissolve meetings. Their position was unenviable. They found opposite often speakers who tried to locate the boundaries of the colonial tolerance. With imaginative word choices and calculated silences PID men were teased and bullied, to the delight of a sniggering room. And find in such an environment, which the colonial government had then to give an appropriate response. World War II In mid-1942 (Java on August 1) the KNIL transferred his administrative duties over to the Japanese Military Administration (Gunseibu). In the Marine Region the Department of Marine Civil Administration operated. The Gunseibu was a military civilian administration device consisting of technical, economic and legal skilled Japanese officials. The commander of the occupation army was indeed the head of the military government but left the actual responsibility for the civil administration to his chief of staff. The military government had the responsibility to maintain order and peace, exploit natural resources in the conquered territories and to make the Japanese occupation forces self- sufficient. Monitoring compliance with Japanese regulations was owned by the Kempeitai, the Japanese military police. It was assisted by Indonesian officials of the PID. Many of the newcomers of the PID were educated by the Japanese and was located by the reopened police school in Sukabumi, beside that one and only police academy which the Dutch East Indies had known, police schools came in all residences. It seems plausible to us that the number of officers of the PID important increased. The Kenpeitai soon made itself hated by their cruel acts, including the Indonesian PID - the Japanese had made this part of Dutch government apparatus completely subservient to their purposes. Who for instance ventured to listen to foreign radio broadcasts, had to fear that he would be reported by contingent traitors of the PID. Soon after the evacuation from the Dutch East Indies, a Dutch intelligence service was set up in Australia on the instructions of the Dutch Commander of the forces in the East, Helfrich. It was called the Netherlands East Indies Forces Intelligence Service (NEFIS), and was based in Melbourne. The service initially consisted of two divisions: NEFIS I, responsible for military reporting, and NEFIS II, responsible for security. KGB and Stasi The PID was seen as the best Intelligence service in the world because of the success of a small Dutch contingent who could control more than 80 million people in what we call Indonesia today. The Stasi of East Germany and the Russian KGB were based on the PID.

Lasting about 42 minutes, it takes the longest to perform among the divertimenti by Mozart. The third movement (the first Menuetto) from the divertimento remains so popular that it is often referred to as Mozart's Minuet, although this is clearly not the only minuet by Mozart. An excerpt from this movement was used in the animated film Yellow Submarine (1968) when the string quartet was being annihilated by the Blue Meanies. Instrumentation This divertimento is scored for 2 violins, viola, basso (double bass) and 2 horns. Movements This divertimento consists of 6 movements: #Allegro (in D major and in sonata form) #Tema con variazioni (Andante) (in D minor, theme and 6 variations, fourth variation in D major) #Menuetto - Trio (in D major and in compound ternary form, trio in G major) #Adagio (in A major and in sonata form) #Menuetto - Trio I - Trio II (in D major and in rondo form, where the first trio is in D minor and the second trio is in B minor) #Rondo (Allegro) (in D major and in sonata rondo form) In Kurt Sanderling's recording of this piece, both the Adagio and the second Menuetto are omitted.

Built in the Byzantine architectural style, it is noted for the candy-striping in its fa√ßade. Dating to 717 AD, it is said to be one of the oldest churches in Eastern Europe. History  The church is located at the foot of the Mitridatskaya steps (there are 432 steps), which rises to the Mitridat Hill where there are a series of ancient sites. St John's Baptist Church is one of the oldest Christian churches built in the Byzantine architecture style; it was built during the Khazar era in the 8th century. An inscription in the older part of the church reads: \\"Here lies the servant of God Kyriakos, a son of George, a grandson of Vindira. He died on the month of June 3, induction 10th, in the year 6265 from Adam\\". This has been interpreted as the year 757 AD. During the period of the Soviet Union, the church was used as a gem museum. Following the restoration works carried out in the 1980s, church services have been resumed since 1990. In 1982, Tatjana Ivanovna Makarova published an article, Archaeological dating of the John the Precursor church in Kerch. Features In the oldest area of the church, there is a \\"four- pillar cross-dome\\" with the facade formed by semicircular recesses built over cross-shaped columns. The base of these columns are founded over marble columns which are provided with Corinthian capitals. It is inferred that this type of architectural feature existed on the basilicas built in the 6th century. Next to the western side of the church, there is a basilica which is dated between the 11th and 13th centuries. A new chapel was added to the church in the 19th century, which was followed by enlarging the basilica with stone works, and with a belfry. The narthex, which existed in the old church, has been demolished. The building material used in the old part of the church is light Kerch limestone. The walls of the church have been built with bricks in successive layers, laid in alternate stages of four layers of masonry followed by four layers of red clay bricks which act against earthquake effects.

General Phoumi Nosavan, a participant in four prior coups, had been deprived of troop command as a result; nevertheless, he managed to come up with troops for another try at overthrowing the Royal Lao Government. Simultaneously, Colonel Bounleut Saycocie independently mounted his own coup; after a short term takeover of Vientiane's radio station and infrastructure, he and his coup troops would rejoin the government forces sent to attack them. General Kouprasith Abhay, the military region commander, suppressed both coups. After re-acquiring Bounleut's troops, Kouprasith turned on the national police force and its commander, Siho Lamphouthacoul, as he felt they were untrustworthy and likely to join Phoumi's coup. The police force was defeated and disbanded. The troops Phoumi counted on never reached Vientiane; they were defeated and dispersed. By 4 February 1965, both coups were defeated. A purge of suspected dissident officers from the Lao officer corps followed. An insurrection was threatened in Thakhek on 26 March 1965, but was quelled bloodlessly. The mutinous units' officers' ranks were purged of insurgents, who exiled themselves to nearby Thailand. Three weeks later, Phoumi's defeated coup troops once again threatened to stage a coup. Kouprasith sent a regiment to overcome this battalion. About two-thirds of its troops deserted; its commanding officer was executed. Both Phoumi and Siho ended their careers in exile in Thailand. Overview French colonial policy in their Protectorate of Laos was based on a minimal French administration imposed upon the local culture. The French apparat in Laos was the smallest in French Indochina. In 1907, the French decided that two or three years education would suffice for the average Laotian citizen. Only a scanty lowland Lao urban elite received a better education, usually at Vientiane's Pavie Lycee by French instructors. By the time the Kingdom of Laos became independent, there were too few Lao with civil administrative training to run the government.Anthony, Sexton, p. 4. The French-run military did no better. Only an estimated five percent of Lao soldiers had three or more years of education; 90 percent were illiterate. Colonial policy was to have French officers command the Lao army units; a few Lao officers would be entrusted with the command of a company. These Lao junior officers came from the urban elite. In the wake of the departure of French officers in 1954 after Lao independence, these few junior officers suddenly rose in rank and responsibilities, becoming field grade officers. Lao sergeants and corporals were promoted to company commands as officers. At the top of the rank structure, generals were commissioned into the army from civilian life, with no military experience. From the beginning, the Royal Lao Army was not allegiant to either the Lao constitution, or to the RLA. Instead, Lao troops showed loyalty toward whichever senior Lao officer they already knew. It was an army utterly without esprit de corps .Anthony, Sexton, pp. 11‚Äì12. Background On 25 December 1959, Captain Kong Le and his paratroopers bloodlessly seized the Royal Lao Government in Vientiane, and installed General Phoumi Nosavan in power.Conboy, Morrison, p. 25. Kong Le displaced Phoumi with a coup on 10 August 1960, only to have control of Laos revert to Phoumi in the Battle of Vientiane on 16 December 1960.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 32‚Äì43. On 18 April 1964, Phoumi would be surprised by another coup, staged by Siho Lamphouthacoul and his Directorate of National Coordination police. Phoumi was sidelined throughout this coup. Nevertheless, after the coup was quashed, Phoumi lost his Defense Minister's post in the RLG, as well as any troops to command.Anthony, Sexton, pp. 98‚Äì99.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 107, 113 note 6. However, Phoumi still had access to a training battalion stationed outside Vientiane; on 4 August 1964, he ordered them into an attempted coup. This putsch was quelled by troops commanded by Kouprasith Abhay, and the training battalion disbanded.Conboy, Morrison, p. 123. Phoumi's coup On 20 January 1965, an electrical malfunction caused a disastrous chain reaction accident that destroyed nine T-28 Trojan bombers at Wattay Airfield outside Vientiane. Taking advantage of the distractions caused by such a serious loss to the government,Anthony, Sexton, p. 150. on 27 January 1965, Phoumi managed to inveigle the dispatch of Military Region 2 troops south from the Plain of Jars to counter a purported attack on Vientiane by the local troops of Military Region 5. The contingent moving from MR 2 consisted of Battalion Volontaires 22 (Battalion of Volunteers 22), Google maps Laos. Retrieved: 11 March 2015. as well as two companies of Battalion Infanterie 13 (Battalion of Infantry 13) moving in from Paksan. Google maps Laos. Retrieved: 11 March 2015. Bounleut's coup On 31 January 1965, Colonel Bounleut Saycocie also decided on a coup. While unaware of Phoumi's efforts, Bounleut led three companies from the Groupement Mobile 17 (Mobile Group 17) regiment as they occupied Vientiane's radio station and other critical points. The coup was largely bloodless. Five announcements were aired on the radio station. There were now two separate coups being staged independently and simultaneously.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 123‚Äì124. Unfortunately for Bounleut, U.S. Ambassador William H. Sullivan had the radio station taken off the air. Sullivan had convinced a drunken Australian technician to sever the station's connection to its antenna to quiet it.Ahern, p. 207. Bounleut's ploy of broadcasting phony news of support for his coup was foiled.Warner, pp. 154‚Äì155. Reaction to the coups It was MR 5 commander Kouprasith's duty to crush the coups. He turned out the remaining companies of GM 17, garbed them with identifying orange scarves, and sent them out to quell the insurrection. Bounleut and his coup force promptly donned orange scarves and rejoined their regiment. Elsewhere, on 1 February 1965, police were posted on guard at Phone Kheng prison.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 124. Meanwhile, Phoumi was in his house in Vientiane, awaiting his promised troops. He also hoped that his protege Siho would bring his DNC police to his aid. However, Siho abstained from any action other than the posted guards. Elsewhere, the inbound troops for Phoumi's coup were still en route from Paksan to Vientiane. Though the companies from BI 13 turned back, BV 22 pressed on to attack the docks on the Mekong River outside of Vientiane before withdrawing some 47 kilometers to a defensive position. At 1300 hours on 3 February 1965, Kouprasith's artillery blasted Phone Kheng. His armored force moved in. By sundown, the commando company of police belonging to Bataillon Special 33 (Special Battalion 33) fled the flaming jail. They changed out of their uniforms and melted into the populace. From there, the anti-coup forces went 22 kilometers out of town to surround the DNC headquarters. With the exception of one escapee company, DNC Bataillon Special 11 (Special Battalion 11) and DNC Bataillon Special 99 (Special Battalion 99) were arrested without incident. Siho now ordered his two remaining companies of police commandos to ambush Route 151 in and around Ban Nava. After Kouprasith's Bataillon Volontaires 52 (Volunteer Battalion 52) failed to dislodge the DNC troops, he called for air strikes on the police. General Thao Ma, who headed the Royal Lao Air Force, managed to deflect the request. Kouprasith then commandeered an RLAF L-20 Beaver, mounted a .50 caliber machine gun in its door, and directed it to attack the DNC ambush. Though inaccurate, the improvised air strike terrified the police into surrender to troops of Bataillon Volontaires 53 (Volunteer Battalion 53) and GM 17. With that done, Kouprasith turned to Phoumi's coup forces. He attacked them with artillery fire and an air raid from the Beaver. BV 22 dispersed north from Paksan. By 4 February, the DNC police were temporarily locked in a cigarette factory, then disbanded. Phoumi's villa was looted. Phoumi and Siho fled into exile in Thailand.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 124‚Äì125. Settling accounts Two Phoumi loyalist generals were purged from command. Also, the major general who had forwarded the MR 2 troops was jailed for a year, and his command passed to General Vang Pao on 28 February 1965.Conboy, Morrison, p. 125. On 26 March, radio broadcasts from troops in Thakhek denounced the Vientiane government. Two regiments and two battalions were stationed there. On the 28th, the Royal Lao Army General Staff sent two regiments and a battalion southward to counter the perceived threat. The potential dissidents quietly acquiesced in a purge of their officers' ranks, with most of the officers exiling themselves across the Thai border. Towards the end of April, there was another threat to the RLG. BV 22 was still lurking near Paksan; they had been joined by Bataillon Regional 290 (Regional Battalion 290). Once again, GM 17 was called upon to crush dissent. BR 290 surrendered; its commander fled to Thailand. The commander of BV 22 was executed while trying to surrender. BV 22 suffered massive desertions, as 360 of its men fled, leaving only 153 soldiers in the battalion. A garrison was selected from GM 17 and posted in Paksan. Aftermath Phoumi and Siho fled into exile in Thailand. It was the end of both generals' careers. Kouprasith Abhay maintained his grip on Military Region 5 and the capital of Laos. Ouane Rattikone remained Chief of Staff for the Royal Lao Army. Subordinates were dispatched to Savannakhet to take charge of any RLA units that might still be loyal to Phoumi. As the elite families settled scores behind the scenes, some of the best junior officers in the RLA were jailed, murdered, or otherwise purged, further weakening the Lao military.

One of his better known robberies occurred outside Contention City, a boomtown in the Arizona Territory. Drew Station Stagecoach Robbery On March 15, 1881, Head and three of his known Cowboy companions, Bill Leonard, Jim Crane, and Luther King, were set to rob a Wells Fargo stagecoach. The monetary gain, however, wasn't the only motive for robbing the stagecoach. Killing Bob Paul was reportedly a secondary objective. Paul had been sent out with the stagecoach to prevent robberies from occurring, riding shotgun. Two well-known local families during the time, the Clantons and the Earps, are rumored to have had an interest in trying to kill Paul.The Complete List of Old West Outlaws; (n.d.); retrieved February 20, 2015; Legends of America website The coach was carrying 26,000 dollars and eight passengers. Twelve miles from the stagecoach's final destination, Paul changed seats with the driver of the stagecoach, which temporarily brought the stagecoach to a halt. Shortly after the change of seats the stagecoach came to a part of the road that had a very steep grade. This was where Head and the others laid in ambush. In order to conceal their identities, the stagecoach robbers wore wigs and false beards.The Western Online; (n.d.); retrieved March 17, 2015 Crane fired at the guard‚Äôs seat, which was where Paul should have been sitting, but the driver, Budd Philpot, was killed instead. Philpot fell forward into the horses pulling the stagecoach, causing them to charge forward. By this time Paul had drawn his weapon and had started to return fire, and he wounded Leonard. During the gunfight, a passenger named Pete Roerig was killed.

Holliday claimed that he had a sufficient alibi and that he was in no way involved in the robbery. But in July a warrant was sworn out for his arrest. Holliday was taken into custody and questioned but was later released on bond. Four days later his case was dismissed for insufficient evidence.Patterson, R.; (1985); Historical Atlas of the Outlaw West; Boulder: Johnson Books; Pp. not given Aftermath After the ambush on the Wells Fargo stagecoach, Paul and Wyatt Earp, started an investigation. They put a price on the heads of those that were involved in the ambush and set it at 2,000 dollars dead or alive. Paul should have notified the local sheriff immediately after the incident occurred, however; the sheriff at the time, Johnny Behan, was known to be a \\"...friend of the [Cowboy] element.\\" As the manhunt for the perpetrators of the Drew Station Stagecoach robbery continued, it was soon discovered that Head and several of his companions had managed to flee across the Mexican border. The investigation initially resulted in the arrest of Luther King, who was held under suspicion of being one of the robbers. King went peaceably even though he had \\"...a Winchester, two six-shooters, and twenty boxes of cartridges...\\" with him. He did, however, quickly escape from jail. Before escaping, King stated he had only been there to hold the horses, but had also revealed that his accomplices were Harry \\"the Kid\\" Head, Billy Leonard, and Jim Crane. Death Head and Leonard were able to elude capture for several months. After three months, however, they attempted a robbery at a store in Eureka, New Mexico. The owners of the store, Bill and Ike Haslett, fought back and killed the two outlaws. Afterward, Crane, along with Curly Bill Brocius, Frank Stilwell, Pony Diehl, Pete Spence, and at least five other men, hunted down the Haslett brothers.Hume, J., & Thacker, J.; (2010); Wells, Fargo & Co.

McNeill (December 19, 1917 ‚Äì May 27, 2005) was an American photographer who documented African-American life. \\"In the 1930s and 40s, any time there was a political, social, religious or community event in Washington's black community, Robert H. McNeill was there to photograph it.\\"  Early life and education  McNeill was born in Washington, D.C.: his father William C. McNeill was a physician and medical educator, and his mother Mary A. McNeill was a DC school teacher and member of the Board of Education. He discovered his interest in photography as a high school student at Dunbar High School , which produced a corps of black artists and intellectuals during the first half of the 20th century.  Career  Education As an 18-year-old sophomore at Washington's Howard University, McNeill photographed the 1936 Olympics hero Jesse Owens during his post-Olympics visit to the campus. He sold the photograph to the two local African-American newspapers and to all four of the daily \\"mainstream\\" DC newspapers, whose coverage of the African-American community had generally been very limited. That was a pivotal moment in his career. After attending Howard University for two years as a pre-medical student, he entered the New York Institute of Photography where he graduated in 1938.Sullivan, Patricia. Washington Post, May 29, 2005; C-8 New York New York City was a fertile field for photographic subjects and an inspiration for McNeill. He photographed dancers at the Savoy Ballroom, cartoonist E. Simms Campbell and Lionel Hampton and Benny Goodman (rehearsing for the famous Carnegie Hall Concert of 1938) among others. While at the institute, McNeill learned that Fortune magazine was looking for photographs of the \\"domestic workers, mostly black, who assembled on designated street corners each day to sell their labor to the highest bidder.\\"Natanson,Nicholas. \\"Robert H. McNeill and the Profusion of Virginia Experience\\", p. 100. In Visual Journal: Harlem and D.C. in the Thirties and Forties\\", Deborah Willis and Jane Lusaka, editors. 1996, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, DC McNeill was developing his own style of documentary photography as he juxtaposed images of the black workers with their surroundings; for example, three women and a man standing beneath a movie poster that reads, \\"Make a Wish\\". As part of the project, McNeill was able to follow Bessie Windstown as she stood waiting on a corner for a prospective job, through her negotiations with a white housewife from the Bronx for her hourly wage to the employer's home, where he was able to photograph her scrubbing the floor on her hands and knees. In the end, Fortune did not use McNeill's pictures; their final story, \\"The Servant Problem\\", portrayed the story from the employers‚Äô viewpoint. McNeill was able to publish the essay \\"The Bronx Slave Market\\" in Flash!, a Washington and NYC-based, black-edited magazine.Natanson, pp. 100‚Äì101, in Visual Journal He returned to Washington in 1938 and established himself as a free-lance photographer. Virginia That same year, McNeill's work came to the attention of Sterling Brown, a faculty member at Howard University and the Negro Affairs editor for the Federal Writers' Project. Brown was launching what was to be known as the Negro in Virginia study. The project was unique in that it had \\"an all-black research staff led by Hampton Institute scientist Roscoe Lewis\\"; the mission was to document \\"three centuries of black history through sources as varied as ex-slave narratives, economic statistics, and photographs.\\" McNeill spent most of September 1938 traveling as an uncompensated consultant through the state of Virginia alone in a black coupe with USA license plates. With 160 images for his Speed Graphic camera and a few rolls of 35 mm for a borrowed Leica, the young photographer had to be very judicious about his shots.Natanson, Prologue During those three weeks, he filmed workers at their jobs from the most menial to the black middle class. He encountered the tobacco workers, the longshoremen, and bankers. Only a few of McNeill's epic photographs of black life in the state were eventually published in Virginia: A Guide to the Old Dominion and that world invisible to most of America, The Negro in Virginia, in 1940. Washington, D.C. During the 1930s and 1940s, McNeill chronicled the lives of African Americans in Washington, DC. He photographed events for the Boy and Girl Scouts, the black YMCA and YWCA, and the African American Junior League. He recorded weddings, cotillions, graduations, meetings, awards ceremonies, and baptisms; one of his famous photographs is of a multiple baptism by Pentecostal minister Daddy Grace. He paid particular attention to people going about their daily lives‚Äîan iceman, a hairdresser, workers at a corner market, movers, and boys reading comic books on a street corner.Lusaka, Jane. \\"Seeking a Cultural Equality\\", pp. 67‚Äì68. In Visual Journal: Harlem and D.C. in the Thirties and Forties, Deborah Willis and Jane Lusaka, editors. 1996, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, DC After his success with the Jesse Owens photograph, McNeill continued to contribute to black newspapers throughout the country. He had an eye for significant events in the African American community, and he had an ear for learning where things were happening. \\"People would give me tips and leads; knowing that I was a photographer, they‚Äôd call me up,\\" said McNeill.Lusaka, p. 72 in Visual Journal McNeill photographed the famous and the ordinary. He met \\"his subjects head on they take up the entire frame of the picture. Nothing distracts from the main event.Lusaka, p. 70 in Visual Journal The list of the famous includes Joe Lewis, Duke Ellington, Hattie McDaniel, Ella Fitzgerald, Eleanor and Franklin Roosevelt. He caught Bill \\"Bojangles\\" Robinson in action from the wings of the Earle Theater because he could not purchase a ticket in the front row. He captured the opening of the T Street Post Office in Washington, the first with an all-black staff, and the opening of the Washington bureau of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. He was present and recorded the confirmation of William Hastie as governor of the Virgin Islands. He documented the growing civil rights movement in the 1940s.Lusaka, pp. 70‚Äì71 in Visual Journal During World War II, McNeill served in an ammunition ordinance company (594th Am Ord Co), which was a very common posting for African American troops; he was stationed in Alabama and Guadalcanal much of which time he spent as the First Sergeant of his all African-American company. He left the Army in 1945 as a Second Lieutenant having been commissioned at the very end of the war. He also compiled a personal photographic record of his experiences in the Army. When he returned to Washington, he resumed his photo business, McNeill News Photo Service. He was commissioned by the United Negro College Fund to document the post-war veterans‚Äô education programs at eleven Negro colleges. Government employment In 1950, McNeill became a government photographer for the Department of Defense. In 1956, James Steven ‚ÄúSteve‚Äù Wright brought McNeill to the U.S. Department of State as a portrait photographer. Wright had started as a chauffeur-messenger in the Federal Emergency Administration of Public Works, but Hyman Greenberg, recognizing his talent as a photographer, hired Wright first as a ‚Äúphotographic assistant‚Äù and quickly changed it to assistant photographer. Greenberg and others helped break down racial barriers for Wright and by 1954, Wright had become Photographic Branch Chief of Audio Visual Division, at the Department of State. McNeill was a direct beneficiary of Wright's policy of giving out assignments to whoever was available at any given time, which gave all of the photographers equal opportunity in the department. McNeill eventually succeeded Wright as Photographic Branch Chief and retired from the Department of State in 1978 in that position. As a portrait photographer at State, McNeill is credited with creating the official portraits of Secretaries of State Dean Rusk, Henry Kissinger, and Cyrus Vance. In 1997, McNeill was selected as Photographer of the Year by the Fotocraft Camera Club of Washington. In 1998 he received the Maurice Sorrell Lifetime Achievement Award from the EXPOSURE GROUP, African American Photographers Association.  Exhibitions  In recent years, McNeill's photographs have been widely exhibited due largely to the efforts of MacArthur Fellowship Award Winner Deborah Willis, who, while working with the Smithsonian's African- American Museum Project, recognized McNeill's artistry and vision. His work was presented in 1983 and 1984 in A Century of Black Photographers,Winston, Michael and Valencia Hollins Coar. 1983. A Century of Black Photographers, Rhode Island School of Design, Museum of Art, Providence, RI a national traveling exhibit sponsored by the Rhode Island Institute of Design.

In Washington, DC, his work was exhibited at the Sumner School in 1989 and at the Smithsonian Institution's Anacostia Museum in 1991. His work was also a part of the 1992 exhibit To Achieve These Rights, a photographic essay on desegregation in Washington.

His 1938 photograph ‚ÄúMake a Wish‚Äù and a 1938 photograph of a farmer worker, which was taken for the WPA project The Negro in Virginia, are part of the Smithsonian's ‚ÄúOh Freedom! Teaching African American Civil Rights through American Art at the Smithsonian‚Äù Web site. These and other McNeill photographs can be seen in the catalog of the Smithsonian American Art Museum. McNeill's photographs were a significant resource for The Washington Post Magazine's feature Backlight, which highlights unique moments in Washington history. McNeill spoke and lectured on Washington during the 1930s and 40s, including an appearance on National Public Radio. He had also been a lecturer and photo competition judge for the Greater Washington Council of Camera Clubs.

Some of the notable silent film stars who worked at the studios during this time are Fatty Arbuckle and Buster Keaton. Charlie Chaplin also made three visits to the studios to visit Arbuckle's film shoots and to study studio management for his newly formed United Artists company.  History  In 1910, the California Motion Picture Manufacturing Company built the first movie studio in the city of Long Beach. This was also the first studio west of Chicago, since the hub of film-making at that time was in New York. In April 1913, H. M. Horkheimer (along with his brother, Elwood) invested their inheritance in the purchase of the studio built by the California Motion Picture Manufacturing Company at the corner of 6th Street and Alamitos Ave. This became the center of their Balboa Amusement Producing Company. Jack London A contract between Balboa and Jack London was signed on April 28, 1913, allowing the studio to make film adaptations of his novels. In the beginning of August, Variety announced a contract between the Bosworth Company and Jack London to produce film versions of London's novels. The first release would be The Sea Wolf. The Balboa company would advertise that they would be the first to release the film and announced their own version of The Sea Wolf and several other adaptations of London's works. In an article in Motion Picture News in which Hobart Bosworth stated the production would be ready by October 1 and there is no reason to doubt the contract between Bosworth and London. The publication received a telegram from Jack London confirmed that Balboa's contract had lapsed because of a failure to produce four films by the stipulated date. London also stated that the first film had not even been completed by this point. When the matter was taken to court, the federal judge in Los Angeles refused to grant an injunction on Balboa's three reel version of the film and H. M. Horkheimer was considering suing for damages by Bosworth. The judge allowed the case to be re-opened and the Authors' League of America announced a desire to take it to the United States Supreme Court if necessary. London would win and the case would influence the United States Congress to change the copyright law in the writer's favor.

Products and services Menchey Music sells and rents guitars, pianos, and band and orchestra instruments, including string, brass, percussion, and keyboard instruments, as well as printed sheet music. In addition to serving consumers directly, Menchey Music has formal arrangements with school districts and colleges to visit schools weekly to pick up and return instruments that need to be repaired or replaced. Their repairs are not limited to instruments specifically purchased at Menchey. School rentals is its largest source of revenue. The company makes relationships with local school districts by providing rental instruments. Schools across the country participate in rental programs for students in brand or orchestras. Menchey Music provides their rental service with pickups and deliveries directly to the school. Music stores tend to succeed with school instrument rentals because parents don‚Äôt want to pay full price for an instrument their child may not continue with. Menchey Music also gives the opportunity for students to rent their instruments through schools so they can change and experiment with instruments they like, without making a long-term commitment. With rent-to-own options, children have the ability to keep their instrument when the payment is complete. Musical instrument and voice lessons offered at store locations are provided by independent contractors. The number of teachers at each location vary and depends on the demand of their customers. Lessons consist of a typical half-hour block once a week, signing up for month long sessions at a time. Band and orchestra instrument brands sold by Menchey Music include Gemeinhardt, Buffet Crampon, Yamaha, Accent Musical Instruments, Eastman Music Company, Vincent Bach, Jupiter Band Instruments, Cannonball Musical Instruments, Haynes, Conn-Selmer, King Musical Instruments, and Henri Selmer Paris. Guitar and amplifier brands include Fender Musical Instruments, Alvarez Guitars, C. F. Martin & Company, Line 6, Zoom, Audio-Technica, Ibanez, and Jay Turser. Awards Menchey is an authorized seller of Yamaha pianos and in 2010 and 2014 was recognized with Yamaha Corporation's Institutional Dealer of the Year Award. Yamaha Corporation of America is the world‚Äôs largest musical instrument manufacturer. The award was presented to Menchey Music at the NAMM music products show in 2015 in Anaheim, California. This award was presented to only nine music retailers in the country. Yamaha pianos sold by Menchey Music include Yamaha Clavinova digital pianos and Disklavier electronic player pianos. History Menchey Music was founded in Hanover, Pennsylvania in 1936 by J. Robert Menchey and today is run by his grandson, Joel Menchey. Robert Menchey (born 1916) founded Menchey Music Service out of his mother‚Äôs sewing room in Hanover, moved to a small shop on York Street, and eventually settled in a 17,500 square foot superstore on Wetzel Drive in Hanover. When Robert Menchey retired in 1982, his business had grown into a full-service piano and school music dealer in Central Pennsylvania and Maryland. Through the help of a mentor and friend, Orin Sepp, Robert Menchey became one of the pioneers in the successful band instrument rental program. His mentor Sepp was a salesman and executive with the Chicago Musical Instrument Company who wanted to see Menchey do well. The rental program Bob Menchey implemented is now one of the largest sources of revenue for Menchey Music Service. This program started with a simple idea from Bob Menchey, who only wanted to rent instruments to kids so parents didn‚Äôt have to pay full price for a hobby their child might not keep. Robert Menchey‚Äôs retail outlets, repair services, and music lessons continue to grow and remain successful. Menchey Music opened its sixth location (in Reading, Pennsylvania) in August 2012 and its seventh location in July 2013 after purchasing Stu's Music Shop in Westminster, Maryland. Joel Menchey served on the NAMM Board of Directors from 2007 to 2010, and was re- elected as secretary of the executive board in 2016.

Evoland was first released for Microsoft Windows and OS X in April 2013, Android and iOS in February 2015 and Linux in March 2015. The design retraces the history of video games. Inspired by The Legend of Zelda, Diablo and Final Fantasy gameplay, the game has many references to movies and video game history. As the player progresses, they unlock new technologies and graphical upgrades that nod towards different eras of the video game industry. A sequel, Evoland 2, was announced at the end of 2014 and was released August 25, 2015. The two games were packaged together as Evoland: Legendary Edition and released for home consoles in February 2019.  Gameplay  Evoland is based on the concept of tracing the evolution of video games. When the game begins, there are only four colors, simple pixelated graphics, and a 2D character. Through the adventure, the player gradually unlocks new graphics, new technologies and new gameplay until reaching the HD age and a three-dimensional world. This evolution in-game of video game history is punctuated by many references to classic role-playing games and movies. The game alternates between action RPG phases similar to The Legend of Zelda and Active-Time Battles like those seen in Final Fantasy. The character moves in a world made up of dungeons, caverns, forests and villages full of NPCs. Players collect the in-game currency Glis after each battle, which can be spent in towns to purchase additional items and upgrades, many of which must be obtained to finish the game. In addition to completing the story mode, players can also attempt to find hidden stars and cards that are scattered around the game world, the latter of which can be used in a collectible card game based on \\"Triple Triad\\" from Final Fantasy VIII.  Development  Originally, Evoland was a video game created by Nicolas Cannasse during the 24th Ludum Dare, an \\"accelerated video game competition\\". Participants have 48 hours to create a video game respecting a given theme. The 24th Ludum Dare theme was \\"Evolution\\". Nicolas Cannasse proposed Evoland in about 30 hours and won first place out of 1400 participants. The concept he proposed can be defined as a game which changes as the player follows the history of RPGs. The player feedback was very encouraging. Evoland Classic quickly reached over 300,000 players within a couple of months, and is still playable on the Evoland Website for free. Also, as common in Ludum Dare, the Haxe source code was made available, in this case on GitHub.ld24 on github.com/ncannasse/ld24evoland by Nicolas Cannasse (Aug 29 2012) Given the success of Evoland Classic, Shiro Games decided to create a new version of the game with new bosses and monsters, new play styles, full environment 3D and an extended play-time.  Release  Evoland was first released on Steam and GOG.com at $9.99 in 2013. on April 4, 2013. In February 2015, the game was ported by Playdigious on iOS App Store and Google Play for $4.99. On January 24, 2019, Shiro Games announced that Evoland and Evoland 2 would be packaged together in a single release, titled Evoland: Legendary Edition, and released for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch and PC the following February.  Reception  The game was received by critics with an average rating of 61 out of 100 on Metacritic. Specialized press and websites acclaimed the potential and originality of the concept as well as the references to cinema and video games history. According to Destructoid \\"Evoland's elements form a love letter to some of the most venerated games in their respective genres, and it's surprising just how well the shifting gameplay types work together.\\" Many critics comment on how nostalgia helps make the game excel. Main criticisms concerned the play-time and the lack of variety. Some players and specialized websites criticized the fact that the game stops evolving much after 30 minutes. Evoland reached approximately 460,000 sales on Steam alone according to Steam Spy.evoland on Steam Spy (May 19, 2017)  References   External links  * * Evoland Classic * Shiro Games official website Category:Role-playing video games Category:IOS games Category:Android (operating system) games Category:Windows games Category:MacOS games Category:Linux games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:Nintendo Switch games Category:Xbox One games Category:2013 video games Category:Ludum Dare video games Category:Video games developed in France ","title":"Evoland"},{"id":"45697478","text":"Clemente V√°zquez Bello (23 November 1887 ‚Äì 28 September 1932) was President of the Cuban Senate from 1925 to 1932, throughout the administration of Cuban President Gerardo Machado. V√°zquez belonged to the Liberal Party of Cuba and was a key figure in the Machado regime during the 1920s and early 1930s. From the time he was 23, V√°squez held local office in Santa Clara. He served in the Cuban House of Representatives and was elected as its president from 1923 to 1925. He was elected to the Cuban Senate during the November 1924 elections as Senator for the province of Santa Clara. By 1927 he was president of the Liberal Party and President of the Senate. In 1930, he responded to economic crisis posed by an oversupply of sugar by proposing a law for a \\"national fuel\\", that is, requiring Cubans to use motor oil based on a mixture of gasoline and alcohol made from sugar. In 1931, he defended Machado from charges that he was responsible for the depression and predicted that the development of more efficient use of sugar by-products would relieve the economic crisis in the sugar market. He minimized the significance of an attempt to overthrow the government in December 1930: \\"Many men have deserted their party organizations and refuse to abide by party control, but in my opinion these will tire of offering resistance to constituted authority.\\" V√°zquez was a key figure in the Machado administration and a likely candidate for the presidency of Cuba in the 1934 elections when he was assassinated by members of the ABC (abecedarios) on the afternoon of 28 September 1932. V√°zquez, riding in his limousine in Havana, was hit by machine gun fire. He died on the operating table at Camp Columbia Military Hospital. Several other political figures were murdered later the same day, apparently in retaliation and on Machado's orders, including three brothers: Representative Gonzalo Freyre de Andrade, Guillermo Freyre de Andrade, an attorney, and Leopoldo Freyre de Andrade, a sugar engineer opposed to Machado's plans for the sugar economy. Representative Miguel Angel Aguiar, who had participated in the unsuccessful revolt against the Machado government in August 1931, was shot four times but survived. V√°zquez was buried on 29 September in Santa Clara, Cuba. The radical group known as ABC had planned to assassinate Machado at V√°squez' funeral in Havana, but their plan was frustrated when the V√°squez family chose Santa Clara for the burial.

It owes its academic heritage to the Servite Order which in 1973 founded the Liceo Linguistico San Pellegrino (the San Pellegrino High School specialising in foreign languages) and in 1987 founded the Scuola Superiore per Interpreti e Traduttori (School for Translators and Interpreters). Founding members of FUSP are the Order of the Servants of Mary, the Municipality of Misano Adriatico and the Nida Institute for Biblical Scholarship of New York. New partners include the Gruppo Maggioli (since 2014) and Uniformazione Vicenza (since 2013).  Academics  FUSP offers an undergraduate program in Cultural Mediation at the Scuola Superiore per Mediatori Linguistici (SSML) in Misano Adriatico. The degree program operates on a semester academic calendar with Fall semester running from October to December and Spring semester running from mid-February to early-May. The program focuses on perfecting one‚Äôs language skills through the acquisition of translation and interpreting skills. All alumni must take English as their first language and can then add up to two languages to their curriculum, choosing from Russian, Spanish, German, French, Chinese, Brazilian Portuguese and Arabic. Core modules also include General Linguistics, Italian Linguistics, Translation Theory, Elements of Economics, Geography and Law. There is an entry level writing test in English and Italian prior to enrolment (end of September). Exam sessions take place in January, May‚ÄìJune and September‚ÄìOctober. Since 1987, SSML has actively participated in the Erasmus Programme, the EU student exchange programme which enables students attending SSML to study abroad at its partner universities and/or work for partner companies in the European Union whilst receiving a bursary. In 2014, FUSP inaugurated a separate branch of SSML located in the South of Italy, in Fasano (Brindisi), and in 2013 the SSML of Vicenza in the North also joined the Foundation, thus consolidating the Foundation‚Äôs presence across Italy.  Professional programs and advanced training  In 2010, FUSP opened Traduzione Editoria, its Translation and Publishing Department which organises professional courses and advanced training for editorial translators. Its most popular programs are: *Master di Tradurre la Letteratura (the \\"Translating Literature\\" Advanced Training course): this advanced training program has been running for 20 years (so prior to the establishment of the Foundation) and in 2015 it will celebrate its 20th edition. This course is composed of two parallel activities: translation workshops and seminars given by professional translators and key figures of the publishing industry. The seminars focus on specific topics which range from literature for young adults to graphic novels, romance novels to historical fiction. *Avviamento all‚Äôinterpretazione simultanea e consecutiva (Introduction to Simultaneous and Consecutive Interpreting), a course for aspiring interpreters wishing to learn the techniques of the trade or interpreters who wish to consolidate the skills they have already acquired. *Master traduzione editoriale‚Äìletteraria dall‚Äôarabo (Advanced training course in literary-editorial translation from Arabic into Italian)  Research  Research has always been a pivotal activity at San Pellegrino and FUSP is currently conducting extensive research in the field of translation and is specifically involved in these projects: *The Nida School of Translation Studies (NSTS) is a two-week event which takes place in Misano in May every year. Now in its ninth edition, this important research gathering provides post-doctoral scholars, along with a limited number of advanced doctoral students, with an intense program of lectures, workshops, readings and tutorials, bringing together experts from around the world to critically explore various aspects of translation theory, linguistics, semiotics and cultural studies. *PETRA (Platforme Europ√©enne pour la traduction litt√©raire) ‚Äì FUSP is one of the Project Partners of a European-Union funded research project (2014-2016) for the creation of a European platform for translation. The aims of the project are to create open structures, at national and European level, to enable universities and higher education establishments to collaborate with non-academic organizations and associations and networks of professional literary translators without cumbersome administrative procedures, and to start a discussion on promising, long-term structures for the education and training of literary translators at a European level. This involves exchange and cooperation between academic and non-academic institutions on the contents of training, on practical issues and methods of teaching. The fellow PETRA Project Partners are: Universiteit Utrecht (UU) ‚Äì Faculty of Humanities, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (KU LEUVEN) ‚Äì Faculty of Arts, Nederlandse Taalunie /The Dutch Language Union (NTU), E√∂tv√∂s Lor√°nd University (ELTE) ‚Äì Department of Dutch Studies, British Centre for Literary Translation (BCLT) ‚Äì University of East Anglia (UEA), Deutscher √úbersetzerfonds (D√úF), Conseil Europ√©en des Associations de Traducteurs Litt√©raires (CEATL). *\\"Translation: an interdisciplinary journal\\" is an international peer-reviewed journal, which from January 2012 is published twice a year in print and online versions. The journal takes as its main mission the collection and representation of the ways in which translation as a fundamental element of culture transforms our contemporary world. Its ambition is to create a forum for the discussion of translation, offering an open space for debate and reflection on what is referred to as post- translation studies, moving beyond disciplinary boundaries towards wider transdisciplinary discourses on the translational nature of societies which are increasingly hybrid, diasporic, border-crossing, intercultural, multilingual, and global. *FUSP is also the venue for the Nida School of Biblical Translation (NSBT) which brings together biblical translators from all over the world in May every year.  Notable Guests  Professors, academics, scholars and translators who are or have been associated to San Pellegrino or its projects since 1987: *Davide Rondoni *Tom√°s Albaladejo *Camilo Rub√©n Fern√°ndez Cozman *Stefano Arduini *Susan Bassnett *Peeter Torop *Edwin Gentzler *Vicente L. Rafael *Eugene A. Nida *Sandra L. Bermann *Anthony Pym *Lawrence Venuti *Giuseppe Ragazzini *Ilide Carmignani *Elsa T√°mez *Beatrice Masini *Emanuelle Caillat *Daniele Brolli  Additional Activities  Every year the Foundation organises important competitions and events which attract interest on a local, regional and national level: *Premio Fondazione San Pellegrino per la Traduzione (Translation Competition for High School students): this annual competition has been taking place since 2012. It is open to all 5th year students from public or private high schools in the provinces of Rimini (RN), Pesaro (PU), Ravenna (RA) and Forl√¨-Cesena (FC) and involves translating a text from English, French, Spanish or German into Italian. The competition takes place in April every year; the best translators and runners up receive prizes at the award ceremony in May. *Premio San Pellegrino \\"Looking for Talent\\" (\\"Looking for Talent\\" Language Competition for Middle School Students): this annual competition, which has been taking place since 2013, tests the English language skills of 3rd year middle school students (12-13 year olds). Pupils from public or private middle schools in the provinces of Rimini (RN) and Pesaro (PU) can take part. The competition takes places in November every year; the best candidates and runners up receive prizes at the award ceremony in December. *Le Giornate della Traduzione Letteraria (The Literary Translation Days): the Literary Translation Days take place every year in late September - early October in the historic city of Urbino. This event, which has been running since 2003, is organised by FUSP in collaboration with the International Studies Department of History, Language and Culture at the \\"Carlo Bo\\" University. The Literary Translation Days are three days of seminars and debates held by writers, scholars, translators and publishers who analyse current issues and future horizons of the translation trade. In addition, two prizes are handed out during the event: the Zanichelli award and Harlequin Mondadori award. The former celebrates the career of a translator or person who has contributed significantly to the translator industry (previous award winners include Daniel Pennac and Luis Sep√∫lveda); the latter awards one of the participants of the event who is given the chance to translate a chapter from a romance novel from English into Italian. *The New York Symposium Each fall since 2011, the Nida School of Translation Studies has convened a high-level research symposium in New York City, seeking to bring into dialogue varied perspectives on an established theme in translation. At each gathering, two preeminent authorities in the field present their research and observations; two equally distinguished scholars are invited to respond. From September 2015, FUSP will be responsible for the organisation of this high-profile event.

Description The height of the shell attains 41 mm, its diameter 15 mm. (Original description) The biconic shell is attenuated in front, slightly swelling in front of the shoulder, which is sharply carinate. The spire is low and consists of about eight whorls without the (lost) protoconch. The summit of the whorls between the suture and the carina is excavated and smooth. The walls of the shell are rather thin. The outer lip is nearly straight. The ground-color is yellowish white covered with a thin smooth yellowish periostracum. The pattern of fluctuating longitudinal streaks of yellowish brown, which by their zigzag direction and anastomosis leave roughly triangular patches of white of small size all over the shell, except in the middle, where a tendency to the usual paler girdle is manifest. Near the siphonal canal there are about sixteen paired prominent spiral threads, the intervals between the pairs being more or less channeled.

Soft-Shed Kisses: Re-visioning the Femme Fatale in English Poetry of the 19th Century, Cambridge Scholars Publishing, p. 15. from a masculine, heterosexual perspective that presents and represents women as sexual objects for the pleasure of the male viewer. In the visual and aesthetic presentations of narrative cinema, the male gaze has three perspectives: (i) that of the man behind the camera, (ii) that of the male characters within the film's cinematic representations; and (iii) that of the spectator gazing at the image. The film critic Laura Mulvey coined the term male gaze, which is conceptually contrasted with and opposed by the female gaze. As a way of seeing women and the world, the psychology of the male gaze is comparable to the psychology of scopophilia, the pleasure of looking; thus, the terms scopophilia and scoptophilia identify both the aesthetic pleasures and the sexual pleasures derived from looking at someone or something.  Background  The existentialist philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre introduced the concept of le regard, the gaze, in Being and Nothingness (1943), wherein the act of gazing at another human being creates a subjective power difference, which is felt by the gazer and by the gazed, because the person being gazed at is perceived as an object, not as a human being. The cinematic concept of the male gaze is presented, explained, and developed in the essay \\"Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema\\" (1975), in which Laura Mulvey proposes that sexual inequality ‚Äî the asymmetry of social and political power between men and women ‚Äî is a controlling social force in the cinematic representations of the sexes; and that the male gaze (the aesthetic pleasure of the male viewer) is a social construct derived from the ideologies and discourses of patriarchy. Preview. Also available as: Pdf via Amherst College. In the fields of media studies and feminist film theory, the male gaze is conceptually related to the behaviours of voyeurism (looking as sexual pleasure), scopophilia (pleasure from looking), and narcissism (pleasure from contemplating one's self). In a narrative film, the visual perspective of the male gaze is the sight-line of the camera as the spectator's perspective ‚Äî that of a heterosexual man whose sight lingers upon the features of a woman's body. Essay about the male gaze in advertising. In narrative cinema, the male gaze usually displays the female character (woman, girl, child) on two levels of eroticism: (i) as an erotic object of desire for the characters in the filmed story; and (ii) as an erotic object of desire for the male viewer (spectator) of the filmed story. Such visualizations establish the roles of dominant-male and dominated-female, by representing the female as a passive object for the male gaze of the active viewer. The social pairing of the passive-object (woman) and the active-viewer (man) is a functional basis of patriarchy, i.e., gender roles that are culturally reinforced in and by the aesthetics (textual, visual, representational) of mainstream, commercial cinema; the movies of which feature the male gaze as more important than the female gaze, an aesthetic choice based upon the inequality of socio-political power between men and women. As an ideological basis of patriarchy, socio- political inequality is realised as a value system, by which male-created institutions (e.g the movie business, advertising, fashion) unilaterally determine what is \\"natural and normal\\" in society. In time, the people of a society believe that the artificial values of patriarchy, as a social system, are the \\"natural and normal\\" order of things in society, because men look at women and women are looked at by men; hence the Western hierarchy of \\"inferior women\\" and \\"superior men\\" derives from misrepresenting men and women as sexual opponents, rather than as sexual equals. Concepts Gazing male, detail of English pew group, 1740s Scopophilia Two forms of the male gaze are based upon the Freudian concept of scopophilia, the \\"pleasure that is linked to sexual attraction (voyeurism in the extreme) and [the] scopophilic pleasure that is linked to narcissistic identification (the introjection of ideal egos)\\", which show how women have been forced to view the cinema from the perspectives (sexual, aesthetic, cultural) of the male gaze. In such cinematic representations, the male gaze denies the female's agency and human identity, thus dehumanizing a woman, from person to object, to be considered only for her beauty, physique, and sex appeal, as defined in the male sexual fantasy of narrative cinema. Spectatorship Two types of spectatorship occur whilst viewing a film, wherein the viewer either unconsciously or consciously engages in the typical, ascribed societal roles of men and women. In relation to phallocentrism, a film can be viewed from the perspectives of \\"three different looks\\": (i) the first look is that of the camera, which records the events of the film; (ii) the second look describes the nearly voyeuristic act of the audience as they view the film proper; and (iii) the third look is that of the characters who interact with one another throughout the filmed story. The perspective common to the three types of look is the idea that looking generally is perceived as the active role of the male, while being looked-at generally is perceived as the passive role of the female. Therefore, based upon that patriarchal construction, the cinema presents and represents women as objects of desire, wherein women characters have an \\"appearance coded for strong visual and erotic impact\\"; therefore, the actress is never meant to represent a decisive female character whose actions directly affect the outcome of the plot or impel the events of the filmed story, but, instead, she is in the film to visually support the actor, portraying the male protagonist, by \\"bearing the burden of sexual objectification\\", a condition unbearable for the actor. A woman being the passive object of the male gaze is the link to scopophilia, to the aesthetic pleasure derived from looking at someone as an object of beauty. As an expression of sexuality, scopophilia refers to the pleasure (sensual and sexual) derived from looking at sexual fetishes and photographs, pornography and naked bodies, etc. There are two categories of pleasurable viewing: (i) voyeurism, wherein the viewer's pleasure is in looking at another person from a distance, and he or she projects fantasies, usually sexual, onto the gazed upon person; and (ii) narcissism, wherein the viewer's pleasure is in self-recognition when viewing the image of another person. That in order to enjoy a film as a woman, or as a person of any gender other than the male gender, women must learn to identify with the male protagonist and assume his perspective, the male gaze. In the genre of action films, the dramaturg Wendy Arons said that the hyper-sexualization of female characters symbolically diminishes the threat of emasculation posed by violent women, hence: \\"The focus on the [woman's] body ‚Äî as a body in ostentatious display of breasts, legs, and buttocks ‚Äî does mitigate the threat that women pose to 'the very fabric of . . . society', by reassuring the [male] viewer of his male privilege, as the possessor of the objectifying [male] gaze.\\" The female gaze The female gaze is conceptually equal to the male gaze; that is, when women objectify a person, they view other people, and themselves, from the perspective of a man. The male gaze is a manifestation of unequal social power, between the gazing man and the gazed-upon woman; and also is a conscious or subconscious social effort to develop gender inequality in service to a patriarchical sexual order. From either perspective, a woman who welcomes the sexual objectification of the male gaze might be perceived as conforming to social norms established for the benefit of men, thereby reinforcing the objectifying power of the male gaze upon woman; or, she might be perceived as an exhibitionist woman taking social advantage of the sexual objectification inherent to the male gaze, in order to manipulate the sexist norms of the patriarchy to her personal benefit. Mulvey said that the female gaze is analogous to the male gaze, because \\"the male figure cannot bear the burden of sexual objectification. Man is reluctant to gaze at his exhibitionist like.\\" In describing the relationships between the characters of the novel Wide Sargasso Sea (1966), by Jean Rhys, Nalini Paul said that when the character of Antoinette gazes at Rochester, and places a garland upon him, she makes him appear heroic, yet: \\"Rochester does not feel comfortable with having this role enforced upon him; thus, he rejects it by removing the garland, and crushing the flowers.\\" From the male perspective, a man possesses the gaze because he is a man, whereas a woman possesses the gaze only when she assumes the role of a man, and thus possesses the male gaze when she objectifies other people, by gazing at them as would a man. Eva-Maria Jacobsson concurs with Paul's description of the female gaze as \\"a mere cross- identification with masculinity\\", yet evidence of women's sexual objectification of men ‚Äî the existence of a discrete female gaze ‚Äî can be found in the boy toy adverts in teen magazines. Despite Mulvey's contention that \\"the gaze\\" is a property of one gender or if the female gaze merely is an internalized male gaze remains indeterminate: \\"First, that the 1975 article 'Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema' was written as a polemic, and, as Mandy Merck has described it, as a manifesto; so I had no interest in modifying the argument. Clearly, I think, in retrospect, from a more nuanced perspective, [the article is] about the inescapability of the male gaze.\\" Moreover, in the power dynamics of human relationships, the gazer can gaze upon members of the same gender for asexual reasons, such as comparing the gazer's body image and clothing to the body and clothes of the gazed-upon person.  Criticism  Matrixial gaze Bracha Ettinger criticized the male gaze with the matrixial gaze, which is inoperative when the male gaze is opposite to the female gaze, wherein both perspectives constitute each other from a lack, which is the Lacanian definition of \\"The Gaze\\". The matrixial gaze does not concern a subject and its object existing or lacking, but concerns \\"trans- subjectivity\\" and shareability, and is based upon the feminine-matrixial- difference, which escapes the phallic opposition of masculine‚Äìfeminine, and is produced by co-emergence. Parting from Lacan's latter work, Ettinger's perspective is about the structure of the Lacanian subject, itself, which is deconstructed, and thus produces a perspective of feminine dimension with a hybrid, floating matrixial gaze. Seeing the nude woman Red Nude (1917), by Amedeo Modigliani, the woman's pose and facial expression indicate her awareness of the male gaze of the spectator for whom the artwork was created.Berger, John Ways of Seeing (1972) pp. 45, 47. In the television series and book Ways of Seeing (1972), the art critic John Berger addressed the sexual objectification of women in the arts by emphasizing that men look and women are looked-at as the subjects of art. For the purposes of art-as- spectacle, men act and women are acted-upon according to the social conditions of spectatorship, which are determined by the artistic and aesthetic conventions of objectification, which artists have not transcended. Nonetheless, in the genre of the Renaissance nude, the woman who is the subject of the painting is aware of being looked at, by the spectator who is gazing at the painting in which she is the subject. In the production of art, the conventions of artistic representation connect the objectification of a woman, by the male gaze, to the Lacanian theory of social alienation ‚Äî the psychological splitting that occurs from seeing one's self as one is, and seeing one's self as an idealized representation. In Italian Renaissance painting, especially in the nude-woman genre, that perceptual split arises from being both the viewer and the viewed, and from seeing one's self through the gaze of other people. The female gaze The cultural analyst Griselda Pollock said that the female gaze can be visually negated; * Abridgement available at: Pdf. using the example of Robert Doisneau's photograph Sidelong Glance (1948) Pollock describes a bourgeois, middle-aged couple viewing artworks in the display window of an art gallery. In the photograph, the spectator's perspective is from inside the art gallery. The couple are looking in directions different from that of the spectator. The woman is speaking to her husband about a painting at which she is gazing, whilst her distracted husband is gazing at a painting of a nude woman, which also is in view of the spectator. The woman is looking at another artwork, which is not in view of the spectator. The man's gaze has found someone more interesting to gaze at, thus ignoring his wife's comment. Pollock's analysis of the Sidelong Glance photograph is that: \\"She [the wife] is contrasted, iconographically, to the naked woman. She is denied the picturing of her desire; what she looks at is blank for the spectator. She is denied being the object of desire, because she is represented as a woman who actively looks, rather than [as a woman passively] returning and confirming the gaze of the masculine spectator.\\" In \\"Watching the Detectives: The Enigma of the Female Gaze\\" (1989), Lorraine Gamman said that the female gaze is distinguished from the male gaze through its displacement of the power of scopophilia, which creates the possibility of multiple viewing angles, because \\"the female gaze cohabits the space occupied by men, rather than being entirely divorced from it\\"; therefore, the female gaze does not appropriate the \\"voyeurism\\" of the male gaze, because its purpose is to disrupt the phallocentric power of the male gaze, by providing other modes of looking at someone. In \\"Networks of Remediation\\" (1999), Jay David Bolter and Richard Grusin said that Mulvey's male gaze coincides with \\"the desire for visual immediacy\\" ‚Äî the erasure of the visual medium for uninhibited interaction with the person portrayed ‚Äî which is identified in feminist film theory as the \\"male desire that takes an overt sexual meaning when the object of representation, and therefore desire, is a woman.\\" Bolter and Grusin proposed the term hypermediacy ‚Äî drawing the spectator's attention to the medium (or media) and to the process of mediation present in an artwork ‚Äî to be a form of the female gaze, because it \\"is multiple and deviant in its suggestion of multiplicity ‚Äî a multiplicity of viewing positions, and a multiplicity of relationships, to the object in view, including sexual objects\\"; thus, like the female gaze, hypermediacy disrupts the myopic and monolithic male gaze, by offering more angles of viewing. Photographer Farhat Basir Khan said that the female gaze is inherent to photographs taken by a woman, which perspective negates the stereotypical the male-gaze perspective inherent to \\"male-constructed\\" photographs, which, in the history of art, have presented and represented women as objects, rather than as persons. The female gaze was the subject of the Feminigraphy exhibition, curated by Khan, at the Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts in January 2017.  Oppositional gaze  In the essay \\"The Oppositional Gaze: Black Female Spectators\\" (1997) bell hooks argues that Black women are placed outside the \\"pleasure in looking\\" by being excluded as subjects of the male gaze. From her interpretation of Mulvey's essay \\"Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema\\" (1975), hooks said that \\"from a standpoint that acknowledges race, one sees clearly why Black women spectators, not duped by mainstream cinema, would develop an oppositional gaze\\" to the male gaze. In relation to Lacan's mirror stage, during which a child develops the capacity for self-recognition, and thus the ideal ego, the oppositional gaze functions as a form of looking back, in search of the Black female body within the cinematic idealization of white womanhood. In the context of feminist theory, the absence of discussion of racial relations, within the \\"totalizing category [of] Women\\", is a process of denial which refutes the reality that the criticism of many feminist film critics concerns only the cinematic presentation and representation of white women. In the course of being interviewed by hooks, a working-class Black woman said that \\"to see black women in the position [that] white women have occupied in film forever . . .\\", is to see a transfer without transformation; therefore, the oppositional gaze encompasses intellectual resistance, and understanding and awareness of the politics of race and of racism via cinematic whiteness, inclusive of the male gaze.

The festival takes place in early April to celebrate the heritage and community of the county of Gloucester, as well as its heritage of daffodils. Gloucester's historic production of daffodils led it to become named the \\"Daffodil Capital of America\\". It offers many aspects including scholarships, contests for Daffodil Queen and a parade. Approximately 8,000 people attend the festival every year. From 1937 to 1941, a Daffodil Festival attracted tourists to the area to see the vast acres of yellow blossoms. In March 1942 the organizing committee suspended the festivities due to the war. It resumed 45 years later. History In 1651 Gloucester County was formed from part of York County. This flower began to grow around the county soon after. Gloucester County earned the title of \\"Daffodil Capital of America\\" in the 1930s and 1940s. Daffodil farms sprouted with bulbs imported from other countries. Gloucester was featured in the National Geographictwice with pictures of townsfolk and daffodils. After World War II, a decline in growth occurred followed by a resurgence of daffodil production. This frenzy led to over-production and the eventual decline of daffodil production.Ray, 1991 Scholarships The Daffodil Festival offers one four-year, renewable scholarship worth $100. The scholarship is awarded to a graduating senior from Gloucester High School. Past winners include Trip Vaughn, Sam Markwith and Kasey Koulhurst. Students selected for these scholarships have to meet certain requirements. The criteria include a five hundred word essay, academic achievement, community involvement, and school activities and employment. Scholarship awards are announced during the festival's opening ceremony.  Daffodil Queen  The Daffodil Queen is a parade staple and fulfills various responsibilities throughout the year, such as attending county meetings and other public events. Past winners include Nicolle Conry and Christine Riddett.  Parade  The Daffodil Festival involves groups and organizations across Gloucester, such as the Boy Scouts of Gloucester, The Masonic Lodge, The Gloucester High School Band, and the Gloucester High School NJROTC Program.  Vendors  Entertainment and vendors can include storytellers, magicians, musicians, and bands. Vendor categories are Fine Arts & Photography, Original Handcrafts, Merchandisers and Certified Vendor.

Mesrop was born in the Ottoman Empire but eventually lived in Isfahan, Persia, where he contributed in the making of manuscripts for bibles and gospels for four decades. He was also a scribe, clerk, teacher, doctor of theology, restorer and binder. His manuscripts have been displayed in museums throughout the world and are found in many prestigious libraries. Life Mesrop of Khizan was born to Armenian parents in circa 1560 and is believed to be from the region of Khizan (now known as Hizan) near Lake Van located in the Ottoman Empire. The Armenians of Khizan were noted for illuminated manuscript making and would later be regarded as the Khizan School of art. After Abbas I of Persia defeated the Ottoman Empire around Lake Van, he forcibly relocated many Armenians of the region to his new capital of Isfahan in 1604. After the family had moved, Mesrop's father Martiros, who was a painter himself, continued to teach his son how to paint in the early stages of his life. Mesrop of Khizan's career spans four decades, with his last known artwork dated in 1651. Works Among the first works of Mesrop is the Gospel of 1608. The first manuscript was done for a priest named Khatchatur and received many sponsors from various wealthy Armenians. This was soon followed by the Gospel of 1609, which is part of the Bodleian Library, the main research library of the University of Oxford. The Gospel of 1609 contains lamentations of the fall of Armenia under Shah Abbas: Art historian Alice Taylor describes Mesrop's work as \\"less lively\\" than other contemporaneous Khizan painters, but his \\"settings are charged with life and energy\\". In one such painting, The Baptism of Christ, Jesus Christ is featured stepping on the head of a dragon that is swimming in a river. The scene around the baptized Christ is beneath a sky that appears to be melting, and a dove, symbolizing the Holy Spirit, entering the soul of Christ from above of his head. Saint John the Evangelist, a painting done in 1615 that is now part of the J. Paul Getty Museum, features John the Apostle receiving the word of God through a ray of blue light. John is surrounded by yellow light and elongated figures. About thirty manuscripts done by Mesrob of Khizan survive today.

Only three candidates participated: outgoing Vice President and Acting President Alexander Ankvab, outgoing Prime Minister Sergei Shamba and opposition leader Raul Khajimba. Shamil Adzynba was picked by Shamba as his Vice Presidential candidate. The pair was nominated by an initiative group on 8 July and applied for registration on 16 July.

Norm is a student dressed in appropriate Charlotte 49ers athletics uniforms with a headpiece. Norm made his debut in 1962 after a student vote in November 1961 to change the mascot, with periodic updates to design and wardrobe occurring in the years since. Norm is rarely seen without his trusty pick-axe and never takes his slouch hat off. As a member of the spirit squad, Norm the Niner travels with the cheerleaders to away athletics events, to many events around the university and often makes appearances around Charlotte and the surrounding region. History The nickname \\"49ers\\" derives from the fact that the university's predecessor, Charlotte Center of the University of North Carolina (CCUNC - established in 1946) was saved from being shut down by the state in 1949 by Bonnie Ethel Cone, when the Charlotte Center became Charlotte College. Due to this \\"49er spirit\\" that Cone felt embodied the University, referring to the settlers that endured much hardships in traveling across the United States to seek fortune in the California Gold Rush, students of the fledgling UNC Charlotte chose \\"49ers\\" as the school's mascot. The fact that the site of the U.S.'s first major gold discovery, Reed's Gold Mine, is located nearby may also be a contributing factor to the nickname. The fact that the University's Main Campus front entrance is located on North Carolina Highway 49 is pure coincidence. Prior to the \\"49ers\\" moniker, the athletic teams were known as the \\"Owls\\" due to CCUNC's beginnings as a night school.

Most of these bulbs are reproductions of the wound filament bulbs made popular by Edison Electric Light Company at the turn of the 20th century. They are easily identified by the long and complicated windings of their internal filaments, and by the very warm-yellow glow of the light they produce (many of the bulbs emit light at a color temperature of 2200‚Äì2400K).  History  Original carbon-filament bulb from Thomas Edison's shop in Menlo Park Light bulbs with a carbon filament were first demonstrated by Joseph Swan in February 1879, and by Edison in October 1879. Carbon filament bulbs, the first electric light bulbs, became available commercially in 1879. In 1904 a tungsten filament was invented by Austro-Hungarians Alexander Just and Franjo Hanaman, and was more efficient and longer-lasting than the carbonized bamboo filament used previously. The introduction of a neutral gas to the glass envelope (or bulb) also helped to improve lifespan and brightness of the bulb. To produce enough light, these lamps required the use of extremely long filaments, and remained so until the development of more efficiently wound tungsten filaments.  Resurgence  A glowing vintage light bulb of \\"ST\\" shape While the intricate filament design never fully left, innovations in energy efficiency outpaced the highly inefficient design quickly. Still, 51 years after more efficient designs had come into play, \\"Edison-style\\" or vintage lights saw resurgence in many businesses and homes wanting atmospheric lighting or vintage themes. Reproductions of the antique bulbs began in the 1980s by Bob Rosenzweig. He began selling the vintage-style light bulbs after watching a salvage operation. The reproductions were sold mostly to collectors and prop houses until the turn of the 21st century, when new regulations banned low-efficiency lighting in many countries. Domestic lighting shifted toward more efficient compact fluorescent lamps and LED lights, but demand for vintage bulbs also increased. Edison-style light bulbs are exempted from the ban in most places as \\"specialty lighting\\". Modern \\"Edison light bulbs\\" are designed to replicate the same light color and bulb shape to offer a more energy-efficient version of the popular vintage reproduction bulbs. (Modern tungsten coils are already more efficient.) These bulbs also maintain the same \\"exposed\\" look to further preserve the vintage reproduction style, and often employ the \\"ST\\" long-pear bulb shape for the same reason. LED filament bulbs have multiple light- emitting filaments within the glass lens, reminiscent of, though not always identical to, antique bulbs. LED bulbs, including LED filament types, are much more energy-efficient than any incandescent lighting. US inventor Robert (Bob) Kyp patented light bulbs under the name Balafire,Scientific demo with the Balafire Flicker Bulb (video) and radiometers; the company he ran since 1964, Kyp-Go,Kyp-Go Web site (discontinued, archived) is the only US manufacturer of carbon-filament bulbs, which have been used in a commercial.7-Up Commercial with the Balafire Flicker Bulb References Category:Types of lamp ","title":"Edison light bulb"},{"id":"45698535","text":"Dagalaifus was a Roman army officer of Germanic descent.

He was inducted into the Massachusetts Broadcasters Hall of Fame in 2007. Benzaquin was born and raised in Quincy, Massachusetts. His father was a grain merchant, his civic-minded mother a founder of the local chapter of the League of Women Voters. After high school, he attended a seminary in Bangor, Maine, for a year. He served with the 37th Infantry Division during World War II on Bougainville and in the Philippines, and was awarded the Bronze Star. Benzaquin then embarked on a journalism career in 1948 at the Boston Globe. He wrote the 1959 nonfiction bestseller Holocaust! about the Cocoanut Grove fire which uncovered malfeasance on the part of the nightclub's employees. Shortly after that he moved to radio broadcasting, starting in September 1960 at WEEI, where he soon afterward announced Logan Airport's first air disaster, the October 1960 crash of a Lockheed Electra. He later worked at most of Boston's big news stations: WHDH, WBZ and WRKO, also writing a column for the Boston Herald Traveler from 1964 to 1969. He was one of the first radio broadcasters to be suspended, in 1968, for uttering a profanity on the air. He spent a year at Chicago station WLS-TV, but returned to Boston in 1971. In the 1970s, as an outspoken feminist, Mr. Benzaquin became interested in early childhood development and produced a long-running series for WEEI called \\"Being a Baby\\". The broadcasts featured his reporting on a group of babies from Marshfield, Massachusetts, and also featured experts such as Harvard psychologist Burton White. He later hosted a late-night television talk show on WBZ-TV. He announced his retirement in 1989, but then returned to work at WRKO from 1992 to 1996. In 1983, he was sued by a Massachusetts State Trooper for defamation following a traffic stop, which Benzaquin then described on the air. He won the suit when the judge ruled that Benzaquin's characterization of the offer, using various derogatory terms such as \\"absolute barbarian\\", \\"reprehensible\\" and \\"merciless\\", constituted mere vulgar abuse and hyperbole, and therefore First Amendment protected speech. Benzaquin, a longtime resident of Marshfield, was married to Barbara J. Benzaquin for more than 25 years. This ended in divorce, and he later married the former Grace Abrams. He had two sons and a daughter.

Life George S. A. Da Costa was born in Lagos in 1853. He was educated at the CMS Grammar School, Lagos. From 1877 to 1895 he managed the Church Mission Society Bookshop in Lagos. In 1895 he invested ¬£30.00 in special training and then opened a photography business in Lagos. He had a thriving business in the 1890s that continued into the next century. Da Costa worked as a photographer for the colonial government of Nigeria, and took many pictures that recorded government activities throughout the country, including the North. These included pictures of the construction of the railway from Lagos through Jebba to Kaduna. His studio in 1920 was at 18 Ricca Street, Lagos. He worked for Allister Macmillan that year, taking photographs for the Red Book of West Africa. Macmillan called him \\"the ablest and best known professional photographer in Nigeria\\". 52 of his photographs appeared in the Red Book, seven taken in Kano and the others in Lagos. George Da Costa died in 1929. Work Da Costa's work depicts a West Africa that is far from the image of the \\"dark continent\\" held by Europeans and Americans at the time.

Early life Hakimi was born in Iran. At the age of five, his father died, forcing Hakimi to leave school to work to support his family. He found work in Iran grinding discarded window glass into lenses for magnifying glasses and eyeglasses. This experience taught him much about the techniques and equipment needed by an optician. At 14, Hakimi attended night school to complete his elementary education, learning to read and write. Later, following service in the Iranian navy, he immigrated first to Germany and then to Switzerland, where he furthered his education in the optician's craft. Career Hakimi finally settled in Toronto, Ontario, Canada where he found work in the field of ophthalmic lens grinding. He saved his money until he could start his own shop. In 1967, Hakimi opened his own lens-grinding laboratory in the former Elwood Hotel in Toronto, buying and rebuilding equipment from a shuttered facility in Chicago. At first, he sold his lenses door-to-door, directly to optician shops. Soon he was able to save enough money to open his first retail shop, selling glasses by day and working nights to fulfil orders. At first, Hakimi offered glasses for $8/pair ($12 for bifocals), which far undersold any competitors. He was able to raise his prices 50% from this starting point while still underselling his competitors and assuring continued demand for his glasses. From this beginning as a single retail outlet, Hakimi has built Hakim Optical into a national chain of over 150 outlets with over 600 employees serving the eastern provinces of Canada.

Its symmetry is classified by the molecular point group Ih. Synthesis and reactions The existence of the dodecaborate(12) anion, [B12H12]2-, was predicted by H. C. Longuet-Higgins and M. de V. Roberts in 1955. Hawthorne and Pitochelli first made it 5 years later, by the reaction of iododecarborane with triethylamine in benzene solution at 80 ¬∞C. It is more conveniently prepared in two steps from sodium borohydride. First the borohydride is converted into a triborate anion using the etherate of boron trifluoride: : 5 NaBH4 \\\\+ BF3 ‚Üí 2 NaB3H8 \\\\+ 3 NaF + 2 H2 Pyrolysis of the triborate gives the twelve boron cluster as the sodium salt. A variety of other synthetic methods have been published. Salts of the dodecaborate ion are stable in air and do not react with hot aqueous sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid. The anion can be electrochemically oxidised to [B24H23]3‚àí. Substituted derivatives Salts of B12H undergo hydroxylation with hydrogen peroxide to give salts of [B12(OH)12]2‚àí. The hydrogen atoms in the ion [B12H12]2- can be replaced by the halogens with various degrees of substitution. The following numbering scheme is used to identify the products. The first boron atom is numbered 1, then the closest ring of five atoms around it is numbered anticlockwise from 2 to 6. The next ring of boron atoms is started from 7 for the atoms closest to number 2 and 3, and counts anticlockwise to 11. The atom opposite the original is numbered 12. A related derivative is [B12(CH3)12]2‚àí. The icosahedron of boron atoms is aromatic in nature. Under kilobar pressure of carbon monoxide [B12H12]2‚àí reacts to form the carbonyl derivatives [B12H11CO]‚àí and the 1,12- and 1,7-isomers of B12H10(CO)2. The para disubstitution at the 1,12 is unusual. In water the dicarbonyls appear to form carboxylic ions: [B12H10(CO)CO2H]‚àí and [B12H10(CO2H)2]2‚àí.  Potential applications  Compounds based on the ion [B12H12]2‚àí have been evaluated for solvent extraction of the radioactive ions 152Eu3+ and 241Am3+. [B12H12]2‚àí, [B12(OH)12]2‚àí and [B12(OMe)12]2‚àí show promise for use in drug delivery. They form \\"closomers,\\" which have been used to make nontargeted high-performance MRI contrast agents which are persistent in tumor tissue. Salts of [B12H12]2‚àí are potential therapeutic agents in cancer treatment. For applications in boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT), derivatives of closo-dodecaborate increase the specificity of neutron irradiation treatment. Neutron irradiation converts nonradioactive dodecaborate containing 10B to 11B, which upon fission process emits an alpha particle near the tumor.

Sneyd was born in Bath in 1751, and following the death of her mother in 1756 was raised by Canon Thomas Seward and his wife Elizabeth in Lichfield, Staffordshire until she returned to her father's house in 1771. There, she formed a close friendship with their daughter, Anna Seward. Having had a romantic engagement to John Andr√© and having declined the hand of Thomas Day, she married Richard Edgeworth as his second wife in 1773, living on the family estate in Ireland till 1776. There she helped raise his children from his first marriage, including Maria Edgeworth, and two children of her own. Returning to England she fell ill with tuberculosis, which was incurable, dying at Weston in Staffordshire in 1780. She is the subject of a number of Anna Seward's poems, and with her husband developed concepts of childhood education, resulting in a series of books, such as Practical Education, based on her observations of the Edgeworth children. She is known for her stand on women's rights through her vigorous rejection of the proposal by Day, in which she outlined her views on equality in marriage.  Life   Early life 1751‚Äì1773  Honora Sneyd was born the third daughter to Edward Sneyd who lived in Bishton, Staffordshire and Susanna Cook of Sible Hedingham, Essex, in Bath in 1751. Her father was a Major in the Royal Horse Guards, with an appointment at Court as a Gentleman Usher. her parents married in 1742 and she was one of eight children and the second surviving daughter of six, and only six years old when her mother died in 1757. Her father found himself unable to take care of all of his children and various friends and relations then offered to take them in. = Adoption by the Seward family 1756‚Äì1771 = Honora Sneyd, who was seven years younger than the thirteen-year-old Anna Seward, moved into the home of family friends, Canon Thomas Seward and his wife Elizabeth and their family at Lichfield, Staffordshire, where they lived in the Bishop's Palace in the Cathedral Close. The Sewards had lost five children after their first two daughters, and such fostering was not uncommon at the time. There she was brought up by the Sewards as one of their own, being variously described as an adopted or foster sister. Anna Seward describes how she and her younger sister Sarah first met Honora, on returning from a walk, in her poem The Anniversary (1769). Initially Honora was more attached to Sarah, to whom she was closer in age, but Sarah died of typhus at the age of nineteen (1764), when Honora Sneyd was thirteen. Following Sarah's death Honora became the responsibility of Anna, the older sister. Anna consoled herself with her affection for Honora Sneyd, as she describes in Visions, written a few days after her sister's death. In the poem she expresses the hope that Honora ('this transplanted flower') will replace her sister (whom she refers to as 'Alinda') in her and her parents' affections. Throughout her life Honora Sneyd's health was fragile, experiencing the first bout of the tuberculosis that would later claim her life in 1766, at the age of fifteen. However, Anna Seward believed she detected the first signs in 1764, at thirteen, writing presciently > This dear child will not live; I am perpetually fearing it, notwithstanding > the clear health which crimsons her cheek and glitters in her eyes. Such > early expansion of intelligence and sensibility partakes too much of the > angelic, too little of the mortal nature, to tarry long in these low abodes > of frailty and of pain, where the harshness of authority, and the > impenetrability of selfishness, with the worse mischiefs of pride and envy, > so frequently agitate by their storms, and chill by their damps, the more > ingenious and purer spirits, scattered, not profusely, over the earth. = Education = At Lichfield Honora Sneyd came under the influence of Canon Seward, who raised her, and his progressive views on female education, which he expressed in his poem The Female Right to Literature (1748). She was described as clever and interested in science, From Anna she developed a great love of literature. Honora Sneyd was an accomplished scholar, attending day school in Lichfield where she became fluent in French, translating Rousseau's Julie for her older foster sister. Though Canon Seward's (but not his wife's) attitudes towards the education of girls was progressive relative to the times, they were \\"by no means excessively liberal\\". Amongst the subjects he taught them were theology and numeracy, and how to read, appreciate, write and recite poetry. Although this deviated from what were considered \\"conventional drawing room accomplishments\\", he encouraged them away from traditional female roles. However, the omissions were also notable, including languages and science, although they were left free to pursue their own inclinations in this regard. To that end they were exposed to the circle of learned men who frequented the Bishop's Palace at Lichfield where they lived, and which became the centre of a literary circle including, David Garrick, Erasmus Darwin, Samuel Johnson and James Boswell. The children were encouraged to participate in the conversations, as Anna later relates. = Relationships = Honora Sneyd and Anna Seward lived under the same roof for thirteen years and formed a close friendship which has given rise to much speculation as to its exact nature, located as it was within the tradition of \\"female friendship\\", and forming the basis of a body of Anna Seward's poetical works. Various authors differ in their interpretation of the relationship between the two women, with Lillian Faderman who first suggested that it was lesbian, supported by Barrett although the term relates more to twentieth- rather than eighteenth-century concepts of identity. On the other hand, Teresa Barnard argues against this based more on examination of the correspondence rather than poetry, which is generally based within the lesbian poetic canon, the relationship between these two women being frequently cited. Sneyd had a reputation for both intelligence and beauty, as commented on by many, including Anna Seward and Richard Edgeworth (see below). In 1764 Seward described Sneyd as \\"fresh and beautiful as the young day-star, when he bathes his fair beams in the dews of spring\\". At seventeen Honora Sneyd was briefly engaged to a Swiss born Derbyshire merchant, John Andr√©, a relationship that Seward had fostered, and wrote about in her Monody on Major Andr√© (1781) when Andr√© became a British officer in 1771 and was hanged as a spy by the Americans. The respective parents did not support this attachment for reasons of his financial status. Around Christmas 1770, Thomas Day and Richard Edgeworth, who like Thomas Seward were members of the Lunar Society that met in Lichfield amongst other places, were spending increasing amounts of time at the Seward household and both had fallen for Sneyd, although Edgeworth was already married. In 1771 she declined an offer of marriage from Thomas Day. Edgeworth gives an account of her letter of rejection stating that it \\"contained an excellent answer to his [Day's] arguments in favour of the rights of men, and a clear dispassionate view of the rights of women\\". Edgeworth continues that Sneyd had very determined views on the role of women and their rights within marriage. > Miss Honora Sneyd would not admit the unqualified control of a husband over > all her actions; she did not feel, that seclusion from society was > indispensably necessary to preserve female virtue, or to secure domestic > happiness. Upon terms of reasonable equality, she supposed, that mutual > confidence might best subsist; she said, that, as Mr Day had decidedly > declared his determination to live in perfect seclusion from what is usually > called the world, it was fit she should decidedly declare, that she would > not change her present mode of life, with which she had no reason to be > dissatisfied, for any dark and untried system, that could be proposed to > her. However, Honora Sneyd's father moved to Lichfield from London in 1771, and reassembled his family of five daughters there. By now Honora was nineteen and Anna viewed her friend's departure with considerable dismay. Although Day was much distressed by his rejection by Honora Sneyd, he transferred his affections to the fifth daughter, Elizabeth Sneyd, who had been in the care of Mr Henry Powys and his wife, Susannah Sneyd, of the Abbey, Shrewsbury, Mrs. Powys being Mr Sneyd's niece. However, Elizabeth Sneyd was not inclined to accept Day. Richard Edgeworth comments on how Honora Sneyd had affected him; > During this intercourse I perceived the superiority of Miss Honora Sneyd's > capacity ... her sentiments were on all subjects so just and were delivered > with such blushing modesty though not without an air of conscious worth as > to command attention from every one capable of appreciating female > excellence. Her person was graceful her features beautiful and their > expression such as to heighten the eloquence of every thing she said. I was > six and twenty and now for the first time in my life I saw a woman that > equalled the picture of perfection which existed in my imagination. He continued, describing the unhappiness of his marriage, and how that made him vulnerable to her attributes, which were shared by all the learned gentlemen of his circle. He also believed that Anna Seward had noticed the effect her friend was having on him, and would regularly place her actions in the best light for his benefit. The elimination of Day as a suitor for Honora Sneyd's hand placed Edgeworth in a difficult situation and he resolved to end it by moving to Lyons France, to work, in the autumn of 1771.  Marriage to Richard Edgeworth 1773‚Äì1780  = Marriage and move to Ireland 1773‚Äì1776 = On 17 March 1773, Edgeworth's first wife Anna Maria Elers gave birth to their fifth child, Anna Maria Edgeworth, at the age of 29. Ten days later she died from puerperal fever. Edgeworth was still in Lyon to avoid temptation leaving his expectant wife in the care of Day. On learning of the death of his wife, Edgeworth travelled to London, where he consulted Day as to Honora Sneyd's situation. On learning that she remained in good health and unattached, he promptly headed to Lichfield to see Honora at the Sneyds, with the intention of proposing. His offer was accepted immediately, and there was no mention of the conventional waiting period before remarrying after widowhood. Although Mr. Sneyd was opposed to his daughter's marriage, the couple were married at Lichfield Cathedral on 17 July 1773, officiated by Canon Thomas Seward, Anna Seward being a bridesmaid. After marrying, problems with the Edgeworth family estates in Ireland required the couple to immediately move to Edgeworthstown, County Longford in Ireland. Through this marriage Sneyd became step-mother to Edgeworth's four surviving children by his first wife, Anna Maria, ranging from seven months to nine years in age; Richard, Maria, who became a writer in her own right, Emmeline and Anna Maria. On encountering her new family she observed that Maria, then aged five, was exhibiting behavioural problems, and expressed her views that speedy and consistent punishment were the keys to ensuring good behaviour in children, a view she proceeded to practice. However, she believed that such discipline needed to be imposed \\"before the age of 5 or 6\\", and was therefore rather late in the case of the older children; however, she imposed a strict discipline. Following a period of ill health on Sneyd's part, Maria Edgeworth was sent away to boarding school in Derby (1775‚Äì1781), and later London upon the death of Honora Sneyd (1781‚Äì1782). Similarly, her older brother Richard was sent to Charterhouse (1776‚Äì1778) and then went to sea, and she never saw him again. Later Richard Edgeworth would comment on how difficult the first two years were for Sneyd in her new role as stepmother to undisciplined children, a role her relatives had advised her against. Honora Sneyd was soon pregnant, giving birth to her daughter Honora on 30 May 1774, who died at the age of sixteen. Her second child, Lovell, who inherited the property, was born the following year on 30 June 1775. The Edgeworth children were raised according to the system of Rousseau, as refined and modified by the Edgeworths. Richard Edgeworth considered his early educational efforts a failure, the older children from his first marriage growing up unruly and then being sent away to school, and readily concurred with his new wife's stricter rules. However, he had seen very little of them in their early years. = Return to England 1776‚Äì1780 = After three years in Ireland, in 1776 they moved to England again, taking up residence in Northchurch,Hertfordshire Despite Anna Seward's despair at the loss of her friend, she and Honora had maintained regular correspondence and visits. However, these suddenly ceased, an event that Anna blamed Honora Sneyd's father for. During a temporary absence of Edgeworth on business in Ireland in the spring of 1779, Honora Sneyd fell ill with a fever, just as he was summoning her to let the house and join him there. On his return they consulted Dr. Erasmus Darwin at Lichfield, who was of the opinion the illness was more severe than at first thought, being a recurrence of consumption (T.B.) from which she had had a brief bout at the age of fifteen. He advised against returning to Ireland but rather, moving closer to Lichfield. For a while they stayed at the Sneyd house that was temporarily vacant while consulting a wide range of physicians including Dr. William Heberden (Samuel Johnson's physician), and even staying with Day near London to be close to medical care. but only received news of incurability. Eventually they rented Bighterton, near Shifnal, Shropshire, closer to the Sneyds, Darwin and others of their circle, where Honora Sneyd drew up her will in April.  Death  Four years after returning to England Honora Sneyd died of consumption at six in the morning on 1 May 1780 at Bighterton, surrounded by her husband, her youngest sister, Charlotte and a servant. Honora Sneyd was buried in the nearby Weston church where a plaque on the wall (see box) bears witness to her life. Honora Sneyd died within eight years of her marriage to Richard Edgeworth, at almost the same age as her predecessor. The same disease which had taken the life of her mother and five maternal aunts would soon claim the life of her young daughter, Honora Edgeworth (1790), as well as her younger sister, Elizabeth, seven years later (1797), as well as at least two of Elizabeth's children, Charlotte (1807) and Henry (1813). Honora's brother, Lovell was also affected by the consumption. At the time it was thought this was a hereditary weakness carried by the family. On Honora Sneyd's death, Edgeworth married her younger sister, Elizabeth Sneyd, stating that this had been the dying wish of Honora. Uglow speculates that this was a marriage of convenience, for the sake of the children. Although it was technically legal to marry one's wife's sister, the marriage was considered scandalous, and was opposed by the Sneyds, Sewards and Edgeworths as well as the Bishop. The couple fled to London where they were married on Christmas Day with Thomas Day as witness, before proceeding to live at Northchurch. The scandal may have given rise to less charitable interpretations of Edgeworth's actions, although there is no direct evidence to support or refute these. Honora Sneyd's will, drawn up during the last month of her life refers only to \\"that Woman whom he shall think worthy to call his, for her to wear, so long as they both shall LOVE\\", referring to a cameo she owned of Richard Edgeworth.  Work   Practical education  The Edgeworths jointly developed the concept of \\"Practical Education\\", a principle that would become a new paradigm by the 1820s. Having determined that after eight years, Richard Edgeworth's attempt to raise his eldest son Richard according to the principles of Rousseau was a failure, he and Honora were determined to find better methods. After the birth of Honora's first child (1774), the Edgeworths embarked on a plan, partly inspired by Anna Barbauld, to write a series of books for children. After trying many other methods, Barbauld's Lessons for Children from two to three years old was published in 1778, and the Edgeworths used it on Anna (5) and Honora (4), and were delighted to find that the girls learned to read in six weeks. Now back in England, at Northchurch the Edgeworths were in closer contact with the intellectuals of the Lunar society. Richard Edgeworth and Honora were determined to design a plan for the education of their children. They started by reviewing the existing literature on childhood education (including Locke, Hartley, Priestley in addition to Rousseau), and then proceeded to document their observations of the behaviour of children and then developed their own \\"practical\\" system. To this end Erasmus Darwin suggested they start by reading the work of Dugald Stewart. Honora Sneyd then started recording extensive notes on her observations of the Edgeworth children. These then became the dialogues in the final book. Richard and Maria Edgeworth state that \\"She [Honora] was of opinion that the art of education should be considered as an experimental science\\", and that the failures of the past were due to \\"following theory rather than practice\\". Richard Edgeworth and Honora then set about applying the emerging principles of educational psychology to the actual practice of education. From their reading of theory they determined that the reason Barbauld was successful was that the child's reading was rewarded (thus departing radically from Rousseau), because it was associated with pleasure. Honora Sneyd conceived of the title of their work therefore as Practical Education. With her husband, Honora wrote the first version of Practical Education as a children's book Practical education: or, the history of Harry and Lucy for Honora her daughter, which was begun in 1778 and privately published in February 1780 in Lichfield as Practical Education, vol 2. The book tells a simple story of two parents and their two model children, Harry and Lucy, who carry out domestic chores and ask their parents many questions, the answers to which may be deemed educational. The children explain their discoveries and how they learn, the whole presented as nine forms of learning. As originally conceived it was intended to be the second part of a series of three books, but the remaining parts remained unwritten. The original plan had been for a collaborative work, contributed to by various members of the Lunar Society. it was an ambitious project designed to fill what they perceived of as major deficiencies in the field of both technical and scientific education and to introduce early ideas on morality, science and other academic disciplines into the developing mind of the young child. After Honora Sneyd's premature death, her sister Elizabeth continued the work, in her role as the third wife of Richard Edgeworth. The final version of the book was authored by Richard and Maria Edgeworth and published after both Honora and her sister Elizabeth's deaths, in 1798, and further revised under Maria's name as Early lessons (1801‚Äì1825). In reality this was a family project contributed to by a number of their members that would extend over 50 years, beyond Richard Edgeworth's death in 1817 (c. 1774‚Äì1825). Richard Edgeworth observed on his wife's death that being familiar with the experimental method in science, she was surprised to find that educational theory was based on very little empirical evidence, and set out to apply experimental science to child education and devised, executed and recorded experiments with children. She conceived and executed a register (2 volumes 1778‚Äì1779) of the reaction of children to new knowledge and experience, given her interest in applying experimental science to the field of child education. She observed the questions that children asked, what they did, and how they solved problems. An extensive example of her recorded dialogue is given by Richard and Maria Edgeworth in \\"Practical Education\\". This formed the basis of Richard Edgeworth's Essays on professional education (1809). In the Bodleian Library there is a short story in manuscript dated 1787 and other fragments attributed to Honora Sneyd. Her parents' principles of childhood education were to be a profound influence on Maria Edgeworth's own career as a writer for children.  Other  Honora Sneyd, through her early contact with members of the Lunar Society, had always taken a keen interest in science, an attribute that drew the intention of Richard Edgeworth who considered himself an inventor. Following their marriage, she worked on his projects with him and in his words, \\"became an excellent theoretic mechanick\\" herself.  Legacy  Jasper medallion of Honora Sneyd by Wedgwood 1780, after an image by John Flaxman. Victoria and Albert Museum, London Since little of Honora Sneyd's own words have survived, our image of her is largely through the eyes of others, in particular Anna Seward and Richard Edgeworth. Honora Sneyd is often listed amongst the members or associates of the Bluestockings, educated upper class literary women who disdained traditional female accomplishments and often formed close female friendships. The depiction of the effect of consumption on her has been used as a symbol of the pervasiveness of the disease in eighteenth-century culture. The work she started on educational psychology would prove to be immensely influential throughout the nineteenth century. Her name is also inextricably entwined with that of Anna Seward in the literature of lesbian relationships and female friendship. From growing up in the Seward household with Canon Seward and the members of the Lunar Society, Honora Sneyd and her childhood friend Anna Seward developed relatively progressive views for the times on the status of women and equality in marriage, a key to which was female education. Sneyd entered into marriage with Richard Edgeworth on the understanding that they were equal partners in his work. Anna, and later Honora's stepdaughter, Maria Edgeworth, were to take those values and promote them in late-eighteenth- and early-nineteenth-century Britain, the ancestors of modern feminists. Today Honora's position on women's rights is best remembered for her rebuke of Thomas Day and his theory of the \\"perfect wife\\". Anna Seward's will mentions two likenesses of Honora Sneyd in her possession that she wished to bequeath. The first of these was a mezzotinto engraving after George Romney, which she had modeled for as \\"Serena\\" (see Figure, above) to Honora's brother Edward. The other was a drawn miniature portrait by John Andr√© (1776) which she left to her cousin and confidante Mary Powys. A jasper medallion, after an image by John Flaxman, was issued by the Wedgwood factory in 1780 (right). Honora Sneyd was the subject of many of Seward's poems, When Sneyd married Edgeworth, she became the subject of Seward's anger, yet the latter continued to write about Sneyd and her affection for her long after her death. In addition to being immortalised in Anna Seward's poetry, Sneyd appears semi-fictionalised as a character in a play about Major Andr√© and herself, Andr√©; a Tragedy in Five Acts by William Dunlap, first produced in New York in 1798. The plaque in St. Andrew's Church, Weston, where she is buried, on the north wall of the tower, reads;  Appendix: Persons mentioned  * Parents *: Edward Sneyd (1711‚Äì1795) m. 1742 Susanna Cook d. 1757, by whom; *:: Elizabeth Sneyd (1753‚Äì1797) *:: Charlotte Sneyd d. 1822 * Foster family *: Thomas Seward (1708‚Äì1790) m. 1741 Elizabeth Hunter d. 1780, by whom; *:: Anna Seward (1742‚Äì1809) *:: Sarah Seward (1744‚Äì1764) * Extended family *: Henry Powys d. 1774 m.

She became famous mainly because of the illustrations she began doing in 2009, she has hundred of thousands of followers in social networks. Biography She was born in Vila-real. Since she was a child loved everything related to drawings and the way of expressing herself artistically. At the age of 14 she joined into a drawing academy in the city she was born, thanks to this she started flirting with what would be years later her profession. After completing secondary school, she decided to study Fine Arts even though many of her relatives and friends told her she should study other careers which have more professional output. When Paula was 17 was admitted in the Polytechnic University of Valencia for studying Fine Arts. Once she had already completed these studies, she decided to spend time abroad completing her university studies. She travelled to Santiago de Chile and for four months she studied at PUC. After that, she went to New York thanks to a scholarship and studied at the NYU for six months. Almost every summer since she was 25, travelled to Urbino (Italy) to take some prestigious short courses. She was very clear that studying abroad would help her open her mind, searching for new horizons and discovering new influences. For four years she found it difficult to combine her teacher job in a school of Valencia (Spain) and her illustrator job. So she decided to concentrate totally in illustration. After five months, she moved to Barcelona where she could find greater artistic movements. Nowadays, she receives new job offers almost every day. She gained many fans by word of mouth. Most of her following was female. After that, her illustration skills appeared in buses, murals and advertisements. She has exhibit in some European cities, such as, Porto, Florencia or Paris, without forgetting Barcelona and Valencia. She is almost a fan phenomenon, she has 200.000 followers in social networks. Illustration techniques She used to work engraving (lithography, screen printing, chalcography) and oil painting techniques. In 2009 started introducing illustration in her works.

he was a former Chancellor and a member of the faculty at The University of Tennessee, Knoxville, USA. He was considered to be an expert in the areas of solid-state physics and many-body theory including two dimensional Composite fermions, low-dimensional systems, quantum Hall effect and nanoscience. Quinn was also one of the first researchers to recognize that physics of ‚Äòtwo-dimensional electronic systems‚Äô needs to be treated as a professional-sub-specialty. Life, education and career Born in New York City in 1933, John Quinn did his undergraduate studies at St. John's University where in 1954, he completed a B.S. with Summa Cum Laude. He earned his doctoral (1958) in Physics from the University of Maryland in USA. His doctoral research at Maryland was in ‚ÄúSelf- Energy Approach to Correlations in a Degenerate Electron Gas‚Äù under the supervision of Professor R.A. Ferrell. From 1989 -1992 Quinn was the Chancellor of the University of Tennessee; where since 1992 he has held the Willis Lincoln Chair of Excellence, Professor of Physics and Professor of Engineering Science and Mechanics. This is the flagship campus of University of Tennessee system and holds a close relationship with the US Department of Energy‚Äôs Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), ORNL was established at one of the original sites of the Manhattan Project and remains one of the largest nuclear facilities in the world. Starting from 1965, for nearly quarter of a century Quinn was at the Brown University in Rhode Island, USA. Between 1986 and 1989 Quinn was Dean of the Faculty. Before taking up the position of the dean, from 1965 to 1989 he was in the physics department at Brown as Professor of Physics. Earlier, from 1959 to 1965 Quinn was Member of Technical Staff, at the RCA Laboratories, in Princeton, NJ. Major professional contributions and recognitions He was internationally recognized as one of the researchers who helped create a research specialty in condensed matter physics known as ‚Äòtwo- dimensional electronic systems‚Äô. Physical properties of materials are critically dependent on how many dimensions of space that the constituents of the system can operate in; for instance, the energies and spatial distribution of quantum states are extremely sensitive to whether the system is effectively 1-d, 2-d or 3-d. He was also instrumental in starting the International Conference on Electronic Properties of Two-Dimensional Systems EP2DS a biannual professional gathering of researchers and scientists. In 1975, the first EP2DS conference was held at Brown University, where John Quinn was physics professor, consequently he co-edited the proceedings of that conference. Quinn was Chairman of the influential Solid State Sciences Committee and co-authored the book ‚ÄúArtificially Structured Materials‚Äù (National Academy Press, 1985). The advanced undergraduate and graduate level textbook ‚ÄúSolid State Physics: Principles and Modern Applications‚Äù (Springer Verlag, 2009) is co-authored by John Quinn and K.S. Yi. Although Quinn has been a university administrator, but all through he has been and active researcher and have published over 350 scientific publications. One of his early papers remains a classic.J.J. Quinn, R.A. Ferrell, ‚ÄúElectron Self-Energy Approach to Correlation in a Degenerate Electron Gas,‚Äù Phys.

He curated GSK Contemporary at the Royal Academy of Arts and Wide Open Spaces at PS1 MoMA New York, among many others. He was Curator of Contemporary Projects at the Henry Moore Foundation and was also director of the South London Gallery, The Showroom and Chisenhale. He has been Associate Director for Artes Mundi, the biannual contemporary art exhibition and prize at the National Museum of Wales, and following the death of Michael Stanley in late September 2012 was appointed Interim Director at Modern Art Oxford. He was a member of the Turner Prize jury in 2004. Since the beginning of 2005 David Thorp has been an independent curator organising and initiating various projects in the UK and abroad. Thorp has held the positions of International Adjunct Curator at PS1 MoMA New York, Associate Curator at Platform China,http://www.platformchina.org/en/home/index Beijing, Curator of the Frank Cohen Collection, one of the most important collections of contemporary art in the UK. Thorp writes extensively on contemporary art and has sat on numerous selection panels for art awards both in the UK and abroad.  Early life  Thorp was born and educated in London attending a Foundation course at Camberwell College of Arts. He studied at Hammersmith College and completed a Master's degree at Flinders University in South Australia. His first major curatorial assignment came in Australia in 1985 when Thorp curated the exhibition programme for the 1986 Adelaide Festival.http://adelaidefestival.ruciak.net/archive/1986%20Booking%20Guide.pdf  Chisenhale Gallery  When Thorp returned from Australia to the UK he was active in the development of the contemporary art scene in the East End of London as a part of which Thorp established Chisenhale Gallery. In 1986 Thorp became director of Chisenhale Gallery. He curated a programme of exhibitions of emerging artists from the UK and abroad and converted the gallery, which had been a shell when he arrived. Before his appointment Chisenhale was unestablished as an exhibition space and was principally occupied as artists studios. Thorp showed works by Ron Haselden presented the collective show \\"Ruins of Glamour, Glamour of Ruins\\" with Art in Ruins, Stewart Home, Ed Baxter, and others. Thorp has always worked with living artists at the forefront of experimental visual culture. The Showroom Thorp stayed in the East End to develop a second public gallery, The Showroom, which had been underused for some time, and curated an exhibition programme that made it one of London's most interesting experimental galleries. Both Chisenhale and The Showroom continue to maintain a thriving presence on the London contemporary art scene. During his time from 1988 until 1992 as director of The Showroom, Thorp presented seminal new works by Art in Ruins, Mona Hatoum, Rasheed Araeen and Marc Chaimowicz. He contributed to the signature aspect of The Showroom's exhibition policy ‚Äì the offer of an artist's first solo show in London ‚Äì was developed and refined so that the focus became the commissioning of individual artists to make new work for the space. During his time at The Showroom Thorp also worked as an independent curator. He organised exhibitions of contemporary art from the former Soviet Union and India as well as several other exhibitions in London and the regions. In 1990 Thorp curated an exhibition of contemporary British art that was shown in Kiev and Moscow. The South London Gallery Thorp was appointed as Director of the South London Gallery in 1992, the exhibition programme began to focus on the latest developments in contemporary art and the Gallery came to be known as the South London Gallery. Under Thorp's direction the South London Gallery became one of London's foremost venues for contemporary art. Thorp developed a programme of exhibitions and events that included education activities, talks, live art, and public art projects. After a gap of ten years, the SLG began once again to collect contemporary works relating to South London with the help of the Contemporary Art Society (CAS). Presenting solo shows featuring artists such as Julian Schnabel, Gilbert & George, Tracey Emin and correspondingly exhibiting works by Sarah Lucas, Gary Hume, Damien Hirst, Mat Collishaw. Purchases in this period included pieces by Antony Gormley, Anish Kapoor and Tracey Emin. Under Thorp's direction SLG received a major 1996 Prudential Arts Award for excellence in the arts. In 1997 Thorp was nominated for a Prudential Creative Briton award. Henry Moore Foundation In February 2001, Thorp was appointed Curator of Contemporary Projects at The Henry Moore Foundation. It finished activities in 2004. Thorp's role was to originate and implement a programme of contemporary art projects in the UK and abroad that introduced overseas artists to the UK and presented the work of British artists abroad. In 2003 as part of the Contemporary Projects programme Thorp organised and curated the Foundation's presence at the Liverpool Biennial. Converting an old school into a site for a series of large installations on the ground floor and in the playground with artists' studios above where the participating artists worked in advance of the event. Other major off site installations in 2003 included the mounting of Simon Callery's vast sculpture The Segsbury Project at Dover Castle and Paul McCarthy's huge inflatable Blockhead on the embankment at Tate Modern. In 2003 and 2005 Thorp successively curated two exhibitions as a part of the Extra 50 at the Venice Biennale. Stopover located in the building and grounds of a former nunnery and subsequently God is Great in a converted high school gymnasium. Frank Cohen Collection Early in 2007 collector Frank Cohen opened Initial Access, a venue for his extensive collection of international contemporary art, on the outskirts of Wolverhampton, England. Comprising two large industrial units, the venue was open to the public and presented four exhibitions per year, with Thorp as curator. Turner Prize Thorp shared the panel of judges in 2004 with Catherine David, Adrian Searle, Robert Taylor and Nicholas Serota who was Chairman of the Jury. The four nominees for the shortlist were Kutlug Ataman, Jeremy Deller, Ben Langlands and Nikki Bell (who work as a partnership) and Yinka Shonibare. It was Jeremy Deller's video study of George Bush's home state that won him the ¬£25,000 Turner prize. Frieze Sculpture Park Thorp was Curator of the annual Outdoor Sculpture Park for the Frieze Art Fair in London from 2005 to 2011, selecting and exhibiting up to twenty large outdoor sculptures from an international submission.

He was chosen on the second secret ballot by the 62-member Republican State Executive Committee meeting in Austin on March 7, 2015, after the resignation of Steve Munisteri. Under Mechler's tenure, the GOP held all statewide offices in Texas. Background Mechler graduated with a Mechanical Engineering degree from Texas A&M; University and an MBA degree from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. Career To win the state chairmanship, Mechler defeated several intra-party rivals, including former vice chairman and current Republican National Committeeman Robin Armstrong, an African-American physician from Dickinson in Galveston County; Wade Emmert, the Dallas County party chairman, and Jared Woodfill, the former Harris County chairman known for his support of social conservatism. Woodfill was unseated as chairman in Harris County in 2014 by Paul Simpson. In 2010, Munisteri defeated Cathie Adams at the party's state convention in Dallas, and Mechler was named the party treasurer and was credited with bringing stability to party finances. Mechler was elected in 2016 by delegates to the regular state Republican convention, which was held in Dallas from May 12‚Äì14. Mechler has been the Republican chairmen in two Texas counties, one of which is Gray County, which includes Pampa, the second largest city in the Texas Panhandle. To succeed himself as party treasurer, Mechler tapped Republican activist and assistant treasurer Thomas Washington of Denton.\\"Tom Mechler Is New State Party Chairman\\", jackcountygop.com, March 17, 2015 In 2005, then-Governor Rick Perry appointed Mechler to the board of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice where he served for nine years, the last five as the Board Vice-Chair. Mechler has served as a Volunteer Prison Chaplain since 2002. Governor Greg Abbott said that he expects Mechler to \\"strengthen the party [and] continue the momentum of our state's Republican victories and preserve the very values that have made Texas the greatest state in the nation to live, work and raise a family.\\" Mechler opposes marriage of same-sex couples and once said he would cancel his subscription to his home-town newspaper, the Amarillo Globe-News, were it to place in its pages a picture of two men or two women kissing each other. Mechler has been a grassroots leader since first becoming involved in Republican Party politics in 1986 in Wasilla, Alaska where he was first elected as a Precinct Chair, followed by his election as the District 16 Vice- Chair and subsequently becoming the District 16 Chair and member of the Alaska Central Committee. He held these positions until leaving Alaska to attend the Wharton Business School in 1990. He became reinvolved as a Republican grassroots leader when he was elected the Gray County GOP Chair in 1993 (Pampa, Texas), a position he held until he moved to Armstrong County in 2000. He became the County Chair in Claude, Texas in 2001, serving for a year when he was elected to the Texas State Republican Executive Committee where he served from 2002-2006. Mechler first became involved in politics because of his strong pro-life beliefs which he continues to hold to this day. In his statement of resignation as state Republican chairman, Mechler cited time constraints and business and family matters. Having worked in 2016 to unify the Donald Trump and Ted Cruz factions in the Texas GOP, Mechler called for party unity and outreach in his departing statement. A successor for a two- year term was chosen on June 3 at the state Republican Executive Committee meeting in Austin. Candidates who sought the position were Travis County chairman James Dickey, Rick Figueroa of Brenham, and Mark Ramsey, a state committee member from Spring in Harris County. The 62-member State Republican Executive Committee and the vice chair narrowly chose Dickey to succeed Mechler. Dickey polled thirty-two votes to thirty-one for rival Rick Figueroa.

The head of the banking house of Emerson McMillin, McMillin won a commission through \\"gallant conduct under fire\\" fighting for the Union Army in the Civil War, before moving to the Ohio Valley to work in the iron works and steel industries. He founded American Light and Traction in 1900 and became president. Early life He was born on April 16, 1844 in Ewington, Ohio. His family was of Scottish heritage, and had initially settled in Virginia. He was the twelfth of fourteen children, and went to school several months a year until the age of ten. His father was the manager of an iron furnace and Emerson worked as an iron furnace apprentice for four years starting at age 12, in 1856. He acquired a good education with hard study after-hours, with a particular interest in scientific research. The Times wrote that he \\"made a practice of thoroughly examining the application of the scientific principles of the iron and gas industries.\\" Career Military activity Devoutly anti-slavery unlike his father, he attempted to sign up for the American Civil War at the age of seventeen. Rejected for his age, when he turned 18 he signed up for the 18th Ohio. He served in the Union Army starting in 1862. He was wounded three times in the war, while other sources say he was wounded five times. He served in 38 battles. In the war, McMillin and his brothers were known as the \\"fighting McMillins,\\" Of his five brothers, three were killed in the conflict. McMillin himself won a commission through \\"gallant conduct under fire.\\" Business The banking house of Emerson McMillin Co. was at 120 Broadway. He worked for ten years in the Ohio Valley in iron works and steel mills. In Ohio, he became manager or president of several institutions, and afterwards focused his energies on gas properties and their consolidation and growth. In 1891, he started a commercial bank involved in mergers and acquisitions in the industry. The Times wrotes that the bank's focus was \\"of a sort then rather new in banking circles,\\" because of its focus on the purchase and merging of gas interests. He believed in consolidating competitors as a business strategy, for example causing the merger in St. Louis of four gas companies, increasing their net profit significantly. Among his other positions, he was president of the Columbus Street Railway Company in Columbus, Ohio, where he lived for some time. After having moved to New York City, he resigned as president on April 14, 1898 due to a \\"diversity of business connections in other localities,\\" although he retained other interests in Columbus, including gas interests. He founded the American Light and Traction in 1900 for the purpose for consolidating the utility industry's small, local power suppliers, and also became president. By 1901, American Light and Traction owned and controlled over 40 gas producing plants, electric light and traction (streetcar) properties. In 1922, although he had experienced two years of poor health, he remained head of the banking house of Emerson McMillin Co. at 120 Broadway, chairman of the American Light and Traction Company, and president of \\"a dozen other lighting and traction concerns throughout the country.\\" Philanthropy and civic efforts World's Court League in 1916, with McMillin seated on the left next to Henry Riggs Rathbone. He supported a number of civic projects with his own funds, for example the Arbitration Society of the Americas to allow for the arbitration of civic disputes outside a court. He served as president of the organization. In 1915, he was at the first meeting of the World's Court League, and was appointed vice president. McMillin provided initial funding in 1916 for the founding of Columbia Business School in New York. Personal life McMillin married Isabel Morgan and she died after his death in 1922. They had four children: Marion McMillin, Estelle McMillin Traverso, Maud McMillin, Emerson McMillin II. Following George Crocker's death in 1909, McMillin bought his 1907 home, the Crocker Mansion, a 45,000 square feet house at Mahwah, New Jersey, designed by the architect James Brite.http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2008/09/crocker_mansion_in_mahwah_sell.html He was an art collector of \\"unusual discernment,\\" and Thomas E. Kirby described McMillin's painting collection sold in January 1913 as the finest collection of American and foreign pictures ever sold in the United States. At the 1913 sale, his Orpheus and Eurydice by Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot was sold for $75,200. McMillin died of pneumonia on May 30, 1922 in Mahwah, New Jersey. In late October 1924, the furnishings from the Crocker-McMillin mansion were auctioned, with profits reaching $185,000 on the third day of sales. Among the items were rare paintings and rugs. His grandson, Emerson McMillin 3d, died in New York at the age of 41 in 1935, and was survived by his mother Baroness Traverso of Florence, Italy, and his wife Olga Kohler McMillin of the Hotel St. Regis.

Early life Veronica Conroy was born at Calverstown, County Kildare. Her mother was in poor health so she was fostered to a family named Burns in Dublin at a very young age.Patrick N. Wyse Jackson, \\"Veronica Burns, 1914-1998, Curator, Geological Museum, Trinity College, Dublin, 1964-1980,\\" Geological Curator 6(9)(June 1998): 339-340. After she discovered her natural brother when she was 22 she took their name Conroy as her second name. She lived in the same house in Ballsbridge in Dublin for all but 2 years of her life. She was considered largely self-educated as she did not hold a degree, but developed interest in astronomy, natural history and geology/palaeontology. She went on to successfully create links between academia and the activities of amateur geologists. Career Burns was one of the founders of the Irish Astronomical Society in 1938, and served as an officer of the organization several times.James O'Connor, \\"A Brief History of the Society,\\" Irish Astronomical Society website. She was also a member of the Irish Geological Association. In the 1940s she compiled meteorological records at Armagh Observatory, and worked as a laboratory assistant, and in a photo studio. In 1953 she joined the Dublin Naturalists' Field Club, and organized the club's annual exhibition for many years.Aideen Austin, \\"The Dublin Naturalists' Field Club Report for 1998,\\" Irish Naturalists' Journal 26(5/6)(1999): 208. She led 19 field trips over a 27-year period. She was an enthusiastic collector of fossils, especially of graptolites from the Irish coast.Matthew A. Parkes, \\"Paleokarst at Portrane, County Dublin: Evidence for Hernantian Glaciation,\\" Irish Journal of Earth Sciences 12(1993): 79. Colleagues encouraged her to write about her collection, and she co-authored two academic papers about graptolites.R. B. Rickards, V. Burns, and J. B. Archer. \\"The Silurian Sequence at Balbriggan, Co. Dublin,\\" Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy 73(1973): 303-316.V. Burns and R. B. Rickards, \\"Silurian Graptolite Faunas of the Balbriggan Inlier, Counties Dublin and Meath, and the Evolutionary, Stratigraphical, and Structural Significance,\\" Proceedings of the Yorkshire Geological Society 49(1993): 283-291. In 1960 Burns became a research assistant to Robert George Spencer Hudson (1895-1965). She started as a photographic technician in the geology department at Trinity College, Dublin in 1964, but soon took charge of the department's museum collections. She created displays, reorganized the mineral samples, catalogued over 20,000 specimens, and gave tours to schoolchildren.Patrick N. Wyse Jackson, \\"The Geological Collections of Trinity College, Dublin,\\" Geological Curator5(7)(1992): 267. She curated and catalogued over 20,000 mineral specimens. Even after her retirement in 1980, she maintained a presence at the museum.Patrick N. Wyse Jackson and Mary E. Spencer Jones, \\"The Quiet Workforce: The Various Roles of Women in Geological and Natural History Museums During the Early to mid-1900s,\\" in Cynthia V. Burek and Bettie Higgs, eds., The Role of Women in the History of Geology (Geological Society of London 2007): 100-102. Her speciality was collecting fossils. In early 1960s she would go on field trips to Balbriggan and Skerries in north Dublin to collect Silurian graptolites, which are fossils of colonial marine animals. She created a large collection of Lower Carboniferous fossils which were used in a paper published on the Scientific Proceedings of the Royal Dublin Society in 1966 by R.G.S. Hudson, Michael Clarke, and George Sevastopulo, though she was not included as an author. Burns was very modest about her work but she was encouraged to publish her findings. Two papers, one with Barrie Rickards and Jean Archer in 1973 and one with Rickards in 1993, used her findings to accurately date the rocks in the Balbriggan area. Her collections are now in the Geological Museum in Trinity. Later life Burns suffered late in life with osteoporosis but remained active in the museum. She died in Dublin on 5 January 1998.

She was the third wife of the German philosopher Ernst Bloch.  Early life and education  Bloch was born into a Jewish-Polish textile manufacturing family that fled to Russia during the First World War. In Moscow she was an eyewitness to the October Revolution, an experience to which she attributes her lifelong devotion to socialism. In 1921 the family moved to Berlin, where she studied art with the Expressionist Ludwig Meidner. She met her future husband, the philosopher Ernst Bloch, in 1926. Karola began her architectural studies in Vienna then returned to study at the Technische Hochschule in Berlin as one of a small group of women. Karola was a devotee of the Neues Bauen; she was a student of Hans Poelzig and Bruno Taut, and through her friendship with Xanti Schawinsky she was able to spend time at the Bauhaus, though she was never officially enrolled. In Berlin she joined a leftist student club and devoted her energy to fighting fascism, joining the Communist Party of Germany in 1932. She also took courses at the Marxistische Arbeiterschule ‚ÄúMasch‚Äù, where she met the architect Hannes Meyer and the critic Gy√∂rgy Luk√°cs. Friends of the Blochs in Berlin included Walter Benjamin and Siegfried Kracauer. The Blochs lived in the left-wing K√ºnstlerkolonie Berlin in Wilmersdorf. When the Reichstag was burned in 1933 the colony was surrounded by Nazis; Karola was able to hide Ernst Bloch‚Äôs manuscripts and have them smuggled out. The Blochs fled to Switzerland where Karola finished her studies at the ETH Zurich. Due to the increasingly anti-Semitic atmosphere, they moved to Vienna, where they married in 1934.  Work and life in exile  In Vienna Karola worked for the architect Jacques Groag, a student of Adolf Loos, and befriended Elias Canetti and Alma Mahler. In spite of the danger for Jews and Communists she also worked as an informant for the USSR, making risky trips to Poland. Her husband Ernst Bloch once said to her ‚ÄúYou practice what I write in my philosophy.‚Äù After the Anschluss the couple fled to Paris, where Karola worked in the studio of Auguste Perret. In 1936 the couple moved to Prague, where Karola had a private design practice with the Bauhaus textile designer Friedl Dicker- Brandeis and was the architect of a single-family house in the Tatra mountains. Her son Jan-Robert was born in 1937. The couple emigrated to New York in 1938. Because Ernst Bloch did not speak English, Karola had to support the family alone by working as an architect. Karola worked as one of only two women in the office of Mayer & Whittlesey, where she worked on high-rises like 240 Central Park South. In the United States, the couple was reunited with other √©migr√©s like Theodor Adorno and Hermann Broch. After moving to Cambridge, MA, Karola was commissioned to design a modern house for Harry Slochower in Andover, NJ. She also worked as a draftswoman for Stone and Webster, one of the largest engineering firms in the US, unaware that they were also working on the facilities for the Manhattan Project. She also worked for Leland and Larsen in Boston, and organized a group to help support Polish architects after the war. In 1943 Karola‚Äôs parents, brother, and sister-in-law were murdered in Treblinka after being forced to live in the Warsaw Ghetto.  Work and life in Germany  In 1949 the couple returned to East Germany, where Ernst Bloch took a teaching position at the University of Leipzig. Karola Bloch worked designing typical plans for kindergartens and daycare centers under commission from the Deutsche Bauakademie (German Building Academy). 8,000 child care centers were built in the GDR during this time, many of them based on her plans. An example is two facilities that she designed and supervised at the Baumwollspinnerei in Leipzig in 1955, which are now protected under historic preservation laws. However, Karola‚Äôs modern approach was controversial during a time when more ornate Stalinist architecture was promoted. For this reason she urged her friend Hannes Meyer not to emigrate to the GDR. In 1957 Karola, who was also politically anti-Stalinist, was forced out of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, which meant that she could no longer work as an architect. For several years she anonymously published articles aimed at women, on topics like more efficient kitchen design and how to read building plans. She also became a founding member of the International Union of Women Architects. When the Berlin Wall was erected on August 31, 1961, the Blochs, on a lecture trip in West Germany, did not return to Leipzig or the GDR, leaving all of their belongings behind. The couple moved to T√ºbingen where Ernst Bloch became a professor. After 30 years of practicing as an architect Karola Bloch devoted herself entirely to the politics of prisoners and abused women, co-founding the organization Hilfe zur Selbsthilfe (Help for Self-Help). She was also active in the pro-choice movement organized by prominent feminist Alice Schwarzer in the early 1970s. When she was 76 years old, she traveled to Nicaragua to support the Sandinistas.

It is native to the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico. Description Pseudoplexaura porosa is a large species of coral, growing to a height of about . The colony is tree-like, upright and relatively robust. It grows from a trunk that may be thick and branches dichotomously (forking repeatedly into pairs of equal-sized branches). The end branches are long and slightly tapered, averaging about thick. The branches are smooth and the tips are soft and slimy. The apertures from which the polyps project are large and crowded together, and are arranged spirally up the branches. The polyps overlap each other, each one having eight tentacles. This octocoral is some shade of pale yellow, tan, or reddish-purple. Distribution Pseudoplexaura porosa is found in the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico. Its range extends from Bermuda and Florida to Colombia, and it usually grows on reefs between deep, but has been recorded at depths as great as . This octocoral thrives in areas with strong currents and, in contrast to stony corals, the branches are flexible and sway about with the movement of the water. Biology The polyps spread out their tentacles to feed on plankton and other fine organic particles both day and night. The octocoral has symbionts in the form of single-celled protists called zooxanthellae that inhabit the tissues. These are photosynthetic and provide their host with nutrients. The polyps are armed with nematocysts (stinging cells) and can be retracted into the branches defensively. Pseudoplexaura porosa has few predators; animals that sometimes feed on it include the flamingo tongue snail, nudibranchs, butterflyfish and some angelfish. Individual colonies of P. porosa are either male or female. On particular nights about five days after a full moon in summer and regulated by the lunar cycle, mature colonies liberate gametes into the sea. Planula larvae that develop from fertilised eggs sink to the seabed five days later and undergo metamorphosis to found new colonies. These are soon colonised by zooxanthellae and grow by budding of new polyps. Besides growing asexually and reproducing sexually, pieces of this coral may detach from the parent colony and become fixed to substrate to create a new colony. P. porosa can live for several decades, and the greatest cause of mortality is detachment from the seabed during tropical storms. Secondary metabolites Several different substances have been isolated from the tissues. One of these is crassin acetate, a diterpene lactone first obtained from this source and found to be present in very high concentrations in the zooxanthellae. Diterpenoids isolated from Pseudoplexaura porosa show cytotoxic antitumour activity when screened against samples of human tumour cells.

Auguste Dide (ed), La R√©volution fran√ßaise, Soci√©t√© de l'histoire de la r√©volution fran√ßaise de Paris, 1884, vol IV, p. 601. He was a Commander of the Royal Order of the Legion of Honour on 17 October 1814, Knight of Order of St. Louis.Acte de d√©c√®s de Fran√ßois Ignace Schaal, dans les archives municipales de S√©lestat (S√©lestat, D, 1833, 4E462/57, Adeloch p. 50/83). He married Josephine Agla√©e Bon Fabry.Recueil, Volume 16, p. 68. During the French Revolution, he was one of the commanders of the Republican army, especially during the Siege of Mainz (1792) and he distinguished himself in Cassel (Mainz). In 1793, shortly after the military reorganization, he was a lieutenant colonel of the 93rd Regiment, formerly the Duke of Enghien's regiment; the first battalion of this regiment served in the Army of the Rhine under Adam Philippe, Comte de Custine; the second at Strasbourg, and the grenadiers at Mainz. L√©on Hennet, Etat militaire de la France pour l'ann√©e 1793, Soci√©t√© de l'histoire de la R√©volution fran√ßaise, 1903, pp. 161-162. Although only a brigadier general, he commanded the Army of the Rhine from 14 February to 29 April 1795.Ramsey Weston Phipps, Armies of the First French Republic, vol II. Pickle Press, 2011, p. 205. He had not sought command of the Army of the Rhine--indeed, Desaix, and others had flat out refused to take command and had finally convinced the Committee in Paris that Schaal was the man for the job, despite his being a brigadier and they, generals of division--but Schaal had taken the command against his better judgement and executed it as best he could. To give the others credit, they had followed his orders precisely, as uninspired as they were.Phipps, pp. 205-206. At the 1795 engagement at Mainz, Schaal commanded two columns, one from the Army of the Rhine and the other from the Army of Moselle, that had been separated from their respective armies to take Mainz. However, when it came to the renewal of siege at Mainz, he commanded the united columns, one from each army, that comprised the Arm√©e devant Mayence (the Army before Mainz). When the critical time came, however, Schaal was a mere figurehead implementing a strategy at Mainz that he had neither thought of, or approved. He entered retirement.Phipps, p. 239. He tried to re-enter the military in 1799, seeking an appointment to Andr√© Mass√©na's Army of Helvetia. He entered full retirement on 4 September 1815. His name is inscribed on the Arc de Triomphe, on the eastern side of the fourteenth column facing the Champs- √âlys√©es.

In connection with the destruction of Susa, which was effectively the dissolution of the kingdom of Elam by Ashurbanipal, Kuras (Cyrus I) sent Arukku to Nineveh to recognize the supremacy of the Assyrians in 639 BC. The distinction equating Parsua with Parsuma≈° would mean that the referenced Cyrus may have meanwhile taken over the sovereignty of one of many kings. In 835 BC, in the 24th year of the reign of Shalmaneser III, Parsua was described as a country with 27 kings.Dietz Otto Edzard: history of Mesopotamia , p. 198 Traditional identifications Traditionally Arukku is usually identified as the son of Cyrus I. The mention serves as proof for the oldest message in the Persian royal family.Ernst Friedrich Weidner: The oldest message via the Persian royal house; Cyrus I was a contemporary of Assurbanipal . In: AfO , Vol 7 (1931/32), pp 1-7. ISSN 0066-6440 . This was followed by the derivation that Cambyses I must have been another son. According to this chronology, in which Cyrus already occurs as a father and king, the birth of Cyrus would be no later than 680 to 675 BC.If Arukku were a 17-year-old son in 639 BC, this results in a birth year of 656 BC at the latest. His father Cyrus was at least 19 years old in the year of Arukku's birth. Alternative explanations The Kyros mentioned by Ashurbanipal did not have vassal status, but gave voluntary gifts to Assyria to ensure friendly relations with the new neighbor. However, these gifts were recorded in the Assyrian king's lists as a tribute.Dietz Otto Edzard: history of Mesopotamia , p. 226 The traditional derivation is not always mentioned by all historians, since the age of Cyrus is thought to be too high and the reading of the name Arukkus is considered uncertain.Reinhold Bichler: Herodotus world , p. 256 Other historians doubt the equation of Parsuma≈° with Parsa and comment on the traditional identifications as obsolete and refuted .Klaas Veenhof: History of the Ancient Near East until the time of Alexander the Great , p. 274 References Further reading * Category:Achaemenid dynasty ","title":"Arukku"},{"id":"45699529","text":"Sabuloglossum is a fungal genus in the earth tongue family Geoglossaceae.

Move to London She was the daughter of Sarah Tappan Hoadley (August 16, 1832 - January 10, 1909) and William Earl Dodge, Jr. (1832-1903) from New York. The family wealth came from a mercantile business that developed into one of the largest copper mining and copper wire manufacturing companies in America called Phelps, Dodge & Co. Mary was one of six children and she, like her sister Grace Hoadley Dodge (1856-1914), remained unmarried and lived with her parents for several years. To seek some independence, Mary moved to London, England. Her father supported her decision, and purchased a house for her in Brompton Square, where she lived with a female companion from New York named Julia Fairchild Schreiner (1864-1953).Julia Fairchild Schreiner (1864 - July 27, 1953) - In 1914 Julia married English diplomat Sir Robert Hyde Greg (December 24, 1876 - December 3, 1953), who in his lifetime held several diplomatic posts, including that of British Commissioner for the Public Debt in Egypt (1929-1940). Julia died in England. Robert died in Cairo, Egypt, and is buried in the Cairo War Cemetery, Misr Al Qadimah, Cairo Governorate, Egypt. Dodge moved from Brompton Square to the more fashionable Eaton Square, and then to Warwick House in the precincts of St James‚Äôs Palace. She also had a residence named West Side House, located on West Side, Wimbledon Common, in south-west London. She was well-connected in London society, and corresponded with authors, artists and others including Lord Baden-Powell, Henry James and John Singer Sargent. She took pleasure in spending her money on friends, and once took seven guests to the Baltic Sea on board a hired yacht. One of the party, architect Sir Edwin Landseer Lutyens (1869-1944), wrote of the experience: He also remarked that she seemed to tire easily, and that this was the result of an arthritic condition. Another example of her generosity was when she hired His Majesty's Theatre and paid all production costs for six performances of an opera titled The Wreckers by another friend, composer and author Dame Ethel Mary Smyth (1858-1944). Theosophy Dodge gained a new companion at Warwick House, Countess Muriel De La Warr (n√©e Muriel Agnes Brassey) (1872-1930)Countess Muriel De La Warr (n√©e Muriel Agnes Brassey) (April 21, 1872 - August 8, 1930) (daughter of Lord Thomas Brassey), who had divorced her husband Gilbert Sackville, 8th Earl De La Warr in 1902. Lady Emily Lutyens (1874-1964),Lady Emily Lutyens (n√©e Emily Bulwer-Lytton) (December 26, 1874 - January 3, 1964) - She was a daughter of Edward Robert Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Earl of Lytton (November 8, 1831 - November 24, 1891), Viceroy of India (1876-1880), and Edith Villiers (September 15, 1841 - September 17, 1936). architect Edwin Lutyens' wife, introduced Mary and Muriel to Theosophy and to the works of Annie Besant (1847-1933). Dodge provided financial support for the Theosophical Society and for the construction of its London headquarters (designed by Edwin Lutyens) in Tavistock Square. The building is now BMA House, the headquarters of the British Medical Association. On May 5, 1911 Besant arrived in London from India with Jiddu Krishnamurti (1895-1986) - identified as their future spiritual leader - and his brother Nitya (1898-1925).Nitya Krishnamurti (May 30, 1898 - November 13, 1925) - His full name was Jiddu Nityananda Krishnamurti, but he was usually referred to as \\"Nitya\\" in order to distinguish him from his older brother Jiddu (1895-1986). Nitya had weak lungs, and died of pneumonia and tuberculosis in Ojai, California. When in England during the period 1911-1919, the Krishnamurti brothers lodged in quite a few different places, including with Mary Dodge at West Side House, and in lodgings provided by Muriel De La Warr in 2 different locations: sometimes Old Lodge in Ashdown Forest, Sussex, and sometimes a flat at No. 2 Robert Street, Adelphi, London. In 1913 Dodge settled ¬£500 per year for life on Jiddu, and ¬£300 per year on Jiddu's brother Nitya during the years Nitya was a student at Oxford University. Suffrage Dodge and De La Warr also supported the Suffragette movement and became involved with Francis Meynell. They helped him and George Lansbury purchase the Daily Herald, a bankrupt Labour newspaper. It was re-launched as a socialist daily newspaper and supported the militant suffrage campaign. Later the two ladies helped Meynell create the Pelican Press. Final Years Despite her great wealth, Dodge was hit by the Depression years and had to cut back on her generosity. Her illness also confined her to a wheelchair in later years. She downsized in London and eventually moved to Wick Hall, Hove, on the south coast of England in about 1930, giving up her houses in London and Wimbledon. Esmond Harmsworth, 2nd Viscount Rothermere became the new owner of Warwick House in 1923. Mary Dodge died on Christmas Eve 1934, leaving about three million dollars, mainly to family and friends.

The concept goes back at least to Guildford (1936). The process of item analysis varies depending on the psychometric model. For example, classical test theory or the Rasch model call for different procedures. In all cases, however, the purpose of item analysis is to produce a relatively short list of items (that is, questions to be included in an interview or questionnaire) that constitute a pure but comprehensive test of one or a few psychological constructs. To carry out the analysis, a large pool of candidate items, all of which show some degree of face validity, are given to a large sample of participants who are representative of the target population. Ideally, there should be at least 10 times as many candidate items as the desired final length of the test, and several times more people in the sample than there are items in the pool. Researchers apply a variety of statistical procedures to the responses to eliminate unsatisfactory items. For example, under classical test theory, researcher discard items if the answers: * Show little variation within the sample * Are strongly correlated with one or more other items * Weakly correlate with the totality of the remaining items, reflected in an increase in Cronbach's alpha if the item is eliminated from the test In practical test construction, item analysis is an iterative process, and cannot be entirely automated. The psychometrician's judgement is required to determine whether the emerging set of items to be retained constitutes a satisfactory test of the target construct. The three criteria above do not always agree, and a balance must be struck between them in deciding whether or not to include an item. References *Guilford, J. P. (1936). Psychometric methods.

The United States' Credit Union National Association (CUNA) asked Herlihy to form a subcommittee to examine how the credit union model could be put to use in Ireland. With Sean Forde and O'Hogain she formed the Credit Union Extension Service. In 1957, Minister for Industry and Commerce Se√°n Lemass appointed Herlihy to a legislative advisory committee on non-agricultural co-operatives. The first two Irish credit unions were formed under Herlihy's influence in 1958 and she promoted credit unions throughout Ireland. She was instrumental in the formation of the Civil Service Credit Union and the Irish League of Credit Unions, which was founded in 1960 and run from the living room of her Dublin house. She served as unpaid secretary for the organisation, teaching full-time and funding the movement's development with her earnings. In 1963 the board of the Credit Union League of Ireland recognized her as having made the greatest individual contribution to the Irish credit union movement. Her efforts aided the passage of the 1966 Credit Union Act and she stood beside President √âamon de Valera as he signed the act into law. Death and legacy Nora Herlihy died on 7 February 1988, 28 years after the creation of the Irish League of Credit Unions. The Nora Herlihy Memorial Centre in Ballydesmond is named for her. The centre includes graphic panels depicting Herlihy's life. Herlihy's niece is RT√â broadcaster Marian Finucane.

Career  Stover officially began his human rights work as a researcher at Amnesty International in London, England, from 1977-1980. During this time, the organization won the Nobel Peace Prize for its ‚Äúcampaign against torture,‚Äù and the United Nations Prize in the Field of Human Rights. Following Amnesty International, Stover became the Director of the Science and Human Rights Program of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. In 1992, Stover served as the Executive Director of Physicians for Human Rights where he worked on forensic missions to examine mass gravesites for the International Criminal Tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda. While at PHR, Stover performed research on the sociomedical consequences of land mines in war-torn countries such as Cambodia. His research helped launch the International Campaign to Ban Landmines, which, along with the organization‚Äôs director, Jody Williams, received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1997. He has published seven books and numerous reports and articles for press and scholarly publications.  Human Rights Center  Stover became the Faculty Director of the Human Rights Center (HRC) at the UC Berkeley School of Law in 1996, two years after the center was established. The HRC is an interdisciplinary research center which uses science and law to pursue human rights issues. The Human Rights center has conducted investigations or research focusing on sexual violence, human trafficking, torture, public health among vulnerable populations, accountability for war criminals, child soldiers, family reunification, and the applications of advanced technologies to human rights work. The Center's reports have examined human rights issues in sub-Saharan Africa, Central America and South America, Southeast Asia, the Balkans, the Middle East, and the United States.

By 1890 the population had reached 600 individuals and boasted several commercial and social establishments, but it began to decline after the town refused to give a bonus to the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway in order to bring that rail line through the town.

One of the United States government's highest-ranking female employees of her time, she worked at the Mint for 34 years, during which she often served as acting director during the Mint Director's absence. O'Reilly was born in Springfield, Massachusetts to an Irish immigrant family. Growing up in that state, she left school around the age of 14 to help support both her widowed mother and her siblings. Likely starting work in the local textile mills, she gained clerical training at night school before working as a clerk in Worcester for eighteen years. In 1904, O'Reilly gained a position at the Mint Bureau, resulting in a move to Washington, D.C. She rose rapidly in the bureau's hierarchy - an unusual feat for a woman at that time - and was frequently called upon to testify before the United States Congress. As many of the Mint's directors were political appointees who had little knowledge or interest in the bureau's operations, the task of running the institution often fell to her. In 1924 she was officially appointed Assistant Director. In 1933, the Mint gained its first female Director, Nellie Tayloe Ross, and despite initial mistrust between her and O'Reilly, they came to forge a strong bond. Although scheduled for mandatory retirement in 1935, O'Reilly was considered to be so indispensable to the bureau's operations that U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt postponed this until 1938. During her later years, O'Reilly remained in Washington D.C.; she no longer involved herself in Mint affairs, instead devoting much of her attention to Catholic charitable work.  Early life and career  Mary Margaret O'Reilly was born in Springfield, Massachusetts, on October 14, 1865. Her parents, James A. and Joanna O'Reilly, were immigrants from Ireland, and Mary was one of five children. The family lived in Springfield and nearby Chicopee, Massachusetts, where James O'Reilly was a liquor wholesaler. He died after an illness in 1873. As well as depriving the family of income, his death caused his family legal trouble: Austin O'Reilly, a clerk in the now-closed O'Reilly business, tried to settle the estate by selling the remaining alcohol, but lacked a license to do so. Joanna O'Reilly denied any knowledge of business affairs. Austin's conviction for transporting liquor without a license was upheld by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. Mary left school after ninth grade, at or soon after age 14, as her help was needed to support the family. She likely worked for one of the local textile mills, and attended night school to train as a clerk and stenographer. From 1885 to 1903, she worked as a clerk, living in Worcester along with a brother, in a boarding house owned by their mother.  Mint career (1904‚Äì1938)   Rise to prominence  O'Reilly was hired by the United States Bureau of the Mint as a Class D temporary clerk in 1904, when she was 38 years old, older than most new employees. She served in the Washington, D.C. headquarters of the Bureau of the Mint, where Mint Director George E. Roberts was impressed by her business experience and competence. Initially having only temporary status, she was made a permanent employee in 1905, and was promoted again that year to Clerk Class I at a salary of $1,200. When Margaret Kelly was commissioned Examiner of the Bureau of the Mint in 1911, the ripple of promotions in her wake included O'Reilly, who became adjuster of accounts. This made her in effect the chief clerk of the Mint Bureau, with responsibility for reviewing all contracts. According to Teva J. Scheer, biographer of Nellie Tayloe Ross (O'Reilly's final Mint Director before retirement) \\"it must have required an almost unprecedented combination of drive and intelligence for [O'Reilly] to have climbed so far up through the organization in her male-dominated work environment\\". Mint Director George E. Roberts (shown on his Mint medal by Chief Engraver Charles E. Barber) During the 1910s, O'Reilly continued to gain promotion, serving both as examiner and as computer of bullion. She was frequently called upon to testify before Congress. In 1915, Robert W. Woolley was appointed Mint Director, and was likely O'Reilly's favorite of those who served in that position during her third of a century at the Mint. She often concluded memoranda with personal good wishes, and Woolley reciprocated. After Woolley resigned in August 1916, O'Reilly served as acting director for part of the time until Woolley's successor Friedrich Johannes Hugo von Engelken took office the next month, though Adjuster of the Bureau of the Mint Fred H. Chafflin held the acting position for much of the interregnum.  Assistant director  Most directors of the Mint of the early 20th century were political appointees, lacking previous experience with the bureau. Von Engelken during his six-month term as director in 1916 and 1917 left almost all supervision of the mints and assay offices to O'Reilly. The Mint eliminated production of proof coins, popular among collectors, in 1916. Although the suggestion that the bureau eliminate the special coins, on which it lost money, came from Philadelphia Mint Superintendent Adam M. Joyce, and was approved by von Engelken, O'Reilly signed many of the letters to numismatists, and thus was blamed for the change in policy. When von Engelken resigned in February 1917, his successor was Raymond T. Baker, who foresaw that women would hold high government positions in increasing numbers, and gave O'Reilly a more public role. Each year, Baker appeared before Congress to defend the bureau's appropriation requests, and O'Reilly sat behind him. In 1920 and 1921, Baker tried to get Congress to formally designate O'Reilly, who then held the title of executive clerk, as Assistant Director, but without success. After the Harding administration took office, Baker was replaced in 1922 by Frank E. Scobey, one of Harding's Ohio Gang. The new director had little interest in Mint affairs, and O'Reilly not only supervised the bureau's operations, but was the chief witness before Congress in 1922, defending both the appropriation request and the continuing drive to have herself designated Assistant Director. This time, Congress was more amenable, and she gained the title effective from 1924. In December 1921, a public relations crisis over the design of the new Peace dollar had erupted while Baker was on a three-day trip by train to the West Coast. Anthony de Francisci, designer of the coin, had included a broken sword on the reverse, which he intended as a sign of the end of war, but which many interpreted as a symbol of disgrace. Anger at such a design resonated in a country deeply sensitive about such matters due to World War I. With Baker unreachable, O'Reilly realized the sword would have to be removed, and approached Treasury Undersecretary Seymour Parker Gilbert, who as acting secretary approved a revised design. The Mint's Chief Engraver, George T. Morgan, skillfully removed the sword from the already-prepared coinage hubs even before Baker cabled his own approval of the revised design he had not seen. O'Reilly ran most Mint operations under Scobey and his successor, Robert J. Grant. Although the Mint Bureau was very busy in the booming economy of the 1920s, numismatic historian Roger Burdette points out that there were flaws in operations‚Äîfor example, Philadelphia Mint officials, instead of setting aside gold coins from each batch delivered for inspecting and testing by the annual Assay Commission, took all assay coins from a bag set aside at the start of the year, increasing the likelihood that nonstandard coins would go undetected. O'Reilly did keep a close eye on coinage operations, warning the San Francisco Mint in November 1931 that it had produced fewer than 200,000 nickels, a figure that if allowed to stand would have resulted in the issue being hoarded by collectors. She directed the mint to strike nothing but nickels for the remainder of the year, resulting in a total mintage for the 1931‚ÄìS of 1,200,000, still the second-lowest by date and mint mark in the Buffalo nickel series.  Roosevelt administration and retirement  When the Democratic Roosevelt administration took office in 1933, O'Reilly was serving as acting director following Grant's resignation. President Franklin Roosevelt (FDR) appointed former Wyoming governor Nellie Tayloe Ross as Mint Director, the first woman to hold that position. By then, O'Reilly was 67 years old, and appeared as a small, grandmotherly figure who was dubbed \\"the Sweetheart of the Treasury\\"‚Äîan appearance that hid her mental strength and determination. Ross's personal secretary, Edness Wilkins, described the Assistant Director of the Mint as \\"ruthless\\". Nellie Tayloe Ross, as seen on her Mint medal designed by Chief Engraver John R. Sinnock Ross and O'Reilly had mutual suspicions to overcome. Ross, who had recently endured poor relations with Eleanor Roosevelt and others on FDR's campaign, did not trust the career staff. O'Reilly saw another political appointee with no experience at the Mint Bureau replacing Grant, who had been Denver Mint superintendent before his directorship. After a brief period, the two women came to appreciate each other's merits. Among the issues that the Mint Bureau had to face in 1933 and 1934 was the calling-in of most gold coins. When the Treasury Department issued regulations allowing such coins to be surrendered at branches of the Federal Reserve Bank, O'Reilly sent out a memorandum over her signature as acting director noting that the Fed had no facilities to accept any gold other than bars with a government stamp. At the time, the Mint Bureau was one of the lowest-status branches of the Department of the Treasury, esteemed far less than the Secret Service and other law enforcement- related agencies that fell under the Treasury Secretary. Burdette points out that the gold regulations showed a lack of basic Mint knowledge both by Roosevelt's appointees and the holdover senior officials from the Hoover administration. O'Reilly and C.M. Hester, Treasury Assistant General Counsel, testify before Congress, August 1935 Ross and O'Reilly soon came to the usual division of labor between the director and assistant: the director would handle public affairs and make policy decisions as needed, while the assistant dealt with the day-to-day business of the bureau. Ross undertook a heavy travel schedule, visiting Mint facilities, making speeches backing Roosevelt, and campaigning for Democratic candidates in Wyoming. This left O'Reilly running the Washington office as acting director. The two women carried on a businesslike but warm correspondence during these times, with O'Reilly writing to Ross (who had embarked on a tour of the mints) \\"I am so anxious to have your mind at ease about the office here [in Washington] that I have resorted to rather frequent telegrams. They are so much more direct and up to date than letters ... my love to you and every good wish for the success of your visits to our beloved mint institutions.\\" Scheer suggests that O'Reilly would have found Ross's reports from the field valuable; they showed how the Mint recovered from the initial years of the Depression, when relatively few coins were produced, to the mid-1930s, when strong demand for coinage led the bureau to run the mints with two or even three shifts. In 1935, O'Reilly reached the mandatory federal retirement age of 70. Her knowledge of bureau affairs was so extensive, and was so badly needed, that she was exempted from mandatory retirement by special order of President Roosevelt, at the request of Ross, giving O'Reilly an extra year in the Mint Service. Although Ross supported the extension, she could not be seen as unable to do her job without O'Reilly's assistance, and hired Frank Leland Howard of the University of Virginia, who had a background in accounting, as O'Reilly's prospective replacement. Roosevelt approved a similar extension in 1936, a distinction considered so significant that Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau, Jr. hosted a luncheon in her honor. Roosevelt again extended her federal service by one year in late 1937, though warning that he would not exempt her again. An attempt by Morgenthau to further extend her tenure was turned down by the president the next July, and she retired on October 29, 1938, to be replaced by Howard. At O'Reilly's request, there was no ceremony to mark her retirement, though her fellow employees chipped in to buy her a diamond-encrusted watch, which they persuaded her to accept. President Roosevelt and Secretary Morgenthau sent letters of appreciation for her service. The New York Times carried word of her retirement, but no interview, and a week later editorialized that \\"there is modernity here, too. An answer to America's challenge to women. It points to what women want out of life, and what women can get and give.\\"  Retirement and death  After her retirement, O'Reilly continued to live in her rooms at the Hay‚ÄìAdams residence in Washington. She did not involve herself in Mint affairs; though Morgenthau sent her a few letters, they did not mention business. O'Reilly kept busy by organizing fundraising for Catholic charities. She was not interviewed when the Mint in 1944 investigated how several 1933 double eagles, never officially released, had come onto the market, an omission Burdette finds unusual. O'Reilly died on December 6, 1949 in Washington. Her New York Times obituary recalled that when she had been granted the first extension by Roosevelt, reporters had sought to interview her, only to be met with the following statement:  Notes   References   Sources   * Category:1865 births Category:1949 deaths Category:19th-century American women Category:20th-century American women Category:American people of Irish descent Category:American women civil servants Category:People from Springfield, Massachusetts Category:United States Department of the Treasury officials ","title":"Mary Margaret O'Reilly"},{"id":"45700200","text":"Thomas Banester (by 1529-71), of London was an English politician.

A Caledonian or Pict, as represented in a 19th-century history book  Visual arts  Thematic Pictish history and imagery has been appropriated by multiple contemporary fine artists, most notably American ex-pat Marianna Lines, British artists Lisa Wright and Jon Hodgson, as well as American artist F. Lennox Campello. Fairies and Picts David MacRitchie was an outspoken proponent of the euhemeristic origin of fairies being the folk memory of Picts.Macculloch, 1932: \\"The origin of fairies in a small race of men [though it should be remembered that all fairies are not small] was strongly advocated in more recent times by Mr. David MacRitchie.\\"Silver, 1986; 1998: 47-48. He argued they were rooted in a real diminutive or pygmy-statured indigenous population that lived during the late Stone Age across the British Isles, especially Scotland: MacRitchie developed what became known as the \\"Pygmy-Pict theory\\" in his The Testimony of Tradition (1890) and Fians, Fairies and Picts (1893) regarding fairies to have been folk memories of the aboriginal Picts who in his view were of very small size, pointing to findings of short doors (3 ‚Äì 4 ft in height) of chambers, underground dwellings, long barrows, as well as quoting old literature such as Adam of Bremen's Historia Norwegi√¶ which describe the Picts of Orkney as \\"only a little exceeding pygmies in stature\\". The folklorist John Francis Campbell, who MacRitchie cited, had also written in his Popular Tales of the West Highlands (1860‚Äì62): Robert Louis Stevenson described so the Picts in his Heather Ale poem: > Rudely plucked from their hiding, Never a word they spoke: A son and his > aged father‚Äî Last of the dwarfish folk. Modern archaeological studies demonstrate that the Picts were not significantly different in height from the present-day occupants of Scotland. Examples * Pulp fiction author Robert E. Howard wrote extensively about his romanticized version of the Picts, especially in his short stories revolving around the fictional character Bran Mak Morn, but also in many other of his stories.

He played first-class cricket for Kent County Cricket Club and the Marylebone Cricket Club. He served in the Guards Armoured Division during the Second World War, reaching the rank of Major. Post-war, he trained many horses owned by Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother and other notable owners. He was British jump racing Champion Trainer on three occasions. Personal life Mrs. Cazalet and Children Edward and Victor, John Singer Sargent, 1900‚Äì1901 Peter Victor Ferdinand Cazalet was born at Fairlawne, Shipbourne, Kent on 15 January 1907. He was the third son and youngest child of William Marshall Cazalet and Maud Cazalet. His brothers were Edward and Victor; his sister was Thelma. Edward was killed in action in 1916.; Victor was killed in a plane crash in 1943. He was educated at Eton and Christ Church, Oxford. Cazalet was good at racquet sports and cricket, playing lawn tennis and rackets. William Marshall Cazalet, John Singer Sargent, 1902 Cazalet's father died on 22 October 1932. Shortly afterwards, it was announced that Peter would marry Leonora Wodehouse, the daughter of P. G. Wodehouse. They were married at St Giles' Church, Shipbourne on 14 December 1932. His brother Victor was the best man. They had a son, Edward, and a daughter, Sheran. Leonora died in London on 16 May 1944 during a routine operation. Cazalet was given a few days leave from the army to attend her funeral. Leonora was cremated and her ashes were scattered at Fairlawne. A window in St Giles' Church is dedicated to her. In 1949, Cazalet married Zara Strutt, the former wife of Lord Belper, and daughter of Sir Harry Mainwaring. They had three sons, although one, David, died in infancy. He is commemorated by a silver cross in St Giles' Church. In 1957, Cazalet was nominated for the position of High Sheriff of Kent, a position to which he was appointed in 1960. Zara Cazalet died in 2004 at the age of 87. Their daughter Sheran Cazalet married Sir Simon Hornby, and their son Sir Edward Cazalet became a high court judge. Cricket As a cricketer, Cazalet was a right- handed batsman, sometimes playing as an opener. He played for Eton and scored a century in the Eton v Harrow cricket match at Lord's in July 1926.Cazalet, Major Peter Victor Ferdinand, Obituaries in 1973, Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, 1974. Retrieved 9 October 2018. Wisden, in its 1927 review of public school cricket, wrote that he had been \\"at once the most successful and the best\\" of the school's batsmen: \\"He has the quickness of foot and the nicety of timing that one expects in a good racquets player, but his defence was also good and he was clever at forcing the ball to the on.\\" In 1926 he played one Second XI match for Kent and in September 1927 played at The Oval in a match between the Young Amateurs of Kent versus the Young Amateurs of Surrey, scoring 117 runs. Whilst at Oxford, Cazalet played first-class cricket regularly during 1927 for the Oxford University side. Against Surrey he shared in a first-wicket partnership of 207 with Aidan Crawley, although he contributed only 66 runs, Crawley making 150. The following week against Essex his innings was cited by Wisden as the brightest part of a disappointing batting performance by the University. Following these innings he was awarded his Blue for cricket and appeared in the University Match against Cambridge. In a preview of the 1928 season in The Times, Cazalet was expected to be one of the mainstays of University batting line-up. In a move that was not uncommon at the time, as an established Oxford player he was \\"stood down\\" from the early-season match against Kent County Cricket Club, appearing instead for the county side. He responded by scoring 150, sharing a partnership of 204 with Frank Woolley. The Times commented that Cazalet was not even overshadowed by Woolley, one of Kent's greatest players. Cazalet returned to the Oxford side for most of the rest of the university season, but was not successful, and before the end of June he had lost his place in the side and was not picked for the 1928 University Match. Cazalet did not play any first-class cricket between 1929 and 1931, but reappeared in two matches for Kent in 1932 without making much impact. In all, Cazalet played in 22 first-class matches from 1927 to 1932, scoring 744 runs at an average of 21.88 runs per innings. As well as gaining a cricket blue at Oxford, Cazalet also won blues in racquets, tennis and squash. He was considered a \\"fine all-round sportsman\\" in his Wisden obituary. Pre- war racing career Cazalet started his career as a jockey in point-to-point racing. He came second on Beau Geste at the North Cotswold Hunt in April 1929. In 1930, he moved up to National Hunt racing. He rode Rocquefort II at Haydock Park in December of that year. At this time, Cazalet was building a stable of steeplechasers at Fairlawne. They were trained by Harry Whiteman. Cazalet gave Elizabeth Taylor instruction in horse-riding when she was a girl. Cazalet rode in the Grand National three times. He rode Master Orange in 1934, and Emancipator in 1935 and 1937. In November 1937, Cazalet announced he would retire from riding as an amateur jockey due to pressures of his business interests. He remained an owner, with Whiteman continuing to train his horses. One of Cazalet's final runners before war broke out was at Folkestone, where French Beggar came third on 4 May 1939. Wartime career Following the outbreak of war in 1939, Cazalet joined the Royal Artillery. He transferred to the Welsh Guards, along with his friend Anthony Mildmay. In 1941, the Guards Armoured Division was formed under the command of Sir Oliver Leese and Cazalet was transferred to the new unit. The Armoured Guards landed at Arromanches, Manche, France on 25 June 1944 and served as a reconnaissance unit during the push across Europe before the German surrender in May 1945. In February 1945, it was reported that Cazalet had been wounded in action. Both Cazalet and Mildmay were involved in an action at Visselh√∂vede, Lower Saxony, Germany on the night of 18‚Äì19 April 1945 in which they were attacked by German Marines. The Guards Armoured Division was disbanded at Rotenburg an der W√ºmme, Lower Saxony on 9 June 1945. Post-war career Cazalet started his career as a racehorse trainer in November 1945. He paid 4,000 guineas for the five-year- old gelding Fishermans Yarn at Newmarket. Another of his early horses was The Hood, who was entered for a novice hurdle race at Windsor in March 1946. In the 1946‚Äì47 season, he had 40 winners, 32 of them ridden by Mildmay. In 1949, Cazalet and Mildmay stayed at Windsor Castle as guests of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth. It was during their stay that they persuaded the Queen to buy a steeplechaser, which Cazalet would train. An early success was Manicou, who won the King George VI Chase at Kempton Park Racecourse in 1950. Another of the Queen's horses trained by Cazalet was Monaveen, jointly owned with Princess Elizabeth. Following Mildmay's death in May 1950, Cazalet inherited the horses owned by Mildmay and ¬£10,000. Cazalet also trained the Queen Mother's Devon Loch, who fell on the run-in to the finish line at the 1956 Grand National when clear of E.S.B., who won. Devon Loch subsequently failed to finish. His jockey was Dick Francis, who had been designated as Cazalet's first jockey in 1953. He trained over 250 winners for the Queen Mother and was champion trainer three times. Cazalet's personal chef for eight years was Albert Roux. Cazalet trained Antiar, who won the Ovaltine Hurdle at Fontwell Park Racecourse on 22 December 1962, the last day of racing before The Big Freeze set in. When racing resumed in March 1963, Cazalet had two winners at Newbury on 8 March and four the next day. In the 1964‚Äì65 season, Cazalet had a record 82 winners. By 1967, he had had his one thousandth winner. His final runner was Soundless at Doncaster on 24 March 1973. Death Cazalet died at Fairlawne on 29 May 1973. He was buried at St. Giles' Church; four of his jockeys carried his coffin. A memorial service was held at the Guards Chapel, Wellington Barracks, London on 15 June. Following his death, Fulke Walwyn was appointed trainer to the Queen Mother. Fairlawne was inherited by Edward Cazalet. He was unable to continue the racing stable due to his career as a barrister, and later a High Court judge. In 1979, Fairlawne was sold to racehorse owner Khalid Abdullah.
