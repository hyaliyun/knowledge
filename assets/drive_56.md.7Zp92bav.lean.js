Prior to that date, arbitration was regulated by the Arbitration Cap, 1976 (Cap 6). The Arbitration Act is based heavily on the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration, but modified slightly for application under British Virgin Islands law. Where the parties have agreed in writing that disputes between them are to be resolved by arbitration, the courts must stay any court proceedings in favour of arbitration unless the court determines that the agreement is void.Arbitration Act, section 18(1) (incorporating UNCITRAL Model Law, article 8). The Arbitration Act provides for the creation of a new statutory body called the BVI International Arbitration Centre.Arbitration Act, section 93. However, the organs of that body have not yet been appointed. Draft subsidiary legislation, the BVI IAC Rules, have been circulated for private sector comment, but not yet brought into force. Accordingly, at present all arbitration in the British Virgin Islands is conducted as ad hoc arbitrations. New York Convention The British Virgin Islands acceded to the 1958 New York Convention on 25 May 2014. Prior to that date it was possible to enforce arbitral awards from New York Convention states under the old Arbitration Cap, 1976 which had incorporated the provisions of the Convention into domestic law with effect to the recognition of overseas arbitration awards. However, it was not reciprocal - it was not possible at the time to have a British Virgin Islands arbitration award recognised in another Convention state under the 1958 Convention. The British Virgin Islands courts may only decline to recognise a foreign arbitral award from a Convention state on the following grounds:Arbitration Act, section 86. # that a party to the arbitration agreement was, under the law applicable to that party, under some incapacity; # that the arbitration agreement was not valid ## under the law to which the parties subjected it; or ## if there was no indication of the law to which the arbitration agreement was subjected, under the law of the country where the award was made; # that the person ## was not given proper notice of the appointment of the arbitrator or of the arbitral proceedings; or ## was otherwise unable to present his case; # that the award ## deals with a difference not contemplated by, or not falling within, the terms of the submission to arbitration; or ## contains decisions on matters beyond the scope of the submission to arbitration; # that the composition of the arbitral authority or the arbitral procedure was not in accordance with, ## the agreement of the parties; or ## if there was no agreement, the law of the country where the arbitration took place; or # that the award ## has not yet become binding on the parties; or ## has been set aside or suspended by a competent authority of the country in which, or under the law of which, it was made. # the award is in respect of a matter which is not capable of settlement by arbitration under the laws of the British Virgin Islands; or # it would be contrary to public policy to enforce the award. An award which contains decisions on matters not submitted to arbitration may be enforced to the extent that the award contains decisions on matters submitted to arbitration which can be separated from those on matters not so submitted. Companies Prior to 1 January 2005, when the BVI Business Companies Act, 2004 came into force, it was standard for companies incorporated in the British Virgin Islands to include an arbitration clause in the articles of association. Under the law at the time, this limited the ability of a minority shareholder to seek relief from the courts on the basis of a just and equitable winding-up. The law has since been modified to provide other forms of minority shareholder relief in cases of unfair prejudice.See generally, BVI Business Companies Act, Part XA. Court assistance Arbitration in the British Virgin Islands is intended to be conducted with minimal interferences with, or assistance from, the courts. However the British Virgin Islands court retain jurisdiction to give interim relief to support the arbitration process where required.Arbitration Act, section 43(2). See also BVI International Arbitration Centre The British Virgin Islands International Arbitration Centre (usually referred to as the \\"BVI IAC\\") provided for under the legislation is to officially open on 17 November 2016.

Morand visited New York four times between 1925 and 1929 and shares his experiences from those trips, with a non-native reader in mind. An English translation by Hamish Miles was published in 1930. Synopsis Morand's impressions of New York are both positive and negative. He disapproves of the upper class, the fashion, speakeasies and the area around Times Square. He is impressed by the City Hall and the buildings around Washington Square, which he regards as genuinely American and not false imitations of historical styles. He makes recurring references to the contemporary saying that \\"the Jews own New York, the Irish run it, and the Negroes enjoy it\\". In his conclusion, he writes: \\"I love New York because it is the greatest city of the universe and because its people are the toughest, the only people who, after the war, went on building, and who do not merely live on the capital of the past, the only ones, besides Italy, who do not demolish but construct.\\" Reception The Saturday Review's Theodore Purdy, Jr. wrote about the book: \\"There is a good deal in it that is inaccurate, and the spellings of American names are confused as only a French proofreader can confuse them, yet on the whole M. Morand has seen New York well and truly, as well as in the impeccable perspective of modernity which is so characteristic of all his work.\\" Purdy wrote that the book, in 1930, already was out of date as a guide book, as the skyline, night clubs and fashions all had changed since the author's visits, but wrote: \\"Yet the talent for assimilation, which has always been M. Morand's chief charm, as well as the great obstacle to his chance of writing anything lasting, is in this book ideally employed. Both the native and the passenger on an incoming liner may find things in his book which will bring the life of the city nearer and render it more understandable. In any case, M. Morand's interest in America is liable to repay both himself and the casual reader of his deceptively facile but extremely clever book.\\" References Category:1930 non-fiction books Category:Books about New York City Category:City guides Category:French travel books Category:French-language books Category:Works by Paul Morand ","title":"New York (Morand book)"},{"id":"46239762","text":"Norton's Coin (16 March 1981 - 15 January 2001) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse, best known for his 100/1 win in the 1990 Cheltenham Gold Cup. He was an obscurely-bred gelding owned and trained in Wales by Sirrell Griffiths, a dairy farmer who had only two other horses in his stable. After success on the amateur Point-to-point circuit and in hunter chases Norton's Coin graduated to professional competition as a seven-year-old in 1988. In his first season under National Hunt rules he showed promise and won the Silver Trophy Chase in April at Cheltenham Racecourse. He struggled to win in the following season, but left all his previous form well behind to record his most famous win over Toby Tobias and the favourite Desert Orchid in Britain's most important weight-for-age steeplechase. Norton's Coin was injured in winning the Gold Cup and won only once (a repeat win in the Silver Trophy) in his remaining eighteen races. He developed breathing problems and was retired in 1993. He spent his retirement on Griffiths' farm before dying from a suspected heart attack in January 2001. Background Norton's Coin was a gelding with a white blaze, described by his owner as an \\"ugly, plain chestnut\\". He was the only horse of any consequence sired by Mount Cassino, a fairly useful racehorse but not a top-class performer (rated 92 by Timeform), who recorded the better of his two wins in a handicap race at Sandown Park Racecourse in 1973. Norton's Coin was the only foal produced by his dam Grove Chance, an unraced mare who was descended from Bebe Grande, the leading British two-year-old filly of 1952. Bebe Grand's other descendants have included Lure and the Eclipse Stakes winner Pieces of Eight. At the time of Norton's Coin's conception, both his parents were owned by Sirrell Griffiths, a dairy farmer who kept a few horses at Rwyth Farm near the village of Nantgaredig in Carmarthenshire. He had bought the stallion and the mare for 700 guineas and £500 respectively. Griffiths sold the pregnant Grove Chance to Percy Thomas, who was officially Norton's Coin's breeder. Norton's Coin began his racing career on the amateur Point-to-point circuit and won several races for Percy Thomas. After the horse won one of his two hunter chases in 1987 Griffiths bought Norton's Coin back for approximately £5000 in 1987 and trained him throughout the rest of his racing career. In his point-to-point races and in his hunter chase win, the gelding was ridden by the leading Welsh amateur jockey Tim Jones. In late 1988, Jones was attending a dinner dance for the local point-to-point community when he was asked about the prospects of local horses by the guest speaker Peter Scudamore: Jones told Scudamore that Norton's Coin would win a Gold Cup. Griffiths was the holder of a training permit rather than a full licence, meaning that he was only allowed to train horses which he (or his immediate family) also owned. Racing career 1988/1989 National Hunt season Norton's Coin began his career in professional company by finishing third in a minor handicap chase at Warwick Racecourse in December 1988. Later that month he finished in two handicaps at Hereford Racecourse and then finished fourth when favourite for a similar event at Chepstow in January. Norton's Coin's form began to improve in spring and he recorded his first success when ridden by Richard Dunwoody to ten length win at Bangor-on-Dee Racecourse on 8 March. He made his first appearance at the Cheltenham Festival eight days later when he started a 25/1 outsider for the two and a half mile Cathcart Challenge Cup. Ridden by Hywel Davies, he was towards the rear of the nine-runner field before making steady progress to finish second behind Observer Corps. His win came an hour after Desert Orchid had won the Gold Cup at the same venue. Norton's Coin was moved up in distance for a three-mile handicap chase and won by three lengths from Fair Child. On his final appearance of the season, the gelding was ridden by Dunwoody when he started a 20/1 outsider for the Silver Trophy Chase over two and a half miles at Cheltenham on 19 April. He raced behind the leaders before taking the lead on the run-in and won by two and a half lengths Aughavogue, with the other beaten horses including Beau Ranger, Panto Prince and Golden Freeze. 1989/1990 National Hunt season After a break of more than eight months, Norton's Coin returned on 26 December when he was move up sharply in class to contest the King George VI Chase over three miles at Kempton Park Racecourse. Starting a 33/1 outsider, he was ridden for the first time by Graham McCourt who became his regular jockey. He made several jumping errors and began to tire two fences out before finishing last of the six runners, thirty-nine lengths behind the winner Desert Orchid. A drop back to two miles in January brought no improvement as he finished ninth of ten in the Victor Chandler Chase. Later that month he showed better form when running second in a handicap at Cheltenham, conceding ten pounds to the winner, and then finished third on heavy ground when favourite a handicap at Newbury in February. After the Newbury race, the gelding contacted a throat infection which interrupted his training. Griffiths had entered the horse for the Gold Cup early in the season but Norton's Coin's moderate form and health problems led him to look for alternative targets at the Cheltenham Festival. When he realised that the horse was ineligible for the Cathcart, and had missed the entry deadline for the Mildmay of Flete Handicap Chase, he reverted to his original plan and allowed him to take his chance in the championship race. Griffiths said that he was hoping to finish in the first six in order to recover the £1,000 entry fee. On 15 March 1990 Norton's Coin, ridden by McCourt, started at odds of 100/1 in a twelve-runner field for the 63rd running of the Cheltenham Gold Cup. On the morning of the race, Griffiths milked his cows before driving the trailer carrying his horse to the racecourse. Desert Orchid was made the 10/11 favourite ahead of Bonanza Boy (winner of the Racing Post Chase and Welsh National) and the Jenny Pitman- trained Toby Tobias. The other contenders included Cavvies Clown (Jim Ford Challenge Cup), Nick The Brief (Irish Gold Cup), Maid of Money (Irish Grand National), Yahoo (runner -up in the previous year and winner of the Martell Cup) and Pegwell Bay (Mackeson Gold Cup, December Gold Cup). McCourt allowed the outsider to race at the back of the main group but moved steadily forward and was close behind the leaders Desert Orchid and Ten of Spades at the end of the first circuit at which point Pegwell Bay, Yahoo and Toby Tobias were also well-placed. At the third last he was in a close fourth behind Desert Orchid, Ten of Spades and Toby Tobias, with most of the other runners beginning to struggle, and moved up into second behind Toby Tobias and the tiring Desert Orchid at the next fence, where Ten of Spades fell. Norton's Coin moved up alongside Toby Tobias at the final fence and got the better of a prolonged struggle on the run-in to win by three quarters of a length, with four lengths back to Desert Orchid in third place. The winning time of 6 minutes, 30.9 seconds was the fastest in the race since 1953. The winning prizes were presented by the Queen Mother, who told Griffiths \\"I think it's marvellous to think that you've only got two horses and you can win a race like this. To think that my husband and I had racehorses almost all our lives and we haven't won a race like this\\". Although the major bookmakers took few substantial bets on the horse, many minor betting shops in Wales sustained heavy losses owing to strong support from local gamblers. Despite the financial damage he had caused, Norton's Coin was invited to \\"open\\" a betting shop in Cardiff in May. 1990/1991 National Hunt season In the following season, Norton's Coin did not appear until January when he fell at the tenth fence in the Newton Chase at Haydock Park and then finished third behind Celtic Shot and Toby Tobias at Cheltenham. He failed to complete the course in his next two races, refusing at a fence in the Irish Gold Cup and falling at the third last when attempting to repeat his 1990 success in the Cheltenham Gold Cup. Later in the spring of 1991, Norton's Coin showed improved form. On 4 April in the Martell Cup at Aintree he recovered from a bad mistake at the second last to take the lead final fence but was overtaken on the run-in and beaten one and a half lengths by the Martin Pipe-trained Aquilifer. Two weeks later at Cheltenham he was matched against Pegwell Bay and the outstanding two-mile chaser Waterloo Boy as he contested the Silver Trophy Chase for a second time. McCourt settled the gelding in third place before taking the lead from Pegwell Bay at the last and held off the late challenge of Waterloo Boy to win by a head. On 4 May Norton's Coin made his first and last appearance over hurdles when he finished second of the ten runners in the Grade 2 Staffordshire Hurdle, a length behind the winner Randolph Place. In June he made his only appearance in a flat race when he was ridden by Lester Piggott in the Queen Alexandra Stakes at Royal Ascot. Starting at odds of 10/1 he never looked likely to win and finished eighth behind Easy To Please. Later career Norton's Coin failed to win in his two remaining seasons. Griffiths believed that the horse's loss of form was due to a failed surgical procedure intended to correct a breathing problem. In the early part of the 1991/1992 National Hunt season he finished second to Katabatic at Chepstow and then produced his best effort of the season in the Peterborough Chase at Huntingdon Racecourse finishing four lengths second to Sabin du Loir and a short head in front of Desert Orchid at level weights. In the King George VI Chase at Kempton he came home last of the five finishers behind The Fellow, Docklands Express, Remittance Man and Toby Tobias. After finishing fifth in the Agfa Diamond Chase he appeared for the third time in the Cheltenham Gold Cup but made no impact and was pulled up by McCourt after the third last. In his two remaining races that season Norton's Coin fell at the second fence in the Martell Cup and finished last of the four runners behind Katabatic, Waterloo Boy and Golden Freeze in the Silver Trophy. In his final season, Norton's Coin showed no worthwhile form in three races. He finished last at Wincanton in October and last again at Chepstow in November. On his last appearance he was dropped in class for a minor handicap at Newbury in February but was already out of contention when he refused to jump the third last fence. Retirement After retiring from racing, Norton's Coin returned to Griffiths' farm in Wales and was never ridden again reportedly enjoying his life of leisure and remaining in excellent health until the age of 19. On the morning of 15 January Griffiths turned the horse out into the field and returned to find that the horse had collapsed and died, probably from a heart attack. Griffiths commented; \\"He was one of the family, but we can't do much about it. It's a pity we can't all go the same way instead of suffering goodness knows what\\".

The title lends its name to the House of Carpio.  History  The Marquessate of Carpio has its origins in the Señorio del Castillo de Carpio which was founded in 1325 by García Méndez de Sotomayor. The Marquesado del Carpio was originally tied to the title of a Grande de España granted by King Phillip II of Spain in 1559. The title was bestowed upon Diego Lopez de Haro y Sotomayor on 20 January 1559 in recognition of his services to the crown, however the Grandeeship may have been revoked or not inherited at some point along the line as another Grandeeship was conferred onto the Marquesado by King Philip IV of Spain in 1640 which was granted to Diego de Haro y Haro, 5th Marquess of Carpio and Count of Morente. It is further unclear whether the first Marquess of Carpio was in fact Diego López de Haro y Sotomayor. Some sources record Diego López as the I Marques and others record Diego López' father Luis Méndez de Haro y Sotomayor as the I Marques. What does appear clear is that Luis Méndez was indeed the 9th Señor del Carpio inheriting the title from his parents and that his son Diego López was also the Marques. Whether the title was conferred upon the 9th or 10th Señor del Carpio appears to be the main question. Luis Méndez inherited the Señorio del Carpio from his mother Beatriz Portocarrero Cárdenas in 1528 according to Margarita Cabrera Sánchez. If the date of the upgrade to a Marquesado is accurately put at 1559, it would seem that the first Marques of Carpio was indeed Diego López de Haro y Sotomayor which is backed by the Real Academia de la Historia.

They were added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 November 2003.  History  Early 19th century The Norfolk Island pine trees at 127 Shore Street North, Cleveland, were planted most likely in the early 1860s by Brisbane Valley squatter Francis Edward Bigge, an enthusiastic promoter of Cleveland as a rival to Brisbane as the state capital. The trees are located on part of allotment 8 of section 6, Town of Cleveland, alienated from the Crown in 1853. During the 1830s Cleveland was known as Emu Point, a jumping-off point to Dunwich on Stradbroke Island. Despite some early setbacks, Cleveland would eventually become the centre of the developing Redlands district. Pastoral settlement spilt down the range from the Darling Downs into the Brisbane River Valley during the early 1840s. Squatters who took up runs here included young English brothers Frederic William and Francis Edward Bigge at Mount Brisbane, which they established in 1841. Frederic returned to England , but Francis remained in Queensland for over thirty years. A member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly from 1851, and of the Queensland Legislative Council from 1860 to 1873, Francis Bigge was the principal advocate for the establishment of Cleveland as the port for Moreton Bay in the 1840s and 1850s, and held substantial financial interests in the colony. He visited England briefly in the 1850s, where he married in 1857, returning to Moreton Bay in 1858. It is believed that on their return, the Bigges lived mainly at Cleveland, leaving Mt Brisbane in the hands of a manager. By 1868, Francis Bigge had three addresses listed in the Post Office directories: Mr Brisbane Station, Cleveland and Brisbane. The pastoralists of the Darling Downs and West Moreton adopted Ipswich (then called Limestone) as their main supply centre. However, the squatters' interests at Ipswich ran counter to those who wanted Brisbane as the commercial centre and chief port of the region. Exports such as wool could be transported directly from Ipswich to Cleveland, thus bypassing the convict-tainted Brisbane with its river mouth blocked by a bar. Francis Bigge and other pastoralists invested heavily in the port of Cleveland. One 19th century commentator estimated that Bigge eventually spent over two decades in efforts to develop Cleveland into an export outlet. The Brisbane versus Ipswich (and, by implication, Cleveland) argument was often heated. The Moreton Bay Courier of 14 January 1850 reported an Ipswich public meeting which called for a shift of the port to Cleveland. Francis Bigge thundered: \\"The ships for Great Britain would receive at Cleveland Point the produce of the country. They would there load their passengers who, as they passed up to Ipswich in the steamers, would give a cheer for dirty Brisbane\\". Surveyor James Warner noted in 1841 that Cleveland offered the only apparently eligible site for a maritime township along this shore of Moreton Bay. By 1842 a track linked Cleveland with Coopers Plains, Ipswich and beyond. This may be the track reported to have been marked out by Francis Bigge and Arthur Hodgson of Eton Vale on the Darling Downs. However, it took another decade of squatter agitation for Cleveland to be officially surveyed. The claims of Ipswich and the squatters were seemingly sunk by the well-known story of the visit to Cleveland by New South Wales Governor George Gipps in 1842, when he was forced to flounder through low-tide mud lying between the Shamrock and the shore. Brisbane offered a most attractive locality elevated upon the riverbank, but was hampered by the river mouth bar and sixteen miles of meandering river. Ipswich, although more easily accessed by the Darling Downs squatters was even further from the Bay. When the Governor became mired in Cleveland's low-tide mudflats, so too were that centre's claims. With the low-tide mudflats regarded as a more serious barrier to ship-borne trade and communications than the bar at the mouth of the Brisbane River, Brisbane gained the upper hand in its desire to become the principal port and the new colony's capital. Bigge and others pressed their claims regardless. Bigge and others began to develop Cleveland despite a lack of official surveys. In June 1847 the Moreton Bay Courier reported that some private dwellings had been built. In the same year the first light was erected at Cleveland Point to guide shipping, and a stone jetty was completed. In 1849 Bigge built a large brick hotel. Standing empty for some years, it was known as \\"Bigge's Folly\\", but today this building (with an additional storey and 'renovated') is now the heritage-listed Grand View Hotel. Although legend has it that Bigge's Folly was erected initially as a private house, other accounts have it purpose-built as a hotel. In 1849 Bigge, John Balfour of Colinton and other squatters petitioned the New South Wales Governor to survey land already reserved for the Town of Cleveland. This survey was completed in 1850 and a town was proclaimed in December of that year. William Pettigrew noted at the time that: \\"The talk of late has been about Cleveland ... All eyes are ... set on Cleveland ... A great many of the Sydney people are going to purchase land there as they are sure that Cleveland will become the chief port\\". At the first auction on 13 August 1851, eighty lots were offered for sale. This land would become the nucleus of the township of Cleveland, officially renamed from Emu Point in July 1851 for the Duke of Cleveland. At this first land sale a number of Sydney people speculated in Cleveland allotments, including Edmund Tobias of Sydney who purchased several acres. Balfour and Bigge also bought heavily. Balfour's half a dozen allotments comprised over twenty acres, and Bigge purchased (or was a partner in) a dozen allotments totalling some seventeen acres. Late 19th century In 1852 Francis Bigge commissioned John Petrie to erect a store at Cleveland, and by March 1853 exports were expected to commence next boiling season. In 1853 Bigge built accommodation for his employees – the building at the corner of Paxton and Shore Streets later used as a courthouse and now a restaurant (the heritage-listed Old Cleveland Court House). However, the October 1853 sinking of the Countess of Derby when crossing the South Passage on her way to collect a large quantity of wool and tallow from Messrs Robert Graham & Co was a blow to Cleveland. Then fire in January 1854 destroyed the brig Courier and virtually its entire cargo of 400 bales of wool. This second disaster prompted Graham to abandon Cleveland, and move his headquarters to Brisbane. Despite these setbacks some further development continued. The Moreton Bay Courier of 26 August 1854 reported that \\"heading from Bigge's Folly towards the point, we passed two other substantial brick cottages ... but both uninhabited\\". Published in 1859, Rambles at the Antipodes described Cleveland as \\"one of the most interesting spots in the neighbourhood ... celebrated for some rather abortive attempts at the establishment of a more convenient shipping place than Brisbane itself\\". Clearly Cleveland's time as potential port or colonial capital had passed, despite the efforts and expenditure by Bigge and others. The writer claimed, possibly erroneously, that Cassim's Hotel was very isolated, the nearest resident being a fellmonger, upon a creek four miles off. It is possible that a number of residences had been abandoned or were used only as summer houses. An unsourced item probably dating from the early 1870s, held by the Royal Historical Society of Queensland, describes standing on a comparatively high background where there were two hotels and a few small cottages, and from there \\"a track sloped a short distance ... to the lighthouse ... Descending the slope, the first private dwelling on the right was a good-sized cottage, built and owned by Mr Bigge, who a few years previously had returned to England, whereupon his Cleveland retreat was much in favour with certain Brisbane families\\". Francis Bigge occupied the land on which the Norfolk Island Pine trees stand, sometime between 1859 and 1863, if not earlier. The land comprised four allotments originally alienated in 1853: two purchased by Sydney speculator Edmund Tobias (allots 7 & 8, sec 6, Town of Cleveland), and two by Moreton Bay squatter John Balfour (allots 9 & 10, sec 6, Town of Cleveland). Bigge purchased allotments 9 & 10 from Balfour on 31 December 1859. Conveyance of allotments 7 & 8 from Tobias to Francis Edward Bigge of Cleveland was made in October 1863. It is likely that neither Tobias nor Balfour built upon their allotments, but Bigge had erected a house at Cleveland overlooking Moreton Bay by March 1864, apparently on the land he had acquired from Balfour and Tobias. In March 1869 Bigge applied for a certificate of tile for allotments 9 and 10, by which time he had sold the property to politician and Darling Downs squatter Joshua Peter Bell of Jimbour Station. These two allotments comprised in total, and were valued at , suggesting that the property had been improved, and likely contained Bigge's residence. The property at this time was also subject to a lease from 1864 for 7 years, to a Mr Tubbs, but it is not known whether this applied to the whole of allotments 9 and 10. At the same time, Bigge also transferred allotments 7 & 8 to Bell. The total holding then comprised . JP Bell was one of the most influential men in Queensland, and in the 1870s was a co-founder of the Queensland National Bank. The Cleveland property remained in his ownership, apparently mainly tenanted, until his death in 1881. In 1882 title was transferred to William Finucane, who retained ownership for two-and-a-half decades. Photographer William Boag travelled Queensland between 1870 and 1878 with his horse-drawn darkroom, undertaking commissions, photographing places across Queensland, and selling prints of \\"spec\\" photos. In November 1871 Boag travelled the southern shores of Moreton Bay. Amongst the photographs he took there is one showing a pair of Norfolk Island Pines – juvenile, but well above house height – standing where Shore Street begins to rise as it heads northwards to the Point. These are thought to be the two landmark Norfolk Island Pines on Bell's property. The same photograph shows several other denser trees surrounding the Norfolk Island Pines, which possibly includes the extant fig tree. 20th century A 1906 photograph taken from near the front of Cassim's Cleveland Hotel, looking northwards towards Cleveland Point, shows the Norfolk Island Pines, one already split, towering over the surrounding tall vegetation. Subsequent photographs of the 1910s and later, confirm the pines' local landmark status. These later photographs also clearly show the mature surrounding trees. It seems reasonable to assume, given the maturity of both the pines and adjacent trees in 1906, that it is these trees which were photographed in 1871. The whole of the Shore Street property subsequently passed to Catherine Byrne in 1906. In 1911 the house and garden on just over (allotments 9 & 10 and subdivision 2 of allotment 8 (now BUP103110)) were transferred to the Bernays family, who occupied it until Mrs Bernays' death in 1949. An anonymous chronicler of Cleveland history whose memoirs are kept at the Redlands Library, wrote of how Mrs Bernays had every reason to be proud of her home and its beautiful garden, most of which had been planted by its previous owners. \\"She always used to tell me that she would never allow the Norfolk Island Pines to be cut down as they were such a guide to boatmen as they came to Black's Jetty at night. She had often been thanked by the men after a wet night as the trees stood out against the background of the Brisbane light glare.\\" Black's Jetty extended into Moreton Bay from behind Cassim's Cleveland Hotel, to the south of Mrs Bernay's property. These landmark Norfolk Island Pines and their associated trees must be viewed in the context of the efforts by Francis Bigge, Balfour and others, during the 1840s and 1850s, to establish Cleveland as the leading port and export outlet for Darling Downs and Brisbane Valley produce. Already by 1906 the pines had grown to a landmark height, towering over the surrounding vegetation. It is not surprising that throughout the 20th century local mariners used the distinctive pair of trees as navigational guides.  Description  Trees in 2015 The Norfolk Island Pine trees are located at 127 Shore Street North, along the road leading to Cleveland Point, nearly halfway between the former Cleveland Hotel and Paxton Street, on the eastern side of the road. The trees The maturity of the Norfolk Island Pine trees suggests that they were planted in the 19th century, and photographic and documentary evidence suggests that they are likely to date to the middle of the century, probably planted as a part of the 1860s garden surrounding Francis Bigge's cottage on Shore Street North – the site now occupied by Norfolk Pines home units.  Heritage listing  Norfolk Island Pine Trees was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 November 2003 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Norfolk pine trees are important because of their association with the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history, in particular the attempts of Brisbane Valley and Darling Downs squatters to establish Cleveland as a port and colonial capital to rival Brisbane. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The Norfolk Island pine trees have a special significance for the seagoing community of Moreton Bay, as their prominent position has provided a navigational landmark for Moreton Bay sailors throughout the 20th century. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The trees have a strong association with squatter Francis Edward Bigge, who was prominent in the serious, but failed, mid-19th century attempt to establish Cleveland as the principal port of Moreton Bay.

In his later years he became a party functionary in the German Democratic Republic. Life Early years Porombka was born in Zabrze, a substantial conurbation east of Breslau and close to Kattowitz. His father, also called Vinzent Porombka, was a miner who would end his life as a murder victim in the Groß-Rosen concentration camp. Long before that, when Vinzent Porombka was aged 4, the First World War broke out. Less than a year after that Zabrze was renamed as \\"Hindenburg\\", to honour the German military commander on the Eastern front who had recently received much public adulation following his victory at Tannenberg. Porombka was still a child during the period of revolutionary turmoil that followed German defeat in the war. He later obtained a job as a dairy worker in 1925/26, and then worked as a miner from 1926 till 1930. After 1930 several years of part-time working alternating with unemployment ensued. Political activism In 1927 he joined the Roter Frontkämpferbund (RFB / Red Front Fighters' League) and in 1930, the year of his twentieth birthday, the Young Communists. In 1931 he was sentenced to ten months imprisonment for Breach of the peace. 1933, a year of regime change in Germany, started with the Nazi Party taking power in January. They lost little time in establishing a one-party dictatorship. Membership of political parties (other than of the Nazi Party) became illegal. 1933 was the year in which Vinzent Porombka joined the Communist Party, and by March he was back in jail. In June he was transferred to the newly opened Esterwegen concentration camp. He was released in December. After his release he continued with his illegal party activity, becoming the Communist Party's local leader for the Beuthen sub-district. He also worked as an instructor with the Young Communists. In August 1935 his political activities in Upper Silesia came to an end when he fled to Czechoslovakia, where he based himself just across the border, in Steinau, and supported himself as a stone worker. He also undertook \\"border work\\" for The Party in nearby Karvin and Ostrava. In July 1936 he was arrested, but he managed to escape, while being deported to Germany, and ended up spending a further three months working illegally in Czechoslovakia. Fighting Fascism From November 1936 Porombka was participating in the Spanish Civil War as a member of the XIIIth Dabrowski Brigade. He also became a member of the Spanish Communist Party. At the start of 1939 he was involved in fighting in North Catalonia where he left a bag with a comrade who was killed shortly afterwards. The Francoist soldiers found his bag with the body of the dead comrade, and inside the bag they found Porombka's Red Aid membership card which included his home address and photograph. The papers found their way back to Condor Legion (which was sponsored by the German government), and from there the erroneous message was passed to the Gestapo that \\"Red Porombka\\" from the Rokittnitz quarter of Hindenburg (formerly known as Zabrze) in Upper Silesia had been killed: as far as the German authorities were concerned he was now dead.Vinzent Porombka: Ein Totgesagter taucht wieder auf. In: Hans Maaßen (Ed.): Brigada Internacional ist unser Ehrenname ... Erlebnisse ehemaliger deutscher Spanienkämpfer. Vol 2. Militärverlag der DDR, Berlin 1974, p. 474ff. He was nevertheless interned in France between February and June 1939, after which he succeeded in being relocated to the Soviet Union in a \\"medical evacuation\\". He began his new life in the Soviet Union as a lathe operator at the tractor plant in Chelyabinsk. In 1942 he was drafted into the Labor army (Трудовая армия). By the end of 1942 he had been enrolled on a special parachutists' course in Moscow. Porombka used this training on 27 April 1943 when he was the designated radio operator in a three-man team parachuted into Germany, landing near Insterburg (then in East Prussia). Their mission involved establishing contact with ant-Nazi resistance members in Germany. It was left to Porombka to report back on the operation. He reported that the other two, Otto Heppner and Adolf Kaim, had failed to complete their part in the mission. Still in Germany, he was able to visit his parents in May 1943. Since he had been reported killed in the Spanish Civil War back in 1939 they must have been delighted to see him, but they had to tell him that two of his younger brothers had by this stage been killed in the fighting. Unfortunately the Gestapo also became aware that he was still alive, and they put his parents in concentration camps.Berliner Zeitung, 22 March 1970, p. 16. In 1945 his father was murdered in the Groß-Rosen concentration camp. Following his instructions from the Communist Party Central Committee, Porombla had made his way to Upper Silesia where he made contact with local party members. Together they worked to expand anti-Nazi resistance in the area and to expand cooperation with Polish resistance movements to the east. Relations with the large resistance group in Ruda, headed up by a Communist called Rudolf Krzyszczyk, were close, and involved a particular focus on disrupting German army transport. Krzyszczyk's arrest early in 1944 placed Porombla in greatly increased danger. The Gestapo launched a search for him and circulated a \\"wanted\\" sheet to party locations. He was obliged to change his radioing habits. Despite his extensive network of contacts he was unable to find a safe hiding place. In order to avoid endangering his comrades he therefore moved his base out of Silesia, across into (formerly) Czechoslovak territory. He now got rid of his radio transmitter for some time, and in July 1944 fled to Ratibor and Ostrava.Wolfgang Schumann: Deutschland im Zweiten Weltkrieg. Vol 5: Der Zusammenbruch der Defensivstrategie des Hitlerfaschismus an allen Fronten. Januar bis August 1944. Pahl-Rugenstein, Köln 1984, p. 308. End of the war By the time the war ended, formally in May 1945, he had been able to return to Upper Silesia and to resume radio contact with Moscow. Of the many agents parachuted into Germany by the Soviets during the war, Vinzent Porombka was unusual in having survived till the end of the fighting.Helmut Roewer, Stefan Schäfer, Matthias Uhl: Lexikon der Geheimdienste im 20. Jahrhundert. Herbig, München 2003, , p. 355. His hometown of Hindenburg being in the east of the country, the Red army arrived on 26 January 1945. By that time Porombka had been back in Upper Silesia for several weeks, working with the illegal regional Communist Party under the leadership of a man called Roman Ligendza. At the end of January he was received by the Soviet military commander and worked with the new municipal administration. A couple of months later, however, in March 1945, Ligendza and Porombka were parachuted into Chemnitz, further to the west in Germany.Neues Deutschland, 23 February 1958, p. 3. The end of the war marked the end of Nazi Germany. Vinzent Porombka made his new life in what had been the central part of Germany and was now the Soviet occupation zone. In mid-1945 he was working for the Red Army General Staff as a simultaneous translator, before relocating to the western occupation zones where for a few months he worked for the (no longer illegal) Communist Party. In 1946 he returned to the Soviet occupation zone and joined the newly formed Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED / Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands). The SED was the result of a contentious political merger, presented as a consolidation of the previously split political left, but after a couple of years former members of the (more moderately left-wing) SPD had been excluded from positions of influence with varying levels of persuasion. By the time, formally in October 1949, that the Soviet occupation zone became the German Democratic Republic, the new SED had come to be seen by many as the old Communist Party with a new name. From May 1946 Porombka was working as a courier and transport supervisor for the Soviet authorities. In 1950 he started to work in the \\"General Department\\" of the Central Secretariat, and was also employed in the new country's important Party Central Committee. In 1970 he reached his 60th birthday. This was the year in which he resigned his Party Central Committee duties on health grounds.

The disaster occurred in the Coalbrook coal mine of Clydesdale Colliery on 21 January 1960 at around 19:00 when approximately 900 pillars caved in, almost 180 metres underground. The mine is situated in the Northern Free State, 21 km south west of Vereeniging. About 1,000 miners were in the mine at the time and 437 died after being trapped, while the rest escaped through an incline shaft. The miners were suffocated by methane gas and crushed to death by rockfall. Miners felt a strong blast wind, many of whom rushed up to the surface but were instructed to return underground or face imprisonment. Only two miners refused to go back underground. The majority of the miners at Clydesdale Colliery were Basutoland and Portuguese East Africa nationals. Immediately after the incident, rescue teams arrived from other mines in the region and boreholes were drilled into areas where survivors were expected to be. When microphones were lowered, no signs of life were detected. After 11 days the rescue was called off. Causes of the disaster The production at the mine had increased from 134 230 tons per year in 1954 to 2 260 660 tons per year by 1958, in response to the newly built Taaibos power station at Kragbron. The accident was caused by cascading pillar failure where a few pillars fail initially and this increases the load on the adjacent pillars causing them to fail. This cascading failure caused pillar collapse over an area covering 324 hectares. Factors contributing to the collapse included the process of top coaling which raised the height of the tunnels and pillar and panel mining reducing the size of structures holding up the tunnel roof. Top coaling Top coaling began as a method of increasing production in areas that had already been mined. In 1932 the tunnels were 2.4 m high, in 1948 some top coaling was done to raise the height to 3.7 m, but the coal yielded was a poor grade and the practice stopped. In 1951 top coaling began once again as a new electricity power station had been built and it was able to use lower grade coal. The roof height was raised to 4.3 m and 5.5 m in places, and by 1957 top coaling was a significant contributor to production. Some time between 1957 and 1959 experimental secondary mining was done in No.10 section to recover coal from a mined out area of the mine. Top coaling raised the roof height to between 4.3 and 6.1 m. On 28 December 1959 a collapse occurred in the northern part of the section 10 mine, an area where most of the top coaling experiments were done. That collapse was stopped from spreading by a barrier wall to the south end of section 10. This incident did not affect coal extraction from the south. However, it did go unreported to mining inspectors. It is reported that in the afternoon of 21 January 1960 miners who were operating in the western part of the section 10 mine heard loud noises that were trailed by a strong blast wind that was coming from the south east section. Pillar and panel mining The tunnels in the mine were between 6.1 and 6.7 metres wide. Pillars and panels of coal were left between the tunnels to keep the mine roof from collapsing. *In 1905 the centres of the barriers and the pillars were 24.4 m apart *From 1932 the pillars were mined to 19.8 m and barriers to 18.3 m. *From 1943 the pillars were reduced to 18.3 m and the barriers 12.2 m (still separated by tunnels 6.1 to 6.7 m in width) In this time \\"dummies\\" of 4 metres wide and 2 metres deep were mined out of the barriers, and in some cases up to four sides of the pillars too, to yield additional coal. Rescue efforts With too much methane and carbon monoxide in the mine for any rescue team to penetrate the South East of section 10, one of the solutions was to drill from the surface all the way down into the entombed shaft. A sophisticated new drill rig at the time was used, but the drill bits wore down as they encountered hard lava rock. Response In the months following the disaster, four different inquiries were launched under the Mines and Works Act of 1956, with the third one being a judicial inquest. The inquests found that the deaths occurred as a result of the subsidence of the mine itself. They also revealed that the collapse of 28 December was not reported to mining inspectors, as was mandatory. Following the disaster, the South African government established Coal Mines Research Controlling Council to improve coal mine safety and research pillar strength, supported by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research and the Chamber of Mines Research Organization. The South African Chamber of Mines obtained rescue equipment to reach men trapped underground in coal mines. Similar equipment was used to rescue trapped Chilean miners in 2010. Compensation With segregation being a policy of governance for the Apartheid regime, the Workmen Compensation Act entitled a white widow to her deceased husband’s pension fund, while a black widow was only granted a lump sum from the mining company. Of the miners killed in the tragedy, half of them came from the then British High Commission Territory of Basutoland, while a little under half of the others came from Portuguese East Africa. Of the deceased, six were white South African men. The disaster sent shockwaves across the nation, which prompted the government to set up the National Mine Disaster Fund. Commemorations 21 January 2020 will mark exactly 60 years since the disaster.

Manik Nagar is located on high slope grounds. Manik Prabhu temple lies on the outskirts of Humnabad, a kilometer away from this taluka. The temple is located on the confluence of two rivulets Viraja and Guru Ganga. People believe that Manik Prabhu, the renowned saint, was fourth incarnation of Lord Dattatreya. There was Political and religious chaos between two communities, Hindu and Muslim, and were the riotous times. Manik Prabhu had an envisioned these two streams (communities) come together and lead a peaceful life. Due to this prognostic vision, even today both Hindus and Muslims visit Manik Nagar every year to pay homage to the Great Founder of Universal Truth, the Sakalmata. Muslim community considers Shri Prabhu to be an Avatar of Mehaboob Subhani, a Muslim Saint. Originally, a small hut was constructed to establish the GADI, or the Spiritual Seat, which in time to come was to be associated with the living spirit of Shri Manik Prabhu Maharaj. Sitting on the Gadi, he would give Darshan to audience and His very Darshan would give peace and contentment to all who visited Maniknagar. In the Durbar, the people gathered would bask in the aura and the benevolent grace of Shri Prabhu. The entire atmosphere would be surcharged with spiritual splendour. Shri Prabhu would cast his compassionate glance on all, making everybody participate in the bliss, which he was experiencing. Maharaj Manik Prabhu ji Mahasamadhi When Prabhu realised that the time had come to shed mortal body and be one with eternity. As Shri Prabhu was reluctant to disclose the time of his own departure to all, he took only three or four persons into confidence, those who understood the significance of his Avatar (incarnation). The news was kept in utmost confidence and all the required work was carried on with a smile on the face but with remorse in the heart. He advised them, On the tenth day of Margashirsha, Shri Prabhu decided to summon the Durbar, so that people could have his final Darshan. All arrangements were made for Shri Prabhu to sit in as comfortable a position as was possible. Maha-Samadhi of Shri Prabhu inside the temple The next day was Ekadashi, the eleventh day of the month. For Hindus it is one of the most auspicious day. This 29th day of the month of November 1865 was the day on which Srhi Prabhu had decided to take Samadhi and merge His Self with the Supreme Self. Before samadhi He called two sons of His brother Narisimha and blessed them and thus the line of succession to the Gadi (spiritual seat) was laid down for all to know. He made the elder one Manohar the successor to Gadi by transferring His Eternal Energy to him. Thus the Guru-Parampara of Shri Manik Prabhu Sampradya was established for all time to come.

It was built from 1847 to 1952. It is also known as One Mile Cemetery. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Gravestone of Emmie Agnew in Dunwich Cemetery The first burials at Dunwich cemetery are believed to date from 1847 and it is one of the earliest surviving cemeteries in Queensland. The European settlement of Stradbroke Island began in 1827 when a convict out-station was established at Dunwich to serve the Moreton Bay convict settlement based at Brisbane town. During 1827-28 a warehouse and accommodation for convict labourers, boatmen and soldiers were constructed. However, this settlement at Dunwich was short lived as problems with unloading goods in poor weather, smuggling, and hostile Aborigines, resulted in the closure of the out-station in 1831. Between 1843 and 1847 the first Catholic Mission to Aborigines in the Australian colonies was established at Dunwich, with four Passionist Fathers occupying the former convict buildings. The mission failed, largely due to the poor state of the buildings in which it was accommodated, and the high degree of exposure of the indigenous peoples of Stradbroke Island to Europeans. However, Dunwich continued to be utilised by the government for a variety of institutional purposes for which its isolation rendered it particularly suitable, both for health reasons and in response to social and cultural values of the time. Quarantine procedures were instituted in Australia in 1841 and in the following year Moreton Bay was thrown open to free settlement. In late 1849, in consideration of the numbers of free settlers who were expected arrive in Moreton Bay, the Colonial Secretary requested the Police Magistrate in Brisbane to suggest a suitable site for a quarantine station. North Stradbroke Island was proposed and in July 1850, Dunwich was gazetted as a quarantine area. At this time, some burials had already taken place at Dunwich, presumably at this site. The first is believed to be that of sailors from the ship Sovereign in 1847. Within two months of the opening of the quarantine station, the ship Emigrant, with an outbreak of typhus on board, reached Moreton Bay. The ship was ordered into isolation at Dunwich, where a further 26 of its passengers died. They were buried at the cemetery, along with the Queensland Surgeon-General, Dr David Keith Ballow, and the ship's doctor, Dr George Mitchell, both of whom attended the immigrants. In 1867 the quarantine station was transferred to Peel Island, and the Queensland government officially established the Dunwich Benevolent Asylum in the former quarantine buildings, although Asylum inmates were housed at Dunwich from as early as 1864. The Asylum accommodated the elderly, disabled or infirm who had no other means of support. At the time, institutionalisation was considered to be the appropriate treatment of those who were unable to fulfil a useful role in society. Accommodation on an island close to Brisbane, yet separated from it, effectively removed Asylum inmates from society and made administrative control easier. The isolation of the island also made it a useful place to treat conditions believed to be infectious and a lazaret was established at nearby Adam's Beach in 1892, where it remained until moved to Peel Island in 1907. From 1896 the Dunwich Benevolent Asylum housed inebriates. Consumptive patients were also taken until 1935, but were accommodated in isolation \\"camp\\". In 1946-7 the Dunwich lands were subdivided and the remaining Asylum inmates, mainly aged people, were removed to the Eventide Home at Sandgate, occupying the site of the former RAAF Station Sandgate. All the Dunwich ward buildings were sold, dismantled and either moved to different sites within a newly surveyed Dunwich township, or removed to the mainland for government purposes. In June 1947 the Dunwich Benevolent Asylum was officially closed and the area was redeveloped for residential and other private purposes. In the 80 years spanning 1867-1947, 8,426 former inmates of the Dunwich Benevolent Asylum were buried in the Dunwich Cemetery. Those buried are believed to include many who were descended from the traditional owners of Stradbroke Island. After cleaning up the grounds in late 1947, control of the cemetery, which was on Crown Land, passed to the Department of Health and Home Affairs, though it was a matter of some dispute as to who should be responsible for its maintenance. It was not an official cemetery reserve and proposals to proclaim it as such were suspended in 1949, as Trustees had to be appointed. The cemetery was officially closed to further burials in 1952. Though a local, Power Irvine Nelson Dickson, acted as an honorary caretaker in the 1950s, the cemetery gradually fell into disrepair as headstones and grave markers suffered from vandalism and theft. In 1970 the Redland Shire Council agreed to become Trustees for the cemetery, providing that the government carried out the necessary survey. This was completed in 1973 and on 13 April 1974 the area was officially gazetted as a cemetery reserve with the Redland Shire Council as Trustees. Restoration work was carried out on the cemetery in 1987/88 with the aid of Bicentennial grants and plans were made for a memorial wall. This was constructed of bricks from the former Asylum laundry, which had been demolished, by the sand-mining company Consolidated Rutile Limited, in honour of all the inmates lying in unmarked graves. Nameplates have been attached to it as the names of those buried have been confirmed by research. A metal sign listing the names of the 26 immigrants buried at Dunwich was unveiled in the cemetery in 1993.  Description  Dunwich Cemetery overlooking Moreton Bay, 2015 Dunwich Cemetery overlooks Moreton Bay and is bounded to the west by a camping area. It is otherwise circled by Flinders Avenue, Bingle Road, East Coast Road and Yabby Street: a section on the north west faces a jetty. The reserve comprises an open grassed area scattered with mature trees and extends over . The cemetery is thought to contain approximately 10,000 burials, largely those of inmates of the Benevolent Asylum, though most of these are unmarked. Entrance and columbarium, 1999 The cemetery reserve is entered from Flinders Avenue on the south through a gateway at the centre of a brick columbarium. In the north western corner are a cluster of memorials including those of the 26 passengers from the Emigrant, which are identified only by metal trefoil markers and a modern metal sign bearing all their names. Nearby are the graves of Dr David Ballow and Dr George Mitchell who attended them. The memorial over the Ballow grave is in the form of a sarcophagus and that over the Mitchell burial a stone obelisk; metal railings enclose both. There is also a memorial to Dr Patrick Smith, the first Medical Superintendent of the Benevolent Institution from 1885 to 1900 and sundry other memorials. Near these memorials is a triangular brick structure, enclosed by a metal railing and bearing nameplates. This is constructed of bricks from the old Asylum laundry and commemorates those lying in unmarked graves. There is also a cluster of memorials on the north east side of the cemetery and scattered across the reserve.  Heritage listing  Dunwich Cemetery was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Dunwich Cemetery is one of the earliest surviving cemeteries in Queensland and is associated with the early European settlement of North Stradbroke Island and the Moreton Bay Region. The burials of passengers from the 1850 typhus epidemic aboard the Emigrant and those of the doctors who treated them are evidence for the early use of North Stradbroke Island as a quarantine station. The large number of burials of inmates of the Benevolent Asylum between 1867 and 1946 link the cemetery to this important phase in the history of the Island. They are evidence for 19th and early 20th century government policies and community values regarding health and social welfare that determined the isolation of the poor, elderly, infirm and diseased from the mainstream of society. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The reserve has a long association with the community of Stradbroke Island and has particular significance to the descendants of those buried in the cemetery.

In January 2015, he retired from his position as a Deputy Attorney General for the California State Attorney General's office to devote himself to music. Biography Bass grew up in Cincinnati, Ohio, and began studying piano at the age of seven. He was accepted to the Berklee College of Music in Boston, but dropped out after a few months to pursue a less formal and more adventurous musical path which included studying composition with George Russell, who had begun teaching his Lydian Chromatic Concept of Tonal Organization at the New England Conservatory of Music and piano with Madame Margaret Chaloff.Jazz Inside magazine interview . April 2015. pp. 32-35. In 1974 he started touring internationally with singer Brenda Lee. He performed with Lee until 1975, after which he relocated to San Francisco. While in San Francisco, Bass performed with the young Bobby McFerrin and with vocalist Jackie Ryan, drummer/percussionist Babatunde Lea and others in various Bay Area venues, including the Keystone Korner. Ryan joined Bass’ band \\"Ad Infinitum,\\" which also featured Babatunde Lea who had a steady Wednesday night gig at a Mission District venue, Bajones, with a large, jazzy salsa ensemble with whom Bass played piano and wrote arrangements. Bass also had a steady solo gig at the Trident in Sausalito. Ultimately, Bass moved to Maui to work with Ryan, remaining there from 1981 through 1984. During that time, Bass also served as the Entertainment Director for the Royal Lahaina Resort, where he performed with his Latin jazz group, his jazz trio, and as a solo pianist. In 1984, Bass relocated to Southern California, where he planned to continue his career as a pianist and composer, but one night, on his way to the Orange County Center for the Performing Arts where he was about to perform, he slipped on a pool of oil and fractured his wrist in an attempt to break his fall. Bass was told that there was no guarantee that, once his wrist had healed, he would be able to play again. Legal career With a family to support, he chose to enroll in college at the University of California at Irvine, earning his B.A. in social ecology and graduating summa cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa in 1989. He went on to attend the UCLA School of Law, where he was an editor of the UCLA Law Review, clerked in the Sacramento legislative office of the American Civil Liberties Union and, in 1991, served as legal extern to the Honorable David S. Levi, U.S. District Court Judge for the Eastern District of California. Bass earned his J.D. in 1992 from the UCLA School of Law. Immediately out of law school, Bass joined the international law firm, Pillsbury Madison & Sutro where Bass practiced general litigation for four years. In 1996, Bass joined the California Office of the Attorney General. At the Attorney General's office, Bass began in the Employment, Administration and Regulation Section, eventually moving to the Civil Rights Enforcement Section. Return to music In December 2008, after a few years playing casually with friends around Sacramento, Bass returned to the studio to record Gone, his first album as a leader. He recorded ten original compositions with saxophonist Ernie Watts, Babatunde on percussion, bassist Gary Brown, and vocalist Mary Stallings. The album reached No. 2 on the JazzWeek national radio play charts. At All About Jazz, Karl Ackermann wrote, \\"listening to what Dave Bass has done on Gone exemplifies the capabilities of an artist who can combine a big-picture mindset and diverse talents. It's a great platform for the kind of musical and intellectual aptitude that can bridge varied attributes of an abstract process.\\" Bass returned to the studio in 2012 to record NYC Sessions (Whaling City Sound). The album includes saxophonist Phil Woods, drummer Ignacio Berroa, trombonist Conrad Herwig, and bassist Harvie S, with guest vocalist Karrin Allyson. NYC Sessions reached No. 5 on the JazzWeek national radio play charts.[March 16, 2015] http://www.jazzweek.com/pdf-archive/ The album received a four-star review from DownBeat magazine in its May 2015 issue with the comment that the album \\"proves deeply satisfying in part because it does so may things so well [including] Bass' savvy as an arranger and programmer [...] not to mention his own sparking keyboard work.\\"DownBeat, May 2015, p. 56.

Multi-instrumentalist and Jazz At Lincoln Center Orchestra stalwart, Ted Nash, co-produced No Boundaries and played on all but one track, featuring Dave in the classic piano trio setting with Bud Powell’s “Hallucinations.” The band includes Carlos Henriquez (also from JALCO) on upright bass, Jerome Jennings on drums and Ted Nash on flute, alto flute, clarinet, bass clarinet, soprano sax, alto sax, and tenor sax. Vocalist Karrin Allyson returns to work with Dave singing one of Dave’s originals, “Time of My Life” and Dave’s arrangement of Rodgers & Hammerstein’s “If I Loved You.” On three Afro-Cuban cuts three native Cubans appear: Carlos Caro (bongo, perc.), Miguelo Valdes (conga, bata) and Mauricio Herrera (timbales, maracas, perc.). No Boundaries was played nationally and internationally, with a 15-week span on the JazzWeek charts, peaking at #13.https://www.jazzweek.com/charts/1574096400/november-18-2019/ The reviews of No Boundaries were laudatory. All About Jazz wrote “Bass hauls piano ass through the closing ‘Hallucinations’ like a jackrabbit with its tail on fire, tangling and untangling complicated and crackling lines like electric lightning. [On the Latin numbers] Bass “plays two different active lines simultaneously, twinkling and wrinkling the upper register while his left hand stomps out rhythm with flamenco fury – simply great Latin jazz piano.”https://www.allaboutjazz.com/no-boundaries-dave-bass-whaling-city- soundDownBeat describes Bass as “a highly effective bebop player, who also has a way with Afro-Cuban rhythms [and] proves his mettle in collaboration with Nash.http://www.downbeat.com/digitaledition/2019/DB1911/single_page_view/53.html Latin Jazz Network writes “Dave Bass, his fluid pianism, together with the extraordinary musicianship of Ted Nash and the rest of the ensemble is most affecting, suggesting that – indeed – there is no real boundary between the music of the world, just gloriously stylistically idiosyncratic ways to express the joy of song and dance. . . . Take the opening, “Lennie’s Pennies”, Swing Theory”, “Hallucinations” at the end or, somewhere in the middle of the repertoire, “Siboney” –classics of their period and style of playing. In Mr Bass’ hands they’re magically sinuous affairs – both in terms of his own approach as well as in the arrangements for others to follow. The way in which he colours the melodic lines and reaches into the various parts of the choruses with subtlety is magical. Or sample “Siboney” and his own composition, “Danzón #1” to marvel how the music is simultaneously intimate, yet possessed of an elegant gravity.”https://latinjazznet.com/reviews/cds/dave-bass-no-boundaries/ Capital Public Radio in Sacramento wrote, \\"Dave Bass’ new album is rapidly climbing the national jazz chart. The recording spotlights Bass as an original composer and pianist capable of delivering clean lines at quick tempos. On “Siboney,” a romantic Cuban song from 1929, Bass and company exemplify soulful lyricism at its finest. Ted Nash on soprano saxophone and Bass on piano transport the listener to an imaginary island of warmth, passion, grace, and beauty.”http://www.capradio.org/music/jazz/2019/09/03/ear-to-ear-heres-what- capradios-jazz-hosts-are-loving-this-september/ References Further reading  Category:American jazz pianists Category:American male pianists Category:American jazz composers Category:American male jazz composers Category:1950 births Category:Living people Category:Musicians from Cincinnati Category:California lawyers Category:Berklee College of Music alumni Category:University of California, Irvine alumni Category:UCLA School of Law alumni Category:20th-century American pianists Category:Jazz musicians from San Francisco Category:Jazz musicians from Ohio Category:21st-century American pianists Category:20th-century American male musicians Category:21st- century American male musicians ","title":"Dave Bass"},{"id":"46240441","text":"Barah Khamba Chhatri at Jalsen Talab Jalsen Reservoir is a famous pond in Hindaun City, Hindaun Block in Rajasthan, India.

Education and career She became professor of social policy in 1975 at the University of Bergen, Norway, and shifted her later research focus to comparative poverty studies within an interdisciplinary framework. She initiated the Comparative Research Programme on Poverty (CROP) in 1991. In a few years it became one of the major programmes under the International Social Science Council (ISSC). The foremost aim of CROP was to provide a scientific framework for the understanding of the many facets of poverty and to create an international arena where poverty researchers from different regions and disciplines could meet and exchange experiences. Research Øyen, through her research on poverty, has been responsible for developing the notion of poverty production. This according to Øyen is the fourth phase of understanding and reducing poverty. It follows the first stage; tale telling, the second stage; client focused and development research, and the third stage, knowledge building about poverty reduction. According to Oyen, the subsequent and fourth stage of research then should be that of poverty production which entails \\"understanding the processes that produce poverty and continue to produce poverty at a rate no present poverty reducing measures can possibly win over or even compete with production\\".Øyen, E. (2004). Poverty production: a different approach to poverty understanding. In Advances in Sociological Knowledge (pp. 299-315).

It is thus necessary, in order to reduce poverty, to identify these actors and to examine their motivations. Despite this however, Øyen is careful to mention that such an exercise must not be a witch hunt as the purpose of identification is not punishment.

The facts  In late February 1945, the 109th Garibaldi Brigade, was moving across Piedmont (N.W. Italy) which at the time was occupied by German troops and held by the Italian MVSN, (\\"Milizia Volontaria per la Sicurezza Nazionale\\"). During the march, a detachment of \\"Zoppis\\" made up of 33 partisans, stopped to rest in a farmhouse in the Province of Vercelli. In the early hours of March 1, they were taken by surprise and taken prisoner by a Command of Italian Fascist soldiers. The thirty-three men were all taken to different places and a group of twenty-one was led towards the small town of Biella. The Fascista soldier then pretended to create an exchange with German prisoners. but in Salussola, after a whole night of torture and violences documented by the only one survivor,\\"Zona Libera, 15 marzo 1945\\" Witness (in Italian) of Sergio Canuto Rosa \\"Pittore\\" filed, a few days after the massacre, at the Command of the Free Zone. Preserved in the Museum of Salussola. the prisoners were killed by machine guns at dawn on March 9, 1945. The massacre was intended as a reprisal to an attack conducted a few days earlier by other Partisans to a column of military trucks of the \\"Montebello\\"’s Fascist Command, which were moving through Salussola. A truck was destroyed in the attack and four soldiers killed. The victims memorial of the Salussola's slaughter (1945) conserved in the Town Museum.

Mainly used to conceal the true identity (it was a clandestine army) the Alias name outlined also in most cases the character and the personality of the owners. It thus enabled at the same time to hide oneself outside, and to be recognized inside among the other Partisans for a personal, moral or physical characteristic.http://www.anpi.it/media/uploads/patria/2009/3/10-15_COLOMBARA.pdf Tom, Lupo, Fulmine e gli altri L’universo dei nomi di battaglia partigiani (Tom, Wolf, Lightning and the others: the univers of the Partisans' war names) * Buscaglino Francesco alias \\"Barbera\\" born in Pray (Bi) on 1902 * Costa Luigi alias \\"Gigi\\" born in Masserano (Bi) on 1906 * Foglia Bruno alias \\"Ebano\\" born in Crevacuore (Bi) on 1926 * Marchesini Valter alias \\"Orlando\\" born in Crevacuore (Bi) on 1925 * Menti Gino alias \\"Colassi\\" born in Pray (Bi) on 1914 * Nicolini Angelo alias \\"Budda\\" born in Cureggio (No) on 1925 * Ortoleva Giovanni alias \\"Iacon\\" born in Isnello (Pa) on 1921 * Picco Giuseppe alias \\"Trento\\" born in Roasio (Vc) on 1916 * Pela Francesco alias \\"Cirillo\\" born in Pray (Bi) il 1893 * Ronchi Antonio alias \\"Figaro\\" born in Lessona (Bi) on 1920 * Riboldazzi Guido alias \\"Pulcino\\" born in Crevacuore (Bi) on 1923 * Rocca Florindo alias \\"Lince\\" born in Crocemosso ora Vallemosso (Bi) on 1920 * Rocca Giulio alias \\"Gino\\" born in Crocemosso ora Vallemosso (Bi) on 1920 * Sesia Gaudenzio alias \\"Sesia\\" born in Novara on 1925 * Salis Gerardo alias \\"Palmiro\\" born ind Asigliano (Vc) on 1926 * Tempia Valenta Edo alias \\"Brunello\\" born in Mezzana (Bi) on 1926 * Tondi Enrico alias \\"Vecio\\" born in Lessona (Bi) on 1900 * Tondi Dante alias \\"Legnano\\" born in Lessona (Bi) on 1915 * Tugnolo Rolando alias \\"Dispari\\" born in Collobiano (Vc) on 1926 * Tosin Valentino alias \\"Bissa\\" born in Mezzana (Bi) on 1911 See also * Sant'Anna di Stazzema massacre * Lidice * Kľak * Oradour-sur-Glane * Ochota massacre * Khatyn massacre * Italian Campaign (World War II) * List of massacres in Italy * German war crimes References Sources * ad memoriam (in Italian) audio testimony of the only partisan who escaped the massacre * \\"Sala dell'eccidio\\" (in Italian) \\"Slaughter's room\\" set up in the Museum-Laboratory of gold and stone in Salussola. * I 20 trucidati names and images of the 20 murdered partisans. * Statement made by the priest father Giuseppe Dotto on October 19th 1945 the commander of the Police Station of Salussola.

The VOOC Flash Charge circuit technology reportedly lowers the temperature of the charging adapter, and creates an interface from the adapter to the phone, which, OPPO claims, improves the speed and safety of the charge. VOOC 2.0 has been licensed to OnePlus as the Dash Charge technology. A single-cell, 30-watt (5 V/6 A) version of VOOC 4.0 has also been licensed to OnePlus as Warp Charge. OnePlus does not market its phones as VOOC-compatible despite the fact that VOOC 2.0 and Dash are compatible. In June 2019 Vivo teased Super FlashCharge technology capable of up to 120W charging. , VOOC has been licensed to 14 other corporations, most of which are in the phone charging and power strip industries.

Oppo's mobile DAC, Oppo H1-2SE, also features VOOC charging.  Technology  All versions of VOOC require a proprietary cable to work. In addition to electrical requirements like thickness (low electrical resistance) to handle the high currents without overheating, the VOOC 2.0/Dash protocol requires a fifth pin on the (USB-A to USB-C) cable to communicate through. Without such communication, the charger runs at a limit of 5 V/1.5 A. From VOOC 4.0 this limit elevated to 5V/2.0A. On the Android phone end, the VOOC communication code is open source under GNU General Public License (GNU GPL) version 2 as a part of the modified Linux kernel, and has been used by custom ROMs like Lineage OS. The firmware code for PIC16F microcontrollers on the \\"VOOC IC\\" is also defined in the code. There is some rudimentary documentation provided by OnePlus, which mentions a BQ27541 battery gauge chip made by Texas Instruments, with Dash-specific protocol extensions. The source code allows a list of parts used for the technology to be made: for example, the Find X uses a pic1508/stm8s chip on the adapter and a bq25882 two-cell charger chip on the phone. The BQ27541 gauge is exchanged for a BQ28Z610 gauge which can handle two-cell battery packs.  Marketing  OnePlus has recognised the weakness of many other mobile phones with fast charging technology to significantly slow down the charging speed during operation of the device, using it as an opportunity to promote Dash Charge enabled devices, which do not throttle the input power during operation.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAy6uRtZcwY OnePlus 3T charging speed comparison with Google Pixel XL during commute in car (uploaded January 26th 2017)  Other charging technologies  * USB-PD and PPS * Qualcomm's Quick Charge * Mediatek's Pump Express * Huawei's SuperCharge References Category:Battery charging Category:Chinese inventions ","title":"VOOC"},{"id":"46240517","text":"Pyotr Ivanovich Sholokhov () was a Russian realist artist, who was a member of the Union of Russian Artists as well as the Association of Revolutionary Visual Artists.

Sholokhov was a teacher of drawing in Verhniy Karachan in the Gribanovsky district. In 1950 he visited Borisoglebsk, where he created many works capturing different parts of the city. Pyotr Ivanovich is known for the portrait genre, landscape, as well as still life. Many of his works are dedicated to landscapes of Borisoglebsk and its surroundings. Still Life(1960th.) In 1941, Pyotr Ivanovich was drafted into the army, and while being at the front, he managed to paint decorations and portraits of generals, posters and nameplates on the graves of the perished. He was able to freely cite poetry of Vladimir Mayakovsky and Sergei Esenin, and argue on contemporary tendencies in the art world. In his free time, the artist painted military landscapes where he showed dugouts, burnt forests, and the remains of peasant's houses and roads. A sketch for the painting \\"The Wounded\\" (1942) Sholokhov was named «The singer of Borisoglebsk and its surroundings». In postwar years he worked on industrial themes, creating famous paintings such as «The Plant of Hammer and Sickle». Pyotr Ivanovich was a Professor of Art History in a studio of the publishing house «Pravda». In 1982 he donated more than 100 works to numerous art museums in Voronezh and Borisoglebsk. The paintings of this author are kept in the Tretyakov State Gallery in Moscow, as well as in Yasnaya Polyana, Melikhovo, and various museums in Serpukhov and Taganrog.Коммуна  Legacy  Pyotr Sholokhov was a highly-skilled painter of the socialist realism period, and he inspired other artists including his nephew Boris Anatolievich Sholokhov. His last personal exhibition took place in 1982 on Begovaya street in Moscow. While realism was largely abandoned in the West in the 20th century, the Soviet state was devoting vast resources to supporting traditional landscape and portrait artists. In 2000, an art gallery under his name was opened in Borisoglebsk in the Voronezh oblast. The art gallery is a branch of Etnographical museum. It is located in an old mansion of a Russian merchant. In this gallery there are over 300 pictures, 70 of which are painted by Sholokhov.Картинная галерея им. П. И.

Employees from all divisions of Microsoft are free to take part in Microsoft Garage activities and small-scale innovation projects. The Microsoft Garage is a global program with locations on the main campus in Redmond, Washington, and several others spread all over the world, and a website that launched in October 2014 to share experimental projects with customers. For project teams that want to move their ideas forward, Garage resources include collaboration with experts to help accelerate project development. These experts consult with project teams who want to ship a trial through the Garage, sharing guidance on all aspects of project development including engineering, design, go-to-market, and analytics. Project teams own their project from ideation to retirement — they design, code, build, release, and support their project. These teams are as small as two and as large as twenty+ people. Teams that win the annual worldwide Hackathon, produced by The Garage, get to meet members of the top level leadership teams to discuss their project and receive direction. The Hackathon and other Garage activities are driving culture change across Microsoft by empowering employees to take risks and try new things.  History  The Microsoft Garage originated in 2009 in Office Labs in Building 4 of Microsoft Redmond campus with Office Labs GM Chris Pratley, Quinn Hawkins, Jennifer Michelstein and Joe Coplen. The name was coined by Quinn based on the fact that many tech companies were \\"started in a garage\\" and the term captured the notion of innovation and the start-up culture. The impetus was that Microsoft needed a safe space where employees could pursue ideas that they were passionate about, even ideas that were not part of their day job, or things that might \\"fail fast\\". The Garage was originally called \\"The Office Garage\\" and was limited to projects focused on office worker productivity. At the time of The Garage's founding, there were several other better-funded programs inside of Microsoft focused on grassroots innovation including IdeaExchange. These programs focused on having employees submit and vote on ideas with the highest-voted ideas receiving some level of funding. What differentiated The Garage was the slogan \\"Doers. Not Talkers.\\" The premise of The Garage was that ideas were cheap and not that valuable, and that execution and prototyping were far more valuable. The Garage focused on supporting employees who were already building their projects and were willing to build it themselves vs. seeking funding. The first Garage event was the \\"Garage Office Science Fair\\" where all employees, regardless of department, were invited to demo their projects to executives from the Microsoft Office group in Building 36. The next step was the creation of an internal email group and a series of bi-weekly events called \\"Stay Late And Code\\" (SLAC). Soon employees with projects not focused on office worker productivity asked if The Office Garage could be expanded to include other groups and Pratley agreed. However, rather than directly funding science fair or SLACs for groups outside of Office, The Garage would seek an internally champion within the business group to obtain funding from the group's executives. This meant that the leaders of the business group were financially invested in the success of The Garage and did more to support it. Bing was one of the first groups outside of Office to have a science fair. During this period Liane Donald and Jane Boise were the primary event organizers for The Garage. International expansion also happened organically. Engineer Sidharth Sehgal at Microsoft's Hyderabad campus began organizing SLACs in India and eventually secured funding for a Hyderabad science fair. The first Garage space opened in July 2011 in Building 4. The space included a working/meeting space with two large working garage doors, a laser cutter and a 3D printer. In September 2011, The Garage helped publish its first Garage project to the general public: Mouse without Borders developed by Microsoft engineer Truong Do. Garage volunteers assisted Truong by designing and developing the installer and setup for Mouse without Borders. By the end of 2012, The Garage had 3,000 members, grassroots Garage chapters in ten locations around the world, and eight Garage Interest Groups (GIGs) including Makers, SQL, Surface, and Bing. By mid-2013, there were more engineers getting involved, and — because of the emphasis on innovation and inspiration — the activities got the attention of leaders in what was then called the Technology & Research group. Eventually, The Garage moved under Jeff Ramos to be part of T&R; in the Engineering Excellence group. There were resources to support “maker” activities and hands-on learning sessions for employees who wanted to experiment, and small “chapters” forming in engineering groups in Microsoft locations around the world. Throughout this period, The Garage continued to retain its identity as the place for pursuing ideas, being creative, and learning new things in an open environment. In late 2013, a dedicated Garage facility was built in Building 27 South on Redmond campus, and Garage activities like hackathons and hands-on coding sessions were occurring on a regular basis. In early 2014, Satya Nadella, as the new Microsoft CEO, began to socialize the priority of having a “growth mindset.” Nadella had earlier shown interest in The Garage, and he held his first all- company meeting streamed from The Garage space in B27. Garage principles were well aligned to the growth mindset, so when the senior leadership team at Microsoft wanted to evolve the Company Meeting to align to their new vision and support culture change, a Garage-type hackathon seemed like it had potential as a company-wide event. By this time, The Garage — still focusing on hacking and innovating in free-form style — had a couple of vendors, an FTE program manager, and a team nearby who often helped when needed. They were running more planned and curated events in The Garage space as demand grew. In July 2014, The Garage produced the first company-wide hackathon. It was an online and in-person event aimed at giving employees an opportunity to set aside time to work with others on a project that interested them. More than 11,000 people registered from 80 countries and created more than 3,000 projects. The Hackathon has grown to be the largest private hackathon on the planet, most recently with more than 23,500 registrants at 45+ locations and 5800+ projects. But more than scope, what makes the Microsoft hackathon unique is that it is open to everyone in the company, not just coders, from any role, any skillset, any division, any team, any location worldwide. Anyone with an idea or with a passion and interest can jump in and participate. Sometimes the ideas turn into something “shipable” through the Garage experimental outlet or in a product, and sometimes the value is just in the experience. There are also a huge number of philanthropic projects in the Hackathon, and the “Hack for Good” activities are an important component of the overall event. In October 2014, The Garage launched the first set of lightweight, cross-platform apps created by incubation teams across the company. When the Microsoft Garage website was made public at www.microsoft.com/garage, there were 16 different applications available for various operating systems such as Google Android, Android Wear, iOS, Windows, Windows Phone and the Xbox One. In February 2015 Microsoft launched a new wave of Android and Windows Phone applications, one of them previously being a Nokia application. Since then, some projects have been marked \\"experiment complete\\" and there continue to be applications and small-scale projects released through the Garage site. In January 2016 Microsoft announced plans to open additional facilities in other Microsoft worldwide offices. The first Garage location outside Redmond opened in the downtown Vancouver, BC, office in June 2016. Next, a Garage facility was opened in Herzelia, Israel, in July 2016, followed by a site in the Microsoft Silicon Valley campus in August 2016, in Beijing, China, and Hyderabad, India, in March 2018, and Cambridge, Massachusetts, in April 2018. In Redmond as well as the global sites, the Garage is a key asset in accelerating culture change at Microsoft through programs and engagements that focus on a growth mindset, customer obsession, diversity and inclusion, and One Microsoft.

At left is Carrie Pringle\\"Caroline (Carrie) Mary Isabelle Pringle (1859–1930)\\", Wagner200 website, accessed 28 March 2015. Carrie Pringle (Caroline Mary Isabelle Pringle) (19 March 1859 - 12 November 1930) was an Austrian-born British soprano singer. She performed the role of one of the Flowermaidens in the 1882 premiere of Richard Wagner's Parsifal at the Bayreuth Festival. Unproven rumours associate Wagner's supposed infatuation with Pringle with the circumstances of his death in Venice in 1883. Life Carrie Pringle was born in Linz, the daughter of Basil Pringle, a landowner and amateur violinist, and Isabella, née Latinovics de Borsód, whose family originated from Hódság (then in Hungary, now Odžaci in Serbia), and who was a talented pianist.Gadd (2011), Vaszonyi (2013). During her youth the family lived in Germany and Italy.Vaszonyi (2013). The conductor Hermann Levi had heard Pringle sing in 1878; it seems to have been on his suggestion that Wagner auditioned Pringle in 1881 for the role of a Flowermaiden; in Act II of Parsifal these characters have an important scene in which they attempt to seduce the eponymous hero, on the commands of the magician Klingsor. Although Levi, who was to conduct the work's premiere, was uncertain about her, she was engaged.Cormack (2005), pp. 20–21. Pringle was the only one of the original Flowermaidens not to be re- engaged for the 1883 production of Parsifal, and moved with her parents and siblings to London. In England her career was fitful and she apparently never appeared on the opera stage again. Other members of the family also sought musical professions, including her brother Godfrey Pringle (1867–1900) who wrote two operas. Pringle and her mother both gave music lessons, and she herself sought by advertisement engagements for theatres and seaside piers during the holiday seasons.Gadd (2011); Cormack (2009), pp. 96–7. Pringle never married; she died in Brighton in 1930 of ovarian cancer.Cormack (2009), p. 98. Pringle and Wagner Advertisement by Carrie Pringle in The Musical Times of 1 November 1895, containing testimonial of Frederick Bridge. Although Pringle's audition with Wagner in 1881 was indifferent, she performed well in the first production of Parsifal. Wagner was particularly keen on the 'Flower Scene' in the opera, and at this point shouted \\"Bravo!\\" at many of the sixteen performances in the Bayreuth Festival Theatre, much to the disgust of the audience (which presumably did not realize who was enthusing).von Westernhagen (1979), pp. 395–6. Wagner also enjoyed the company of the Flowermaidens offstage: Cosima Wagner recorded in her diary for 3 August 1882 \\"[Richard] sits by the stove...amidst the Flowermaidens and talks jokingly with them\\".Cited in von Westernhagen (1979), p. 396. In Wagner's own essay on the Parsifal production (1 November 1882), he gushed: \\"I do not believe that the enchantment of girlish grace expressed in singing and acting has ever been conveyed...in a manner which can stand comparison to that of the young ladies, true artists, who performed this scene in Parsifal.\\"Cited in von Westernhagen (1979), p. 397. However, in the event, in the opinion of those around Wagner, Pringle proved too undisciplined and was 'overparted'.Cormack (2009), p. 96.  Wagner's death  Wagner died at the Palazzo Vendramin Calergi in Venice of a heart attack on 13 February 1883. There is some evidence that earlier in the day, there had been some argument between him and Cosima, on the subject of which there is no record.Newman (1976) IV, p. 697, pp. 711–2; von Westernhagen (1979), p. 397. The memoirs of the criminologist Alexandre Lacassagne, published forty years after Wagner's death, include the first suggestion that this argument was associated with Pringle: \\"In February 1883...[Wagner] gave out his intention of engaging Miss Pringle, but met with serious opposition all round. He flew into a violent temper and had a sudden apoplectic seizure to which he succumbed in half-an-hour\\".Alexandre Lacassagne, tr. H. Wilson, A Green Old Age, London, 1923: cited in Cormack (2009). p. 96. Other writers embroidered this tale, to claim that Pringle had been Wagner's lover since 1882. A further elaboration has been that Pringle was intending to visit Wagner in Venice, prompting Cosima's displeasure.Cormack (2005), p. 22; Cormack (2009), p. 92; Baker (2008), p. 277; von Westernhagen (1979) p. 397. The Wagner scholar Stewart Spencer has demonstrated the complete absence of any first-hand or documentary evidence to support such stories.Spencer (2004). The only material connecting Pringle to Wagner's death is a telegram of condolences sent by the Pringle family from Milan after the event.Cormack (2005), p. 21. Nevertheless, in the words of David Cormack, \\"The 'English Flowermaiden killed Wagner' story refuses to give up the ghost.\\"Cormack (2009), p. 95. In Jonathan Harvey's 2007 opera about Wagner's last day, Wagner Dream, which assumes that Wagner and Pringle had an affair, Carrie Pringle appears onstage in a spoken role.Andrew Clements, Wagner Dream, The Guardian, 3 May 2007 (accessed 28 March 2015) Notes Sources * Baker, John A.

The game has several game modes and a multiplayer battle mode. The impetus for the game—the concept of combining elements from Tetris and Boggle in what was a prototype of the puzzle video game Puzzlejuice—inspired Gage to create SpellTower. The game released for iOS in November 2011 to generally favorable reviews. Versions for OS X and Android followed over the next two years. In 2017 SpellTower Minutes was released. This browser-based Flash game created special \\"blitz\\" like modes not found in the mobile releases. A new iOS version released in 2017 swapped out the unnamed dictionary and began using Merriam- Webster's Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged. French and Dutch language specific versions were also released. A 2020 release, SpellTower+, added new game modes, cleaner visuals, and a jazz soundtrack.  Gameplay  In the iPad puzzle video game SpellTower, the player attempts to clear the screen of jumbled, lettered tiles by using them to create words. The player can select adjacent and diagonal tiles to create words, which clears those tiles from the screen. If the player creates a long word with five or more tiles, any adjacent tile will be cleared as well. Additionally, difficult characters like X, Q, and J, will remove an entire row when used in a word. Some tiles are blank and can only be cleared by such an adjacent effect. There are several game modes. In Tower mode, the player has 150 set tiles and tries to remove as many words as possible before running out of options. In Puzzle mode, for each set of tiles removed from the board, another row is added to the screen. The game ends when the tiles fill the screen. While Puzzle mode waits for the player's turn to add more tiles, Rush mode adds new tiles every few seconds. A later update added a multiplayer battle mode, where players can face each other across local Bluetooth connections.http://toucharcade.com/2012/04/05/spelltower-multiplayer-update- hitting-tomorrow/ In battle mode, each completed word sends tiles to their opponent's screen.http://toucharcade.com/2012/02/20/multiplayer-and-more- coming-to-spelltower-in-new-update/  Development  Developer Zach Gage The concept behind Puzzlejuice (pictured)—to combine Tetris and Boggle—inspired Gage to create SpellTower. When indie developer Zach Gage was first told about a video game that combined Tetris and Boggle, he had a very specific idea of how the game would play. But after seeing that the prototype of Puzzlejuice played differently, he created—with the developer's permission—the version he imagined as SpellTower. Gage's game eventually released prior to the game that inspired it. SpellTower released for the iPad tablet computer on November 17, 2011.https://www.engadget.com/2011/11/17/spelltower-chickon-superman-and-lots- of-other-ios-releases-tod/ A month later, Gage added support for iPhone and iPod Touch, and Game Center achievements. In 2012, Gage added local multiplayer support over Bluetooth in a new battle game mode.http://toucharcade.com/2012/09/21/spelltower-on-iphone-5-adds-ipad- puzzle-mode-looks-great/ Gage later released versions for OS X (July 25, 2012)https://www.destructoid.com/spelltower-is-out-for-mac-and-it-s-like- crack-231966.phtml and Android (March 7, 2013). The Android release is identical apart from the omission of word lookup. It also supports local Wi-Fi multiplayer and high score competition via Scoreloop.http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-03-05-spelltower-is-finally- coming-to-android Gage and developer Jack Schlesinger rebuilt SpellTower from scratch to better accommodate changes made since its original release. The new version, SpellTower+, has a revised look, a new soundtrack, iCloud backup, and new game modes.  Reception  The game received \\"generally favorable\\" reviews, according to video game review score aggregator Metacritic. Edge called it a \\"magnificent ... brainteaser that's nervy, humbling, and strangely energizing\\". The title was one of TouchArcade honorable mentions for 2011 game of the year.http://toucharcade.com/2011/12/23/toucharcade-game-of-the- year-2011-superbrothers-sword-sworcery-ep/ A year later, TouchArcade said the game remained among the best on the App Store.http://toucharcade.com/2012/11/02/top-ten-best-ipad-game-classics-for- ipad-mini/ In 2012, SpellTower was named among IGN underrated iOS word games.http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/03/29/six-underrated-iphone-word-games Edge compared the game's tension to that of Resident Evil survival horror, though noted that Tower mode was much less tense than the game's Puzzle modes. The reviewer highlighted the role of strategy in both modes, as a small word might fare better than a large word in maintaining the growth of the Puzzle mode tower.

It is made up of “a group of interested experts involved in the application of anthropometry data for design purposes.”http://www.codata.info/taskgroups/TGanthro/index.html History WEAR was first proposed in 2000 at an International Ergonomics Association (IEA) meeting. The strategic plan was drafted at the first working meeting in Paris, France in 2002. The first workshop was at the IEA in Seoul, Korea in 2003. Since then there have been working meetings and symposiums in USA, South Africa, Brazil, China, Australia, Canada, The Netherlands, Japan, New Zealand and Spain. WEAR gained support from the International Council for Science (ICSU): Committee on Data for Science and Technology (CODATA) in Berlin, Germany in 2004.

To create a searchable resource like WEAR is a mammoth undertaking. A standardization procedure was required to make more than 120 different anthropometric databases searchable and comparable. These databases often had different measurement collection methodologies, some described without much detail, and some in languages other than English. To achieve a workable standard the Anthropometric Measurement Interface (AMI) was created.Ennis, E., & Robinette, K.

He was first mentioned in 1741 as the Metropolitan of Skopje. At that time, the throne of Serbian Patriarchate of Peć was contested between the Serbs, who were seen as rebels by the Ottomans, and Phanariote Greeks, who were very much loyal to the authorities. In the last Austro-Turkish War (1737–1739), in which Serbs supported Vienna, a major migration northwards into Habsburg territory was led by Serbian Patriarch Arsenije IV. The Ottomans brought Joanikije III, a Greek, to the throne in Peć. During his days all connections with Serbs in the Habsburg Empire were cut. Thus, the election – an Ottoman approval – of a Serb as the head of the Serbian Patriarchate of Peć delighted all the Serbs. Immediately after his election Atanasije II made a canonical visit to Sarajevo. In 1748 we find him in Niš. In 1749 he visited Rila monastery, at the time a part of his patriarchate. That same year Atanasije II visited Montenegro and then continued to the Adriatic littoral to visit his flock. He was accompanied by metropolitan of Cetinje Sava Petrović. The worried Venetian authorities tried to prevent their movement by increasing the sanitary measures for all people coming from the Ottoman Empire, thus also to the patriarch and his entourage.http://forum.burek.com/svi-srpski- patrijarsi-t342338.10.imode.html Next year (1750) Atanasije was in Belgrade where he installed Vasilije Petrović as the new metropolitan of Cetinje. Atanasije II worked hard to reestablish the broken connections with Serbs in the Habsburg Empire whose church was now organized under the Metropolitan of Karlovci. As one of tokens of this renewed collaboration copper plates from book printing were sent from Sremski Karlovci to Atanasije II.\\"Атанасије II Гавриловић\\", Народна енциклопедија, Загреб, 1927. Since the treasury of the Serbian Patriarchate of Peć was all but emptied during the irresponsible rule of his predecessor, in 1750 Atanasije II sent his exarch, abbot of Studenica Vasilije Petrović to collect donations in the regions of the Metropolitan of Karlovci. Same was done in 1751 in the diocese of Valjevo. Atanasije II died in 1752.  References  Sources  Сава Вуковић, \\"Атанасије ІІ Гавриловић\\", Српски биографски речник, књ. 1, Нови Сад 2004, 294.

She was the first woman awarded the Guy Medal in Silver in 1928.  Early life  Ethel May Newbold was born in Tunbridge Wells. One of eleven children, she was the eldest daughter of William Newbold (1828–1900) and Eleanor Isabel Newbold, née Fergusson (1862–1942). Her mother was born in California and her parents married in Mexico. Her older brother Charles Joseph Newbold (1881–1946) was a noted rugby player and chemist.  Education  She was educated at first by a governess and then won a scholarship offered by the Girls’ Public Day School Company to attend Tunbridge Wells High School The Kent & Sussex Courier reported the December 1902 Tunbridge Wells High School School Prize Giving in detail. > “In geometry the examiner says that of the three candidates taking both > parts of the paper one did brilliantly—this girl, we know, was Ethel > Newbold, who got full marks, 90 out of 90 on the second part.” The article continued > “The Chairman again congratulated the school on its success in the matter of > education, and observed that he noticed the name of Ethel Newbold was > mentioned very frequently in the report, and he was sure the school was > proud of her (applause)”. Ethel won a mathematics prize and was awarded an open scholarship for three years at University of Cambridge. > “Ethel Newbold carried off an open scholarship to Newnham College this year > – the value of it is £50 a year for three years and it is one of the most > difficult scholarships to win. It was awarded to her on the results of the > Higher Local Examinations in which she got a double first in classics and > mathematics, with distinction in Latin and arithmetic. She was also awarded > on the same examination a prize of the value of £3 10s; a certain number of > these prizes are awarded to the best candidates of the year.” Her tutor at Cambridge was Mr. G. H. Hardy, Fellow of Trinity College. The London Daily News reported on \\"The Lady Wrangler\\" on 14 June 1905. > \\"Miss E. M. Newbold, of Newnham, the only woman student to find a place > among the Wranglers, and she is placed equal to 26th … With her latest > success Miss Newbold’s career at Newnham concludes, and she is now leaving > college for the purpose of entering the teaching profession. Asked her > favourite pursuits, Miss Newbold replied \\" Mathematics and hockey\\" but she > also admits a liking for tennis\\". On 21 February 1909 she landed in New York, travelling from Liverpool, on board the ship 'Baltic' to visit her grandfather David Fergusson, of Oxford Street, Berkeley, California with her mother and younger sister Angela (1886–1958). Angela's second husband (m. 1934) was aviator Alec Ogilvie.  Career  She first taught at Godolphin School, Salisbury. Her move to Statistics was induced by her work during the First World War in the Ministry of Munitions. She studied for a M.Sc. in the University of London, which she received in 1926, and was awarded a Doctorate in 1929. She became a member of the Medical Research Council in 1921, working on medical and industrial studies. Ethel Newbold published 17 papers within the eight years she conducted research at the Medical Research Council. In his obituary, Major Greenwood describes her as \\"the best mathematical statistician and I think quite the best logician\\" of the group at the National Institute of Medical Research. She was elected a Fellow of the Royal Statistical Society in 1921 and was the first woman awarded the Guy Medal in Silver in 1928, for the paper \\"practical Applications of Statistics of Repeated Events, particularly to Industrial Accidents\\" and for her other contributions to the then novel experimental study of epidemiology. She served on the Council of the Royal Statistical Society between 1928 and 1933.  Death  She died at Woodend House, Hayes End, Middlesex in March 1933 after \\"a long illness\\". Her coffin left her mother’s home of Imberley Lodge, East Grinstead and her funeral \\"took place quietly at Tunbridge Wells Cemetery in the presence of family and intimate friends on Thursday 30th March\\". Major Greenwood, with whom she had worked at the Medical Research Council wrote a professional obituary for her in the Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, ending with a touching tribute. > “The pages of a scientific journal are no doubt not the place in which to > expiate on the personal qualities of a friend and colleague.

It depicts the conflict between tradition and modern life faced by women belonging to the middle and upper classes, no doubt reflecting the experience of the author herself. The book won the Sahitya Akademi Award for English-language works in 1979. Her earlier works include Ramu, A Story of India (1966) and The Life of Keshaw (1969). Both emphasize the importance of education for boys. Ramu does not appreciate the sacrifices his parents have made for him until he sees their heartfelt disappointment after he misses a day at school in order to go to the fair. Mehta's critical essay The Western Educated Hindu Woman (1970) describes the contrast between women in their twenties at the time of independence who were well educated and spoke English and their mothers who spoke no English and remained devout Hindus bent on maintaining traditions.

Biography He was born in Constantinople and descended from an old noble family of Genoa. The family's wealth allowed him to receive a good education. In 1818 he was initiated into Filiki Eteria (Society of Friends) and became one of its most active members. He served as secretary to the hospodar of Moldavia Scarlat Callimachi, and in early 1821 he was appointed Ottoman envoy to Paris. On his way, however, he received news on the outbreak of the Greek War of Independence, and went secretly to Greece. Following the massacre against the Greek population in Constantinople, his father was beheaded by the Ottomans. Negris arrived on the island of Spetses in Ottoman dress, and was almost lynched by the crowd, but was saved by Neofytos Vamvas. Although he spread the false rumour that he was a relative of Demetrios Ypsilantis, he soon joined with fellow Phanariotes Alexandros Mavrokordatos and Kostakis Karatzas in an informal political alliance directed against Ypsilantis. On 19 November 1821, he participated in the establishment of the Areopagus of Eastern Continental Greece, becoming its first president. He took part in the First National Assembly at Epidaurus and the Second National Assembly at Astros, after which he switched camps and allied with Theodoros Kolokotronis and Odysseas Androutsos against Mavrokordatos. As the power of the Areopagus declined in favour of the central provisional government, so Negris too began to be sidelined and lose his influence. He died on 22 November 1824 of typhus in Nafplio.

Founded by public figure, producer and director Sadyk Sher-Niyaz in 2001 in the capital of Bishkek, the structure of the Fund consists of the Union of Improvised Singing ‘Aitysh’, Film Production Company ‘Aitysh Film’, International Film Festival \\"Kyrgyzstan - Land of Short Films\\", Manas Cinema network and Literary Organization ‘Kalemger’.  History  The idea of creating Aitysh Public Fund was born in 1998 as at this time the art of traditional improvised singing was poorly developed throughout the country. In 2001, Sadyk Sher-Niyaz established the Fund to support young singing improvisers and to restore the former greatness of this traditional art known as ‘Aitysh’. Together with such well-known singing improvisers as Ashyraly Aytaliev, Estebes Tursunaliev and Tuuganbay Abdiev, Sadyk Sher-Niyaz established a school for young singing improvisers. By 2014, the school had approximately 30 students. In 2003, the singing improvisers were included in the UNESCO List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. The Head of UNESCO, Kōichirō Matsuura, gave special thanks to the founder, Sadyk Sher- Niyaz, for his contribution to world culture. In 2004, the Russian NTV television channel devoted a programme to Aitysh Public Fund and the art of improvised singing and in 2005, the largest US newspaper ‘The Washington Post’ published an article about this tradition. The Fund has helped to establish new, talented singing improvisers such as Amantay Kutmanaliev, Jenishbek Toktobek, Elmirbek Imanaliev, Aaly Tutkuchev, Azamat Bolgonbaev. In addition, the Fund has contributed to the resumption of cultural unity between Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan through international competitive concerts. Later Aitysh Public Fund started to promote the development of other spheres of Kyrgyz culture and from 2004 to launch new cultural projects.  Activities  Since 2001, Aitysh Public Fund has organized and sponsored: * competitive concerts for singing improvisers 2-3 times per year, with a prize fund of one million Kyrgyz som * charity concerts, cultural events and celebrations of the anniversaries of eminent singing improvisers * film festivals, film screenings and other events in the field of cinema. The fund also supports the release, presentation and distribution of publications, video and audio materials, the authors of which include singing improvisers and others. In 2004, due to the large interest in the art of improvised singing among the population, the first public TV channel Public Television Radio Corporation (PTRC) and the second channel ElTR began live broadcasts of the competitive concerts. Regular partners include the Ministry of Culture of the Kyrgyz Republic, International Humanitarian Cooperation Fund, The Platform ‘Dialogue Eurasia’, Kyrgyzfilm and International PEN.  Projects  In 2001, in order to promote the development of the traditional art of improvised singers, Sadyk Sher-Niyaz founded a school for young singing improvisers. In December 2004, he also founded the literary organization ‘Kalemger’. The purpose of the organization is to support young, talented writers in Kyrgyzstan. Several collections of member’s work have been released, as well as dozens of periodic anthologies. In 2006, Sadyk Sher-Niyaz founded the film production company ‘Aitysh Film’. The main objective of the film company is the development of Kyrgyz cinema by supporting the creativity of talented young people. Aitysh Film produces art- house, animation and documentary films. ‘Kyrgyzstan – Land of Short Films’, an annual International Film Festival for short films from the Commonwealth of Independent States, the Baltic States and Georgia, has been held in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan since 2011. Traditionally, the festival opens on 12 December and lasts four days. The opening date of the festival marks the birthday of the famous Kyrgyz author Chingiz Aitmatov, who died in 2008.

The FCCRCS -belonging to Argentine State Railway- also connected to Central Chubut Railway. This railway, also known by local inhabitants as \\"Autovía\\", was the transport that joined oil wells of the region, where local companies Astra and YPF extracted petroleum that had been discovered in Comodoro Rivadavia in 1907. At the very beginning, goods and passengers were carried by steam locomotive trains and then by railcars, nicknamed \\"chanchitas\\" due to their lack of comfort. The FCCRCS' remnants are considered as cultural heritage in Comodoro Rivadavia and Sarmiento, where they are kept and exhibited at Railway & Port Museum and National Petroleum Museum (in Comodoro) and Regional Museum Desiderio Torres (in Sarmiento).  History  Background A train arriving to Km. 3. Baldwin leaving Comodoro. May Revolution celebrations in Comodoro station, 25 May 1931. Train carrying oil. YPF Freight train. Employees of Talleres station, 1940. Coaches unloaded in Puerto Morán, 1943. Drewry railcar serving in the line. Train struck in the snow, 1950s. Accident that caused the closure of branch to Rada Tilly in 1958. 1960 accident. Km. 5 station in 1979. In 1897 Colonia Sarmiento was founded by National decree N° 12161, by request of Welsh settlers that had the intention of establishing in the valley located between Musters and Colhue Huapi lakes, which they considered fertile lands for livestock. During the first years, the transport of merchandise that the intense commercial activity of Sarmiento generated, was made with carriages to the port of Camarones, with high costs and risks. The merchants realised that a closer port would be needed, so the city of Comodoro Rivadavia was founded in 1901. On December 13, 1907, a search for potable water ended in a discovery of petroleum in the zone, which changed plans for the development of the region so Comodoro Rivadavia became the most important city of the region. Construction The FCCRCS was created by Law N° 5559 on September 11, 1908, starting works soon after. Original project included to build a 150-km straight line to connect Comodoro Rivadavia Colonia Sarmiento although it would be extended to 200-km. On March 29, 1912, the line reached Cañadón Lagarto, beginning to operate. The railway line finally reached Colonia Sarmiento on May 25, 1914. Years later the company built a new branch to join local oil company Astra when it established at the north of Comodoro Rivadavia. According to Clement Dumrauf, the railway was not expanded due to British settlers that were interested in preserving the Patagonia region only for sheep farming. Other version stated that livestock company \\"La Argentina Southern Land Company\\" refused to the construction of a line when they realised about the poor quality of the soil, which would be used to finance the construction. Other reasons for the cancellation of the project were the crisis caused by World War I, some politicians that considered that the Government had to devote its funds to the Pampa region, and the death of Roque Sáenz Peña in 1914. Expansion During the first years of existence, the FCCRCS trains fueled with crude oil with no refination, being considered the most expensive trains for that reason. This railway was also used to carry wood and livestock. Besides, local companies Astra and Diadema carried crude oil to the port of km. 3. Comodoro Rivadavia had an oil refinery that worked at a capacity of per day, serving both lines of the railway in Chubut Province. During the 1920s the branch to Astra refinery was completed, that was financed by the company due to their interests in the transport of passengers, goods, crude oil and bricks. In August 1923 the port of Antonio Morán was built. This port had an own railway line that carried soil and rubber used for construction from a quarry in Punta Piedras. This line would be later named as Rada Tilly. When works were interrupted, the port was set as terminus of the line until its closure in the 1970s. In 1924 the FCCRCS was used to transport materials for the construction of the San Jorge lighthouse from Colonia Sarmiento to Astra station in Comodoro Rivadavia. Other companies that made their contributions were YPF (donating AR$ 25,000), Astra (bricks and lime), Compañía Forrairrilera de Petróleo (trucks). In 1927 another project (written by deputy Guillermo Fonrouge) was proposed to extend the rail line. This project proposed to join Holdich and Las Heras stations in Santa Cruz Province through a branch that also connected with the Patagonian Railway. Nevertheless, the project would never carried out. Nationalisation When the Juan Perón's administration nationalised all the Argentine railway network in 1948, the FCCRCS became part of Ferrocarriles Patagónicos, finally being added to Ferrocarril Roca in 1957. Prior to nationalisation the railway had carried 434,052 passengers and 45,969 tons of freight. However the volume of passengers and cargo carried decreased one year later, mainly due to the increasing road traffic. In spite of this, the Argentine state made significant investments for the FCCRCS, acquiring railcars (even a refrigerating coach), 13 wagons for livestock, apart of remodeling stations and building houses for the employees. By 1949 the line had run 430,828 kilometers. At mid-1949 brand new railcars were added to the FCCRCS although they were put on service one year later. By 1973 all the passenger services were operated with railcars. With the improvements in the line, some passengers choose Sarmiento as their destiniy for recreational trips, and some of them even for their honey moon. Decline and closure In 1953, there was a terrible accident on the Narrow-gauge railway that joined Comodoro Rivadavia with Rada Tilly, with 36 people died. When Arturo Frondizi became President of Argentina in 1958 the Government carried out a plan to reduce costs, including the railway lines among them. On August 20, 1958 the branch to Rada Tilly was definitely closed, among with the Central Chubut Railway. The decision was largely based on the 1953 tragedy and the tracks were removed from the line. On August 12, 1960, a Ganz Works railcar that returned from Colonia Sarmiento lost brakes at El Sindicato, crashing a Drewry railcar that was leaving Comodoro Rivadavia at that time. Both railcars were destroyed with a result of 100 passengers injured and some killed by the impact. In 1969 the lands were the railway line had been built were transferred to the Municipality of Comodoro Rivadavia. The tracks that crossed the downtown were removed and a stop near the port was built. During the 1970s the FCCRCS was restructured because of its deficit, obsolete rolling stock and the growth of population in the city. In 1971 the Comodoro station was closed to expedite the urban traffic, being replaced by a precarious stop near the port. The station became a heritage place. The Sarmiento station building would become the Regional Museum \\"Desiderio Torres\\" after the first section was definitely closed in 1977. In the late 1970s the lack of investments in the railway was made felt in the rolling stock, with steam locomotives, Ganz and Drewry railcars that were obsolete by then. Moreover, only one of the three Ganz Works was operating. The employees of the FCCRCS made their best to keep the line active, sometimes collecting missing spares from Temperley, Tolosa and Haedo workshops, after driving from the Patagonia to Greater Buenos Aires. In other cases, the employees themselves manufactured the spare parts to keep Drewry railcars running on the tracks. In spite of the efforts made by the employers, the railway continued to decline until carrying only 5 or 6 people per trip. Besides, the freight trains only transported one or two wagons to the port, once a week. In 1977 passenger services were definitely closed. Finally the entire line was closed in 1978. The de facto government led by Jorge Videla also ordered rolling stock was destroyed and sold as scrap.  Post-closure  In 1979 the railway station was declared as National heritage. Years later the Port & Railway Museum (\\"Museo Ferroportuario\\") was established there, including other adjacent buildings and objects as a locomotive, a wagon, the tower, the water tank, the warehouses (currently a cultural centre), workshops (today a school), the port and Scalabrini Ortiz and San Martín parks, the last being inaugurated in 2012. In 1991 the Municipality of Comodoro acquired the lands where Astra had operated. When the Government of Chubut Province decided to refurbish some railway branches by decree N° 2642, the FCCRCS was not included. By December 1992 the branch to Muelle YPF had been eroded by the sea. In 1991 a group of neighbours proposed to establish a heritage railway that would run from Sarmiento to the Bosque Petrificado (Petrified Forest, 38 km. to the south of that city). The project was revived in early 2000s with no successful results. Another ambitious project was introduced in 1996 by congress members of Chubut for the construction of the Ferrocarril Transpatagónico. The railway line would join San Antonio Oeste in Río Negro with Río Gallegos in Santa Cruz, including the construction off a bridge between Punta Loyola and La Misión in Tierra del Fuego. The project also included the reopening of Ferrocarril Puerto Deseado- Colonia Las Heras and Central Chubut Railway. Other project was sent to the Congress of Argentina for approval in 2006. This proposed to create a railway museum and heritage railway in Km. 5 of Comodoro Rivadavia. The train would depart from that city, crossing Don Bosco and Astra, with an additional branch to Caleta Córdoba and San Jorge lighthouse. In August 1995, the Government of Comodoro Rivadavia announced they were negotiating to transfer the line to the Chubut Province. The project planned to join Comodoro Rivadavia with Chilean city of Puerto Chacabuco. Representatives from the Provincial Government flew over the rail tracks to corroborate how many kilometers had been dismantled, considering that Santa Cruz Province had previously removed several tracks. After studying the region, they concluded that a 75% of the tracks still existed, most of them in good conditions. Nevertheless, the expectations for the reopening of the line ceased in 2004 when the Provincial Government requested to the Central Government all the line was dismantled. The permission was granted one year later. The FCCRCS tracks were removed between 2005 and 2006 by company Natura Ecology, after signing an agreement which committed the company to carry 46,000 ties to El Maitén to refurbish heritage railway La Trochita. Works were made at a cost of AR$700,000. Soon after it was revealed that the agreement had been signed without been approved by the Provincial Legislature, therefore it was annulled and the ties were never sent to El Maitén. According to what happened, the agreement infringed a national law that only allows the dismantle of rail tracks if they are destined for other railway line. Natura Ecology was hired directly with no bidding procedures and the company was also accused of having stolen the material. The rail ties were intercepted and seized by the local police in Trelew, totalizing four tracks with 100 tons of material with an estimated value of AR$1,000,000. Nevertheless, the rail profiles were never found. Some reports stated that they had been sent to different locations in Chubut, Greater Buenos Aires, Córdoba and even the city of Buenos Aires. The robbery of sleepers and profiles was never cleared. In 2013, an initiative planned to build a railway to the Pacific Ocean, establishing a new port at the south of Rada Tilly to Puerto Aysén in Chile, excluding Comodoro Rivadavia port from the route. Nevertheless, the project was dismissed because of the bad weather in the zone. Other projects included the reopening of the Ferrocarril Puerto Deseado in the Puerto Deseado-Tellier section, with the purpose of connecting Puerto Deseado with Puerto Chacabuco in Chile. A second stage considers the possibility of a future connection with Comodoro Rivadavia. In March 2014, a group of representatives of Chinese company China State Construction Engineering Corporation stated that Chubut Province was enabled to build a railway line. They studied the ports of Comodoro Rivadavia and Madryn, searching for a route that allowed trains to join Aysén Region in Chile. On May 25, 2014, a ceremony to commemorate the 100th. anniversary of the FCCRCS was held in Colonia Sarmiento.

Separative work is not energy. The same amount of separative work will require different amounts of energy depending on the efficiency of the separation technology. Separative work is measured in Separative work units SWU, kg SW, or kg UTA (from the German Urantrennarbeit – literally uranium separation work) * 1 SWU = 1 kg SW = 1 kg UTA * 1 kSWU = 1 tSW = 1 t UTA * 1 MSWU = 1 ktSW = 1 kt UTA  Definition  The work W_\\\\mathrm{SWU} necessary to separate a mass F of feed of assay x_{f} into a mass P of product assay x_{p}, and tails of mass T and assay x_{t} is given by the expression :W_\\\\mathrm{SWU} = P \\\\cdot V\\\\left(x_{p}\\\\right)+T \\\\cdot V(x_{t})-F \\\\cdot V(x_{f}) where V\\\\left(x\\\\right) is the value function, defined as :V(x) = (1 - 2x) \\\\ln \\\\left(\\\\frac{1 - x}{x}\\\\right) and satisfies :V(x)=\\\\frac{1}{(x(1-x))^2}. The feed to product ratio is given by the expression :\\\\frac{F}{P} = \\\\frac{x_{p} - x_{t}}{x_{f} - x_{t}} whereas the tails to product ratio is given by the expression :\\\\frac{T}{P} = \\\\frac{x_{p} - x_{f}}{x_{f} - x_{t}}  Example  For example, beginning with of natural uranium (NU), it takes about 62 SWU to produce of Low-enriched uranium (LEU) in 235U content to 4.5%, at a tails assay of 0.3%. The number of separative work units provided by an enrichment facility is directly related to the amount of energy that the facility consumes. Modern gaseous diffusion plants typically require 2,400 to 2,500 kilowatt-hours (kW·h), or 8.6–9 gigajoules, (GJ) of electricity per SWU while gas centrifuge plants require just 50 to 60 kW·h (180–220 MJ) of electricity per SWU. Example: A large nuclear power station with a net electrical capacity of 1300 MW requires about 25 tonnes per year (25 t/a) of LEU with a 235U concentration of 3.75%. This quantity is produced from about 210 t of NU using about 120 kSWU. An enrichment plant with a capacity of 1000 kSWU/a is, therefore, able to enrich the uranium needed to fuel about eight large nuclear power stations.

The daughter of the poet Olegario Victor Andrade, her poems were praised by for their \\"idealized romantic love\\". Early life and work Agustina Andrade was born in Gualeguaychú, Entre Ríos on 9 August 1858 (or 1861) in the town of Gualeguaychú, in the province of Entre Ríos. She was the daughter of the poet Olegario Victor Andrade and Maria Eloisa Quiñones González. Interested in poetry from a young age, she began to publish her work by 16. With her father and the young Leandro N. Alem, Andrade worked on Álbum poético argentino, released in 1877. Encouraged by her father, she began publishing her poems in La Tribuna, forming a distinct poetic style, clearly influenced by Victor Hugo and Gustavo Adolfo Bécquer. In 1878, she published the volume Lágrimas, and the following year authored Flor de un día. Her poems were praised by the likes of Benigno Tejeiro Martínez and for their \\"idealized romantic love\\". In his Poesías (1877), the poet includes the poem, ¿Cuándo vuelves á tu patria? A mi simpática amiga Agustina Andrade (When will you return to your country? To my good friend, Agustina Andrade). Andrade's poem La Fé was described as a \\"revelation\\". Personal life Andrade met the military officer Ramón Lista (1856–1897), when he arrived to explore southern Argentina. In 1879, they married in Buenos Aires. Lista left the , where he became the second governor, while Andrade lived in Témperley, about twenty kilometers from the city of Buenos Aires. Although they did not see much of each other, the couple had two daughters. In 1890, Andrade learned that her husband maintained a parallel family in Patagonia with an indigenous Tehuelche woman called Koila, with whom he had a daughter. Heartbroken, she locked herself in the house for months on end, before leaving her two daughters in the care of her mother and committing suicide with a revolver on 10 February 1891.

She founded the True Light Middle School, the first women's school in Guangdong Province, China, and is credited with establishing the first generation of professional women of that province. Biography Noyes was born on March 5, 1844, in Guilford, Ohio. Her father, Varnum Noyes (1804 - 1888) was a Presbyterian minister. She was her parents sixth child and one of three of the children who were Chinese missionaries. She was named for Harriet Newell who was a famous missionary. In January 1868, the Presbyterian Church of the United States (PCUSA) sent her as a missionary to Fangcun, Guangzhou, China (广州市芳村区) where she learned to speak fluent Cantonese. On June 16, 1872, she founded the first school for women in Guangdong Province - the True Light Academy in Shakee.那夏理：创办真光学堂的洋女子 [Noyes: Founder of the True Light Academy], retrieved 1 April 2015 She had spent two years preparing to open the school and she used $1000 she had collected. Noyes was surprised to find the resistance there was to the education of women in the area. She had sufficient resources to supply free education to thirty females and ten of these would be married. When the school first opened, there were only six students and three of them were married. The school that she started was a primary school, but it grew from offering three years of education to offering nine despite having an early disastrous fire. The school broke the 100-student barrier in 1887 and in 1894 had 200 students. The Women's School and the Bible Women's School were moved to Paak Hok Tong, Guangzhou and were merged and renamed as \\"True Light Middle School\\". Dr. J.W. Creighton was named the principal. In 1919, the first graduation ceremony was held. In 1919, Noyes published A Light in the Land of Sinim: Forty-Five Years in the True Light Seminary, 1872-1917. Noyes returned to the United States in May 1923 when she received a letter from Eugene Chen, the secretary to Sun Yat-sen, thanking her for helping with the education of 6,000 pupils at the \\"True Light\\" Seminary.Letter located in the Department of Special Collections at The College of Wooster. Legacy She is credited with establishing the first generation of professional women of that province. Women who were educated during her 50 years at the school went on to become 286 teachers, 114 doctors, and more than 30 nurses. Her book, titled History of the South China Mission of the American Presbyterian Church, 1845-1920, was published posthumously in 1927. In 1949, the Chinese Communist Revolution forced the headmistress of Noyes' school to move the school to Hong Kong. The school became the Kowloon True Light Middle School. The \\"True Light\\" schools also include the Hong Kong True Light College, True Light Girls' College, and True Light Middle School of Hong Kong. The school that remained in Bai He Dong was taken over by the Chinese Communist Party, which renamed it the Number 22 Middle School during the Cultural Revolution.

He is best known for the cartoons and cover art he contributed to The New Yorker magazine under the pen name \\"Alain\\" from the 1930s through the 1950s. The novelist John Updike once said his childhood discovery of Brustlein's cartoons helped to stimulate his desire to write for the magazine and one of Brustlein's cartoons has been repeatedly cited for its skillful and witty self-reference. Although they have not received the same public acclaim as his humorous drawings, his paintings drew strong praise from influential critics such as Hilton Kramer, who said Brustlein's work had great refinement showing \\"beautiful control over the precise emotion he wants it to convey\\" and \\"complete command of color and form handled with a remarkable delicacy and discretion.\\" In October 1960 a painting of Brustlein's appeared on the cover of ARTnews and his reputation as a \\"painter's painter\\" appeared to be firmly established after he was the subject of an article in that magazine four years later. Early life Daniel Brustlein was born on September 11, 1904, in the Alsatian town of Mulhouse. Although attached to Germany and known as Mülhausen during Brustlein's childhood, the town retained historic ties to France and, despite their unavoidable German citizenship, many of its citizens—Brustlein included—considered themselves to be French. He attended local schools approximately through age fourteen and, showing an early aptitude for drawing, published his first collection of cartoons—Petite Histoire de la Guerre en Caricatures—at the age of fifteen in 1919. At about that time he began residence in Geneva and soon after enrolled as an art student in that city, first at the École des Arts & Métiers and then the École des Beaux Arts. In 1924, at the urging of one of his teachers, Brustlein moved to Paris where he found work as an illustrator while continuing his art studies. Two years later some of his illustrations were included in the Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes. The exposition, a World's fair held in Paris from April to October 1925, introduced the Art Deco style. In 1927 Brustlein moved to New York City on the advice of Jean Coquillot, a colleague and fellow student. Having emigrated from Geneva in 1921, Coquillot had found work in New York as an illustrator, humorous cartoonist, and book cover designer. In the 1930s he would become known for a cover he contributed to Mademoiselle magazine (1936) and illustrations he made for Heidi Grows Up (1938), the first of two sequels to the book Heidi. Through his friendship with Coquillot, Brustlein found work drawing illustrations and cartoons and within a few years he had become a regular contributor to The New Yorker magazine. Mature style Daniel Brustlein, as \\"Alain,\\" cartoon: \\"Drawing From the Life\\" The New Yorker (1955) Brustlein's mature style emerged after he had emigrated to New York and begun working as an illustrator and cartoonist. Illustrations and cartoons for magazines Daniel Brustlein, cover art: The New Yorker, November 9, 1935 Beginning in the early 1930s his cartoons began to appear in The New Yorker and Collier's magazines. He signed this early work with the name \\"Alain\\" and subsequently used that pen name for the rest of his career as illustrator and cartoonist. The issue of The New Yorker for November 9, 1935, contained Brustlein's first cover art. Over the next 30 years he would produce another nine covers for the magazine. In 1936 he illustrated a book entitled Farewell to Model T. Written by New Yorker writer E. B. White and journalist Richard Lee Strout, the book was a reprint of a New Yorker piece of May 16, 1936 entitled \\"Farewell My Lovely.\\" Both the book and article were credited to the pseudonymous author \\"Lee Strout White.\\" The book's illustrations were credited to Brustlein as \\"Alain.\\" During World War II Brustlein contributed drawings and cartoons to exhibitions benefiting the war effort. In January 1942 he won first prize for a cartoon that appeared in one such exhibition held at the Grand Central Art Galleries. Consisting of nearly 100 posters made by cartoonists and comic strip artists, the show raised money for both United China Relief and U.S. War Bonds. In February of the same year he won a prize at a benefit exhibition of cartoons sponsored by the American Society of Magazine Cartoonists and held at the Art Students League. The show, called \\"Cartoons Against the Axis,\\" contained 116 works. Brustlein's contribution showed a Japanese husband reading a Japanese newspaper and commenting, \\"It seems there's a good deal of unrest over there because of priorities and they expect to see internal collapse by Spring.\\" In May the cartoon was shown again in an exhibition called \\"Cartoons of the day\\" at the Metropolitan Museum In July Brustlein married the painter Janice Biala. At the close of the war they moved to Paris and, while living there most of the year, retained American citizenship and usually spent some months in the United States. After the close of World War II Brustlein, as \\"Alain,\\" continued to make cartoons and cover illustrations for The New Yorker and other magazines, but he produced less of this work in order to devote more time to easel painting and the illustration of children's books. A cartoon he contributed to The New Yorker in 1955 has been cited as a good example of metapictorial drawing. Entitled \\"Drawing From the Life,\\" the cartoon presents a classroom scene in ancient Egypt where art students are using modern perspective techniques to sketch a model who stands in a stiff, flat pose that is typical of Egyptian art. Easel painting and other art Daniel Brustlein, \\"Figure d'Eches,\\" 1973, oil on canvas, 51 × 64 inches, signed, lower right Brustlein was a painter and book illustrator as well as a magazine illustrator and cartoonist. After the close of World War II he continued to place drawings and cartoons in magazines such as The New Yorker, The Saturday Evening Post, Look, and Esquire, but he also began to make paintings for group and solo exhibitions in galleries located in New York, Paris, and other cities. In 1948 and for the next three years he contributed paintings to the Salon des Surindependants in Paris. In 1952 he was given his first solo show when \\"Peintures de Alain Brustlein\\" opened at Galerie Jeanne Bucher in Paris. His work also appeared group exhibitions at Stable Gallery in New York and at the Musée Cantonal des Beaux-Arts in Lausanne. In 1952 a French critic included him among the best young painters of the day when reporting his nomination for the Prix de la Critique (Galerie Saint Placide, Paris). In 1955 Stable Gallery gave him his first New York solo exhibition. In 1957 he contributed work to a group exhibition of portraits held at the Tibor de Nagy Gallery. Apart from Brustlein, the artists, who were not generally known for their portraiture, included Willem de Kooning, Franz Kline, Philip Guston, Milton Resnick, and Larry Rivers. A year later his paintings appeared in the annual exhibition at the L'École de Paris for the first time and in 1959 he was given a second one-person show at the Stable Gallery. Of the portraits and landscapes he contributed to this show, the critic for the New York Times said \\"Without pushing realization far he succeeds quite strikingly in compassing characterization in the spontaneous portraits, and with a few quick strokes of the brush establishes mood in low keyed statements of scene.\\" In 1960 Brustlein received a purchase award at the 5th International Hallmark invitational exhibition held at Wildenstein Gallery in New York. The prize- winning painting, a self-portrait, subsequently appeared on the cover of the October 1960 issue of ARTnews. Four years later his brother-in-law, Jack Tworkov, wrote a feature article on him for the November issue of ARTnews, and that month, his work appeared in a solo exhibition at the Saidenberg Gallery. In 1965 a painting of his was included in a group show of portraits showing friends and acquaintances of the participating artists. Appearing at the New School Art Center, the show drew praise from Stuart Preston of the New York Times for its \\"delectable items\\" that \\"make for extraordinary documentary value.\\" Through the rest of the decade and into the 1970s Brustlein continued to show at Galerie Lutece, Galerie Jacob, and other Parisian galleries and the Sachs gallery in New York. Of a painting he saw in 1978, the Times critic Hilton Kramer wrote that Brustlein showed \\"complete command of color and form handled with a remarkable delicacy and discretion.\\" In reviewing a solo exhibition at Sachs the following year Kramer said: > In everything that Daniel Brustlein paints there is a sensibility of great > refinement. We are never in any doubt that this is a painter with a deep > affection for his medium, and a beautiful control over the precise emotion > he wants it to convey. His color is gentle and delicate, and his imagery > too—mostly of generalized figures in interior or landscape spaces—has a > gentle, pacific quality. It is in the sensitive handling of the medium—in > cool greens and blues of \\"Chinatown,\\" in the copper-haired figure of > \\"Rastro,\\" in the way the couch encloses the three figures in \\"Ladybug\\"—that > we feel his special felicity as a painter. Three years later, discussing another solo show at Sachs, a critic praised his \\"taste for muted colors that may owe something to Paris\\" and said his oil paint has the pleasing quality of slightly decaying fresco.\\" During the 1980s he showed at the Gruenebaum gallery in New York and the Galerie Jeanne Bucher in Paris and in the next decade, the last of his life, mostly in the Kouros Gallery, New York. A retrospective exhibition at Kouros in 1994 pulled together works from his wife and her family as well as his own. Entitled \\"A Family,\\" it included works by Biala's brother, Jack Tworkov; his daughter, Hermine Ford; her husband, Robert Moskowitz; and Erik Moskowitz who is the son of Hermine and Robert. Other retrospective exhibitions include solo and group shows at Kouros (1997, 1999, 2001, 2002) and group shows at Galerie Jacob (1996) and Galerie Arnaud (Paris, 2001). Books Daniel Brustlein, as \\"Alain,\\" illustration from The Magic Stones (New York, Whittlesey House, 1957). Farewell to Model T was Brustlein's only book illustration project of the 1930s and 1940s. In the mid-1950s, Brustlein began to illustrate and also to write books, most of them short and all intended for children's use. In 1956 he wrote and illustrated a book called The Elephant and the Flea in which an elephant tries increasingly desperate measures to dislodge a troublesome flea. That same year he illustrated a book, written by his wife, called It's Spring! It's Spring!. The book describes the transition from winter to spring from the point of view of the chickadees, bluebirds and swallows who then start building nests and sing with a new vigor. A reviewer for the New York Times said Brustlein's drawings were \\"wonderfully colored,\\" depicting \\"swirling patterns of birds in flight.\\" The following year Brustlein wrote and illustrated The Magic Stones, a book on the architectural uses of the arch. Introducing an evil character, \\"Monsieur Down,\\" it explains how medieval builders used the arch to overcome the destructive force he employed, that of gravity, so that they might construct the great Gothic cathedrals of France. The text says \\"Monsieur Down\\" was so enraged at being defeated that he turned to stone and is now a great gargoyle, seated high upon Notre Dame de Paris. Writing in The New York Times, C.E. Van Norman said Brustlein employed simple text and clear pictures to produce a fascinating introduction to the subject. In 1959 he illustrated Minette, another book for which his wife supplied the text. The book, which describes the title character's life in a royal palace, drew praise from the New York Times for the quality of its illustrations. In 1968 Brustlein wrote and illustrated a book called One, Two, Three, Going to Sea. Using cartoon figures the book provides an introductory guide to adding and subtracting. A reviewer called it a book both amusing and useful for arithmetic-ready children. Personal life Brustlein was born in the town of Mulhouse close to the borders of Germany, France, and Switzerland. At the time of his birth the town was called Mülhausen as it was then part the German Empire, having been ceded by France following her defeat in the Franco- Prussian War of 1870. Over many centuries the town was occasionally independent but most often attached to one of its neighboring countries. It had been detached from the Swiss Confederation to become part of France during the French Revolution and, four decades after 1870, it was returned to France following World War I, only to be again taken by Germany during World War II and returned thereafter. When asked to his nationality at birth, Brustlein reported that he was French rather than German. One of the oldest families in the community, the Brustleins became prominent in the late fifteenth century during a transition from an aristocratic council to a democratic form of government. Thereafter members of the family served frequently as the town's mayor and in 1512 one Martin Brustlein commanded a company of Mulhousiens in successful battles to defend Pope Jules II from attacks by armies of King Louis XII of France. In 1925 the city council named a low-cost public housing project in honor of the Brustlein family. In 1940 Brustlein told a census taker that he had left school after the eighth grade. This presumably means that he received elementary education in Mulhouse and that he did not graduate from either of the schools he subsequently attended in Geneva (the École des Arts & Métiers and the École des Beaux-Arts). While studying at these schools, Brustlein apparently obtained Swiss citizenship. This seems likely since on emigrating to New York in 1927 the manifest of the ship on which he traveled gave his nationality as Swiss. He emigrated to the New York in 1927 and in 1933 became a U.S. citizen. The 1940 Census shows that Brustlein was then living in a New York apartment with his mother, Louise. It is possible that she had recently come to live with him since reports of his travels as late as 1939 do not show her as a companion. Louise Brustlein's age is given as 63 and her presumptive year of birth is thus 1877. She would have been about 26 when Brustlein was born. Sometime on or before December 1938 Brustlein met his future wife, Janice Biala, who was then living with Ford Madox Ford. An acquaintance of Ford's remembered meeting Brustlein at a New Year's Eve party she and Ford gave in a Manhattan apartment where they were then staying. The acquaintance wrote that Brustlein, whom she knew only as \\"Alain,\\" was an Alsatian (\\"or maybe Luxembourger\\") with red hair. Brustlein and Biala were both artists, both Francophiles, and both by nature outgoing and sociable. They were friends with many of the same people, mostly in the Parisian and New York art communities. Willem de Kooning, then a struggling young artist, became a close friend whom Brustlein and Biala would nurse when ill and to whom Brustlein would provide financial support. Two years later, on July 11, 1942, Brustlein and Biala married in New York and the following year they hosted a wedding lunch for de Kooning and his new wife Elaine, herself an artist. They lived in New York during the war years and, while retaining U.S. citizenship, in 1947 they moved to Paris where they reunited with friends in the artist community. In 1949 Brustlein and Biala began renting places in Gladstone, New Jersey, during their periodic returns to the United States and in 1953 they purchased a farmhouse in the Peapack area of Gladstone, New Jersey. That year de Kooning insisted that Brustlein join the members-only club that he and other artists of the New York School had founded to discuss topics related to the art movement which would become known as abstract expressionism.

The café, opened by comedian and activist Russell Brand, was funded by profits from his 2014 book, Revolution. The café name and logo come from its location on the New Era estate and from Brand's web series, The Trews. In September 2016, Brand donated the cafe to The Rehabilitation for Addicted Prisoners Trust (RAPT) whose London Recovery Hub is located next door to the Trew Era Cafe. https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-37466434 Background During promotion for his book, Brand stated that he would use the profits to fund a social enterprise to employ former drug users in \\"abstinence-based recovery\\" and help them return to work. The café is located on the New Era council estate, whose residents faced eviction in 2014 when their rents were to be tripled by a new owner, Westbrook Partners. They campaigned against the proposed purchase by Westbrook, and Brand supported and drew attention to the residents' cause. In December 2014, Westbrook backed out and the approximately 100 families of the New Era estate ultimately were able to stay. Facility In February 2015, work began on the facility, next to a printing shop and a barbershop. The location was formerly a clothes shop but was empty for some time. The café opened its doors on the morning of 26 March 2015, with approximately 200 people coming for the event. Brand stated that he hopes to have a chain of self-supporting social enterprises. On the café opening, he told the crowd, \\"In this book, I wrote about how the way to change politics is not depending on the existing political class and the existing political system, but for us ourselves to start grassroots movements like what has happened on the New Era estate...this café is going to be run by people in abstinence-based recovery. It's a model which is not for profit, a fully self- supporting new economic enterprise.\\" As of July 2015, the cafe employed seven recovering addicts, who are paid £9.15 per hour, and a manager.

His heart is actually from Dong-wook (Jin Goo), a young detective and Soon-jung's fiancé, who suffered from brain damage from a mysterious car accident. After receiving a new life thanks to the new heart, he is no longer the cold and callous person that he has been and undergoes a profound change to his personality, talking differently and warming up people.

There are a few Gibson's Discount Centers still operating under independent ownership; two in Texas in Weatherford and Kerrville, and two in Kansas in Salina and Clay Center.  History  Herbert R. Gibson and his wife, Belva, opened Gibson Products Co., a wholesale novelty company, in 1936 in Abilene, Texas. By the late 1950s, Gibson had decided to refocus on discounting, and he opened the first Gibson's Discount Center in Abilene in 1960. The company grew mostly by franchising the store concept to others. Sam Walton once inquired about obtaining a Gibson's franchise, but nothing came of it. By 1964, there were 138 Gibson's Discount Center stores generating $190 million in revenue; by 1968, there were 434 stores generating $1 billion in sales. The company's headquarters moved to Seagoville, Texas. In 1972, Gibson transferred ownership of the company to sons Herbert Jr. and Gerald. By 1978, Gibson's had 684 stores across the United States. The company began to go into decline after that, in part because franchisees began to withdraw from the chain; the company's largest franchisee, Pamida Inc., began opening discount stores under its own name. Gibson's was sold in June 1984 to a company headed by Gary Chaffin. Chaffin sold the company in 1992, and it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1996. Chaffin repurchased the company in 1999, which by this time was headquartered in Dodge City, Kansas. In November 2002, Gibson's announced it would close the chain's 17 remaining stores. Two stores continue to operate independently under the Gibson's name, in Kerrville, Texas, and Weatherford, Texas. Gibson's stores in Kansas are members of Ace Hardware. At one point in time, the Gibson's store in Great Bend, Kansas had what was called “The Biggest Outdoor Sign in Kansas.”  References   External links  * Website for currently operating Gibson's store in Kerrville, Texas Category:Defunct discount stores of the United States Category:Retail companies established in 1936 Category:1936 establishments in Texas Category:2002 disestablishments in Kansas Category:Retail companies disestablished in 2002 ","title":"Gibson's Discount Center"},{"id":"46241852","text":"The 177th (2/1st Lincoln and Leicester) Brigade was an infantry brigade of the British Army that saw active service in the First World War as part of 59th (2nd North Midland) Division and fought again in the Second World War, now the 177th Infantry Brigade, with the 59th (Staffordshire) Infantry Division before being disbanded in August 1944. First World War The brigade was raised during the First World War. Part of the Territorial Force, the brigade was raised as a duplicate of the 138th (Lincoln and Leicester) Brigade and was raised from those men in the Territorial Force who had not originally agreed to serve overseas. It was assigned to the 59th (2nd North Midland) Division. However, with the division, the brigade was sent overseas in early 1917 and saw service in the trenches of the Western Front in France and Belgium, in particular during the Third Battle of Ypres, the Battle of Cambrai and Operation Michael, part of the Spring Offensive.

Due to the increasing likelihood of war breaking out with Germany, the Territorial Army was ordered to be doubled in size and the brigade was reformed, as the 177th Infantry Brigade. The brigade was created as a 2nd Line duplicate of 176th Infantry Brigade and was assigned to the 59th (Staffordshire) Motor Division. After spending many years training in the United Kingdom, the brigade, with rest of the division, was sent overseas to France in late June 1944 as part of Operation Overlord and joined the British Second Army in its attempts to capture Caen. The brigade fought in Operation Charnwood and the Second Battle of the Odon and helped the 59th Division gain an excellent reputation as one of Montgomery's most reliable divisions. The majority of the British Army was, by this stage of the war, suffering from a shortage of manpower, particularly in the rifle infantry (where the majority of casualties fell and where the problem was most acute) and, to a lesser extent, in the Royal Armoured Corps.Colossal Cracks - Montgomery's 21st Army Group in Northwest Europe, 1944-45, Stephen Ashley Hart As a consequence of this, and higher than anticipated casualties in Normandy, along with there being very few draftable infantrymen in the United Kingdom by August 1944, the only solution to this was by breaking up field force units in order to bring other units up to strength. Therefore, the 59th Division, as the most junior of all the British infantry divisions fighting in France, was broken up in late August in order to provide replacements for other British divisions of the 21st Army Group. The 177th Brigade ceased to exist by 26 August 1944 and the battalions were broken up and sent to other infantry units.

Owain Fychan shared the southern portion of his father's territories with Owain Cyfeiliog. Working together they drove the English out of Carreghofa in 1163 (capturing and destroying the royal castle there, which was made of timber until fortified in stone in 1194) and Iorwerth Goch from Mochnant Is Rhaeadr in 1166. Owain Fychan now controlled Mechain, Cynllaith, Caereinion and Mochnant Is Rhaeadr. Carreghofa Castle was retaken by Henry II in 1165, but Owain Fychan had recaptured it again by 1187. The castle may have been important because of silver mining operations taking place there. Death He was attacked at night and killed at Carreghofa Castle by Gwenwynwyn and Cadwallon, the sons of Owain Cyfeiliog. They were unable to control the territories gained to the west of Oswestry, so Owain's descendants were able to continue to rule over a much diminished realm in Mechain until the end of the 13th century. He may have had two sons - Owain Fychan ab Owain (c. 1170 - aft. 1218) and Llywelyn ab Owain (c. 1170 - aft. 1204), but some historical records of his marriage(s) have confused him with his half-brother Owain Brogyntyn.

After Kentucky, the 6'10\\" forward transferred in his sophomore year to Southern Illinois University. Upon graduation in 1995, Timberlake played professionally overseas for five years, in National Basketball leagues in Australia, New Zealand, China and in his final season 1998-1999 in the South Korea Basketball League in the LG Sakers before retiring from professional basketball. In popular culture Timberlake is famous for being stomped on by Duke star player Christian Laettner, in one of the most memorable NCAA basketball games of all-time, between the Kentucky Wildcats and the Duke Blue Devils in the 1992 Elite Eight. Officials declined to eject Laettner, instead only charging him with a technical foul, a decision especially controversial because Laettner went on to score the game's winning points with an overtime buzzer-beating shot in which Grant Hill threw a inbounds pass to Laettner, who converted it from the free throw line. After many years of speculation about whether the stomping incident was an accident or an intentional foul, Laettner admitted during the airing of 30 for 30 documentary titled I Hate Christian Laettner broadcast in March 2015 on ESPN, that it was intentional. During the program, Laettner gave his reason for doing it, citing physical play by Timberlake particularly the latter's earlier fouls on him during the game. The former Duke center star also apologized to Timberlake over the incident. Personal life Timberlake is a devout Christian. He met his wife while both were studying in Southern Illinois University. He went on a mission trip to Zimbabwe, which helped strengthened his Christian faith. The couple has three girls. Timberlake remains a devout Christian today and is very active in North Atlanta Church of Christ where he also serves in a mentorship program of the church called Trail Guides. After retiring from international basketball, Timberlake went on to work as a telecommunications executive in the Atlanta, Georgia. Besides his new professional career, he still finds time to coach youth basketball.

It was sited outside the western part of the city, off the Buncrana Road in an area now covered by an industrial estate. After the United States Navy had evacuated the camp at the end of the war, local people living in over-crowded terraced homes, sometimes three families living in one small house, broke into the camp and [squatted] in to the huts in August 1946. The huts although without running water, electricity or any means of heating, they still provided the families with space, which was lacking in their previous homes. After a public outcry the Londonderry Corporation who were unionist/Protestant in the majority and who only obtained power by vote gerrymandering, granted \\"temporary\\" rentals to the new occupants and charged rent. This agreement was supposed to last 6 months after which the families were to be housed in proper house in Derry City. But this never happened due to discrimination, as the residents of Springtown Camp were over 90% catholic/nationalist.The quality of the accommodation was poor, however, and over time, children grew up, married and were obliged to live with parents, resulting in over-crowding. The conditions, in the tin huts deteriorated due to lack of repairs and became very unsafe, led to a sustained campaign for rehousing. The Corporation resisted this campaign for years but after a \\"silent\\" protest march by the residents from the camp to Derry's Guildhall was televised and beamed in to many homes throughout Ireland, pressure was mounting on the Londonderry Corporation to act.They again refused to re house the people of the camp, fearing the movement of so many catholic/nationalist to different areas of Derry could jeopardise their grip on power. However the residents protest gained so much support the Londonderry Corporation was forced to move on the rehousing of the people. Eventually all the residents were rehoused when on 11 October 1967 the two last families were finally housed to make way for the Springtown Industrial estate. Springtown Camp which was to provide temporary housing for the people for a maximum of six months was in existence for period of over twenty one years.The camp residents rightly claim the march on Tuesday 28 January 1964 from Springtown Camp to Derry's Guildhall was the first Civil Rights march in the 1960s and indeed was a precursor to the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association [NICRA] march in Duke Street Derry where the marchers were beaten by the RUC over the head with batons. This march led to worldwide condemnation of the Royal Ulster Constabulary [RUC] and led to other Civil Rights Marches throughout Northern Ireland which was the start of the \\"Troubles\\" in Northern Ireland which lasted over 30years.The Derry Journal in a two page article on their Friday 25 January 2019 edition on the coming 55th anniversary of the Springtown Camp silent protest march of Tuesday 28 January 1964.[See \\"Springtown Camp from the inside\\" by Willie Deery] carried a quote from founder member of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association [NICRA] Fionnbarra O'Dochartaigh confirming that that march was the first march in the civil rights campaign in Derry. He further confirmed it was the spark that lead to the formation of the Derry Housing association [DHA]. Willie Deery and Hugo Mc Connell are the former ex residents who have lobbied politicians for support to obtain planning permission to erect an Art Installation in remembrance of the Community who lived there.

This style of business building is referred to as \\"parallel entrepreneurship\\". History Idealab, founded by Bill Gross in 1996, was one of the first to introduce the 'incubator industry', and has started over 75 companies. Idealab was founded to test many ideas at once and turn the best of them into companies while also attracting the human and financial capital necessary to bring them to the market. The startup studio trend had really begun to gain momentum around 2008. Today, there are over 65 startup studios across the world, of which 17 have been built since 2013. Types There are several types of startup studio models. \\"Builder\\" studios A builder startup studio focuses on creating and developing a company, mostly from internal ideas. Notable examples of this model are Atomic, Pioneer Square Labs, and Rocket Internet. Unlike business incubators and accelerators, venture builders generally don't accept applications concerning their portfolio of companies, and the companies instead \\"pull business ideas from within their own network of resources and assign internal teams to develop them.\\" According to VentureBeat, Nova Spivack was \\"part of the early technologists who pioneered the venture production studio model. He wrote about the model in 2011 at a time when most of its production elements were still in gestation. Nova actually invented the Venture Production Studio term, calling it a 'new approach to building startups.'\\" \\"Investor\\" studios Investor venture studios bring in early-stage external startups and help them grow by providing them both funds and expertise. Studios Betaworks and Science, Inc. fall in this category. At the very end of the spectrum, some VC firms are growing closer to the startup studio model by intervening very operationally in the startup they invest; for instance Andreessen Horowitz and Google Ventures. However, this participation is usually limited to some areas, such as recruitment, fund raising, or PR relations. \\"Incubator\\" studios Incubator startup studios are accelerators that get equity in exchange of providing funds and expertise, but also get involved in building the startup. Overview Business model Startup studios are often mistaken with startup incubators and startup accelerator, or operational Venture Capital firms. The startup studio model is defined by three important criteria: * Startup studios focus their business on creating startups Unlike startup incubators or VCs, the main goal of a startup studio is to build a startup from the ground up. This implies an important involvement of time, dedication and resources to working operationally on the project for a period of time. * Startup studios build several startups following a repetitive process One focus of a startup studio is the rapid development and prototyping of new products. They work on multiple startups and projects simultaneously instead of building one project at a time. * Startup studios build an infrastructure that enables an efficient venture building process Startup studios own an infrastructure made of pooled resources: technical tools, management processes, and a multi-disciplinary team. By building several projects a year with the same team, startups studios can re-use this infrastructure, software and best practices across products. Features in early stage ventures ;Startup studios in the early-stage entrepreneurship environment Startup studios occupy a specific place in the entrepreneurship environment, based on the amount of human and financial support they provide to the startups: * Incubators and accelerators focus on providing advice and some operational guidance to the startups they select. They are mostly providing ‘Human Capital’. * Startup studios provide a high level of ‘Human Capital’ along with some ‘Financial Capital’. They dedicate a team to the development of their startups and inject limited funds early stage in their startups. * Angel investors and early-stage VC focus more on ‘Financial Capital’: they provide funds to help their portfolio startups develop, sometimes along with some guidance and strategic help.

They are distinguished from stakeholders in that they may have no stake in an organization's success, yet they still have the ability to shape its operating environment. The only stake an environmental activist may want in a coal company is a stake through its corporate heart, yet it can still shape the opportunities and risks of a coal company. Mark Kennedy first introduced the concept of shapeholders to business strategy in courses taught at Johns Hopkins University's Carey Business School in 2012 and while at George Washington University's Graduate School of Political Management through an article in Emerald Group Publishing's Strategy & Leadership journal in 2013 and through a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) in 2015. Shapeholders are important in business practice and in theorizing relating to strategic management, corporate governance, business purpose, corporate social responsibility (CSR), and creating shared value (CSV). Shapeholder Engagement Theory According to Shapeholder Engagement Theory treating shapeholders as stakeholders when they have little or no stake in an organization's success, leads to sub-optimal results. Therefore, unique engagement strategies are required. Seven Steps for Shapeholder Success One approach to effective shapeholder engagement is the “Seven Steps for Shapeholder Success” advanced by Mark Kennedy that takes a long-term view of the most beneficial path for organizations to engage with elements of society lacking a significant natural stake in their success. Each step begins with the letter \\"A\\". The first set of “A’s” – Align, Anticipate, and Assess – define how to be well positioned with respect to shapeholder actions. The second set of “A’s” – Advance, Avert, Acquiesce and Assemble – explain how to act in response to an attack or opportunity posed by shapeholders as illustrated by the Shapeholder Decision Matrix. Shapeholder Decision Matrix If organizations either must or believe they can prevail through the \\"Assemble\\" option in the Shapeholder Decision Matrix, it is essential to optimize the right mix of Why, What (Message), Where (Arena), Who (Coalition), How (Channel), and When in order to succeed.

The story alternates between their three points of view. The story begins with Sten, former Marine and Vietnam veteran, killing a mugger while on a vacation cruise in Puerto Limón (Costa Rica). The story then moves to California, where Sten is unable to understand or help his schizophrenic son, who considers himself a \\"mountain man\\" modeled on his hero John Colter.

Early life  She is a member of the ruling family. She received her primary education in Basra and then in Kuwait at Al-Khansa School, and her secondary education in Al-Merqab School. She received her BA in Economics and Political Science in 1973. She received her master's degree from the University of London in 1976. Her MA thesis was « Management and Planning in the State of Kuwait ». She earned a second a master's degree in Foundations in Arabic Language. She obtained a degree in economics and politics at Cairo University in 1973 and a doctorate in economics from University of Surrey in the United Kingdom in 1981.  Career  She is from the third generation of the modern poets in Kuwait. She expressed the concerns of Arabic women in general and Kuwaiti women in particular. She won the attention of the critics and researchers who classified her in different frameworks of art and poetry. She followed the path of feminist creativity that sometimes belongs to Romanticism and some times belongs to Apollo School. Founded in 1985, Dar Souad Al-Sabah Publishing and Distribution reprinted the volumes of Al-Risala Al-Adabiya, between 1933 and 1952, and was headed by editor Ahmed Hassan Al-Zayat. She founded several competitions to encourage Arab youth to literary and scientific creativity.  Abdullah Al-Mubarak Al- Sabah Prize  In 1988, she founded the Suad Al Sabah Foundation for Intellectual Creativity, a prize named for her husband Abdullah Al-Mubarak Al- Sabah, a specialist in scientific creativity, and a special prize for the youth of the occupied land. It also took the initiative to honor the Arab writers and creators in recognition of their work. Winners: * Thinker Abdul Aziz Hussein - Kuwait in 1995. * The poet Ebrahim Al-Arrayedh - Bahrain - 1996. * Arabic poet Nizar Qabbani - Syria in 1998 in Beirut. * Dr. Tharwat Okasha - Egypt - 2000 in Egypt. * Prince Abdullah Al-Faisal - Saudi Arabia - in 2001. * Dr. Abdelkareem Ghalab - Morocco - 2003 *Ghassan Tueni - Lebanon *Dr. Saleh Al-Ajairy - Kuwait - 2013 * Dr. Habib Al-Janhani - Tunisia - 2017 She participated in the Supreme Committee for the Liberation of Kuwait during the period of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990 through the mobilization of Arab organizations to resist that aggression. She convened conferences in defense of the country and the publication and issuance of leaflets and books in Washington, London, Geneva and Prague. Souad Al-Sabah is a member of the executive committee of the Worlds Muslim Women Organisation for South East Asia, and is on the board of trustees and executive committee of the Arab Intellect Forum.  Reception  Researchers took into consideration subjects in her poems such as national, social. emotional, love, or women's issues. They studied the sources of her poetry and its relation to the artistic rebel movements in modern poetry. Some of them studied her poetry in general such as S’ayd Farahat did in \\"A critical study in the poetry of Suad Al-Sabah\\", Mohammad Al-tunjy in \\"A traveler’s study in the poetry of Suad Al- Sabah\\", Fadil khalaf in \\"Poetry and the poet\\", Nabeel Rabeel Regheb in \\"Playing on tight strings\\", and Salah Fadel in \\"The sea rose and the freedom in feminist imagination, a journey in the poetry of Suad Alsabah\\". Other researchers studied her language such as Mahmoud Haider in his book The contiguity of language, Fadel Alameen who studied the \\"Intimate affiliation in Suad Al- Sabah, the poet of the intimate affiliation\\" and Samir Staityeah in his research \\"The linguistic function and texts analysis in the poetry of Suad Al- Sabah\\". This research is an attempt to take another path in critical study, and it embodies the duality of the subject and the object, and their dialectical relationship that appears with other dualities. These contrasts such as life and death, man and women, treachery and loyalty, abstract and concrete, subject and object are reflected in her poetry. She is a director of the Kuwait Stock Exchange.

Rainbow gravity (or \\"gravity's rainbow\\") is a theory that different wavelengths of light experience different gravity levels and are separated in the same way that a prism splits white light into the rainbow. This phenomenon would be imperceptible in areas of relatively low gravity, such as Earth, but would be significant in areas of extremely high gravity, such as a black hole. As such the theory claims to disprove that the universe has a beginning or Big Bang, as the big bang theory calls for all wavelengths of light to be impacted by gravity to the same extent. The theory was first proposed in 2003 by physicists Lee Smolin and João Magueijo, and claims to bridge the gap between general relativity and quantum mechanics. Scientists are currently attempting to detect rainbow gravity using the Large Hadron Collider.  Background  Rainbow gravity theory's origin is largely the product of the disparity between general relativity and quantum mechanics. More specifically, \\"locality,\\" or the concept of cause and effect that drives the principles of general relativity, is mathematically irreconcilable with quantum mechanics. This issue is due to incompatible functions between the two fields; in particular, the fields apply radically different mathematical approaches in describing the concept of curvature in four-dimensional space-time. Historically, this mathematical split begins with the disparity between Einstein's theories of relativity, which saw physics through the lens of causality, and classical physics, which interpreted the structure of space-time to be random and inherent. The prevailing notion about cosmic change is that the universe is expanding at a constantly accelerating rate; moreover, it is understood that as one traces the universe's history backwards one finds that it was, at one point, far denser. If true, the Rainbow gravity theory prohibits a singularity such as that which is postulated in the Big Bang. This indicates that, when viewed in reverse, the universe slowly approaches a point of terminal density without ever reaching it, implying that the universe does not possess a point of origin.  Criticism  There are stringent constraints on energy-dependent speed-of-light scenarios. Based on these, Sabine Hossenfelder has strongly criticised the rainbow gravity concept, stating that \\"It is neither a theory nor a model, it is just an idea that, despite more than a decade of work, never developed into a proper model. Rainbow gravity has not been shown to be compatible with the standard model. There is no known quantization of this approach and one cannot describe interactions in this framework at all. Moreover, it is known to lead to non-localities which are ruled out already. For what I am concerned, no papers should get published on the topic until these issues have been resolved.\\"  See also  * Steady State theory * Eternal inflation * Cyclic model  References  Category:Physical cosmology Category:Astrophysics theories Category:Theories of gravitation ","title":"Rainbow gravity theory"},{"id":"46242770","text":"Anna Marie Höljer-Serra (born 22 October 1965) is a road cyclist from Sweden.

Development Cauty originally got the idea for the film when visiting the United States in 2012, and seeing how different the attitude to alcohol there was to that in the UK. On one night of filming, Cauty and Levy-So were attacked by around four or five people but they continued rolling. Law enforcement would also occasionally interrupt the shooting process. The involvement of Russell Brand helped the film to become more widely noticed. Other interviewees included Government Drugs Advisor Professor David Nutt, BBC TV and Radio personality Dr Sarah Jarvis, and leading British charities Alcohol Concern, Alcohol Research and Druglink. Brand came on board after parts of the film were shot at the rehabilitation centre Focus 12, which Brand attended. Other filming locations included London, Liverpool, Bristol, Wales, Los Angeles, Paris and Devon (where the filmmakers are from). Total development on the film lasted around one and a half years. Cauty and Levy-So themselves are non-drinkers but are fascinated by drinking culture, particularly, by the huge role that it plays in British society, which motivated Cauty to make the film. A Royal Hangover is his feature debut. He hopes that after watching the film people will \\"see alcohol as a drug not as just a beverage or a form of entertainment\\". Research for the film began in November 2012, which is when fellow filmmaker, \\"soberist\\" and friend Silver Levy-So came on board as associate producer and camera operator, filming then began in April 2013. A trailer for the film was released on 15 September 2014. It received huge response and support from just weeks after release. Release The film premiered on 12 October 2014 at the Sunscreen Film Festival in Los Angeles. Other screenings occurred at the Reel Recovery Film Festival in Florida, the Cleveland International Film Festival in Ohio and the Piccadilly Cinema in Australia. It was also the opening film for the Cape Town Recovery Film Festival in 2015. It has been picked up by Journeyman Pictures and released on iTunes. The film is also available on Amazon Prime. Critical reception A Royal Hangover received positive reviews from critics. The Huffington Post said \\"if you understand alcohol abuse, or want to understand.

He founded the brand Stelbel in 1973. Career In aviation At the end of World War II, at the age of 13, Stelio Belletti began working for his father Antenore Belletti in his workshop in via Giovanni Antonio Amadeo in the Ortica district of Milan, where they repaired and built tubular steel aircraft fuselages. They produced fuselages for some important aeronautical companies in Milan, working for the most part with the Società Italiana Ernesto Breda where his father, Antenore Belletti, apprenticed in the years before the war started. In the early years of working with his father, they receive important commissions from Fratelli Nardi and Caproni di Taliedo. In the 50s, they established a relationship with the newly founded Aviamilano owned by Mario Vietri, who commissions a variety of projects from Belletti. The projects were often contracted through the engineer Stelio Frati, who regularly commissioned projects from the Belletti workshop, the majority of which were prototypes. One of the most important projects was the development of a fuselage for the F.8L Falco, a lightweight aircraft designed by Frati. They also built all the fuselages for the P.19 Aircraft, also for Aviamilano and designed by the engineer Ermenegildo Preti. The Belletti Workshop, driven by the aviation industry, was one of the first in Italy to acquire TIG welding equipment from the American company Miller. In the motorcycle industry 266x266px 266x266px Towards the end of the 50s, while continuing to work in the aviation industry, the Belletti Workshop began to establish important relationships in the motorcycle racing industry, working closely with Eng. Lino Tonti, building motorcycle frames for racing competitions. Some of the first frames were built for Paton in Milan, who they continued to work with until 1973. Paton motorcycles with Belletti frames, or replicas of the same, are identified with the initials BL, as can be seen in the BL3-R model which is still in production today. Starting in the 60s, other important brands such as Linto, Puch Frigerio, and Guazzoni begin to commission the Belletti family to build prototypes and special motorcycle frames for racing. One of the most significant achievements within the motorcycle industry dates back to 1967. That year, Mike Hailwood was to take part in the World Championship with a Honda 500 GP, but after the initial testing carried out that winter, the road racer began to complain about the performance of the frame. In 1967, the engineers at the Japanese company had been focused on developing the engine (which turned out to be among the most powerful in the Championship) and consequently decided not to make any further changes to the chassis. Referred by specialist Giuseppe Pattoni, Hailwood approached Stelio and Antenore Belletti as a private customer and commissioned them to construct a new chassis for his Honda 500 GP. They completed the tubular-steel double cradle frame in just 16 days. The Honda 500 GP motorcycle equipped with the new Belletti frame was used for the first time at the Mototemporada Romagnola, in the Rimini stage on May 14, 1967. The road racer won the race, breaking the winning streak of racer Giacomo Agostini who rode a MV Agusta. The motorcycle was also used in the World Championship while testing the Hockenheim circuit, but Honda forbade the use of the motorcycle during the race and for all subsequent races. In 1968, they also began construction on a limited series of frames to equip the Gran Prix motorcycle Linto 500 GP; all the frames for this model were designed by Belletti’s friend, Lino Tonti, and built by Belletti. The Belletti workshop continued to work in the motorcycle industry until the early 70s. In the bicycle industry Stelio Belletti has been passionate about racing bicycles ever since he was a boy. Starting in the 70s, he began to race in local and amateur competitions with excellent results. Spurred by a dry-spell in his family’s workshop and the dissatisfaction he felt towards the most recent racing bicycle he had purchased, Stelio Belletti tried his hand at bicycle frame building. His results encouraged him to found the Stelbel brand in 1973. Having honed his TIG welding skills while working in the aviation industry, he became the first Italian frame builder to build TIG welded frames. In 1975, Stelio Belletti patented the first bicycle frame welded with TIG welding techniques in Italy and that same year produced the frames for the Polish national team, who went on to win the gold medal in the men’s team time trial race at the UCI Road World Championships in Mettet. By the second half of the 70s, the Belletti workshop concentrated on the production of Stelbel bicycle frames, and gradually began to decrease their commitment in other areas of production. In the early 80s, for age reasons, his father Antenore left the company to Stelio, and under his management the company hired additional employees. Stelio Belletti is recognized to have been on the forefront of bicycle frame construction, always pushing the boundaries and experimenting with new solutions. He remembers being one of the first manufacturers to make stainless steel frames. Belletti continued to work in his family’s workshop until 1990 when the company closed. Over the following years, Belletti collaborated with other Italian brands producing TIG welded frames made with steel or aluminum tubing. Upon his retirement, Stelio Belletti has devoted his time to sports, participating in several cycling events, and even organizing some himself.

The chain was launched in 2013 by Chris Edwards Sr. and Chris Edwards Jr., who were the founders of the single-price chain, Poundworld. In 2015, TPG Capital purchased a majority stake in Poundworld and Bargain Buys. TPG Capital went into administration in 2018, with all Poundworld and Bargain Buys stores closed. Later in 2018, Poundstretcher purchased the rights to the Bargain Buys name and began opening new stores nationwide. The company headquarters are currently based in Kirby Muxloe, Leicester  History   Poundworld subsidiary (2013-2018)  Bargain Buys' first store was opened in Walsall in November 2013. Edwards and Edwards launched the multi-price chain to complement their single-price chain. Bargain Buys was the result of rebranding existing Discount UK (Discount NI in Northern Ireland) stores, initially launched in 2010. The name and branding was changed to allow the chain to compete more closely with its rivals in the market, and to exploit the expanded product range and knowledge that the business had built up. The stores were invented to rival the likes of popular discount retailers such as Home Bargains, B&M; Bargains and Poundstretcher. As of 2015, the chain had 41 stores across the United Kingdom . The company intended to expand rapidly, with plans to double the number of stores by 2016, and to open an additional 100 stores by 2018. In April 2015 it launched an online store in a bid to expand its customer base. The chain stocked over 8,000 products over 25 departments, this included groceries, home living and cleaning to toys, electricals and pet care. It sold leading household brands including Coca-Cola, L'Oréal, Fairy and Gillette. On 15 May 2015 the Edwards family announced that they had sold a majority stake in both Poundworld and Bargain Buys business to US private equity firm TPG for £150 million. On 11 June 2018, TPG announced that the Poundworld and Bargain Buys stores had appointed administrators after talks to sell the company fell through. At some point during or after June 2018, the official website was shut, and the Facebook and Twitter pages stopped being updated with new products and offers. Any remaining Poundworld stores closed in early August. It's not clear whether any Bargain Buys stores remained trading this long as well, or were closed earlier in June or July.  Poundstretcher subsidiary (2018-present)  Poundstretcher began to open stores under the Bargain Buys name towards the end of 2018, their first being in Paisley in September 2018. This was followed by 59 other stores across the UK. The Bargain Buys brand was purchased by New Money, a company established by Yorkshire-based property entrepreneur, Manni Hussain, who unsuccessfully attempted to trademark the Bargain Buys name in October 2018. Poundstretcher filed a month later and successfully won the trademark with the phrase 'Bargain Buys, Big Brands Big Discounts'. In early 2019, Poundstretcher was successful in trademarking the Bargain Buys name. Throughout 2019, the company has since opened over 75 stores across nationwide using the Bargain Buys name, with plans of more to come throughout 2020. As of October 2019, Poundstretcher has opened over 75 Bargain Buys stores, many of which are opened in former Poundworld and Bargain Buys units.

His father, J. K. Vance, a military officer, was a member of the South Carolina House of Representatives prior to the American Civil War. Vance received a bachelor's degree from the University of Edinburgh in Edinburgh, Scotland, where he was a member of the Chi Phi fraternity. Vance studied law privately in Abbeville in western South Carolina. In 1879, he relocated to Bellevue, then the parish seat of Bossier Parish in northwestern Louisiana, where he established an extensive law practice. He won a special election for the Louisiana State Senate, then District 21 and including Bienville, Bossier, Claiborne, and Webster parishes, to succeed John C. Vance, who resigned after five years in office. It is unclear how or if William Vance is related to this John C. Vance, but they were not brothers. John Vance was six years the senior of William Vance and was born in 1843 in Abbeville County, South Carolina, but it is unclear if William Vance had any association with Abbeville prior to 1870. William Vance served in the Senate from 1886 to 1892 and was also during the latter part of his tenure the assistant to state Attorney General Walter Henry Rogers. In 1892, Vance assumed his terminal position as the private secretary to two-term Governor Murphy J. Foster, Sr. In 1857, a bruise which would not heal developed on Vance's leg. Despite an amputation, cancer spread, and he died in 1900, three months before Foster left the governorship and was soon headed to the United States Senate. Vance was survived by his widow of only eight years, the former Sidney Ballard, a native of New Orleans, and two young children. He is interred at Magnolia Cemetery in Baton Rouge.

Durt Boi started his music attempts at the age of 9. Hailing from the tough streets of the Riverside community in South Memphis, Durt Boi had to overcome many struggles and hardships, such as his father being incarcerated when he was only 9 years old. After suffering from the devastating blow of his father receiving a life sentence, Durt had to adapt to the instability of bouncing from home to home between his mother, grandma, and aunt. Longing for that missing void in his life from the absence of his father, Durt enlisted in the Military service after graduating high school. According to PledgeMusic, after serving a tour in Iraq, Durt was stationed at Ft. Lewis in Seattle (Tacoma), WA. Realizing he had a true talent with music, Durt and two friends started the group, “The Durty Boiz.” From ’05 – ‘09 the group released two albums, “The Connection” and “Durty Dolla: 1st Deposit.” 2009 the group split up and Durt Boi returned home with his goal of pursuing a musical career. When he returned home he had the opportunity to work with C&N; Management and Marketing, where he launched his solo career. Durt Boi got his break in 2011 when he made the front cover of Memphis’ Streets Scene’s Magazine and was awarded the “Out of Town New Artist of The Year” at the 2011 Jackson Music Awards. Durt Boi has collaborated with rappers like 8ball&MJG;, Young Buck, Too Short, Devin The Dude, and Playa Fly. So far in 2015, Durt has definitely raised some eyebrows in the hip-hop community with the official release of the video to his new party anthem, Supa Soakar.

He began working for himself in 1945, opening a small workshop in the Ortica district of Milan, where he mainly repaired American aircraft fuselages as well as built new ones for Milanese companies. He collaborated on projects with companies such as Caproni, Fratelli Nardi and Aviamilano. Belletti worked independently in his workshop with the help of his son Stelio Belletti. At the beginning of the 60s, Belletti moved his workshop into a larger space in Rodano, a town in the province of Milan and, thanks to a loan granted to him by Artigiancassa, invested in the purchase of a TIG welder, a welding technique still relatively unused in Italy in those years. The purchase of this equipment allowed him to specialize in TIG welding. Thanks to the rapprochement of technicians Giuseppe Pattoni and Lino Tonti in the early 60s, Belletti began some fruitful collaborations with motorcycle companies. In the motorcycle industry, Antenore Belletti primarily worked for brands such as Paton, Linto, Guazzoni, Puch Frigerio and Honda, building frames for Grand Prix motorcycles. In the mid-70s, Belletti Sr. gradually began to pass his business onto his son Stelio, who, after founding the brand Stelbel in 1973, began to concentrate his efforts on constructing racing bicycle frames.

She had two brothers: Edwin Jr and Jared Kirk Funk. She grew up in Owensboro, and a few Air Force bases before she was in elementary school. Funk studied Biology and History at Murray State University in Kentucky and received her B.S. in 1969. She had wanted to attend medical school, but decided against it after volunteering at a hospital one summer. After graduating, she lived and worked part-time in Germany for two years and returned to the United States to teach high school for one year. She then spent a summer at the Hancock Biological Station on Kentucky Lake. There she discovered her passion for field work and research.[4] In 1975 she received an M.S. in Biology at Murray State where her thesis was A Floristic and Geologic Survey of Selected Seeps of Calloway County, KY. Her advisor was Dr. Marian Fuller. She spent the summer of 1975 studying aquatic plants at Stone Lab at Lake Erie. In the fall she started a PhD program at Ohio State University with Ron Stuckey as her advisor. She later changed her studies to Compositae with Tod Stuessy. She was an assistant curator at the Ohio State University from 1976 until 1977.[4] In 1980, she graduated from the Ohio State University with a Ph.D. writing her thesis on The Systematics of Montanoa Cerv. (Asteraceae), which was published in 1982 in the Memoirs of the New York Botanical Garden. In 1981 she spent a postdoctoral year at the New York Botanical Garden[5] where she studied Compositae with Art Cronquist[4] and the newly developing field of phylogenetics at the American Museum of Natural History. Funk was appointed as a research scientist and curator at the US National Herbarium of the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History in 1981. In 1986 she published A Phylogenetic analysis of the Orchidaceae (Smithsonian Institution Press) with Dr. Pamela Burns-Balogh. In 2004 she became a Senior Research Scientist and Curator of Compositae at the US National Herbarium Department of Botany. Funk's research included detailing evolutionary relationships and biogeogrpahy using plant DNA.[6] Funk co-discovered the critically endangered Bidens meyeri in Rapa Iti, French Polynesia. Funk's work shows that this Bidens species may represent the end of a migration from North American through the Society Islands to the Austral Islands.[7] Beginning in 1988, she served as head of the Biological Diversity of the Guiana Shield Program (BDG), and in 2015 began the Global Genome Initiative for Gardens, both headquartered at the Smithsonian Institution. Both of these programs were passed on to others in 2018. She was also an adjunct professor at George Mason University and Duke University.[3] Funk was a member of a number of societies and served in a position for many. She was the president of the Society of Systematic Biologists in 1998–1999, American Society of Plant Taxonomists 2006–2007, the International Biogeography Society in 2007 to 2009, the Botanical Society of Washington in 2014, and the International Association of Plant Taxonomistsfrom 2011 to 2017. She was in many other positions in these societies and others.  Awards and honors  In 2001, the government of Queensland awarded Funk a Queensland Research Fellowship.Queensland Research Fellowship In 2009 she was received two awards: the Secretary's Award for Excellence in Collaboration, and the National Museum of Natural History Science Achievement Award. In 2010 she was awarded the Stebbins' Medal for the best publication in Plant Systematics or Plant Evolution in the period 2007 to 2009 from the International Association for Plant Taxonomy. In 2012 she won the Smithsonian's Secretary's Award for Outstanding Publication and became a board member for the National Evolutionary Synthesis Center for two years. In 2014 she won the Rolf Dahlgren Prize for her major contributions to the understanding of the systematics and evolution of the angiosperms. Funk has also ben recognized for lifetime achievements in her field. In 2018 she won the Asa Gray Lifetime Achievement Award from the American Society of Plant Taxonomists. In 2019, the Linnean Society of London recognized Funk with its Linnean Medal, for lifetime service to the natural sciences. In 2019 the American Society of Plant Taxonomists announced the new Vicki Funk Fund for Graduate Student Research in her honor. The species Xenophyllum funkianum J. Calvo from the Ecuadorian Andes was named after her in 2020 in a posthumous co-publication.  Bibliography  * *  Select publications  She was the author or co-author of over 280 publications.

Background When Levs, a CNN journalist, requested extended paid parental leave from CNN’s parent company Time Warner in August 2013, he was denied anything more than the two weeks paid leave for biological fathers—much less than 10 weeks paid leave that were provided for women and for men who had babies through adoption or surrogacy. Levs used his two paid weeks, and additionally vacation and sick days as he cared for his three children and wife, who had developed severe preeclampsia. Levs filed a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) against Time Warner demanding equitable paid paternity leave, the claim essentially prevailing a year later. . Though Time Warner changed its family leave policies, the changes were not retroactive to benefit Levs himself. Content Kirkus Reviews wrote that All In provides \\"well-documented and easy-to-comprehend data on why men need more paid time off to be with their newborn children.\\" Levs' analysis was said to show how the workplace has not kept pace with the significant changes in \\"male-female dynamics at home\\" over the past 50 years, and that, in addition to his scrutiny and evaluation of paid paternity leave, Levs also considered issues relating to absentee fathers, lack of intimacy for new parents, and finding the mental and spiritual balance needed for parenting during times of stress. Publishers Weekly described All In as a \\"call for men to fight against the laws, policies, and stigmas preventing them from fully participating in their families’ lives,\\" more specifically, discussing parental leave, the tax system, paid family leave, the \\"doofus dad\\" stereotype, fear of men as predators, the stigma against men taking time off work for family, and a plea for men and women to work together, as well as providing action plans for family-supportive work environments. The Daily Beast's Andy Hinds added that All In argues that the \\"pop culture image of dads as lazy and uninvolved\\" is both false and damaging, pigeonholing both men and women. All In characterizes the workplace as forcing men to place career before family, and penalizing them if they don't. The book urges that men be accurately portrayed and more strongly supported in their fatherhood roles, such as with federally mandated paternity leave, and flexible commuting and telecommuting opportunities. Business Lexington's Paul Sanders wrote that All In reads like \\"a series of thematically linked essays\\" in a broad-brush approach that attempts to touch many facets of the problem, noting the book's extensive fact-checking approach. The book is said to spotlight gender discrimination in an American workplace that trails much of the world on the issue, noting that in industry's \\"war for talent\\" companies can attract and retain employees by offering paid paternity leave. The title All In is a play on the title of Sheryl Sandberg’s 2013 women's empowerment book, Lean In.See Levs was said to expand and detail Sandberg’s argument that advancing the American economy depends on changing workplace structures, not only for women but for men. Time's Charlotte Alter summarized the gist of All In as being that \\"men should lean in just as much as women—they should just do it in a different direction.\\" References External links * Author's website: JoshLevs.com Category:American non-fiction books Category:Discrimination in the United States Category:2015 non-fiction books Category:HarperOne books ","title":"All In (Levs book)"},{"id":"46243336","text":"Mohamed Selim Zaki (born 16 July 1924) is an Egyptian former equestrian who competed in the 1952 Summer Olympics, in the 1956 Summer Olympics, and in the 1960 Summer Olympics.

The film was shot in black-and-white. The film was successful at the box office and was followed by a sequel, Thou-Vou falakros praktor, epiheirisis \\"Yis Mathiam\\" (1969). Title The film title means Help! It is Vengos visible agent '000', in humorous reference to secret agents (1964). At the time Room 000 meant the public toilet. The title character is codenamed Thou-Vou (. \\"Thou\\" stands for Theta, \\"Vou\\" stands for Beta. They form the Greek initials of protagonist Thanasis Vengos (Θανάσης Βέγγος, pronounced: Thanássis Végos). Plot The protagonist is Athanasios Bobas (Thanasis Vengos), codenamed Thou-Vou. He is a secret agent in training, one of seven students of a spy school named after James Bond. He is trained in Karate, target practice, track and field, etc. He is, however, thoroughly inept. His trainer Zannino consistently grades him with 0. In order to graduate and receive his degree, Thou-Vou has to successfully complete three missions. He has to put in practice what he has learned so far. He is to be rated with a grade from 0 to 9. His grades will form the three numbers of his new codename. His first mission involves the beautiful daughter of a cantor. The girl is having a secret affair, and Thou-Vou has to find out who her lover is. His second mission involves a fashion company. Someone has been stealing its patterns and Thou-Vou has to uncover the culprits. The third mission is to recover a secret document which has been hidden away in a cake.

Çoban captured the city and the Kypchacks declared their loyalty to Keykubat. He returned to Sinop in 1224.Enfal history page According to Selçukname the history book written by Yazıcıoğlu Ali, an Ottoman historian of the early 15th century, when Keykubat travelled to east to take precations against a possible Mongol invasion, his regent in west Anatolia was Hüsamettin Çoban with Ertuğrul (father of Osman I of the Ottoman Empire) and his brother being his subordinates.Yücel-Sevim p. 183 The beylik In historical documents his name is not mentioned after the campaign to Sudak.

Biography Turner was descended from a Scottish family, was born at Barnstaple, Devonshire. He was educated for a time at Exeter College, Oxford, and at Christ's College, Cambridge, whence he matriculated in 1567, but left each university without a degree. In after years he said: \\"Non ego nunc, ut anteà, ætatem meam in nugis (ne quid gravius dicam) Oxonii apud homines hæreseos crimine obstrictos, neque in fabulis domi apud homines nulla politiori literatura excultos, otiosè, turpiter, nequiter contererem\\". Leaving his country and parents on account of his attachment to the Roman Catholic religion, he went in 1572 to the English College at Douai, where he became professor of rhetoric, and was ordained priest in 1574. In 1576 he went to Rome, and taught the classics for several years in the German College. He states that he was a pupil of Edmund Campion, but whether at Oxford or Rome does not appear. He was never himself, as has been sometimes stated, a member of the Society of Jesus. Turner was for some time prefect of studies at the college of Eichstadt in Bavaria; and, after many journeys and services undertaken for the Roman Catholic cause, he was, by the influence of Cardinal Allen, appointed professor of eloquence and ethics in the Georgian College at Ingolstadt, where he was created D.D. Subsequently he became rector of that university. He was also nominated one of the privy council to William, duke of Bavaria; but, incurring that prince's displeasure, he retired for a time to Paris. A year or two later he returned to Germany, and was made canon of Breslau in Silesia, and afterwards secretary for the Latin tongue to the Archduke Ferdinand, who had an especial esteem for him. He died at Grätz in Styria on 28 Nov. 1599.

In 1888, a line was extended from Londa towards the Portuguese colony of Goa where it connected with the Marmagao line at Castle Rock. (From 1902 this line was leased as the West of India Portuguese Railway.) By 1890, this line extended from Londa eastwards via Guntakal to Bezwada, and northwards to Poona, Via Belgavi & Miraj turning the SMR from an assortment of branches to a real railway network.

Built in 1906 and 1910 by Kent, they are an important reminder of his presence on the island. Both properties were later owned by artist James E. Fitzgerald, and now serve as a museum displaying his works. They were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. Description The Rockwell Kent Cottage and Studio occupy two discontiguous parcels of land on the north side of Horn Hill Road, overlooking the village on Monhegan Island. The cottage is a Cape style single-story wood-frame structure, with a side gable roof and shingled exterior. Short ells extend to either side from the gable ends. The main facade faces south, and is three bays wide, with the entrance in the rightmost bay, framed by sidelight windows. The studio is located about from the cottage, down a winding path. It is a slightly larger building, also a single story, with a gable-on-hip roof on its main block, with lower sections extending from the narrow ends. While the cottage is essentially vernacular in style, the studio has some distinctive Shingle style features, with a porch-like entry recessed under a hip roof on one of the ells. A wall dormer rises on the north side of the building, making space for a large picture window providing light to the studio space. History The buildings are two of four that were designed by Rockwell Kent during the years he spent on the island. The cottage was built in 1906, its design and construction overseen by Kent, whose formal training included architecture and design. He built a similar cottage for a neighbor (since altered), and another small house for his mother. In 1910 Kent built the studio, in part as a place to operate an art school in partnership with an art school friend, Julius Golz. It is here that Kent painted some of his best- known works, including Toilers of the Sea, Winter-Monhegan Island, and Down to the Sea. Kent left the island in 1910, selling the cottage, which was rented to his cousin Alice Kent Stoddard, a fellow artist. In 1948, Alice Kent Stoddard purchased the John Willey House from Alma Marshall Wincapaw, and Rockwell Kent repurchased his cottage from Alice, then he again spent several years on the island. In 1952, James E. Fitzgerald purchased the studio and six years later purchased the house. Upon Fitzgerald's death in 1971, his buildings and artwork were inherited by Edgar and Anne Hubert, who were his patrons and friends. Fitzgerald's estate, including the buildings, were bequeathed to the Monhegan Museum and Library upon Anne Hubert's death in 2004. Museum During the summer, the historic house museum is open to the public on a limited basis to view the works of Fitzgerald. A symposium was held on the 100th anniversary of the building's construction in 2007. The Kent Collector intended to publish papers from the symposium. It is produced by the Rockwell Kent Archives at the SUNY Plattsburgh Art Museum.

Cariplo In 1992, due to Legge Amato, the daily banking operation, charity and ownership were separated into a società per azioni and Fondazione Cassa di Risparmio di Foligno (a banking foundation). Cassa di Risparmio delle Provincie Lombarde also immediately acquired 20% stake in the new limited company.

In 2001, Ascoli was added into the mini-group, followed by Terni and Narni in 2003. In 2007, Carifol followed the ultimate holding company to become part of Intesa Sanpaolo Group. In 2008 the group acquired Banca CR Firenze. Intesa Sanapolo sold the shares of Casse del Centro (ex-Holding Intesa Centro) to Banca CR Firenze, making the Florence bank becoming the new intermediate holding company. merger In 2012 Carifol and 3 former member of \\"Casse\\" Central Holding, Città di Castello, Spoleto and Terni and Narni to become part of Casse di Risparmio dell'Umbria.

Leavitt House is a historic house on Main Street (Maine State Route 158) in the Sherman Mills village of Sherman, Maine. Built in 1890, the house is a high-quality and well-preserved example of Gothic Revival mail-order architecture, being a nearly-intact and faithful rendition of a design pattern published by the architectural firm of Palliser, Palliser & Company, deviating only in the addition of a carriage house. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. Description and history The Leavitt House is set on the north side of Maine State Route 158, at the northwest corner with Gardner Street. It is a 1-1/2 story wood frame structure, roughly rectangular in plan, with a multi-gable roof, clapboard and decorative shingle siding, and a three-story pyramid-roofed tower. The gables are steeply pitched, with vergeboard decoration. The front facade has a projecting bay window at the first level, sheltered by a shed roof supported by large brackets; above this in the gable are a pair of sash windows. Immediately to the right is the main entrance, sheltered by a similar shed-roof porch supported by turned posts. The toweris behind the main entrance, and there is next a gable section similar to the front facade on the right side. Behind this is a secondary entrance similar to the main one, a smaller gable section, and the carriage house, a 2-1/2 story structure with two bays and a gable- roofed square cupola. The only notable alterations to the exterior have been the removal of cresting from the roof, and the reconstruction of the chimney. The house was built in 1890 by Chester Coburn, a local contractor, for Alva P. Leavitt, a local wheelwright and blacksmith. The house is a faithful execution of Design #28 of an architectural pattern book published by the Bridgeport, Connecticut architectural firm Palliser, Palliser & Company. The notable deviation from the plans is the addition of the carriage house, which Coburn executed using stylistically similar elements to those present in the pattern. The house is one of the finest known examples of mail-order architecture in the entire state.

It is the first half of the maxim \\"Test early and often.\\" It was coined by Larry Smith in 2001.  Harm due to late testing  Shift- left testing is important because it helps to prevent the following types of harm due to late testing: * Testers may be less involved in initial planning, often resulting in insufficient resources being allocated to testing. * Defects in requirements, architecture, and design remain undiscovered while significant effort is wasted implementating them. * Debugging (including identifying, localizing, fixing, and regression testing defects) becomes harder as more software is produced and integrated. * Encapsulation impedes white-box testing, reducing code coverage during testing. * There is less time to fix defects found by testing, thereby increasing the likelihood that they will be postponed until later increments or versions of the system. This creates a “bow wave” of technical debt that can sink projects if it grows too large.  Types of shift-left testing  There are four basic ways to shift testing earlier in the life-cycle (that is, leftward on the classic V-model). These can be referred to as traditional shift-left testing, incremental shift- left testing, Agile/DevOps shift-left testing, and model-based shift-left testing.  Traditional shift-left testing  As illustrated in the following figure, traditional shift-left moves the emphasis of testing lower down (and therefore slightly to the left) on the right hand side of the classic V model. Instead of emphasizing acceptance and system level testing (e.g., GUI testing with record and playback tools), traditional shift-left concentrates on unit testing and integration testing (e.g., using API testing and modern test tools). The transition to traditional shift-left testing has largely been completed. Traditional-Shift-Left.jpgTraditional shift-left testing  Incremental shift-left testing  As illustrated in the following figure, many projects developing large and complex software-reliant systems decompose development into a small number of increments (Vs) having correspondingly shorter durations. The shift-left illustrated by the dashed red arrows occurs because parts of the single, large waterfall V model’s types of testing (shown in gray) are shifted left to become increments of the corresponding types of testing in the smaller incremental V models. When each increment is also a delivery to the customer and operations, then incremental shift-left testing shifts both developmental testing and operational testing to the left. Incremental shift-left testing is popular when developing large, complex systems, especially those incorporating significant amounts of hardware. Like traditional shift-left, the transition to incremental shift- left has also been largely completed. Incremental-Shift-Left.jpgIncremental shift-left testing  Agile/DevOps shift-left testing  As illustrated in the following figure, Agile and DevOps projects have numerous short duration Vs (sprints) in lieu of a single or small number of V as in the previous two examples of shift-left testing. These small Vs would also be modified if one or more early sprints are used to block out the basic requirements and architecture or if test-first and test-driven development (TDD) are being performed. The shift-left occurs because the types of testing on the right sides of the earliest of these tiny Vs are to the left of the corresponding types of testing on right side of the larger V(s) they replace. While the following figure appears remarkably the same for Agile and DevOps, Agile testing is typically restricted to developmental testing and does not include operational testing, which occurs once the system is placed into operation. The transition to Agile/DevOps shift-left testing is currently popular and ongoing. Agile_DevOps_Shift_Left_Testing.jpgAgile/DevOps shift-left testing  Model-based shift-left testing  The previous forms all concentrated on testing earlier in the development cycle. However, they all test after software exists and seek to uncover only implementation defects. Model testing theory argues that 45% to 65% of defects are introduced before implementation, during requirements gathering, architecture, and design. Model-based testing moves testing to the left side of the Vs, by testing requirements, architecture, and design models. This shift begins testing almost immediately, instead of waiting a long time (traditional testing), medium time (incremental testing), or short time (Agile/DevOps) for software to become available to the right side of the Vs. This trend is just beginning.

The character made her first screen appearance on 29 August 2013. She was introduced as part of established character Zac MacGuire's (Charlie Clausen) extended family. Hannah is characterised as a \\"strong and determined\\" and very family orientated. She arrives in Summer Bay with newfound responsibility of looking after her dead sister's children Oscar (Jake Speer) and Evelyn MacGuire (Philippa Northeast). She takes a job at the local hospital as a nurse. Her early storylines focused mainly on the MacGuire family and Hannah shared a brief relationship with brother-in-law Zac. Producers created a new partnership between Hannah and Andy Barrett (Tai Hara). The latter being a self-destructive character, their relationship is short-lived following the revelation that he is a drug dealer. Writers continued to involve Hannah in romantic themed stories when she develops feelings for her married colleague Nate Cooper (Kyle Pryor). Their attraction causes a feud between Hannah and Nate's mentally unstable wife Sophie Taylor (Bridgette Sneddon). When Hannah and Nate share a kiss, Sophie takes Nate hostage and causes a bus crash. The scenes formed the 2014 series finale and Hannah was left with life changing injures after two of her vertebrae were crushed leaving her paralysed. The story marked the character's first issue- led storyline. Howarth researched the plot intensively because she wanted to portray the disability correctly. Writers eventually paired Hannah and Andy together again. But their relationship is marred with Andy's personal issues, Hannah's struggle to regain the use of her legs and Hannah's infidelity with her ex-fiancé Sean Gleeson (Luke Pegler). After her break-up with Andy, she starts dating Chris Harrington (Johnny Ruffo). The character was killed off on 5 May 2016 ending three and a half years on the show. She suffered a head injury during an explosion at the Caravan Park. Casting The character and Howarth's casting were publicised on 27 August 2013. The character made her on-screen debut during the episode broadcast on 29 August 2013. Development Characterisation Hannah is characterised as being \\"a free spirit\\". Howarth called her character strong and determined. She also stated that Hannah would \\"fight fiercely for her family\\", but she has a fear of being alone and needs to be loved. The character is described on the show's official website as striving to be an independent female despite coming from a wealthy background. Hannah is left with the responsibility of caring for her deceased sister's children Oscar (Jake Speer) and Evelyn MacGuire (Philippa Northeast). Howarth told a Yahoo!7 reporter that \\"Hannah has to now struggle to stay selfless and responsible, to make sure the twins have the life their mother wanted for them.\\" Hannah is a strong and determined woman who is prepared to fiercely fight for the interests of her family. But Howarth noted that despite this, \\"[Hannah] needs to feel loved as she has a fear of being alone.\\" Howarth described Hannah's qualities as a \\"big heart\\" and being a positive person with \\"much get up and go\\". Introduction Hannah comes to Summer Bay to ask Zac MacGuire (Charlie Clausen) for his help, when she believes their niece and nephew are being brainwashed by a cult that Zac's brother, Ethan (Matt Minto), has got them involved in. Howarth explained \\"Hannah hasn't seen Zac in years, because he's been estranged from his brother. Hannah's sister, Sarah, was married to Ethan, but died a year ago. Hannah has been looking after the kids and helping her brother-in-law. She's played a real motherly role with them.\\" Zac initially thinks Hannah is over reacting, but decides to go and see Ethan and his children at the camp. Howarth said that Hannah has been to the camp a few times and has got a bad feeling about what goes on there. Ethan gives Hannah and Zac a tour; passing the place off as a group enlightening camp. Howarth called the storyline \\"hard-hitting\\" and added that it was not a smooth transition to life in the Bay. When Hannah arrives in Summer Bay she is in a lonely stage of her life. She feels as though she has no one due to her sister's death. The town provides a community atmosphere which Hannah embraces and Howarth added that her character wants to share this with Oscar and Evelyn. Hannah moves in with Zac and the twins, but her brother-in-law has romantic feelings for her and they try to start a relationship. It develops following the explosion at the hospital and the twins going missing, Hannah seeks comfort with Zac. Clausen said that \\"they're very attracted to each other. He's opened his arms to her and helped her through so much.\\" The pair decide to have a temporary break-up to concentrate on the twins well being. But Zac struggled to be around Hannah and she began spending time with Andy Barrett (Tai Hara) and an attraction develops between them. Clausen told Rebecca Lake from TV Week that \\"Zac never thought Hannah would be looking elsewhere for romance or that anyone else had come on the scene. It's a blow to his ego!\\" When Zac and Hannah stop communicating, he looks through Hannah's phone and she catches him. Clausen tried to defend his character's spying, saying that he does not mean to check up on her, but Hannah has the right to be angry. While Zac evaluates the situation he becomes regretful about his actions because he still has feelings for Hannah. Relationship with Andy Barrett Tai Hara (pictured) played Hannah's second love interest Andy Barrett. The show created a new romance storyline for Hannah with trouble-making character Andy. The show involved Andy is a drug dealing story in which he sells marijuana. On one occasion he stores a supply of the drug in Hannah's home but she discovers it and flushes it down the toilet. Hannah's actions leave Andy in debt and endanger his brother, Josh Barrett's (Jackson Gallagher) life. The storyline created increased danger and Andy was eventually beaten up by his suppliers. Hara said that Hannah finds Andy left on the side of a road with \\"quite severe injuries\\". He also warned that the unpredictable nature of the drug dealers leave those closest to him, including Hannah, at risk. An Inside Soap writer said that the beating leaves Hannah shocked. Following their second attempt at their relationship and her paralysis, Hannah tries to help to improve Andy's literacy skills. Andy needs to qualify as a personal trainer and pass exams. Hannah attempts to tutor Andy but he becomes irate and the pair argue. A TV Soap reporter stated that Andy \\"hated feeling like a five year old in front of her.\\" Andy tells Josh the truth which makes Andy realise that he needs to apologise to Hannah. Part of Andy's motivation to succeed at his exams is to make Hannah proud, so Andy receives tutoring from Josh instead of Hannah. Howarth told Kerry Harvey from TV Guide that Hannah and Andy have complete opposite personas but \\"balance each other well\\". She concluded, \\"I think with what's happened with the accident he's really risen to the occasion and he's been so good to her. I think at least for a while they'll be able to be happy.\\" Following Hannah's recovery and reuse of her legs, producers decided to create a series of new relationship problems for the duo to work through. Andy becomes jealous of Hannah's new found freedom: he sees Hannah dancing with another man and becomes violent and punches him. Hara said that the bad side of Andy had not surfaced for sometime, but seeing Hannah with another man makes him \\"see red\\". Hannah then meets her ex-boyfriend Sean Gleeson (Luke Pegler) and is unfaithful. Howarth said that her character \\"loves Andy and doesn't want to hurt him, but ultimately she's not happy.\\" Hannah remembers how exciting her life was with Sean and doesn't feel the same when she is with Andy. The pair are nearly caught in bed together when Andy comes home early. As she is not vindictive, Hannah struggles with the guilt of cheating, but still decides she wants Sean instead. But Hannah is shocked to learn that Sean is married and realises her mistake. She wants her infidelity to remain a secret, but Sean's wife arrives to confront Hannah. Howarth stated that the whole situation \\"blows up in her face\\". Hannah tells Sean that she is going to be honest with Andy, unaware that Josh has recorded her. Nate Cooper In later 2014, Hannah was briefly separated from Andy. Writers used the opportunity to introduce the character into her colleague Nate Cooper's (Kyle Pryor) storylines. Hannah develops feelings for him, but in denial over their attraction, Hannah's niece Denny Miller (Jessica Grace Smith) forces her to acknowledge her crush. His wife Sophie Taylor (Bridgette Sneddon) becomes suspicious of Hannah's intentions and is jealous when she sees Nate comforting Hannah. Hannah and Nate's attraction grows and the pair kiss while at work. Pryor told Stephen Downie from TV Week that \\"it's a spur of the moment thing\\" as Nate too had been in denial. He has relationship problems with Sophie but continues to protest she is imagining the attraction. Pryor added that Hannah is attractive and Nate is not having fun in his marriage. While he should keep away from her, \\"he's looking for moral support and he finds that in Hannah.\\" While Nate is in hospital following an abdominal injury, Hannah presides over his treatment, which annoys Sophie. Howarth says that Hannah and Sophie have never got on properly since they met. Though \\"Hannah seems to be enjoying his company more than perhaps she should. To Sophie, everytime Hannah and Nate are even in the same room it looks suspicious.\\" Desperate to keep Hannah away from Nate, she tries to compromise her career by accusing Hannah of medical negligence. This causes an argument between the two, and Nate tries to defuse the situation. As a result, he collapses and requires additional treatment. Howarth believes that it was her character's fault, and Hannah is left with the task of saving Nate's life. The pair kiss again, Pryor says a \\"good connection\\" had been developed between the two and it is hard for Nate to resist temptation. Sophie witnesses their tryst and retaliates by taking an overdose of pills she steals from Hannah. Paralysis For the 2014 series finale, Home and Away devised a bus crash story for their annual \\"cliffhanger\\". Hannah is one of the characters caught in the accident. Sophie becomes increasingly unhinged in the aftermath of Nate's infidelity and causes their vehicle to crash into the bus. The crash leaves Hannah and several other character's lives in danger. When the show returned in 2015, Hannah is seriously injured in the accident and is impaled by a piece of metal which lodges in her spine. Nate rushes to free her and save her life. It was played out as a \\"touch and go as to whether she will survive\\" scenario. Hannah is freed from the wreckage after drifting in and out of consciousness due to pain. But the \\"real battle\\" to survive starts in hospital when she is rushed into surgery. After, Nate informs Hannah that she has two crushed vertebrae and that she may never walk again. Howarth branded it an \\"horrific\\" situation for her character. First she believes she might not live and secondly she faces the prospect of being permanently paralysed. This leaves Hannah without any hope. Her nursing profession also plays a part in Hannah's pessimistic attitude. Howarth added that \\"Hannah knows what it means to be injured. So, no matter how much Nate assures her she will heal, she knows the facts.\\" Certain aspects of Hannah's paralysis upset Howarth (pictured)Howarth began researching paralysis and read about people's experiences living with the condition. She found it difficult to comprehend to because she believed it an impossible situation to come to terms with. She wanted to do the story \\"justice\\" and make it believable to respect those who really do lose their ability to walk. Howarth added \\"at the same time, you can really only go as far as the script takes you and, of course, it's television and it's going to be exaggerated a little.\\" One issue led part of the storyline showed Hannah wanting to be intimate with Andy. But due to her disability he is afraid of hurting her. Howarth was unhappy when she read the scripts as believed there were other topics that the storyline could have explored. However writers told Howarth that it is a \\"very real situation\\" and one they felt Home and Away needed to portray. Hara also defended the storyline stating, \\"I don't think anyone could possibly imagine this until they were in that situation.\\" It began on-screen as Hannah presumes that she is a burden on Andy. She wants to have sex and Andy's reluctance leaves Hannah feeling dejected. Howarth told an Inside Soap writer that Andy \\"freaks out\\" when Hannah tries to be intimate. That while Andy has been \\"fantastic\\" to Hannah, they do not have the same physical relationship they once shared so he finds it \\"strange\\". Nate informs Andy that there is no medical reason not resume sexual activity. Before he can apologise, Hannah ends their relationship wanting him to \\"enjoy a normal life\\" elsewhere. Howarth added that \\"Andy has become more like a carer to Hannah than a boyfriend, and she doesn't want that for either of them. She wants Andy to have the opportunity to be happy with someone else.\\" Despite this their love for one another remains and the actress added that Andy chooses not to give up on their relationship. But warned \\"it's going to be a big challenge going forward.\\" Andy decides he wants to be with Hannah still and tries to convince her otherwise. Hara told Erin Miller (TV Week) that Andy told Hannah he had changed and now he wants to prove it. His aim is to show Hannah that he loves her. The pair get back together but Hannah develops \\"cabin fever\\" from being homebound. She decides she needs to do something spontaneous and begs Andy to take her out on a boat ride. Howarth explained that being stuck at home has \\"taken its toll on her both physically and emotionally\\" and is \\"desperate\\" to go outside. The writers threw Hannah into yet another dangerous scenario as their boat capsizes and paralysed Hannah begins to drown. Howarth added that it is dangerous because of her condition and Andy frantically searches for her to save her. The stunt was actually only filmed in waist-deep water and Howarth had to make her character's drowning look authentic. Hannah regains feeling in her legs and in time makes a full recovery. Relationship with Chris Harrington Following the second break-down of her relationship with Andy, writers devised a new screen partner for Hannah. Hannah works alongside Chris Harrington (Johnny Ruffo) on a charity fund-raiser and they become better acquainted. When Hannah and Chris both have bad experiences dating, Irene Roberts (Lynne McGranger) suggests that the two should date which is not well received by Hannah. Howarth told a TV Week reporter that Hannah had not contemplated romance with Chris because she considered them only as friends. Writers created an ex-girlfriend for Chris to continue to develop their bond. Ivana Frost (Tegan Martin) pays a visit to Summer Bay, but Chris feels he must prove he has moved onto a more successful life and convinces Hannah to pose as his girlfriend. Ivana does not believe them because of Chris, Hannah fakes a kiss with him to fool Ivana's suspicions. Howarth commented that her character thinks she is helping Chris because \\"Hannah loves hanging out with Chris. She thinks he is really funny and he is a breath of fresh air.\\" The two become official following Hannah's jealousy when Chris kisses another woman. Howarth revealed that Hannah feels awkward about the kiss, but more unsettled that it makes her jealous. She truly believed Chris was just a friend and her jealousy peaks when he asks for dating advice. Hannah feels she cannot explain her feelings and reacts by kissing Chris. Howarth explained \\"she doesn't know how to articulate the way she feels, she just wants to kiss so she does.\\" But writers soon introduced problems playing Hannah wanting to be secretive about their romance. Chris eventually threatens to leave Hannah and she publicly confirms their relationship to other characters. Writers later reintroduced Hannah's main love interest Andy into her story, forming a love triangle. Howarth said that her character would try to \\"right her wrongs\\" in 2016. Hannah wants to learn from past mistakes when she ruined her relationship with Andy by being unfaithful. Ultimately Hannah wants \\"a fresh start\\". But by episodes airing in February 2016, Hannah succumbs to Andy's advances while still with Chris. Hara told Downie that \\"they've been through so much together, but, I think the constant is that he's always loved her.\\" It marked the first time she reciprocates and is unfaithful to Chris. Departure During episodes broadcast on 5 May, Hannah was caught up in the Caravan Park explosion and received a head injury. She initially appeared to be fine, but she later collapsed with internal bleeding and dies. Howarth later posted a message on her social media account, saying she was \\"forever grateful\\" for her time on the show. Reception An Inside Soap reporter included Hannah and Andy's romance in their \\"best bits of August [2014]\\" feature. They branded Hannah a \\"naughty nurse\\" and said they had undeniable on-screen chemistry. Stephen Downie (TV Week) branded Hannah an \\"unlucky-in-love\\" character. He later said that the chemistry between Hannah and Nate was \\"just too strong\\" and they were \\"like super-magnets\\".

She has exhibited nationally and internationally, and her work is in the permanent collections of the Smithsonian American Art Museum, The Mexican Museum, the Los Angeles County Museum, and the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art.  Biography  Cervantez was born in Garden City, Kansas and raised in Mount Palomar, California. Cervantez's mother was creative and served as an artistic inspiration to her daughter. Her childhood was spent in culturally segregated, rural areas and exposure to the conservative attitude of these neighborhoods inspired Cervantez to later join the Chicana/o movement. Later her family moved to Orange County. During high school, she focused on her watercolor skills. Cervantez received a BA from the University of California, Santa Cruz and in 1989 graduated from the University of California, Los Angeles with an MFA. A founding member of the Los Angeles art collective Self Help Graphics, Cervantez spent six years working for this non-profit dedicated to supporting community artwork. In 1987, Cervantez's work was shown in Chicago at the Mexican Fine Arts Center Museum. Her work was also part of the CARA project and traveling exhibition which opened in 1983 and had its final venue in 1994. Cervantez was a cast member of the feminist film, Define (1988), by O.Funmilayo Makarah. Between 1990 and 1993, she worked as a coordinator at the Los Angeles Municipal Art Gallery. Cervantez is currently a professor of Chicano Studies at California State University, Northridge.  Art  La Ofrenda (1989). Mural painted by Yreina Cervántez. Located in Los Angeles, California at the First Avenue Bridge. The mural depicts the first female Mexican American union leader, alt=La Ofrenda: mural depicting Dolores Huerta by Yreina Cervantez Cervantez's work often includes a rich visual vocabulary that draws inspiration from pre-Columbian history, Central American politics, the urban landscape of Los Angeles and sometimes herself, as a viewer of what she is painting. She overlaps two different \\"worlds,\\" one of the present and another of the past, creating a visual space where ideologies are explored and examined. She uses the visual language of Aztlan to create a new artistic vocabulary. Growing up, Cervantez did not see many Latina images in popular culture and because of this, her portraits of Latina women and her self- portraits became an important part of her work. Cervantez's self-portraits show an artist that is at once whole and fragmented, experiencing nepantla. Cervantes often uses the self-portrait technique in order to explore cultural identity. In many of her self-portraits, she continues to blend contemporary culture with Aztec and mesoamerican imagery. Cervantez uses much of this type of iconography of the past in order to update the symbols and create a modern feminist perspective. Her female figures are often described as \\"inspiring representations of female agency.\\" Cervantez's art is also concerned with helping the viewer recognize that Chicanos are already in their own \\"ancestral homelands\\" and are actually not \\"immigrants\\" to the United States. Cervantez has also created many large-scale murals in Los Angeles and is considered a pioneer of the Chicana mural movement. She was involved with designing and painting part of The Great Wall of Los Angeles, which is thought to be the longest mural in the world. Cervantez has been a major influence on artist Favianna Rodriguez, who was so impressed with a printmaking class she took with Cervantez that she quit school to become a full-time artist.

Sercevičius played for the center position and had the outstanding ability to shoot the hook shots with both hands, which earned him the nickname of \\"The Second Lubinas\\". However, his international career was impeded by his anti-Soviet political record. Biography According to Antanas Kuzdys, Sercevičius was arrested because he refused to purposefully lose a basketball match to a team from Moscow in 1945. He was arrested and sent to mines in Vorkuta by the Soviets. Following his return to Lithuania, he was a candidate to the Soviet Union national basketball team for four straight years, including the team sent to EuroBasket 1947 where it won gold. His place was taken by another Lithuanian, Justinas Lagunavičius. He was not selected because was not allowed to leave the Soviet Bloc due to his arrest. As a student at Lithuanian National Institute of Physical Education (LVKKI), Sercevičius played for the institute's team. He was also a member of the Lithuania SSR men's national basketball team (1945–51), playing 11 matches and scoring 73 points. Upon graduation in 1951, he joined the legendary Lithuanian club Žalgiris. He coached Žalgiris in 1951 and 1953–55. During his career, Sercevičius won five Lithuanian and two Soviet championships. After retirement from active sport, he continued to teach at the Lithuanian National Institute of Physical Education until his retirement in 1984. In 1990s, during one of his interviews, he described his career by telling: \\"My sporting period was beside Stalin and Brezhnev and we cannot consider that it went as it could went. <…> Being young we had in mind that we represent Kaunas, the republic in the Soviet Union, we fought for our nation, ideas, we acquainted the people that there is such Pabaltijis, such cities. <…> There was a stimulus that we fight for Lithuania and there were games when we reached victories during the crucial moments, however the satisfaction wasn’t complete because we competed for the Lithuanian SSR. <…> Personally, I haven't played till 1940.

It is situated between Little Thornton and Poulton-le-Fylde along the western banks of the River Wyre, about three miles south of its mouth between Fleetwood and Knott End. These banks are known as Skippool Creek, an historic docks area now home to mostly run-down vessels. The MV Good Hope, for example, may date from the 1830s. The B5412 (Skippool Road) passes through Skippool, ending at the roundabout it shares with Mains Lane, Breck Road and Amounderness Way. Skippool is believed to be a joining of the Old Norse word skip, which means ship, and the Old English pull/pol, for a slow-moving stream.Skippool - Wyre Archaeology Group History A sign on Wyre Road, near Thornton Lodge Skippool, more specifically its creek, was a major trading port for hundreds of years, similarly to that of Wardley's Creek on the other side of the river.\\"History of Skippool\\" - VisitCleveleys.co.uk It is understood to have been in constant use from the end of the Middle Ages. Goods arrived at the docks from all over the world. Flax was brought in from Ireland and the Baltic; timber came from North America; and tallow arrived from Russia. More locally, limestone and oats were transported from Ulverston and coal from Preston. Its popularity fell out of favour when Fleetwood's port opened in the 1840s.\\"THE RIVER WYRE PORTS, SKIPPOOL CREEK AND WARDLEY'S – POULTON, BLACKPOOL AND THE FYLDE COAST\\" - JohnEllisBFC.wordpress.com A 1610 map gives the name of the river as Skippon Flue. In 1787, another map gives the area the modern spelling of Skippool. A pub has stood on or near the site of today's Thornton Lodge since around 1824, when it started out as The Crackers Head. It became The White Horse a decade later, then, in 1866, The Brockholes Arms. A bone mill, called Silcocks, also stood near the docks. Silcocks Cottages, a home on Skippool Road about half a mile to the north, preserves this name. Sport Thornton Cleveleys Cricket Club is located in Skippool, on land leased to it by Frederick J. Emery, one of the owners of the now-demolished Edwardian mansion The Illawalla, in the early 1950s.History - Thornton Cleveleys Cricket Club's official website Businesses Blackpool & Fleetwood Yacht Club is located just beyond the northern end of Wyre Road, which runs along the head of the docks.

Notable residences In addition to the Illawalla, there are three other notable residences on Skippool Road. Ashley Hall was where select celebrities would stay while they were appearing on Blackpool's North Pier. These include Danny La Rue and Roy Castle. On the opposite side of the road is Thornton Hall. On Wyre Road, The River House was built in the late 1830s.

With Anna P. Schenck (1874–1915), she was a partner in the firm of Schenck & Mead, which was acclaimed in 1914 as the first team of women architects in America but was actually formed later than both Gannon and Hands and the partnership of Florence Luscomb and Ida Annah Ryan. Schenck died early in their partnership, after which Mead pursued a solo career. Education Marcia Mead was born in Pittsfield, Pennsylvania, in 1879, and in 1898 she received a degree from the State Normal College in Edinboro. She went on to the School of Architecture at Columbia University and in 1913 became the first woman to graduate from that program. Around this time, she worked for the university's superintendent of buildings and grounds, and she also placed among the top ten finalists in a contest to design structures for a piece of land in Chicago. Although Mead's plan wasn't ultimately chosen, it was featured in promotional literature. Anna Pendleton Schenck was born on January 8, 1874, and studied architecture privately before gaining work as a draftsperson with various New York architectural firms. Career Mead and Schenck may have begun working together as early as 1912. When they formed the partnership of Schenck & Mead in early 1914, they were (incorrectly) hailed by the New York Times as the first firm of women architects in America; that milestone had actually been set two decades earlier by Gannon and Hands. After Mead and Schenck opened their offices in midtown Manhattan, their first commissions included a summer home and a bungalow-style residence. Their main interest, however, lay in designing housing that was practical for women, modern tenements for the poor, and neighborhood developments for the working classes. They planned to work from \\"the feminist side\\" of things, giving priority to matters like closets, clothes chutes, and water pumps that they felt made a world of difference in women's lives but were often neglected by male architects. In addition, they approached community planning and design holistically, taking into account not just individual residences but also street layouts, store locations, and open space. In 1915, Schenck & Mead won a nationwide architectural competition sponsored by the City Club of Chicago for a neighborhood center. Their proposal was for a center an area of the Bronx between Washington Bridge and Macombs Dam Park. Around the same time, they put forward a proposal for a group of model homes for the poor in Washington, D.C., to be known as the Ellen Wilson Memorial Homes after the late wife of then-President Woodrow Wilson. The plan was ambitious, comprising a playground, day nursery, laundry, small emergency hospital, communal kitchen, library, and club rooms, alongside 130 individual residences. On April 29, 1915, just a few months after the firm won the Chicago competition, Schenck died of pneumonia. Mead continued to use the firm's name for several years while establishing a solo practice. Anna Pendleton Schenck ca 1915. One large 1917–18 project for which Mead was the lead architect was in Bridgeport, Connecticut, which had a shortage of affordable housing as a consequence of the rapid development of war-related industries like shipbuilding during World War I. A local firm, Bridgeport Housing Company, financed construction of a group of 87 one- and two-family row houses designed by Mead. The development occupied a city block and was laid out around a central playground, keeping the children away from automobile traffic. Unusually for the time, about half of the houses had a hot water system supplied from a nearby powerhouse. In discussing her design for this community housing, Mead stressed the importance of cross-ventilation and windows for light, and she paid close attention to the structure of a housewife's day since \\"the work of taking care of the home falls to her lot.\\" During this project, for example, she managed to get the local standards for sink and washtub heights changed to be higher, using live demonstrations to convince officials that basins set too low strained women's backs. In 1918, Mead became the fourth woman member of the American Institute of Architects, and in 1929 she was made a Life Member. In 1923–24, the Canadian architect Esther Hill worked for Mead as an apprentice. Mead died in 1967. Legacy Since 1983, Barnard College has had the Marcia Mead Design Award for undergraduate excellence in architectural design. Publications *Mead, Marcia, ed.

It is located in a small public park on the east side of Maine State Route 182 at its junction with Grist Mill Road in Franklin, Maine. It is the only known surviving intact example of the form, which was used widely in Maine's granite quarries. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. Description and history The galamander is a wagon-like conveyance, about long and wide. It has four wooden spoked wheels, the rear pair in diameter and the front ones . The wheels have iron hubs and the wearing surface is also finished in iron. The \\"frame\\" of the wagon is a single large wooden beam, to which the rear axle assembly and a front swivel mount for the front axle are attached. A simple seat with a metal spring is fastened above the front axle, and a derrick consisting of a single tapered beam is attached to a swivel mount above the rear axle. The derrick was used (in conjunction with a block and tackle) to raise slabs of stone onto and off the galamander. The wagon is braked by friction pads on the rear wheels which are activated by a lever controlled by the driver. The galamander would have been drawn by a team of horses or oxen. It is presently set in a display configuration under a gable-roofed shelter in a small municipal park, along with interpretive panels explaining its historical use. This galamander is one of only two known to survive from Maine's quarries. The other, the Vinalhaven Galamander in Vinalhaven, Maine, is a 1960s reconstruction of one that was deemed in too poor condition to restore completely. The exact origin of the galamander's creation is not known, but they were in common use in Maine's mid-coastal granite quarries from the late 19th century into the early 20th century, with one historian crediting their development to Rev. W. H. Littlefield of Vinalhaven. This galamander was recovered from a local quarry in 1965.

As with the original Sonata, the soloist in this arrangement can either be a clarinet or a viola.  Composition  An avant-garde composer, Luciano Berio was also active as an arranger, an example being his Quattro versioni originali della \\"Ritirata notturna di Madrid\\", an arrangement of Luigi Boccherini's Musica notturna delle strade di Madrid. Op. 120, No. 1 is an arrangement for clarinet and orchestra of Johannes Brahms's Clarinet Sonata Op. 120, No. 1, which was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic in 1986, and was premiered with clarinetist Michele Zukovsky in Los Angeles, on 6 November 1986. The composition was dedicated to Franco Debenedetti and Barbara Debenedetti and was later published by Universal Edition. Brahms himself stated once in a letter to the dedicatee of the original composition, Richard Mühlfeld, that he had not \\"been so impulsive as to write a concerto\\" for him. The arrangement retains the title of 'Sonata' even though, given that it is arranged for soloist and orchestra, it could be considered a concerto.  Structure  Op. 120, No. 1 is in four movements and takes 25 minutes to perform. As in the case of Brahms's original composition, the soloist part of Berio's arrangement can be played by either a clarinet or a viola. Berio played close attention to the original, only adding an extended introductory section and arranging the rest of the composition for orchestra, leaving the clarinet (or viola) part almost unaltered. The list of movements in this composition are as follows: The composition is scored for clarinet (or viola) and an orchestra consisting of two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets in B-flat, two bassoons, one contrabassoon, three French horns in F, two trumpets in C, one trombone, timpani, and a full string section.  Recordings  * The world première recording was made 1992 with clarinetist James Campbell and the London Symphony Orchestra under Geoffrey Simon for Cala Records. *The Orchestra Sinfonica di Milano Giuseppe Verdi recorded the piece under the baton of Riccardo Chailly with clarinetist Fausto Ghiazza under Decca Records.

It was based on HMS Formidable moored off the shore from 1870 until 1906. It then used a purpose built facility nearby until its closure in 1982. Formation The National Nautical School was formed by a committee composed of several Bristol business men led by Henry Fedden as a training school for penniless boys aged between 10 and 15 from Bristol. Many of the semi-delinquent boys were sent by the courts. Fedden was chairman of the Bristol Board of Magistrates and frequently saw boys brought before the courts on charges of truancy, theft and begging. An application was made to open the school under the Industrial Schools Act of 1866. At least £2,700 was raised by voluntary contributions from local citizens. The committee were offered HMS Ajax. However, the repair bill for the ship would have been considerable, and they therefore repetitioned the navy and were eventually leased HMS Formidable. HMS Formidable HMS Formidable was launched on 19 May 1825 at Chatham Dockyard.Lavery, Brian (2003) The Ship of the Line — Volume 1: The development of the battlefleet 1650–1850. Conway Maritime Press. . It had been an 84-gun second rate of the Royal Navy, with ports for guns on upper, main, and lower decks, however was known as a two-decker. The deck was long and a breadth of beam about . It was leased to the Bristol Training Ship Association by the Royal Navy in 1869 and sailed from its mooring at Sheerness in Kent and moored off the pier of the Portishead Railway near the Black Nore Lighthouse. Captain Poulden, who had been in HMS Excellent at Portsmouth was appointed to the command. The Industrial School Ship for up to 350 boys was opened by Charles Kingsley. In 1884 Poulden was replaced as the captain superintendent by Captain R.B. Nicholetts who served until 1900 when Commander Willoughby E. Still was appointed. A regime of strict discipline was imposed; however in a visit by the mayor of Bristol and local dignitaries in 1896 this was found to have been an efficient training regime. Several boys died on the ship, some from infectious diseases and others from injuries received or by falling overboard. The ship was damaged in storms and, once the onshore building was ready, HMS Formidable was scrapped. Archives Records of the National Nautical School, including records of the Clifton Industrial School, are held at Bristol Archives (Ref. 38087) (online catalogue). Onshore In 1906 an onshore building was opened by Princess Helena within a site. The School was built by Edward Gabriel in 1905, at a cost of £30,000. It had three storeys with four storeys in the central tower with a basement. The building was fronted with Ionic pilasters. The dormitories had wooden floors and hammocks to simulate the environment on a ship, although the hammocks were later replaced with beds. A gymnasium was also provided. The land in front of the building was used as a parade ground and then had playing fields close to a jetty and the foreshore. The mizzen-mast from the old ship was placed in the school grounds. Other timber was used to make the pulpit of the school's chapel, which was built on land donated by William Wills, 1st Baron Winterstoke. The Clifton Certified Industrial School, which was also known as the Mardyke House School, which had been established in 1849, was amalgamated with the National Nautical School in 1924. Alterations were made to the building in 1928 with W.A. Williams as the architect. In 1931 it was re- certified for 225 boys and from 1933 became a senior approved school. The pupils were taught seamanship and other relevant skills such as shoemaking, tailoring and carpentry. The school also had a military band. Between 1869 and 1909 over 3,500 boys were discharged from the school. 192 entered the Royal Navy however a larger number (2,312) gained employment in the Merchant Navy. The building was designated as a Grade II listed building in 1983, the year the school closed. The building is now part of a private gated community known as Fedden Village. A sculpture commemorating the school has been erected in the Port Marine Development in Portishead, and another in the shape of a compass has been installed in North Weston cemetery as a memorial to those who died on the Formidable.

It is the third in a trilogy of short stories that make up the Paladins of Shannara series, first published in 2013. Plot summary A year after the events of The Sword of Shannara, Shea has become very ill. Fearing for his life, Flick goes to a woods witch and seer named Audrana Coos. She gives him a small bottle of liquid and tells him to give it to Shea secretly. She also tells him that Shea will soon go on another quest and that Flick should not dissuade him. Flick does not believe her, but he slips the liquid into Shea’s ale later and the next day Shea’s health has completely recovered. Later Flick tells Shea about the woods witch and Shea thanks him and assures him that he will not be going on any quests or leaving the Vale again. Then Panamon Creel arrives. Creel tells Shea that the Black Irix that Keltset the rock troll used to save their lives and was lost when he was killed has been acquired by a collector of rare artifacts called Kestra Chule. He tells Shea that he must use the power of the elfstones to help him find and recover it so that he can return it to his fallen comrade’s family. Reluctantly, Shea agrees. Creel and Shea set off, but Flick refuses to accompany them, angry that Shea is leaving with the untrustworthy Creel. However, Flick catches up with them later. Shea then uses the elfstones to discover that the Black Irix is hidden in a vault in Kestra Chule’s private quarters within his fortress. Flick questions Creel as to how he expects to gain entry into this fortress. Creel informs them that Chule is actually a good acquaintance, and that they have been invited. When they arrive at the fortress, they indeed are invited in and given a great feast, after which Chule has his guards put the Ohmsfords in chains. Creel then takes the elfstones off of Shea and presents them to Chule in exchange for a hefty sack of gold. Chule promises to lock the brothers up overnight and release them in the morning, perhaps… Flick is angry that Shea trusted Creel despite his warnings, but in the early morning hours the Ohmsford brother’s cell door opens and there stands Panamon Creel. He had worried that Chule would kill them to keep the Elves from learning he had the elfstones. Shea refuses to leave without the elfstones, to which Creel responds by handing them back. Creel then convinces the guards to let them go. On the road Creel informs the brothers that Chule had told him he had acquired the Black Irix and needed somewhere to store it. Creel suggested a vault maker to build a vault for him. Later he paid the vault maker a large sum of gold for the backup combo. He then needed a reason for Chule to let him get close. So the elfstones served two purposes. They convinced Chule to let him in so that he could buy the elfstones. They also helped him find the vault. He reveals that after the brothers had been confined, he slipped some sleeping potion into Chule’s drink, and while he slept, stole the Black Irix, and the elfstones back. Shea dismays over the fact that Chule will surely come after Creel, but Panamon says he is not that easy to find. He then sends the brothers on their way home, and heads off to return the Black Irix to Keltset's family.

Life Kayghalagh was one of the many Turks who entered service of the Abbasid Caliphate as soldiers (ghilman), and rose to be a prominent commander. Like most senior Turkish military figures of the late 9th century, he was apparently a protégé of the powerful Musa ibn Bugha, the most influential of the Turkish leaders until his death in 877. He is first mentioned in al-Tabari's History of the Prophets and Kings in June 870, when he was sent by Caliph al-Muhtadi to calm a riot among the people and troops at al-Karkh, along with Tabayaghu ibn Sul Artakin and the Caliph's brother Abdallah. As the crowd neared the palace, however, most of the senior officials and commanders, led by Abu Nasr Muhammad ibn Bugha, fled. Enticed by assurances to return, however, they did so, only to be immediately thrown into prison. Kayghalagh's role as administrator of the palace passed to Masrur al-Balkhi, who had remained in the palace. Kayghalagh is next mentioned in 873, when he attacked and killed a certain Takin (an unidentified individual, as he is unlikely to have been the same as the Abbasid general of the same name). In 875/6, he was appointed governor of Rayy following the death of his predecessor, al-Salabi. Following the death of the vizier Ubaydallah ibn Yahya ibn Khaqan in August 877, Kayghalagh was granted possession of his palace at Samarra. In 879/80, he was appointed governor of the province of Jibal. At about the same time, his brother Abrun was serving as governor of Qazvin, a city in Jibal. In 880, Kayghalagh led the Abbasid troops into a campaign against the autonomous magnate family of the Dulafids. Kayghalagh was victorious in a first battle near Qarmasin and entered Hamadan, but the Dulafid leader, Ahmad ibn Abd al-Aziz ibn Abi Dulaf, rallied his forces and decisively defeated Kayghalagh, forcing him to retreat to Saymarah (September/October 880). Kayghalagh is last mentioned in April 883, but his sons Ibrahim (died 916) and especially Ahmad (died 935) later rose to become senior commanders.

Priest was the recipient of many awards for her artistic talent and philanthropic contributions to many social organizations that focused on issues of homelessness, education, and civil rights. Life Terri Priest was born in Worcester, Massachusetts on January 20, 1928 to Anna and Joseph J. Khoury. During her childhood, Priest was a constant student of art at the Worcester Art Museum School. From 1967 to 1976, Priest taught part-time at the Museum School. During this time, she also took enrichment courses at Quinsigamond Community College before she received a masters in Fine Arts from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst in 1977. Following her artistic education, Priest helped co-run the Fletcher-Priest Gallery in Worcester for several years. She went on to be a professor at College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts for fourteen years, where she served as a mentor to many students. In 1993, Priest retired form the College of the Holy Cross in order to devote more time to her own painting and to the Fletcher-Priest Gallery. Priest's works were supported by a number of grants from Holy Cross, Worcester Community Foundation, and the Frances Kinnicutt Foundation. She was an active supporter of the Worcester Art Museum and the galleries at Clark University, UMass Amherst, Worcester State University, and College of the Holy Cross. Priest died on September 13, 2014 at the age of 86 at her home in Worcester, with her two sons at her side. Philanthropy Priest was very committed to Abby's House, a shelter for battered women and children in Worcester, Massachusetts. She was the happiest when she was learning, and strongly believed that education was the engine that would keep cities, communities, and the world a better place. Her mission was to afford opportunities for all who would take the time and interest to follow their dreams. This passion inspired her to play an important role at the Nativity School in Worcester, which enables young boys from disadvantaged areas to finish elementary school and enables them to attend private and public high schools, based on performance. Artworks In the 1970s Priest worked in abstraction using large striped areas of color in her work. She would attach these paintings to each other in varying ways to create different compositions. Art History was always the impetus for Priest's artwork. Terri Priest's work was greatly inspired by the mystery associated with the women in the paintings of Johannes Vermeer, one of the greatest painters of the Dutch Golden Age. The women in Vermeer's paintings typically stood quietly and did not perform complicated or complex tasks. Terri Priest borrowed his style in feminine depiction and repurposed them in her own paintings. She took them in their original setting and placed them in the context of modern painting. These renditions were first widely seen in her exhibition at Clark University in 2001. Proof of Priest's success can be seen in the many positive reviews she received throughout her career including a review by Cate McQuaid of the Boston Globe which referred to Priest's work as sly social commentary. Awards and recognition Priest's artworks are currently in permanent collections in several artistic institutions including The Worcester Art Museum, California College of Arts, Springfield Museum of Fine Arts, and at the Decordova Museum. She was called Worcester's most celebrated living artist by Nancy Sheehan in 2012. Sheehan referred to Priest's impact on the local art scene as the \\"Terri Effect\\".

She was the curator of the Iowa State University Herbarium, which was renamed the Ada Hayden Herbarium (ISC) in her honour in 1988. During her career, she added more than 40,000 specimens to the herbarium. Her studies and conservation work were particularly important in ensuring the preservation of the tallgrass prairie. The Hayden Prairie State Preserve, the first area dedicated as a preserve under Iowa's State Preserves Act of 1965, is named in her honor. Also named in her honor is the Ada Hayden Heritage Park in Ames, Iowa.  Childhood and education Ada Hayden was born 14 August 1884 near Ames, Iowa to Maitland David Hayden and Christine Hayden. While still in high school, Louis Hermann Pammel became her mentor. She earned a bachelor's degree from Iowa State College in 1908, studying botany, a master's degree from Washington University in St. Louis in 1910, and a Ph.D. from Iowa State in 1918. She was the first woman and fourth person to receive a doctorate from Iowa State College. Career Hayden taught botany as an instructor at Iowa State beginning in 1911, and continued in this role until she earned her doctoral degree. She became an assistant professor of botany in 1920, and a research assistant professor at the Agricultural Experimental Station (Lakes Region) and curator of the herbarium in 1934. She worked closely with Louis Pammel and Charlotte King, contributing to The Weed Flora of Iowa (1926) and Honey Plants of Iowa (1930). She concentrated on prairie plants of the lakes region, and is credited with \\"possibly the best published native flora survey… of any part of Iowa\\". She was an early advocate of prairie preservation, writing and speaking in its support. In 1944, she and J. M. Aikman released a report identifying possible areas of preservable prairie in Iowa and Hayden became director of the \\"Prairie Project\\". She systematically developed a database of information relevant for decisions about land acquisition, working with the State Conservation Commission (SCC) to purchase areas of relict prairie. She was an active member of the Ecological Society of America for many years. Ada Hayden died of cancer in 1950, at age 65.She was succeeded as herbarium curator by Richard Walter Pohl.

The character made his first screen appearance on 28 August 2013. Hara relocated to Sydney to take on the role. Kyle Pryor who plays fellow character Nate Cooper originally auditioned for the role. Andy and his half-brother Josh (Jackson Gallagher) were introduced to viewers through a series of online webisodes titled Home and Away Extras, prior to appearing in the main series. Andy is characterised as a troubled man because of his upbringing and disappearance of his father. Hara has described his character as \\"extremely unpredictable\\" and very protective of his brother. Andy has spent time in prison and causes trouble from his first episode. Andy's initial storyline was a feud with the Braxton family which had been ongoing before he was born. Through this story, writers involved Andy in crimes ranging from fights and car chases to explosions and shootings. Hara announced he would be departing from the show on 22 February 2016, after over three years in the role and Andy made his final appearance on 5 July 2016. Producers created a romantic partnership between Andy and Hannah Wilson (Cassie Howarth). Their on/off relationship has been focused on heavily during his tenure. Andy is also involved in drug dealing which saw him temporarily separated from Hannah. His involvement leads to the death of Casey Braxton (Lincoln Younes), which prompts Andy to want to change his life. He sets on course to become a gym instructor, become literate and maintain a relationship with Hannah. The latter rarely goes well as they face problems such as Hannah's paralysis, her infidelity and Andy's temper. The character became popular with viewers as the Barrett brothers gained a fan-base. A reporter from The Daily Examiner said that Andy continually causes friction on the show. A writer from TV Soap noted that trouble follows Andy everywhere. They concluded that writers transformed the character from \\"rough customer\\" to \\"respectable citizen\\". Casting The character and Hara's casting was reported by Debbie Schipp from The Daily Telegraph on 3 August 2013. Hara relocated from Gold Coast to Sydney to take on the role. Of being cast in Home and Away, Hara commented \\"I thought how lucky I was. It's just a real privilege to be on a show that is so loved.\\" Andy was introduced to the show along with his brother Josh (Jackson Gallagher). The characters first appeared in online webisodes, which explored their backgrounds. The Barretts were initially rivals of the Braxton brothers and Hara said \\"There is a lot of history behind both the families. I carry the secrets of what our whole relationship is with them.\\" Andy's debut on the main show was broadcast on 28 August 2013. British actor Kyle Pryor also auditioned for the role with an Australian accent. But producers thought he was better suited to the role of Nate Cooper. Development Characterisation Andy is characterised as an over-protective brother to Josh. He has an uncontrollable temper which leads gets him into trouble. His anger issues date back to the disappearance of his father which changed him and eventually led to him being reprimanded by the law. He is a \\"feisty\\" resident of the infamous Mangrove River who \\"thinks with his fists before thinking of consequences\\". He is a \\"loose cannon\\" and harbours a \\"volatile mood\\" which has gained him a significant criminal history. They added that his attitude would only carry on adding to his criminality. Hara told a Yahoo!7 reporter that \\"he's an extremely unpredictable and protective character and regardless of his circumstances, family always comes first.\\" Andy was forced to take care of Josh in the absence of their father. Hara added that \\"although sometimes he lacks morals and normal social behaviour, everything he does for his brother, despite how reckless, it comes from a place of love.\\" Home and Away Extras Andy and Josh were introduced to viewers in a series of four special online episodes titled Home and Away Extras, which were made available online from 7 August. The episodes gave fans a chance to see the characters prior to their on-screen arrival. They were written by Supervising Script Producer, Louise Bowes and directed by Danny Raco. A promotional article stated that the footage would reveal a shared history and angst with the established characters of Brax (Steve Peacocke), Heath (Dan Ewing) and Casey Braxton (Lincoln Younes). To coincide with the content the show produced a series of additional content such as spoilers and cast interviews as extra promotion. Series Producer Lucy Addario created the \\"webisodes\\" because she wanted alternative ways for viewers to interact with the Home and Away brand. She added \\"we're going to reveal dramatic details of the characters' back-stories before they are introduced as a major storyline.\\" Home and Away Extras completed its run on 26 August and Andy was introduced into the main show two days later. Feud with the Braxton family To introduce Andy and Josh into the main series Home and Away developed a feud storyline between the Barrett and the Braxton brothers. The established Braxton family were popular with viewers and garnered a large fan base. Hara was not worried about their popularity ruining the chances of his character being successful and believed the Barretts would gain their own fans. He warned that Andy does not get intimidated by anyone and would comfortably rival the Braxton brothers. Ewing told a TV Week reporter that the Braxtons would still be the \\"top dog\\" but the Barretts would give them \\"a run for their money\\". He believed his family had the advantage because they learned to carefully think about their actions whereas Andy is an \\"act first, think later\\" type of character. The storyline began when Josh meets Maddy Osborne (Kassandra Clementi) at a party and she refuses to leave. Her friend Casey does not approve of Maddy trying to lose her virginity and starts an argument with Josh. Younes explained that Andy gets involved and they fight, but he manages to defuse the trouble. He added \\"Casey has no idea who these guys are. He's never met them, but they say that they have.\\" When Casey and Maddy drive away Andy decides to start a car chase and runs Casey's car off the road causing an accident and explosion. He is left with life changing injuries. The crash and subsequent explosion were big stunt scenes for the show. The car chase scenes Andy featured in were filmed at night on location down a narrow road, the cast described the shoot as a \\"scary\\" scenario. When Casey's brother Brax learns that Andy and Josh caused the accident he attacks Josh. Bianca Scott (Lisa Gormley) intervenes but Brax hits Andy instead. Hara stated that \\"hot head\\" Andy is not afraid of a fight or Brax because of his upbringing. Andy and Brax have known each other for a long time and there was \\"bad blood\\" between them. He added that \\"revenge is something they've all grown up with. You strike someone and they strike back. I think Andy will be prepared whatever happens.\\" Gallagher added that there is a \\"lot of unspoken history\\" between Andy and Brax. The writers then decided to cause a divide between the Barrett brothers and added a new dynamic between Brax and Josh. Realising that Josh is homeless, Brax asks Josh to stay at his home. Gallagher explained that it was Andy's hatred that influenced Josh's feelings towards the Braxtons. His attitude does not change but he begins to see another side to Brax. The actor added, \\"deep down he doesn't hold the same anger and resentment Andy does.\\" But the effect the Barrett's arrival has on Brax becomes apparent and he visits Debbie Barrett (Olivia Pigeot) to confess that he killed Andy's step-father Johnny Barrett (Stephen Anderton). Andy attacks Brax in retaliation. When Brax appears in court Andy considers shooting Brax. But Debbie steals the gun and tries to shoot Brax, but Josh is hit by the bullet but survives. The cast were not allowed to reveal who fired the shot before the episode aired. After this Andy becomes jealous that Josh is spending all his time with Maddy and spikes her drink. A reporter from TV Week wrote that following Maddy behaving erratically Josh punches his brother for his crime. In a later development it is revealed that Johnny had slept with Cheryl Braxton (Suzi Dougherty) and had fathered Casey. Andy was angry with this and Hara told Shayn from The Edge that \\"he is never going to be considered a Barrett in Andy's eyes\\" and \\"Brax is not happy to learn his mother slept with their dad\\". He also explained that the Barrett and Braxton feud had been going on long before Andy was born. Drug dealing The show decided to begin Andy's journey through 2014 by exploring his \\"dark past\\". A guest character, Sean Green (Khan Chittenden) was introduced on-screen as Andy's old prison enemy. He targets Andy's livelihood by vandalising the gym he works at. Hara told Miller that it comes at a point in Andy's life when things were \\"looking up for him\\". It becomes apparent that Sean wants revenge because Andy made a deal to leave jail at Sean's expense by naming him for a crime. He threatens to hurt Josh and Maddy if he does not tell the truth. Hara added that \\"Andy feels responsible for putting them at risk, he doesn't want Josh involved in this.\\" Andy tries to reason with Sean but he gathers a gang to punish the character. The storyline marked a turning point of the Braxton/Barrett feud as Casey gathers his family to help Andy and Kyle Braxton (Nic Westaway) rescues him by attacking Sean. The show created a drug dealing storyline for Andy, which saw him trying to raise money to move out of the Summer Bay caravan park. He begins selling marijuana but his girlfriend Hannah Wilson (Cassie Howarth) destroys the drugs when she finds them in her home. This gets Andy into debt with the drug gang. In retaliation Josh is seriously assaulted by the gang. Hara told an Inside Soap reporter that Andy knows that the attack on Josh is a warning. He added that \\"he's incredibly protective of his little brother, so of course he feels responsible for what's happened.\\" Despite Josh becoming involved in his predicament he cannot afford to pay his debt. Hara explained that his character is \\"dead broke\\" and \\"in some deep debt\\". The storyline developed chaotically as Andy's debt continued to grow. He believes he can prolong paying his suppliers off by meeting up with them and pleading for more time. Hara said that it does not go according to plan and Andy is left with severe injuries following an assault and being thrown from a moving vehicle. The story sees Andy turning to Casey for help, Hara explained Andy's out-of-character actions were because the dealers are \\"unpredictable so everyone close to Andy is at risk.\\" The storyline made way for a different dynamic between Andy and \\"arch-nemesis\\" Brax as he is forced to accept money from him to clear his debts. But Hara warned that his character would become more erratic, adding \\"Andy's heading down a path of self-destruction - and someone will pay for his mistakes.\\" Brynmor Pattison from the Irish Mirror observed the storyline as a \\"dramatic development that pulls many other characters into a vortex of trouble.\\" While Hara explained that the drug dealing \\"will cause a domino effect that implicates numerous people and puts their lives at risk\\". Casey's death The main dealer is revealed to be Jake Pirovic (Fletcher Humphrys), unbeknownst to him the sworn enemy of the Braxton family. He uses Andy in his plan to enact revenge on Brax for killing his brother, Hammer (Benedict Samuel) . But when Andy tries to defy him, Josh is kidnapped and Andy if forced to beg Casey for help. Gallagher explained that Stephen Downie (TV Week) that Andy does not realise the severity of his involvement with Jake. He added that the storyline was \\"very heavy\\" viewing. Hara said that Andy no longer wants anything to do with Jake because \\"he's exploited and manipulated him into a situation that seems irreversible.\\" The interviewers questioned why Casey would want to help Andy after his constant trouble making. Younes explained that his character \\"sees the best in Andy\\" and wants him to change his life for the better. When Casey realises that Jake is involved he tries to keep Brax out of the situation. But he fails and Andy, Brax, Casey and Kyle end up in a fatal confrontation with Jake. Home and Away's producers put an embargo on which character would be killed off in the scenes. They kept viewers guessing by confirming one character at the scene would definitely die. Following a shooting, Casey dies in Brax's arms. Hara told Chantay Logan of the Gold Coast Bulletin that many fans were \\"devastated\\" following the death of Casey. But he noted that \\"a lot of them were sticking up for me too, there’s not that much hate there. It’ll be interesting to see if the audience goes along on the rest of Andy’s journey with him.\\" Susan Hill from the Daily Star reported that Andy and Brax would team up to avenge Casey's death. But a high speed car chase results in a crash. Hara stated that \\"Andy and Brax need to end this before more people get killed.\\" With Jake dead, Andy is left to face the wrath of other characters. But Brax is forgiving of his one-time-nemesis. Hara explained that \\"Brax doesn't blame Andy for what happened to Casey. He understands that Andy was manipulated by Jake.\\" Relationship with Hannah Wilson Cassie Howarth (pictured) plays Andy's love interest Hannah Wilson. The show decided to renew the partnership between Andy and Hannah. She asks Andy to meet with her, feeling confused Andy asks Denny Miller (Jessica Grace Smith) how Hannah feels. But Denny still blames Andy for Casey's death and lies to him. Andy sleeps with Neive Devlin (Jolene Anderson) in retaliation. Hannah is involved in a bus crash and is told she may never walk again. One aspect of the storyline showed Andy afraid to have sex with Hannah in case he hurt her due to her disability. Howarth was unhappy when she received the scripts because she believed that there were other topics that their storyline could have explored. But writers told Howarth that it is a \\"very real situation\\" and one they felt Home and Away needed to portray. Hannah presumes that she has become a burden on Andy. She wants to have sex and Andy's reluctance leaves Hannah feeling dejected. Howarth told an Inside Soap writer that Andy \\"freaks out\\" when Hannah tries to be intimate. They do not have the same physical relationship they once shared so he finds it \\"strange\\". Nate Cooper (Kyle Pryor) advises Andy that there is no medical reason not resume sexual activity, but Hannah ends their relationship before he can apologise. Howarth added that \\"Andy has become more like a carer to Hannah than a boyfriend, and she doesn't want that for either of them. She wants Andy to have the opportunity to be happy with someone else. She wishes for him to enjoy a normal life.\\" Despite this their love for one another remains and the actress added that Andy chooses not to give up on their relationship. Andy knows that he still loves Hannah and tries to resume their relationship, asking Denny for help. Hara told Erin Miller (TV Week) that \\"Andy told Hannah he's not the same person he used to be. It's going to be a test for their relationship but he wants to prove that he loves her.\\" The pair get back together but Hannah soon becomes depressed because she cannot go outside. She decides to behave spontaneously and begs Andy to take her on a boat ride at sea. Howarth explains that being stuck at home has \\"taken its toll on her both physically and emotionally\\" and she is \\"desperate\\" to go outside. The writers throw the duo into yet another dangerous situation as their boat capsizes. With Hannah's paralysis she is unable to stay afloat and disappears beneath the water. Howarth added that it is dangerous because of her condition. Andy frantically searches for her to save her. Another problem the duo encounter is Andy's literacy problems when he needs help with revision for his personal trainer qualifications. He becomes angry and argumentative with Hannah despite her help. A TV Soap reporter stated that Andy \\"hated feeling like a five year old in front of her.\\" But when he admits the truth to Josh he decides to apologise to Hannah. Josh struggles to mentor him but carries on knowing that Andy is trying to make Hannah proud of him. Howarth told Kerry Harvey from TV Guide that Andy and Hannah \\"balance each other well\\", two opposites personality wise, but they get along so well. She concluded \\"I think with what's happened with the accident he's really risen to the occasion and he's been so good to her. I think at least for a while they'll be able to be happy.\\" Following Hannah's recovery and reuse of her legs, Andy becomes jealous of Hannah's new found freedom. When he witnesses Hannah dancing with another man he becomes violent and punches him. Hara said that the bad side of Andy had not surfaced for sometime and likened him to the Hulk. He defended his character's overreaction, \\"imagine walking into a bar and seeing the one you love dancing with someone else.\\" Hannah then meets her ex-boyfriend Sean Gleeson (Luke Pegler) and is unfaithful. Howarth said that her character \\"loves Andy and doesn't want to hurt him, but ultimately she's not happy.\\" Hannah remembers how exciting her life was with Sean and doesn't feel the same when she is with Andy. She sleeps with Sean and is nearly caught by Andy. Hannah struggles with the guilt of cheating, but still decides she wants Sean instead. But Hannah is shocked to learn that Sean is married. Hannah realises that she has made a mistake and wants to keep her infidelity a secret. But Sean's wife arrives and confronts Hannah. Howarth told a TV Week reporter that the whole situation \\"blows up in her face\\". Hannah tells Sean that she is going to be honest with Andy, unaware that Josh has recorded her and Andy learns the truth. Departure On 22 February 2016, the Seven Network Twitter account announced Hara's departure from Home and Away. They implied that he was travelling overseas to Venice Beach. The actor stated, \\"My time on HAA has been a once in a lifetime experience that I'll never forget and I can't wait for what's to come!\\" Andy's exit storyline was not immediately revealed, but he is one of several suspects in the Charlotte King's (Erika Heynatz) murder. Reception An Inside Soap reporter included \\"local bad boy\\" Andy and Hannah's romance in their \\"best bits of August [2014]\\" feature. They added that \\"there was no denying the heat between these two.\\" They also included Andy's drug dealing as one of the best soap opera storylines airing in September 2014. A reporter from The Daily Examiner opined that Andy is a \\"bad boy\\" who causes much friction on the show. A writer from TV Soap opined that \\"trouble seems to have followed Josh and Andy wherever they've gone since arriving in town, with the two brothers quickly developing a reputation as rough customers.\\" They added that despite their bad impression created on their arrival, there has been much work to transform the characters into \\"respectable citizens\\". A writer from the Sunday Mail opined \\"Andy is the sort of bloke who couldn't learn a lesson if you drilled it into his head. Having caused no end of hassle to an astoundingly large circle of people, what does he do? Take on another illegal job, that's what.\\" References External links * Andy Barrett at the official AU Home and Away website Category:Home and Away characters Category:Television characters introduced in 2013 Category:Fictional personal trainers Category:Fictional drug dealers Category:Fictional murderers Category:Fictional mechanics Category:Male villains Category:Fictional criminals on soap operas Category:Male characters in television ","title":"Andy Barrett"},{"id":"46244236","text":"Janine L.

The first three segments of the abdomen are reddish-orange and the remaining segments are brown, each with a pale basal portion and blackish apical section. The female is drab and much less noticeable, being pale tan, with black markings on the head and thorax, and dark rings on the abdomen. Distribution and habitat Neoneura amelia is native to Central America and the southern tip of the United States. Its range includes southern Texas, ten states in Mexico, Belize, Costa Rica, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua and Panama. Its typical habitat includes the backwaters of large rivers and streams, and the edges of large ponds, including muddy locations. It is present in both wet tropical and subtropical forests and dry forests, as well as grasslands. Behavior In Texas, this damselfly is on the wing between April and December. Males are often to be seen hovering over the surface of the water well away from the shore, but they sometimes perch in shrubby vegetation, concealed by overhanging foliage. The females are seldom seen except in the company of males. Eggs are laid while the pair are in tandem on floating wood debris or on the stems of submerged plants, and there are often other threadtails and dancer damselflies seeking to lay in the same locations. Egg-laying is at its peak in the middle of the day and then diminishes. Status Neoneura amelia has a wide range and is a common species. The population seems stable and no particular threats have been identified, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being of \\"least concern\\".

He was the second governor of the Territorio Nacional de Santa Cruz, precursor of Santa Cruz Province, Argentina. He was in part responsible for the Selknam Genocide in Tierra del Fuego. Later he identified with the indigenous people of Patagonia, and went to live with them until he was recalled to Buenos Aires. Lista wrote a number of books on the people and places he had found. Early years Ramón Lista was born on 13 September 1856 in Buenos Aires. His grandfather, also called Ramón Lista, was a Colonel of Infantry. Ramón Lista studied at the Colegio Nacional in Buenos Aires. When only 15 years old he taught history and geography at the Colegio del Salvador. He traveled in France and Germany in 1875–77. He was interested in natural sciences, met the main scientific figures and was taught by the great scientist Hermann Burmeister (1807–92). On his return from Europe at the age of 21 he was appointed a civilian explorer for the navy, with the rank of \\"superior officer\\". Explorer Patagonia 1877–84 The Scientific Society sponsored an expedition to Patagonia to explore the region between Punta Arenas and Santa Cruz. In March 1878 Lista landed at Punta Arenas in the Strait of Magellan, where he made a careful examination of the mines. In mid- August he set off for the north, passed the Santa Cruz valley and explored the Chico River, the main object of the expedition. He traveled up the river to the foot of the Cordillera of the Andes, and claimed the land for Argentina. Returning east, on 6 November 1878 he met an encampment of friendly Tehuelche people in the Shehueu valley. He found that they were tall, as had been reported earlier, indolent and addicted to gambling, but kind and hospitable. They lived by hunting. Lista made a collection of words in their language. Lista became a friend of Papón, a Tehuelche leader, and the friendship survived until Lista's death in 1897. At one time they traveled to Buenos Aires together, where the only thing in which Papón showed interest were two elephants in the zoo. Lista took this apparent lack of curiosity in modern things as evidence of the inability of the \\"savage Tehualche\\" to change. In 1879 Lista married Agustina Pastora Andrade (1858–91), a poet and the daughter of his friend the famous writer and poet Olegario Víctor Andrade (1839–1882). That year he surveyed the coast between Carmen de Patagones and San Antonio. A few years later he explored the area of Patagonia from Valcheta to Choele Choel and the Deseado River. In 1884 he made a voyage on horseback that discovered the main rivers that flowed into the Atlantic Ocean. Tierra del Fuego 1886–87 Lista was the first native-born Argentinian to explore the island of Tierra del Fuego. In a report to President Miguel Juárez Celman in 1886 Lista expressed his disgust that the Onas (Selknam people) of Tierra del Fuego would not let him take \\"anthropometric measures\\" of their heads. In 1887 he explored the east coast of the island from Cape San Sebastián to Bahía Thetis accompanied by a chaplain and 25 soldiers. In the preface to his book Viaje al país de los Onas Lista takes responsibility for an encounter in which 26 Indians armed with bows and arrows were shot dead. Some of the survivors were taken prisoner, and he sent some of the women to Río Gallegos, Santa Cruz. He said of the island, \\"It is inhabited by cannibal tribes that are ethnographically placed as the lowest of human beings. Santa Cruz 1887–92 Lista succeeded Carlos María Moyano as governor of Santa Cruz from 1887 to 1892. In 1890 he navigated up the Santa Cruz River in a steam boat to Argentino Lake. At this time Ramón Lista's wife and two young daughters lived at his home in Temperley, Buenos Aires while Lista alternated between his governor's house in Río Gallegos and his Tehuelche common-law wife Koila in an encampment at Paso del Roble, forty leagues away. Koila gave him a daughter, Ramona Cecilia Lista. In 1890 his legal wife, Agustina Pastora Andrade, learned of her husband's parallel family in Patagonia. Heartbroken, she locked herself in the house for months on end, before leaving her two daughters in the care of her mother and committing suicide with a revolver on 10 February 1891. By late 1891 Ramón Lista had identified himself with the Indians, and was staying on the Indian side of the border. News of what was happening reached Buenos Aires and caused a minor scandal. President Carlos Pellegrini arranged for Juan Víctor Paris, an old friend of Lista from his 1887 expedition in Patagonia, to find Lista, who returned to the capital by steamer from Punta Arenas and resigned his post. It was all handled very discreetly. Later years 1892–97 After returning to Buenos Aires Lista founded the Argentine Geographical Society, which published a magazine on geography and other sciences. Lista continued exploration of Patagonia to the Strait of Magellan, the Gran Chaco and the mission territories in preparation for them to be incorporated in Argentina. He wrote on archaeology, anthropology, ethnography, botany and zoology, as well as writing popular accounts of his travels. Lista wrote a book about the Tehuelches, The Tehuelches, a disappearing race, published in 1894. He wrote that they seemed to be under a divine curse. They are the original owners of the land they inhabit, and now do not have even a plot of ground. They were born free and are now slaves. They die of tuberculosis, and face death as calmly as a Roman gladiator. Ramón Lista was killed on 23 November 1897 for an unknown reason at Miraflores, Orán, Salta during an exploration of the Pilcomayo River. His remains were taken back to Buenos Aires for burial in La Recoleta Cemetery in the Andrade family vault. Selected works Lista wrote 41 books and papers.

Collins compiled these extensive interviews that contained residents' stories, songs, and folklore into a compendium which he shared with Steinbeck, who used it and his own notes to write The Harvest Gypsies.Jackson J. Benson, \\"To Tom, Who Lived It: John Steinbeck and the Man from Weedpatch,\\" Journal of Modern Literature (April, 1976), 151-94. Influence on future literary works The Harvest Gypsies preceded several of Steinbeck's celebrated works with migrant workers at the center, among them Of Mice and Men (1937) and The Grapes of Wrath (1939).\\"John Steinbeck Biography: The California Novels\\" According to Steinbeck scholar Robert DeMott, The Harvest Gypsies provided Steinbeck a repository of precise information and folk values: \\"From countless hours of listening to migrant people, working beside them, listening to them and sharing their problems, Steinbeck drew all the correct details of human form, language, and landscape that ensure artistic verisimilitude, as well as the subtler nuances of dialect, idiosyncratic tics, habits, and gestures, which animate fictional characterization.\\"Robert DeMott, ed. Working Days: The Journals of the Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck (New York: The Viking Press, 1989), pp. xli-xlii). This rich information would figure in his later works, as Steinbeck used the experience to create not only the vibrant characters but also the vivid settings of migrant camps. A host of details first described in The Harvest Gypsies reappear in The Grapes of Wrath, among them Steinbeck's portrayals of the “dignity and decency” of government camps, the widespread hunger and suffering of children, and the injustice of the authorities operating within the camps.PBS, https://www.pbs.org/wnet/need-to- know/culture/steinbecks-the-harvest-gypsies/16473/ Even the famous conclusion of The Grapes of Wrath finds a basis within the account of a stillborn child in The Harvest Gypsies.Steinbeck, 11 Significance in John Steinbeck's career The impact of Steinbeck's investigative reporting for The Harvest Gypsies on his literary career cannot be underestimated, according to scholar William Howarth.William Howarth \\"The Mother of Literature: Journalism and The Grapes of Wrath\\" in New Essays on The Grapes of Wrath, David Wyatt, ed. (Cambridge University Press, 1990), pp.71-96. DeMott notes that The Harvest Gypsies \\"solidified [Steinbeck's] credibility--both in and out of migrant camps--as a serious commentator in a league with Dorothea Lange's husband, Paul Taylor, and Carey McWilliams, two other influential and respected investigators.\\" Robert DeMott, \\"Introduction\\" in The Grapes of Wrath, John Steinbeck (New York: Penguin Classics, 2006), xxix. Production of the pamphlet Helen Hosmer, a central figure in California labor circles, was responsible for the re-publication of the articles as Their Blood Is Strong. Steinbeck did not initiate the re-publishing of the series. By 1938, he had moved on to writing The Grapes of Wrath full-time and had to be persuaded by Hosmer to get involved in reissuing the series. Hosmer had worked as a researcher for the Farm Security Administration in the mid 1930s, where she met Dorothea Lange and economist Paul Taylor. She met Steinbeck in that period and supplied him with data files she had collected for the Farm Security Administration. After Hosmer left the FSA, she founded the Simon J. Lubin Society to advocate on behalf of workers.Helen Hosmer, Helen Hosmer: A Radical Critic of California Agribusiness in the 1930 (Santa Cruz: University of California, Santa Cruz, 1992), p57-8.Anne Loftis, Witnesses to the Struggle: Imaging the 1930s California Labor Movement (Reno: University of Nevada Press, 1998), p. 168. According to Hosmer, Steinbeck was reluctant to participate in the project. “He was scared to death of all these left-wingers swarming around,” she said in an oral history interview in 1992.Hosmer, 58. Eventually, Steinbeck agreed to allow Hosmer to publish the series. She combined the articles with Dorothea Lange's photographs and gave the pamphlet its title Their Blood Is Strong. Hosmer printed a first order of 100 pamphlets and sold them for 25 cents, the proceeds of which went to the Simon J. Lubin Society. Steinbeck did not receive any money from the project. Demand quickly exceeded the first print run and the pamphlet became a valued commodity. Eastern publishing houses contacted Hosmer to try to purchase mint condition copies, offering as much as $100 per pamphlet.Hosmer, 57. Synopsis Article I Dated October 5, 1936, Article I serves as a general introduction to the Migrant Farm Worker, which Steinbeck describes as \\"that shifting group of nomadic, poverty-stricken harvesters driven by hunger and the threat of hunger from crop to crop, from harvest to harvest.\\" Although there are a few migrant workers in Oregon and even Washington, the vast majority came to California; Steinbeck estimates that there are \\"at least 150,000 homeless migrants wandering up and down the state.\\"Steinbeck 3 This concentration of migrant farmers in California is due to \\"the unique nature of California agriculture,\\" in which a crop that for most of the year requires only 20 laborers for maintenance will require 2,000 during harvest time. California requires a large influx of migrant workers during the harvest, which occurs at different times for different crops. Those who hire the migrants encourage their immigration so much that \\"twice as much labor as was necessary\\" was present, and wages were kept low.Steinbeck 7 Migrants are essential to the functioning of California's agricultural economy, but, at the same time, they are reviled for being \\"dirty\\" and a drain on government support systems - in other words, for being impoverished. \\"The migrants are needed,\\" Steinbeck states, \\"and they are hated.\\"Steinbeck 4 A small child living in the \\"squatter's camp\\" agrees: \\"When they need us they call us migrants, and when we've picked their crop, we're bums and we got to get out.\\"Steinbeck 6 The migrants, however, are desperate to get out of poverty. They want nothing more, Steinbeck asserts, than to become economically self-sufficient again: \\"as they move wearily from harvest to harvest, there is one urge and one overwhelming need, to acquire a little land again, and to settle on it and stop their wandering.\\" Steinbeck 5 They are wanderers not by choice, but because they have no other way to survive.Steinbeck 5 Steinbeck continuously emphasizes the virtues and inherent dignity of these farmers, which serves to make their current destitution all the worse. Photo by Dorothea Lange of a migrant family in Kern County. The \\"new migrant worker\\" Steinbeck discusses is that who comes with his family. 1936 The Great Depression sees a transformation in the ethnic make-up of the migrant farmer. In the past, migrant farmers were almost exclusively immigrants - first from China, then Japan, Mexico, and the Philippines (Steinbeck discusses the treatment of non-white/non-American workers more extensively in Article VI).Steinbeck 4Steinbeck, 28-32 But the combination of the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl introduced a new type of migrant worker: the white American family, women and children included. They came from \\"the agricultural populations of Oklahoma, Nebraska, and parts of Kansas and Texas\\" most affected by the Dust Bowl.Steinbeck 4 Steinbeck describes these families as once-prosperous - or at least once self-sustaining - farmers from the Midwest, \\"resourceful and intelligent Americans\\" and honest workers who experienced the \\"curious and terrible pain\\" of having everything they worked for taken away from them.Steinbeck 4 Throughout the article, Steinbeck cautions his reader that \\"the old methods of repression...are not going to work [because] these are American people.\\"Steinbeck 6 It is not that Steinbeck believes that non-white races deserve worse treatment than Americans; Article VII expresses Steinbeck's belief that American treatment of non-white migrant farmers has generally been \\"a disgraceful picture of greed and cruelty\\" by American farm owners.Steinbeck, 28 American migrants are different, Steinbeck believes, not because they necessarily deserve better treatment but because they will (in theory) refuse to tolerate the horrible conditions under which immigrant farmers labored. Thus, Steinbeck urges his readers to be prepared to \\"work out the problem to their benefit as well as ours.\\"Steinbeck 6 Article II Dated October 6, 1936, Article II explores the camps of squatters, focusing on three families.Steinbeck, 8 Steinbeck describes the materiality of these settlements, which were made up of pieces from \\"city dumps,\\" and were often constructed near bodies of water such as riverbanks and irrigation ditches. Fixated on the living conditions of the camps, Steinbeck ruminates on the dirt that pervaded them, the sanitary conditions of those who lived in them, and the precariousness of their long-term futures. Steinbeck pays great attention to highlight how the Depression has impacted the families in the squatter camps by tracing their economic degeneration, and the intense precision and consistency that their agricultural work demands.Steinbeck, 8-9 He mentions a family that had been very successful farmers,Steinbeck, 8 and another that had owned a grocery store.Steinbeck, 10 Additionally, he notes the tempered optimism that many new residents had, and works to humanize the squatters: their desire to educate their children, and the loss of loved ones that marks their lives evoke sympathy. With the \\"filth\\"Steinbeck, 9 and malnutrition of the camps, causes of death are clear to Steinbeck—and, he purports, to the squatters.Steinbeck, 10 The Great Depression did not do away with class differences, however, as different families were able to live in varying levels of sanitation and well-being. Steinbeck notes a family whose children refused to go to school, weary of the bullying that they would receive from \\"The better-dressed children.\\"Steinbeck, 10 Teachers had too much on their hands to deal with such behavior, and the parents of the better-off students did not want the diseases of households with poorer hygiene to enter schools. The Depression did reorient class structures, however. The middle class was poor,Steinbeck, 10 and the lower class was even poorer.Steinbeck, 11 And, there was a certain inevitability to the lower class' growth, according to Steinbeck; referencing a man in the lower class who had all but given up, he writes that \\"This is what the man in the tent will be in six months; what the man in the paper house with its peaked roof will be in a year, after his house has washed down and his children have sickened or died, after the loss of dignity and spirit have cut him down to a kind of sub-humanity.\\"Steinbeck, 11 Steinbeck extends the camp's economic hopelessness to a larger societal one. He mentions social workers and survey workers who took data from the settlements, only to file it away—even this was hopeless, as \\"It has been done so often so little has come of it.\\"Steinbeck, 12 Disease was another force that was a given, and epidemics could be treated by \\"country doctor[s]\\" in \\"the pest house.\\"Steinbeck, 12 However, Steinbeck writes that \\"The country hospital has no room for measles, mumps, [and] whooping cough,\\" which posed great dangers to children.Steinbeck, 12 Making things worse, the poor were often ignorant of how to utilize the free clinics that supposedly existed to serve them, and skeptical of the interaction with authorities that pursuing health services would entail.Steinbeck, 12 Ultimately, Steinbeck contextualizes the narrow scope of his observations within the larger scale of its existence. He states that \\"This is the squatters' camp. Some are a little better, some much worse,\\" pointing out that while he has described three families, \\"In some of the camps there are as many as three hundred families like these.\\"Steinbeck, 12 He closes Article II by making a plea for sympathy: if some of the squatters steal, or begin to express a distaste for the relatively affluent, \\"the reason is not to be sought in their origin nor in any tendency to weakness in their character.\\"Steinbeck, 12 Above all, the squatters, he emphasizes, are human beings that deserve human understanding. Article III Dated October 7, 1936 Steinbeck's third article explores the system of oppression that large farms have developed so as to maintain their complete control over the lives of migrant workers. Steinbeck first draws a juxtaposition between the large farms, responsible for the oppression, and the smaller farms that often treat the migrants more properly.Steinbeck, 13 The author points out that small farms are often forced to side with the larger farms on issues of labor because of the former's debt with the banks, which are controlled by the farm association. To ignore the demands of the large farms might cause farmers to have their smaller farms foreclosed upon. Steinbeck then expounds upon the Farmers Association's almost complete control over labor in California and the terrible financial conditions this control has engendered for migrant workers. Steinbeck points out that to work on large farms workers must agree to pay rent, losing some of their salary almost immediately.Steinbeck, 15 Furthermore, the housing consists of one-room shacks where a migrant worker must fit his entire family, with no rug, no bed, no running water, and no toilet. Instead, there is a septic tank usually somewhere down the street. Working conditions are particularly tiring. Workers work with a \\"pacer\\" who maintains the pace at which migrants should be harvesting crops. If a migrant worker falls behind, he is fired. Steinbeck also explains that the large farms provide no amenities for relaxation or entertainment. Steinbeck then goes on to describe the system of deputies that prevent the migrant workers from unionizing. Deputies are armed employees who keep the migrants in line. Steinbeck explains that \\"resisting an officer\\" often results in being shot. The deputies are trained to make workers feel \\"inferior and insecure.\\"Steinbeck, 16 The deputies also break up all gatherings so as to prevent possible unionization. This constant degradation at the hands of the deputies sometimes leads to revolts.Steinbeck, 17 Steinbeck ends the article by explaining that large farms want very little to change and that \\"trails are too expensive.\\" Article IV Dated October 8, 1936, this article concentrates on camps developed by the Resettlement Administration as hubs for refugees from the Dust Bowl. Steinbeck details the characteristics of two camps at Arvin (now called Weedpatch) and Marysville. Each camp comprised around 200 families.Steinbeck 21 To participate in life at these camps to pay their keep, farmers were responsible for helping clean the camp through two hours a week of chores. Steinbeck highly praises the innovation of these camps, writing \\"The result has been more than could be expected. From the first, the intent of the management has been to restore the dignity and decency that had been kicked out of the migrants by their intolerable mode of life.\\"Steinbeck 18 He also celebrated how the organization of these camps advanced American ideals, explaining that \\"people in the camps are encouraged to govern themselves, and they have responded with simple and workable democracy.\\"Steinbeck 19 Steinbeck also makes the case that with their dignity restored and their sense of \\"having something of their own, these men are better workers.\\"Steinbeck 20 Observing workers and their families living in these camps, Steinbeck reports that many individuals displayed \\"a steadiness of gaze and a self-confidence that can only come of restored dignity.\\" And he attributes this recuperation of basic dignity to \\"the new position of the migrant in the community.\\"Steinbeck 20 No longer an individual who is hated and vulnerable, those living in these camps were transformed into active members of communal living. Many women participated in an organization called The Good Neighbors, monitoring a nursery and carrying out sewing projects to produce clothing for camp members. Steinbeck describes how whenever a new family joins the camp, they are immediately welcomed by members of The Good Neighbors and instructed on the practices of the camp. Inhabitants of the camp come together to pool resources that the incoming family might be lacking, and any sick members of the family are also attended.Steinbeck 20-21 Another point Steinbeck makes in favor of these camps is the good behavior of camp members, emphasizing how in their first years of operation neither camp needed police.Steinbeck 22 Article V In Article V, dated October 9, 1936, Steinbeck illustrates the migrant family's struggles to obtain aid, and state of California's failure to help them do so. The migrant family is never fully employed, so they always need aid. Since they must travel for work seasonally, they never have permanent residence, and are always confronted with challenges when applying for aid.Steinbeck, 23 The need to travel continuously to find work presents the migrant family with additional problems related to accessibility. Benefits necessary to a family's survival are only obtainable with a permanent residence, but the migrant family cannot stop for long enough to establish one, less they starve. Most needed of these resources—yet most inaccessible—are hospitals. Steinbeck follows a former Oklahoma ranching family's medical struggles, illustrating the unavailability of medical care and other welfare services for migrant workers. The family consists of a fifty-year-old father, a forty-five-year-old mother, two sons, fifteen and twelve, and a six-year-old daughter traveling to California in their truck, starting off picking oranges. When their truck breaks down, fixing it consumes a third of their initial earnings. This leaves little money to pay for medical problems—the father's sprained ankle and the daughter's measles.Steinbeck, 24 With the father out of work, the boys become the primary earners. The twelve-year-old steals a brass gear to sell, and the father must walk to town to bail him out of jail. This worsens his ankle, delaying his return to work. Out of money, the family applies for relief. They are informed they are ineligible because they do not hold a permanent residence. The family's neighbors, not much better off, provide food when they can, but this only stretches so far. The family faces their greatest adversity when the fifteen-year-old boy, the family's primary earner, falls ill with appendicitis. The father, still lame, seeks aid at the hospital, but town residents occupy all of the beds. Steinbeck writes that the father's status as a migrant worker results in hospital officials failing to weigh the gravity of the situation. The son lapses into unconsciousness, and the family is unable to reach a doctor before he dies of a ruptured appendix. The family sells the truck, their means of traveling to work, in order to pay for the son's burial. The father returns to work with his bad ankle, paying neighbors for rides, but it soon gives out, limiting his earnings. The daughter, malnourished, falls ill again, and the father seeks out a private doctor. He must pay in advance, and after requesting two days pay from work, loses his job and falls into debt. Steinbeck uses the case of this family, because it is among thousands of its kind. He suggests that the family, like many others, could have received help, but had no resources to obtain it. Steinbeck develops three critiques of how California dealt with migrant workers. First, the state denied there were such problems, and secondly, when counties admitted to the existence of these problems, they denied responsibility because the workers were transient. Lastly, in what Steinbeck calls “a game of medicine ball,” counties continuously changed their borders, to displace migrant workers.Steinbeck, 25 The overarching problem, Steinbeck writes, was the singular focus on the immediate economy, and the inability to recognize the long term value of a strong labor force. He depicts the failure to link crop yield with the health of migrant workers by looking at the hookworm problem that spread across several counties. Ideas of isolating or treating victims were overlooked, and the infected were sent to other counties where they spread the parasites. Article VI Dated October 10, 1936, Article VI is Steinbeck's overview of the traditional treatment of non-white/non-American migrant farm workers, a situation that Steinbeck describes as being characterized by \\"terrorism, squalor, and starvation.\\"Steinbeck 32 Steinbeck's first sentence says it all: \\"The history of California's importation and treatment of foreign labor is a disgraceful picture of greed and cruelty.\\"Steinbeck 28 Immigrant labor was valued above white American labor for two reasons: immigrants accepted lesser pay and tolerated worse treatment. Throughout all seven articles, Steinbeck emphasizes that white Americans, bolstered by \\"pride and self-respect,\\" were unwilling to accept the low pay and horrible working conditions accepted by immigrant laborers.Steinbeck 32 Merely in financial terms, \\"the nature of California's agriculture made the owners of farm land cry for peon labor,\\" a situation that Steinbeck found despicable.Steinbeck 29 The sheer scope and conditions of California agriculture required cheap labor of a kind that white Americans felt was not worth of their dignity. Steinbeck writes that \\"with the depression, farm wages sank to such a low level in the southern part of the state that white labor could not exist on them.\\"Steinbeck 29 Farm owners simply made greater profits because immigrant laborers accepted lower wages; therefore, they were constantly seeking out foreign labor rather than trying to pay white Americans a fair wage. The desire for foreign labor, however, was motivated by more than monetary gain. Unlike white laborers, immigrants \\"could be treated as so much scrap when [they were] not needed\\" because the threat of deportation was always hanging over their heads.Steinbeck 29 \\"The old methods of intimidation and starvation perfected against the foreign peons\\" that Steinbeck describes, would never be tolerated by white workers.Steinbeck 31 Furthermore, since these laborers were not American citizens, they were not protected by American labor laws.Steinbeck 30 Thus the preference to employ immigrant laborers remained constant, creating a cycle of need for such laborers, immigration, racism, and expulsion that repeated over and over.Steinbeck 29 \\"The one crime that will not be permitted by the large growers,\\" therefore, is the act of labor organization.Steinbeck 30 \\"They [the workers] commit...the unforgivable,\\" Steinbeck writes, \\"in trying to organize for their own protection.\\"Steinbeck 31 Once workers have become fed up of being abused and begin to resist, then the great landowners have no more use for them, as they are no longer the \\"peon workers\\" that they were hired to be.Steinbeck 30 Steinbeck states that \\"the usual terrorism\\" enacted against immigrant laborers was due in large part to \\"their organization.\\"Steinbeck 31 The first major group of immigrant farmers were Chinese, originally \\"brought in as cheap labor to build the transcontinental railroads\\" before they then were forced to turn to farming.Steinbeck 28 They were immediately reviled by American workers because \\"the traditional standard of living of the Chinese was so low that white labor could not compete with it.\\"Steinbeck 28 A combination of top-down and bottom-up efforts - immigration laws closing the borders and riots against Chinese laborers - eventually \\"drove the Chinese from the fields\\" and left a void of cheap labor that needed to be filled.Steinbeck 28 The next group were the Japanese, and they suffered the same fate as the Chinese laborers before them. \\"A low standard of living...allowed them to accumulate property while at the same time they took the jobs of white labor.\\"Steinbeck 28 Again, they were chased from the fields and from the country as a whole. After the Japanese came the Mexicans, and again their acceptance of low wages threatened the livelihood of white workers. Besides the usual tactics of racially motivated attacks and changing immigration laws, the desire of Mexico to repatriate their departed citizens led many of the Mexican workers to leave California and return to their home country. The final group Steinbeck discusses are the Filipino, \\"predominantly young, male, and single,\\" which caused serious problems when they consorted with white women. Although inter-racial marriage was not allowed, extra- marital affairs occurred and contributed to \\"a reputation for immorality...[and] many race riots directed against them.\\"Steinbeck 31 Like in the case of the Mexican laborers, the Philippine Islands aided the United States in encouraging the return of their young men. While they still resided in California, they often lived in \\"families\\" of several young men who pooled their resources together and shared equipment and food.Steinbeck 30 By the time Steinbeck was writing, however, \\"the receding waves of foreign peon labor are leaving California agriculture to the mercies of our own people.\\"Steinbeck 31 \\"Foreign labor is on the wane in California,\\" Steinbeck writes, and the future farm workers are to be white and American.\\"Steinbeck 32 Although landowners and farm owners began to attempt to subjugate \\"the new white migrant workers\\" to the terrorism that they enacted upon foreign workers, Steinbeck predicts that \\"they will not be successful,\\" as white Americans \\"will insist on a standard of living much higher than that which was accorded the foreign \\"cheap labor.\\"\\"Steinbeck 31 Again, Steinbeck re-asserts his claim that white American laborers, possessing \\"pride and self-respect,\\" will simply not tolerate the low pay and horrible conditions that foreign laborers had no choice but to accept.Steinbeck 32 Thus Steinbeck sets the stage for his seventh and final article, a treatise on how conditions will need to change in response to the new migrants that California is dealing with. Article VII Article VII, dated October 12, 1936, addresses the problem of migrant farm workers. Steinbeck begins by saying that the “problem of the migrants” must be addressed, for the sake of the California agriculture which depended on them, and also for humanitarian reasons, given the inhumane living conditions of the migrant workers.Steinbeck 33. Since the migrants were displaced farmers, he argues that they should not be removed from farm work and suggests that the federal government set aside land to be rented or sold to these families. Subsistence farming would allow families to have enough food to survive in the off season--when migrant labor is not needed--and to have a more settled lifestyle, with children returning to school and communities developing among these resettled migrants.Steinbeck 33-34. In addition, these communities would have access to medical attention, shared farm equipment, self-government, and “trained agriculturist[s] to instruct the people in scientific farming.”Steinbeck 34. Steinbeck suggests that the federal government should cover the cost of such a project, pointing out that “The cost of such ventures would not be much greater than the amount which is now spent for tear gas, machine guns and ammunition, and deputy sheriffs,” referencing contemporary labor conflict between farm owners and migrant workers.Steinbeck 34. In addition, he argues that laborers and labor unions should be able to play a bigger role in wage determination and advertising for laborers to prevent the “great disorganized gold rush” that comes from too many laborers vying for too few jobs and the low wages that result from such an excess of labor.Steinbeck 34-35. To critics claiming that organized agricultural labor would destroy the agricultural industry, Steinbeck points out that the same argument was used against industrial labor organization, yet industry survived.Steinbeck 35. However, he does not condone “vigilante terrorism” and encourages the federal government to pursue and prosecute vigilantes.Steinbeck 35. He reviews the grievances of the migrants, ending with the statement, “They can be citizens of the highest type, or they can be an army driven by suffering and hatred to take what they need. On their future treatment will depend which course they will be forced to take.” Steinbeck 36. Major Themes Labor and resistance In addressing the labor market in California in the 1930s, Steinbeck describes a conflict between migrant laborers and commercial agriculture. He argues that California's agricultural sector is distinct from that of the Midwest because of its high level of commercialization and centralization.Steinbeck 14. California's large farms are highly organized and controlled by banks, businessmen and wealthy politicians.Steinbeck 14. Workers typically pay high rent to live in small, poorly maintained shacks on these farms. The managers of these ranches exercise a sort of extrajudicial power over their workers; deputized agents of the ranch enforce law on the property, sometimes shooting those workers found to be “resisting an officer.”Steinbeck 15. Steinbeck suggests that the sheer numbers of migrants killed indicates the casualness with which these deputies operated.Steinbeck 15. Steinbeck notes that the harsh discipline on these large farms is intended to prevent any organization of labor, which the managers of the ranch fear. He observes that the “attitude of the employer on the ranch is one of hatred and suspicion, his method is the threat of his deputies' guns.”Steinbeck 16. Any successful organization of labor would force the owners of large farms to provide better living and working conditions, which in turn would cut into profit margins. Throughout his articles, Steinbeck takes a rather sympathetic position on the migrant laborers’ condition. His opinion is clearly informed by the squalor and poverty that characterizes the lives of many migrant workers. However, his views also seem to be guided by the central assumption that the shift in labor in the American West in the 1930s is not a temporary aberration but rather an irreversible paradigm shift.Steinbeck 36. As a result, Steinbeck argues for their incorporation into the state of California. Their acceptance by the state and its existing inhabitants will benefit all parties. In conclusion, Steinbeck notes that the poor workers can be “citizens of the highest type, or they can be an army driven by suffering and hatred to take what they need.”Steinbeck 36. In Steinbeck's opinion, a peaceful, constructive resolution to the conflict between laborer and employer is needed to forestall a more destructive resolution wrought by the laborers alone. Health Article II, in particular, details the dire consequences of poor sanitation of Hoovervilles, or \\"squatter camps\\" as Steinbeck refers to the shantytowns in the California valley. One of the three families he writes about had recently suffered the loss of one child; a four-year-old boy had been sick, poorly nourished and appeared feverish, then, \\"one night he went into convulsions and died.\\" Steinbeck also attacks the lack of basic preventative care among those in the \\"squatter camp\\" shantytowns. Part and parcel of his argument about the dignity of the laborers—and the way it is disregarded by local and national authorities—is his observation that, while \\"an epidemic\\" is a way of \\"getting [the attention]\\" of medical authorities, local doctors care little for malnutrition or dysentery.Steinbeck, 38 There is care for these easily treatable conditions, Steinbeck argues, but \\"these people do not know how to get the aid and they do not get it.\\" What efforts there are to improve the lot of the workers are half-hearted, and there is no effort exhausted on outreach or civil society measures. Describing another family, Steinbeck highlighted a three-year-old who had \\"a gunny sack tied about his middle for clothing. He has the swollen belly caused by malnutrition. [Fruit flies] try to get at the mucous in the eye-corners. This child seems to have the reactions of a baby much younger. The first year he had a little milk, but he has had none since. He will die in a very short time.\\" This account of the child is grim but realistically so given the circumstances of living in Hoovervilles, suffering from poor hygiene and lack of food. Pregnant migrant woman living in a squatter camp in Kern County, CA. \\\\- Dorothea Lange 1936 Pregnancy was extremely difficult as most mothers were malnourished. Steinbeck straightforwardly writes, \\"The problem of childbirth among the migrants is among the most terrible.\\" Steinbeck 27 While some women were able to conceive, most could not produce breastmilk, and as they continued to labor late in the pregnancy, miscarriages were increasingly common. In his discussion of challenges to normal pregnancy in Article V, he tells the poignant story of a woman who had multiple miscarriages, due to work accidents, sickness, and malnutrition. Steinbeck reports that she felt ashamed of not being able to conceive and bring healthy babies into the world, suggesting a way in which the Great Depression challenged femininity by compromising a female's ability to raise a healthy family. Dignity In detailing several of the narratives of migrant workers and their families, Steinbeck raises the concept of dignity, or pride, and how it wavered and diminished depending on what hardships were suffered and what level of poverty was reached. Article II showcases the stories of several families, and the mention of dignity and even spirit is present with every one. The first family is said to have put the children in school at every stop they made, even if for just a month at time, something that spoke to their pride. The father's attempt to craft a decent toilet by “digging a hole in the ground near his paper house and surrounding it with an old piece of burlap”Steinbeck, 27 is regarded by Steinbeck as a sign that “his spirit and decency and his sense of his own dignity have not been quite wiped out.”Steinbeck, 27 As Steinbeck progresses down the classes of laborers and the state of their families, the dignity wanes as well. This is reflected in the unwillingness of the children to show their faces at school where they are ridiculed for their ragged clothing. It is also shown in the dullness that Steinbeck describes has settled over families who have lost young ones to malnutrition or other such diseases. Steinbeck describes this family to be in the middle class of the squatters’ camp. At the lower classes, Steinbeck declares, “Dignity is all gone, and spirit has turned to sullen anger before it dies.”Steinbeck, 29 In Article IV, the surfacing of camps developed by the Resettlement Administration act not only as a provider of basic goods and living standards for the migrant workers and families, but also as a place for the migrants to regain their dignity as members of a functioning society. Because one of the three conditions of staying in the camp was to help to maintain the cleanliness of the camp,Steinbeck, 39 the migrant workers were given a responsibility that allowed them to contribute as members of a functioning community. Furthermore, the camp afforded them civilized amenities such as “water, toilet paper, and medical supplies,”Steinbeck, 38 which allowed for bathing and cleanliness of dress. Steinbeck states, “From the first, it was the intent of the management to restore the dignity and decency that had been kicked out of the migrants by their intolerant mode of life.”Steinbeck, 39 The Harvest Furthermore, within the camps many of the families took to growing their own vegetables, which Steinbeck saw as an uplifting sense of ownership to “have something of his own growing.”Steinbeck, 42 Race among migrant laborers Steinbeck's series of articles focuses primarily on American migrant laborers with Western and Northern European heritageSteinbeck, 5 who he describes as \\"resourceful and intelligent Americans...gypsies by force of circumstances.\\" These are men and women, as he describes them, used to democracy, self-government, and self-reliance. He argues that their fate is a distinct misfortune, and the social abuse they suffer as migrant workers does not befit their history. While the focus is on those white American migrants, Steinbeck also describes the lot of foreign migrants and notes how they are \\"ostracized and segregated and herded about.\\"Steinbeck, 5. Article VI describes in the most detail their lives. The Chinese immigrants are notable for their low standard of living, and how their ability to live on very little led to their being driven from the fields by white laborers dissatisfied with the competition they created.Steinbeck, 28. He remarks upon their ability to accumulate property as notable given its contrast to the property-less white migrant. Steinbeck also mentions the presence of anti-Chinese immigration policy and its effect on keeping the numbers of Chinese working in the fields low. He then moves to a discussion of Japanese workers and the discrimination they faced with the rise of \\"yellow peril\\" literature. Also perceived as a threat to white labor, they too were eventually forced from the fields.Steinbeck, 29 thumbMexicans bound for the Imperial Valley to harvest peas near Bakersfield, California \\\\- Dorothea Lange 1936 The non-American group that occupies the bulk of Steinbeck's section on foreign labor is the Mexicans. Steinbeck attributes their presence in California's fields to the \\"cry for peon labor\\" issued by farm owners seeking to maximize profits and minimize costs.Steinbeck, 29 Again, like with the Chinese, Steinbeck points out their standard of living and ability to subsist on depressed wages that made them preferable to white labor, particularly with the rise of intensive farming practices. Steinbeck comments on the treatment of the Mexican workers \\"as scrap,\\" and the widespread abuses they suffered due to the impunity provided by Government's program to deport dissenting Mexicans. He also notes how Mexican workers, inspired by the example of workers in Mexico itself, began to organize themselves effectively, an impulse described as their \\"natural desire to organize\\" though their efforts were met with significant violence and lawlessness on both the citizens, growers, and officials of the Imperial Valley.Steinbeck, 29-30 The final group Steinbeck describes are Filipino men, who he refers to as \\"little brown men.\\"Steinbeck, 30 That they came without families made them attractive as a workforce, and they instead created male domestic units. Again, Steinbeck remarks on their ability to live on very little food and with few material goods. Racism against Filipino men arose less because of their role as a threat to white labor, but rather because of their extra-legal relations (caused by laws against inter-racial liaisons and marriages) with white women and the threat it posed to white masculinity. With the independence of the Philippines, the vast majority of the Filipino workers were subject to repatriation. Steinbeck's discussion of the different racial groups involved in migrant agricultural labor spends most of its time noting the differences between the groups, though primarily concerns itself with distinguishing the foreigners from the white American farmers in terms of ability to subsist on poor wages and their ability to organize. He also consistently points out the violence levied at each foreign group, caused by the threat they posed to white labor and the system of industrial agriculture. Criticism and legacy On October 20, 1936, several days after the initial release of the letters, Steinbeck published a letter in the San Francisco News responding to criticism from migrant workers over being referred to as \\"gypsies.\\" \\"I have heard that a number of migrant workers have resented the title,\\" Steinbeck wrote. \\"Certainly I had no intention of insulting a people who are already insulted beyond endurance.\\"Rick Wartzman, \\"Obscene in the Extreme: The Burning and Banning of John Steinbeck's the Grapes of Wrath,\\" (New York: PublicAffairs, 2009), 89-90. Within days, however, migrants' Camp Central Committee responded reassuringly in the same publication: \\"We think you did a fine job for us and we thank you. this is a big battle which cannot be won by ourselves, we need friends like you.\\" Wartzman, 91 Steinbeck's series immediately became an important and influential work in the scholarly and popular investigation of California migrant labor. His articles built on and contributed to the works of economist Paul Taylor, photographer Dorothea Lange, and historian Carey McWilliams. McWilliams cited the series twice in the 1939 edition of his book Factories in the Field.Carey McWilliams, Factories in the Field (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1939), p. 273, 316. The pamphlet remained a valued item in publishing circles decades later. Helen Hosmer, the publisher, remembered seeing a copy sold in 1967 for $500.Hosmer, p. 57-8. Contemporary analysis of Steinbeck's text, while largely positive, has primarily criticized the articles' narrow scope and racist undertones. UC Berkeley History Professor James Gregory, in a mixed of a Heyday Books 1988 edition of the pamphlet, argues that Steinbeck's harsh treatment of agribusiness ignores the potential for exploitation in small family farms. He also argues that Steinbeck's choice to overlook the stories of more successful migrant workers created the potential for stereotyping.James N. Gregory, \\"The Harvest Gypsies: On the Road to the Grapes of Wrath.\\" In California History, Vol. 69, No. 1 (Spring, 1990), pp. 71-72. Despite his anguish over the incompleteness of Steinbeck's social history, Gregory goes on to call The Harvest Gypsies \\"a marvelous document of his time, important both to those interested in Steinbeck's personal development...and for anyone interested in the political passions surrounding Dust Bowl migration.\\"Gregory, 72 Historian Charles Wollenberg, in the introduction to the 1988 edition, attacks Steinbeck's assertion that unionization was inevitable because whites would \\"insist on a standard of living far higher than that which was accorded foreign 'cheap labor'\\" as ethnocentric and misguided.Charles Wollenberg, \\"Introduction,\\" in \\"The Harvest Gypsies: On the Road to The Grapes of Wrath,\\" (Berkeley: Heyday Books), 1988. JMU English Professor Mollie Godfrey, in her article \\"They Ain't Human: John Steinbeck, Proletarian Fiction, and the Racial Politics of 'The People',\\" takes a slightly less critical stance, citing Steinbeck's claim that \\"racial discrimination\\" was one of the wealthy farmers' primary methods of maintaining power and arguing that Steinbeck's touting of white labor was largely \\"tactical.\\"Molly Godfrey, \\"They Ain't Human: John Steinbeck, Proletarian Fiction, and the Racial Politics of 'The People,'\\" in Modern Fiction Studies, Vo.59, No.1 (Spring 2013), 107-134; 114. Godfrey acknowledges, however, that Steinbeck \\"attempts to combat economic exploitation of migrant workers by affirming their whiteness.\\"Godfrey, 115 In 1999, New York University Communications Professor Mitchell Stephens directed a project to the determine \\"The Top 100 Works of Journalism in the United States in the 20th Century.\\" Steinbeck's accounts of migrant labor placed 31st on Mitchell's list, which was compiled by intellectuals including Morley Safer, George Will, and Pete Hamill.

Prior to European settlement in the 16th century, there were indigenous people living in the area. Expansion of the settlement came when a railway through the area was completed in 1875. Since then, Recreo's progress has been interrupted at times by earthquakes and drought. In the 20th and 21st centuries, major infrastructure has been developed to meet the needs of Recreo's growing population. On 20 August 1995, Recreo was endowed with a municipal charter.  Indigenous peoples of the Recreo area (circa 16th century)  In pre-Hispanic times the area of Recreo was inhabited by the Iules and Diaguitas peoples. The indigenous people were called Suries by the Inca people. It was a Quechua word from \\"I suri\\" (ostrich feathers). By 1563, the area was controlled by the Governorate of Tucumán and the word, suries had changed to juries. The indigenous peoples of the Recreo area dug cavities known as \\"mortars\\" in the stone of the hills about their settlement. They may have been used to grind corn and other grains but more likely they were a tool for astronomical observations. When filled with water, each mortar would reflect a position of the stars.  Hispanic settlement  In 1782, the Recreo area became part of the region under the control of the Quartermaster of San Miguel de Tucuman. In 1783, the region became the Municipality of Salta del Tucumán under the governance of San Fernando del Valle de Catamarca. On August 25, 1821, the region became the Catamarca Province after receiving autonomy from Tucumán Province and Santiago del Estero Province. In the 1860s, Don Clemente Martinez took possession of some land in the province. The baptismal records of the Parish of San Roque indicate a fair population in the area by the mid 1860s. After the death of Martinez, his widow married the Provincial Deputy Governor, Pedro Cano. By 1874, the Cano family owned a cow, a mill and a chapel. The homestead became a rest point for travellers. It was a place for \\"recreation\\" and hence the place became known as \\"Recreo\\". On May 9, 1875 a section of the railway between Cordoba and Tucaman was opened. In 1892, Recreo was shaken by a 6.0 magnitude (very strong earthquake. Some lives were lost and there was severe damage to buildings. After the earthquake, a cemetery was developed. At the 1895 census, 624 people had settled in Recreo. Most of the immigrants were Spanish, Italian, French, Syrian-Lebanese, and German. Many were illiterate. With this background, Recreo does not have a founding father. Some settlers were evicted by land owners. Recreo was inaugurated and then divided into two \\"departments\\", Ancasti and La Paz.  Twentieth century  In 1910, at the centenary of the May Revolution, a new school was opened in Recreo. In prior years, education was given in private homes and much of the population was illiterate. In 1914, the Estanislao Severo Zeballos public library opened. In September 1958, by the passing of Law Number 1755, the Department of La Paz was renamed \\"Villa de San Antonio\\". Municipal entities such as a police force, civil registry, power plant and an hospital were founded. Travel by car and rail became more common. The railway was used to export minerals from mines in the hills around Recreo. In the mid 20th century, there was an economic decline in Recreo due to drought. In 1962, the Motegasta Dam was constructed. Drinking water was supplied via an aqueduct. Previously, groundwater had been used. Other infrastructure created around this time included a bus station, a sports complex and an air strip. In 1971, a secondary school was opened in Recreo by Irish Catholic priests. In 1975, a center for volunteer fire fighters was founded. In 1982, economic measures were taken such as providing ta incentives to local industries. In 1983, the regional Liborio Forte hospital opened. In 1986, developments included the opening of a tertiary education facility, a natural gas pipeline, and the construction of a large statue overlooking the town, the Cristo Redentor de Recreo (Christ the Redeemer of Recreo). Around this time, streets were covered with asphalt. On 19 December 1986, the Recreo coat of arms was ratified by John Paul II. The Recreo population again started to expand leading to electricity and water shortages. In 1991, a political and judicial crisis occurred in the Catamarca province when an 18-year-old student by the name of Maria Soledad Morales was raped and murdered near the city of Catamarca by the sons of some of the city's elite residents. The killers were convicted and imprisoned. This is marked as an important moment in the progress in Argentinian justice. On 20 August 1995, Recreo received its municipal charter, making it an autonomous town.  Twenty-first century  In 2004, Recreo suffered a magnitude 7.0 earthquake. In 2005, it was recognised that land for expansion in Recreo was becoming limited. On June 15, 2007, an official city flag was announced. It was coloured green for the mountains and pastures surrounding the city, created the flag of the city, its colors are green on the mountains of jarillas, quebrachos and pastures that surround the city, white salt of the Salinas Grandes and yellow for the sunshine. There was a shield positioned in the center of the flag. In the first years of the new century, Recreo experienced the common social problems such as drug use, alcohol misuse and crime. In 2014, community police were introduced to curb these problems. Infrastructure projects included the building of a bike path in 2003 and sewers in 2006; insertion of traffic lights in 2007; and the opening of a cultural center in 2011, a cinema and weather station in 2013 and a new bus station in 2015. Plazas and promenades were remodelled and boulevards, parks and shrines were improved. A municipal sports complex was renovated.

Description The border starts in the west at the tripoint with Israel, though the precise location of the tripoint is it at present unclear owing to the Israeli occupation of the Golan Heights, which are claimed by Syria. The de jure tripoint lies immediately east of the Israeli town of Sha'ar HaGolan, whereas the de facto tripoint lies at the border's junction with the United Nations UNDOF Zone south-east of Metzar. The Jordan-Golan Heights border runs along the Yarmouk River, and this river then continues as the western-most section of the Jordan–Syria border proper. The border leaves the river just east of Et Turra, and a series of irregular and short straight lines then proceeds to the south-east, passing between Ar Ramtha and Daraa across the Daraa Border Crossing and on to the Nasib Border Crossing on the Amman–Damascus road. At it turns north-east, running in a straight line across the Syrian Desert, terminating at the Iraqi tripoint at . History At the start of the 20th century the Ottoman Empire controlled what is now Jordan and Syria. During the First World War an Arab Revolt, supported by Britain, succeeded in removing the Ottomans from most of the Middle East. As a result of the secret 1916 Anglo-French Sykes-Picot Agreement the Ottoman Vilayet of Syria was split in two, with France gaining the north and Britain the south. France's section was then organised into the Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon. Britain's section (roughly, modern western Jordan) was contested between Britain, the newly-formed Arab Kingdom of Syria, Zionists in the new Mandate of Palestine, and further south Ibn Saud the of new kingdom of Saudi Arabia, resulting in a confused period in which the region was essentially an ungoverned space. Eventually in 1921 Britain declared a formal mandate over the region, creating the Emirate of Transjordan under the semi-autonomous rule of King Abdullah I.League of Nations Official Journal, Nov. 1922, pp. 1188–1189, 1390–1391. In the period 1920-23 France and Britain signed a series of agreements, collectively known as the Paulet–Newcombe Agreement, which created the modern Jordan-Syria and Iraq–Syria borders, as an amendment to what had been designated the A zone in the Sykes–Picot Agreement. A more detailed description of the Jordan–Syria border was agreed upon on 31 October 1931.

He was nicknamed El Cepa (the stump), apparently due to his low height and lack of intelligence. He worked at the farm of Francisco Antonio Ruiz, and was constantly mocked by the farm manager, León Sánchez, and also by the security guard Gregorio Valero. On August 20, 1910, Grimaldos sold a number of sheep belonging to him and after that he disappeared. Subsequently, it was found that he had gone to bathe at \\"La Celadilla\\", a shallow lagoon where bathers covered themselves in mud reputed to have curative properties. La Celadilla is located in the municipality of El Pedernoso about 4 km from the town. endorheic lake. After several weeks of Grimaldos' disappearance, rumours started to spread around the village about his possible murder with the assumption that he was murdered by someone who wanted to steal the money he had earned from the sheep sale. His family knew about the taunts that Grimaldos received —as he always talked about them at home— therefore they decided to file a complaint over the disappearance in the court of Belmonte, accusing Sánchez and Valero of being the suspected perpetrators of the alleged crime, so they were arrested to be presented in a trial. In September 1911 the case was dismissed. After the interrogation of the detainees, the summary of evidence was heard and the judge released the defendants due to the lack of evidence.  New prosecution and imprisonment  After a couple of years, in 1913, at the insistence of the Grimaldos' relatives, the case was reopened. With the arrival in town of a new judge, Emilio Isasa Echenique, Grimaldos' family reported the case again. Once again an arrest warrant was served on the same suspects thus beginning a long ordeal for them. The Civil Guard began torturing and mistreating the detainees to obtain confessions from the defendants and to discover what they had done with the missing corpse. And so it continued November 11, 1913 when following the judge of Belmonte's order, the judge of Osa de la Vega certified the death stating that José María Grimaldos López, native of Tresjuncos, died on August 21, 1910 between 8.30 pm and 9.00 pm as a result of having been murdered by Gregorio Valero and León Sánchez. The record reflects note in the margin: \\"The body could not be identified because it has not been found\\". In 1918 after being in prison for four and a half years, the trial began against the defendants with a summary riddled with contradictions and unclarified aspects. The trial ended with a sentence that condemned the defendants to 18 years of prison by order of the Provincial Court. The court who sentenced the defendants hardly deliberated for thirty minutes, and the twelve members composing the jury judged them responsible for the death of Grimaldos. The defendants managed to avoid death penalty, as the garrote was then still in use at the time. Valero served time in the prison of San Miguel de los Reyes in Valencia, whereas Sánchez served his sentence in the prison of Cartagena.  Reprieve  On July 4, 1925, they left jail after serving 12 years and two months of their sentence, as a consequence of two decrees of pardon.  The reappearance of José María Grimaldos  On February 8, 1926, the priest of Tresjuncos received a mail from the priest of the municipality of Mira, who requested the baptism certificate of José María Grimaldos in order to celebrate his marriage. The priest of Tresjuncos, astonished by the news, decided not to respond to the priest of Mira. Meanwhile, as time went by, José María Grimaldos became impatient with the delay to his marriage and set off for Tresjuncos. When he showed up in the village, the villagers could not believe what they saw. Then the judge of Belmonte interceded and ordered the arrest of the man. Within hours, the press got hold of the news and it had a huge impact on public opinion. After the indisputable identification of Grimaldos, the Minister of Grace and Justice ordered the retrial of the case and ordered the prosecutor of the Supreme Court to appeal for revision against the sentence of the hearing of Cuenca. On the aforementioned order it is noted that \\"there are reasonable grounds to believe that the confession of Valero and Sánchez, essential basis of their convictions, were extracted under exceptional continuous violence\\".  Aftermath  The Supreme Court declared the ruling issued in Cuenca in 1918 void. As well as establishing Sánchez and Valero's innocence, the supreme court established the nullity of José María Grimaldos' death certificate, and established the corresponding compensations that the State had to pay to the prisoners in such cases. A trial was held of those held responsible for the miscarriage of justice. Sánchez and Valero ended their days in Madrid, far away from their village and from the people who had condemned them; there, they were offered jobs as security guards in the city hall.  In literature and theater  The writer Alicio Garcitoral, Cuenca's Civil Governor at the time these true events occurred, wrote the social novel El Crimen de Cuenca (1932) reprinted with prologue and edition by José Esteban in 1981. Some time later, the well-known writer Ramón J. Sender wrote the novel El lugar de un hombre (1939). The writer Luis Esteso y López de Haro, native of San Clemente, Cuenca, wrote some four-lined stanzas with the name El Crimen de Cuenca, which were edited in one of his numerous collections (Madrid, G. Hernández and Galo Sáez, 1927). Pilar Miró, the producer, made a film in 1979 entitled The Crime of Cuenca; it was scripted by Lola Salvador Maldonado, who also narrates the facts in a book published with the same name by the editorial Argos Vergara. The film makes a strong plea against torture and it is perfectly understood that the crime the title refers to is the one committed by the Civil Guard when torturing the suspects. The mathematician Carlos Maza Gómez also studies the case in his book Crímenes in 1926.

He succeeded his father, Bahgulwet (aka Jean-Baptiste Neptune), who died in 1778, and was succeeded by his own son, John Francis Neptune, in 1824. The term \\"chief\\" later became the word for governor. Becoming chief is passed along through family lineage and requires acceptance from the Passamaquoddies, Penobscots and Maliseet tribes. These three tribes share similar chief induction ceremonies, conducted simultaneously with eyewitnesses from each tribe present. 1770s During the Revolution, the Passamaquoddies sided with the American colonists to fight against the British soldiers invading the eastern coast of Maine. On June 12, 1775 the tribe assisted the American military in a naval attack at Pleasant Point known as the \\"Battle of the Rim\\", or Battle of Machias in Machias, Maine. After gaining permission from the commanding officer, Chief Francis Neptune was the one who fired the first shot, with his flintlock rifle, at the Battle of the Rim. Roughly 200 Passamaquoddies were soldiers in the Revolutionary War serving under Chief Francis Neptune's orders. George Washington proclaimed a \\"pledge of friendship\\" after the success of the Passamaquoddy people's efforts in battle. On Christmas Eve of 1776 George Washington wrote to the tribe in hopes that they would come to the aid of the colonies by sending warriors and ensuring Passamaquoddy boundaries along the Canada and Maine border. a According to Colonel John Allan, the man whom the Passamaquoddies served under, noted in his journal that Chief Joseph Francis earned £4 for his participation in the Battle of Machias 1790s In the 1790s the Passamaquoddies were in land and rights disputes with the government. Chief Francis Neptune took responsibility and fought for his people. He did this by reminding the white government of the help that the Passamaquoddies contributed to the American Colonists winning the Revolutionary War. There is a statement from Colonel Allan saying that the Native Americans who served time for the United States military will be viewed as brothers, children, and under protection and care of the United States. Colonel Allan was also reported saying that their future children should enjoy all the rights and privileges that all Americans will receive. Chief Neptune was part of the negotiation with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to separate a piece of land from the state for the Passamaquoddies. In 1794 the Passamaquoddy reservation, Passamaquoddy Pleasant Point Reservation, was established by the state. The reservation was originally 23,000 acres with additional acreage at other points in Maine for hunting and fishing. He lived on the reservation with his wife, Sabattis Neptune, until he died in 1824. After the establishment of the reservation, Chief Neptune spoke in front of the Massachusetts government in Boston, Massachusetts saying that Passamaquoddies should be allowed to make decisions regarding their established land Also in 1796 Chief Francis Neptune served as a guide along the United States and Canada border. On that surveying trip he signed a land treaty to establish boundaries between the Passamaquoddy reservation, the United States, and Canada. To help draw land boundaries and features Chief Francis Neptune drew a map of the Cobscook River area on July 12, 1798. This map helped British Commissioner Thomas Barclay learn about the St. Croix River and land boundaries 1800s In 1829 Andrew Jackson met with Chief Neptune. The president enjoyed his meeting with the Passamaquoddy tribe and extended his gratitude in the same way that George Washington had done, the \\"chains of friendship\\" continued to be strong with the tribe In 1834 Chief Francis Joseph Neptune died on his Passamaquoddy Pleasant Point Reservation at the age of 99. In his honor a schooner was built for him at Huston's Shipyard. Many people spoke highly of him because they approved of the actions he did while he was chief.

The conversion mechanism is the space charge wave process whereby velocity modulation in an electron beam transforms to current or density modulation with distance. The tubes contain a single resonator. The complete cavity is a rectangular box containing a ladder-like structure through which the electron beam passes. Such a cavity has a large number of resonances but in the resonant mode used, large RF fields are developed in the gaps between the rungs. The phase advance from gap to gap is selected in such a way that an electron sees the same field at every gap, and it is described as being synchronous. In this context, the same field means a field of the same phase but not necessarily the same magnitude. An electron beam which enters an RF excited cavity with approximately synchronous velocity will receive cumulative velocity modulation at each gap. After some distance into the resonator, repeatedly accelerated electrons will be catching up with electrons repeatedly decelerated, and bunches will form. These bunches will have a velocity close to the beam velocity. If the electron velocity is somewhat greater than synchronous, the bunches will start to cross gaps when the field is retarding, rather than zero. When this happens, the electrons are slowed; their lost energy is gained by the cavity and sustained oscillations become possible. As the velocity of the beam entering the cavity is increased further, more energy is transferred to the cavity and the frequency of oscillation rises somewhat. Eventually, however, the bunches punch through the retarding fields and oscillations cease abruptly. Reducing the beam velocity (voltage) will cause the tube to resume oscillation. However, it is necessary to reduce the beam velocity below the value at which oscillations ceased before oscillation will start again. This phenomenon is known as hysteresis and is similar to that observed in many reflex klystrons. The frequency change which occurs as the beam voltage is raised is referred to as electronic tuning, and is typically 0.2% of the operating frequency measured from half power to cessation of oscillation. For larger frequency changes mechanical tuning is used which is obtained by moving one wall of the cavity. The moveable wall is, in fact, a piston which can be moved in a tunnel whose cross-section is that of the wall which it replaces. The range of mechanical tuning is usually limited by parasitic resonances which occur when the oscillating frequency and the frequency of one of the many other cavity resonances coincide. When this happens, serious loss is introduced, often sufficient enough to suppress oscillation completely. Typically, a mechanical tuning range of 4% can be obtainedRoitman et al, High Power CW 264 GHz tunable Extended Interaction Oscillator, 14th International Vacuum Electronics Conference (IVEC), Paris, France 2013 but greater ranges have been demonstrated. Apart from the resonant cavity, the Extended Interaction Oscillator is very similar to more conventional klystrons. An electron gun produces a narrow beam of electrons which is maintained at the required diameter by a magnetic field while it passes through the RF section. Thereafter, the beam enters a relatively field-free region where it spreads out and is collected by an appropriately cooled collector. Many of these oscillators have electrically isolated anodes and in these cases, the voltage between the cathode and anode determines the tube current which in turn determines the maximum power output.

Sullivan accidentally punched Donahue in the face and she countered with a full right to his jaw that dropped him unconscious to the floor for a full minute. The crowd loved it and the punch was kept as part of the act. Personal life Donahue was married and widowed four times. She died in 1961.

The bright, pure all-orange flowers distinguish it from the related black-eyed Susan vine (Thunbergia alata). Spencer Le Marchant Moore described the species in 1894, naming it after John Walter Gregory. Within the genus Thunbergia, it is most closely related to T. alata, the two being placed in the subgenus Parahexacentris. The common name of clockvine relates to the vine spiralling upwards in a clockwise direction. Thunbergia gregorii is an evergreen vine that grows to 8–10 ft. tall, or if left without support can become an extensive groundcover. It looks like the related black-eyed Susan vine (T. alata), but without the black eye. Thunbergia gregorii is native to east Africa, and is pollinated by bees. Hardy to -1 C, Thunbergia gregorii flowers more profusely and even year-round in warmer climates, while restricted to summer and autumn in cooler climates. Propagation is by cuttings taken in the summer.

Open Wound Open Wound uses photo animations to explore the turmoil of families impacted by the Partition of India in 1947. It has been 65 years since the Partition, where 12 million people were displaced within three months and over a million died. But unlike tragedies such as the Holocaust, there is no memorial about the Partition. There is little for the larger public to understand and commemorate those impacted by this tragedy. ReGeneration ReGeneration builds on the presumed veracity of photographs to spur a critical reflection on the power of photography and its effect on the perception of memory, family and the warping of cultures over time. The final ephemeral animation is built from archival images and recent photographs of three or more generations of women. The digital technology and animation makes it appear that the old and new images flow one into another. Memories of India Memories of India reflects Matthew's mixed background, as she was born in England, raised in India and now is living in America.The images are a time warp, revisiting the sights, sounds, and smells of her childhood impressions of her cultural homeland, India. The images are captured by the use of a simple plastic-lensed Holga camera, that makes images with a dreamy quality. Fabricated Memories Fabricated Memories uses digital technology and Polaroid film to reconstruct memories, combining recent images with childhood snapshots. The results are seemingly realistic images of events that never happened but reflect emotions from the artist's childhood. A small handmade accordion book presents the images as Polaroid emulsion transfers. Some pages also include text. To emphasize the fact that Matthew's father died due to smoking, the book is covered in paper made from tobacco leaves and is presented in a cigarette box. The paper has been stained with tobacco juice so that the viewer experiences the tobacco through sight, touch and smell. The pages of the book are made from a delicate handmade paper to suggest the images are very fragile. Bollywood Satirized Bollywood Satirized, a digital portfolio, is a critical commentary on the societal expectations for women growing up in India. The work uses movie posters which reflect the popular culture of Indian life. The visual and aural presence of cinema in India is the result of the largest commercial film industry in the world that produces over eight hundred movies a year and reaches approximately 3.5 billion people. Most of the 2 billion dollar industry is concentrated in Bombay, (now called Mumbai) which is also called “Bollywood”.Harrison, Helen A. \\"Art Reviews: Artist's Mondrian Imitations.\\" The New York Times 15 April 2001.

It stars Gary Carins and Brad Dourif as a patient who undergoes involuntary treatment to cure his alcoholism and the mad doctor who performs it, respectively.  Plot  After his wife dies, Allex becomes a self- destructive alcoholic. A mysterious doctor shows Alex the consequences of his actions, and the involuntary treatment leaves Allex with incisions. The doctor explains that whenever Allex drinks to excess, an implant will force him to violently murder people.  Cast  * Gary Cairns as Allex * Brad Dourif as The Man * Nick Nicotera as Chad * Sienna Farall as Emily * Steve Wastell as Charlie * Jennifer Blanc as Gail  Production  Dourif said that he was approached by the filmmakers and accepted the role because he found the character interesting. Dourif said that the character feigns sympathy, which makes him easier to portray as somewhat sympathetic.  Release  Malignant premiered at Shriekfest in Los Angeles on October 4, 2013. It was released to video on demand in May 2014. The DVD was released February 17, 2015.  Reception  Pat Torfe of Bloody Disgusting rated it 2.5/5 stars and wrote, \\"Diehard fans of Dourif may get some enjoyment out of seeing him strut his stuff, but it's ultimately not enough for this film to be entertaining.\\" Scott Hallam of Dread Central rated it 2.5/5 stars and wrote, \\"The casting of Brad Dourif as a maniacal scientist was a brilliant move that took a movie that might have been a throwaway and elevated it to at least a satisfactory level.\\" Ross Peterson of HorrorNews.Net wrote that Dourif's character is far more interesting and is not given enough screen time in comparison to the lead. Mark L. Miller of Ain't It Cool News wrote, \\"Brian Avenet-Bradley has constructed a solid thriller here with a strong mystery, characters you can't help but feel for, and a diabolical and bent villain in Dourif.\\"  References   External links  * * Category:2013 films Category:2013 horror films Category:American films Category:American horror thriller films Category:American independent films Category:English-language films Category:Films about alcoholism ","title":"Malignant (2013 film)"},{"id":"46244788","text":"Agriades pheretiades, the Tien Shan blue, is a Palearctic butterfly of the family Lycaenidae.\\"Agriades Hübner, [1819]\\" at Markku Savela's Lepidoptera and some other life forms Subspecies *A. p. pheretiades (Saur Mountains, Tarbagatai Mountains, Dzhungarsky Alatau) *A. p. andarabi (Forster, 1937) (western Pamirs) *A. p. danya Korb, 2013 (Uzbekistan) *A. p. lara Zhdanko & Churkin, 2001 (Kyrgyzstan) *A. p. micrus (Avinoff, 1910) (eastern Pamirs) *A. p. pheres (Staudinger, 1886) (Gissar Range, Darvaz, Alay Mountains, northern and western Tian Shan) *A. p. pheretulus (Staudinger, 1886) *A. p. pseudomicrus Tshikolovets, 1997 (northern Pamirs) *A. p. sveta Zhdanko & Churkin, 2001 (Kazakhstan) *A. p. tekessanus (Alphéraky, 1897) (inner Tian Shan) *A. p. walli (Evans, 1912) (Kashmir) References External links P Category:Butterflies of Asia Category:Insects of Central Asia Category:Tian Shan Category:Butterflies described in 1843 ","title":"Agriades pheretiades"},{"id":"46244796","text":"The Tom Smith House is a historic house on Arkansas Highway 74, east of Elkins, Arkansas in Washington County.

She is a scientist in the Department of Mineral Science at the National Museum of Natural History.  Education  Corrigan obtained a Bachelor of Science in 1995 and a Master of Science in 1998, both in Geology at Michigan State University. Her master's thesis was titled The Composition of Impact Breccias from the Chicxulub Impact Crater, Yucatan Peninsula, Yucatan, Mexico. She later earned a Ph.D in Planetary Science at Case Western Reserve University in 2004 studying carbonate minerals in Martian meteorite Allan Hills 84001 which suggest the sample came from a surface on Mars that underwent multiple distinct exposures to liquid water, rather than long term exposure in a body of water. Career  Field work  In 2001 and 2004, Corrigan travelled to Antarctica as a member of ANSMET (Antarctic Search for Meteorites) teams. She is a co-author of 35 seasons of U.S. Antarctic meteorites (1976-2010): a pictorial guide to the collection (2014) (OCLC Number: 879851951).

In 2004, Corrigan was instrumental in the initial examination and classification of newly discovered Martian meteorite MIL03346, only the seventh known Nakhlite. In early 2008, Corrigan was hired to classify meteorites and curate the meteorite collection for the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History. As a curator, she is responsible for classifying meteorite samples collected in Antarctica for the Antarctic Meteorite Newsletter.  Other professional work  Corrigan helps process and analyze images from the Mars Exploration Rover project's Opportunity rover. Corrigan is a member of the science team working with Moon Zoo, a Zooniverse citizen science project. She is interested in linking lunar meteorites to impact craters on the lunar surface.

Life and career  Born in Cosenza in 1974, Maria Perrotta made her debut with a symphony orchestra at the age of 11, performing Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 1, but she came to the limelight in 2012, after performing J.S. Bach's Goldberg Variations during her ninth month of pregnancy. An ambulance was stationed outside the theatre in case the artist went into labour during the recital. Very few women in history had given a concert this far into their pregnancy; one of them being Clara Schumann. The live performance, published on CD by Decca, received rave reviews: \\"A perfect blend of the lush pianism of Alexis Weissenberg and the laser-like focus of Glenn Gould\\". In 2013 Decca released a CD of Beethoven's Piano Sonatas Opp. 109, 110 and 111 played live by Maria Perrotta. The recording was acclaimed in leading musical magazines, including Gramophone, and in major newspapers: \\"Where Pollini is fast and formalistic, Perrotta is analytical and expressive, but, like Pollini, always maintains a sense of formal unity.\\". A graduate of the Milan Conservatoire, the École Normale de Musique in Paris and the National Academy of St Cecilia in Rome, she has won top prizes in several international competitions, including the Shura Cherkassky International Piano Competition in Milan and the triennial International J.S.

Banks was the second son of Robert Banks of Beck Hall, Giggleswick, Yorkshire and his wife Margaret Frankland, daughter of John Frankland of Rathmell, Yorkshire. He was articled to a solicitor. He married, Mary Hancock, the daughter of Rev. Rowland Hancock, a dissenting minister of Shircliffe Hall, near Sheffield, in 1689. At some time, he moved to live as a country attorney at Scofton, Nottinghamshire, where he was steward of the manors for Lady Mary Howard of Worksop. He was also agent for the Dukes of Leeds, Norfolk and Newcastle. He made a fortune and bought up estates in Nottinghamshire, and Lincolnshire where in 1711 he bought Revesby Abbey from Henry Howard, 11th Earl of Suffolk. At the 1715 general election Banks stood for Parliament at Great Grimsby where his opponent, being in debt, had promised to repay his creditors after he won. Banks pointed out that if his opponent won, he could claim privilege and default, and so offered to pay the notes of credit himself. He was elected Whig Member of Parliament for Great Grimsby. He voted consistently with the government and his only speech was to oppose a scheme to improve navigation facilities at the rival port of Sunderland. In 1719, he bought some estates which were forfeited after the Jacobite rebellion (and which he sold back to the family later a profit), and in 1720 made a profit from South Sea Company stock before the bubble burst but avoided a penalty because, unlike his fellow MP Robert Chaplin, he had paid for them himself. At the 1722 general election he was defeated heavily at Grimsby but was returned on the Treasury interest as MP for Totnes. He did not stand at the 1727 general election. In his later days took an interest in reclamation operations at Deeping Fen in Lincolnshire. Banks died shortly after leaving parliament on 27 September 1727. He had two children. His son Joseph Banks inherited his profitable estates and became an MP. His daughter married Sir Francis Whichcote, 3rd Baronet.

It is a single-story rustic fieldstone structure, with front-gable roof and a squat square tower set off to one side. Built between 1933 and 1937, the building is an interesting and unusual mix of Gothic and Romanesque styles, with windows set under Romanesque arches, and the tower with a crenellated parapet. The church is the second for the congregation, which was established c. 1848 on land donated by Michael Son. The known history of this area starts in approximately 1842. By the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek, this land of 160 acres was in a tract issued to a Choctaw man, Ah-To-Chubee. After his death, the land was deposited in the general land office in Fayetteville. Michael Son was born in Virginia and his wife Nancy (born in South Carolina) in the late 1770s. They, and other Son family members migrated to NW Arkansas via Kentucky and Missouri, and were issued a patent to 40 acres of the land in 1848. This community is called \\"Son's Chapel\\" after the two brothers: Michael & Abram Son, who settled here, in what was wooded farmland. The Son's built a home and in 1852, being good community citizens, conveyed about 2 acres of land, for $2, to the Methodist Protestant Church, for a cemetery and church yard. A log chapel, called \\"Son's Chapel\\", was built on the north end of the cemetery and was used for both church activities and a community school. Three different denominations held services there in the early days as well as various community groups who also used the building. When the small log building could no longer serve the needs of a growing farm community, a frame school house was built across the road (behind the current chapel) and discussion started about how a community center could be built. The Rural Builders Association, formed in 1922, still supports the care and maintenance of the building through fund raising efforts. Son's Chapel was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as of 2006. The bronze plaque is mounted outside the front door. The Son's Chapel Cemetery across the street has acquired several more tracts of land to attain its present size and is one of the oldest cemeteries in the county. While no \\"famous\\" people are buried there, there are many old pioneer graves, and some unmarked graves, whether pauper, slave or Indian. It is still an active cemetery with its own Board of Trustees, who holds an annual workday and Memorial Service on Memorial Day week-end. Nancy Son, wife of Michael Son is the only Son buried there. Michael Son is buried with his brother in Missouri. In the mid 19th Century, the City of Fayetteville built the County Poor Farm adjacent to the Cemetery and most probably buried some indigents in unmarked graves.

The episode was written by series creators David Benioff and D. B. Weiss, and directed by Jeremy Podeswa. The lifeless body of Jon Snow is discovered by Ser Davos Seaworth and loyal members of the Night's Watch protect it; Melisandre has begun to lose her faith in the Lord of Light; Sansa Stark and Theon Greyjoy flee Winterfell, Ellaria Sand and the Sand Snakes seize control of Dorne; Jaime Lannister returns to King's Landing with the body of his dead daughter; and Daenerys Targaryen is taken prisoner by the khalasar of Khal Moro. \\"The Red Woman\\" was positively received by critics who found the episode to be a satisfactory launching point for the season, and praising the scenes involving Sansa and Brienne, as well as the closing reveal with Melisandre, although the Dorne storyline was criticized once again for feeling too abrupt and deviating greatly from the books. For filming of the episode's closing reveal, the director used similar technique to the body double of Cersei Lannister in the previous episode. The episode title is an allusion to the epithet used to describe the Red Priestess Melisandre. In the United States, the episode premiere achieved a viewership of 7.94 million in its initial broadcast, and a same-day total including the streaming services HBO Go and HBO Now of 10.7 million viewers, a record for the series. Plot In the North At Winterfell, Ramsay Bolton mourns the death of Myranda, but commands that her corpse be fed to his hounds. Roose Bolton warns him that, despite their victory over Stannis Baratheon, they could face the wrath of the Lannisters in the future and must therefore secure the loyalty of the North's other nobles. Roose blames Ramsay for losing Sansa Stark, who, as a child of Eddard Stark, could have been used to unite the North. Roose implies that he will disinherit Ramsay if he cannot retrieve her and if Roose's unborn child is a son. Sansa and Theon Greyjoy are pursued and confronted by a squad of Bolton soldiers as they flee through the Wolfswood, but Brienne of Tarth and Podrick Payne arrive and kill the soldiers. Brienne again offers to pledge her loyalty to Sansa, who accepts. In Dorne Doran Martell receives news of Myrcella Baratheon's death and is aghast, but he and Areo Hotah are immediately murdered by Ellaria Sand and Tyene Sand, while the palace guards look on passively. Ellaria states that the Dornish have become dissatisfied with Doran's inaction against the Lannisters. As Doran dies, he pleads for his son Trystane's life, but Ellaria vows that \\"weak men\\" will never rule Dorne again. In King's Landing Jaime Lannister arrives in King's Landing bearing Myrcella's body, and returns to Cersei Lannister. Cersei recounts Maggy the Frog's prophecy that all her children would die before her. Jaime promises that they will have revenge against all who have wronged the Lannisters, heightening the importance of him and Cersei staying close. Margaery Tyrell, who is still held captive by the Faith Militant, converses with the High Sparrow, but he refuses to give her information about her brother Loras. Obara and Nymeria Sand infiltrate Trystane's ship and declare their intent to kill him. When he attempts to defend himself from Nymeria, he is stabbed through the back of the head by Obara. In Meereen Tyrion Lannister and Varys walk through the streets, now deserted due to Daenerys Targaryen's absence and fear of the Sons of the Harpy. Varys promises that his spies will find the leader of the Sons of the Harpy. The two discover that all of the ships in Meereen's harbor have been set ablaze, and Tyrion realizes that Daenerys' forces will be unable to sail to Westeros. In the Dothraki Sea Daario Naharis and Jorah Mormont continue to seek Daenerys. Jorah takes a moment to observe his worsening greyscale. They discover her ring in the middle of thousands of hoof-prints, deducing that she has been taken by the Dothraki. Daenerys is presented to Khal Moro, who has taken her prisoner. Daenerys explains that she was Khal Drogo's wife and asks Moro to escort her back to Meereen, but he refuses, as widows of khals must live out their lives in Vaes Dothrak, the Dothraki's sacred city. In Braavos Arya Stark, now blinded, is sent to beg on the streets. The Waif appears and forces Arya to duel her using a wooden staff. Arya fails because of her blindness, and the Waif promises that she will return the following day. At the Wall Following the murder of Jon Snow, his direwolf Ghost begins to howl, attracting the attention of Davos Seaworth, Eddison Tollett, and a few other loyalists, who take Jon's body into a storeroom. Melisandre briefly visits and is troubled, as she had experienced a vision in the flames of Jon fighting at Winterfell. The loyalists lock themselves in from the mutineers, while Edd sneaks out of Castle Black to get assistance from the Wildlings. Ser Alliser Thorne convenes the Night's Watch and takes responsibility for Jon's murder, defending himself and his co-conspirators from accusations of treason by claiming that Jon's actions would have allowed the Wildlings to destroy the Night's Watch. Thorne and the other mutineers then surround the storeroom and threaten to attack if the loyalists do not surrender by nightfall. Melisandre, who has been sullen following Stannis' defeat and Jon's death, goes to sleep in her bedroom. As she undresses, she removes her ruby necklace, which proves to be enchanted, as she is revealed to have a physical body many years older than she normally appears. Production Writing Series co-creators David Benioff and D. B. Weiss wrote the episode. \\"The Red Woman\\" was written by the series' creators David Benioff and D. B. Weiss. Some elements in the episode are based on the sixth novel in the A Song of Ice and Fire series, The Winds of Winter, which author George R. R. Martin had hoped to have completed before the sixth season began airing. It also contains elements from the chapters \\"The Sacrifice\\" and \\"The Blind Girl\\" from A Dance with Dragons. With this episode, Jonathan Pryce (High Sparrow) is promoted to series regular. The episode has the introduction of new recurring cast member Joe Naufahu, who plays Khal Moro. It was the first episode followed by After the Thrones, HBO's after-show hosted by Andy Greenwald and Chris Ryan. The episode had a premiere at the TCL Chinese Theatre two weeks before the premier of the episode on HBO. There was a lot of speculation prior to the episode regarding whether the character Jon Snow would remain dead or return to life. Fans speculated that Melisandre would be the one to bring back Snow to life, after and before the title of the first episode was revealed to be \\"The Red Woman\\". Liam Cunningham, who portrays Davos Seaworth, spoke about the writing of the episode following its airing, and revealed how he reacted to the scene, saying \\"It was initially shocking. You know what I thought was my favorite bit, and I said it to David and Dan, it was at that moment when the reveal comes and you kind of go, 'Oh my God,' it puts things into context with Melisandre. It doesn't explain or blah, blah, blah. … It's confirmed like, she's a witch, but there was such a touch of humanity. When she went to the bed and got into the bed and covered herself up… it was like a really striking moment in this weird madness of humanity.\\" John Bradley, who portrays Samwell Tarly, also spoke about the scene, saying \\"And what I like about that, and seeing her like that is you know then that her sexuality over the course of the last few seasons, we've seen her use as such a tool -- that's all very deliberate. She presents herself in this way as this beautiful woman because she knows the effect that that can have on people. She knows the effect that that has on Stannis, and that can make men do unadvisable things. So the fact that she did that and she uses that power in that way to have this influence on people. That puts her into context as somebody who really does know what she's doing.\\" Filming Carice van Houten portrays the titular character of the episode, the Red Woman Melisandre. \\"The Red Woman\\" was directed by Jeremy Podeswa. Podeswa previously directed the fifth season episodes \\"Kill the Boy\\" and \\"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken\\", the latter of which received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series. The budget for the sixth season increased compared to the previous seasons as each episode had an average cost of over $10 million, totaling approximately $100 million for the full season, setting a new high for the series. For the closing reveal involving Melisandre, the director of the episode stated that a similar technique to the body double of Cersei Lannister in \\"Mother's Mercy\\" was used, with Carice van Houten wearing prosthetic makeup for the face that was then transposed onto the real body of an old woman. Podeswa stated, \\"The idea is there's an indefinite indeterminate quality that she could be ancient. We were limited by choosing to use a real person rather than a complete creation. Because what does a 400-year-old person look like? We don't know. So if you try to create that, then you're creating something that looks beyond our known reality. Here you feel like she's very old without putting a number on it.\\" Reception Ratings \\"The Red Woman\\" was viewed by 7.94 million American households on its first viewing, which is slightly lower than number of viewers for the fifth-season premiere, 8.00 million, marking the first time in the show's history a season premiere received less ratings than the premiere and finale of the season that came before it. HBO notes that two replays later in the night and early figures from HBO Go and HBO Now push the total to 10.7 million viewers, a same-day record for the show, meaning that the episode received an increase in viewerships. The episode also acquired a 4.0 rating in the 18–49 demographic, making it the highest rated show on cable television of the night. In the United Kingdom, the episode was watched by 2.19 million viewers according to overnight ratings (2.289 million viewers over 7 days and 2.554 over 28 days), a record for the pay channel Sky Atlantic. The UK viewing figures reached an all-time high. The 2am simulcast attracted 60,000 viewers. Similarly it broke the Australian record as the most watched show on pay TV, with 721,000 viewers in the overnight figures and 1.1 million in the final tally. Over a million had downloaded the episode within 12 hours of airing, with Australia having the most illegal downloads of the episode by a single nation. Critical reception Reviews for \\"The Red Woman\\" were very positive. The episode was praised for its humor, Brienne's reunion with Sansa and Theon, and the revelation regarding Melisandre's true age. Rotten Tomatoes gave the episode an approval rating of 86% based on 59 reviews, with an average rating of 7.5.4/10, and the consensus reading: \\"A solid season opener, The Red Woman balanced its ongoing mysteries with a bit of humor and featured Sansa's touching reunion with Brienne of Tarth.\\" James Hunt of What Culture wrote in his review of the episode; \\"It was a good return to the Seven Kingdoms (and beyond), one that was filled with tension throughout, and set about re-establishing the pieces on the board.\\" Ellen Gray of Philadelphia Daily News noted in her review of the episode; \\"First episodes are always difficult. So many people to check in on. Or kill. Or swear vengeance upon. Still, things are off to several promising starts.\\" Mark W. Pleiss of PopMatters wrote in his review of the episode; \\"The most recent episode of HBO's Game of Thrones largely evaded the two major questions from the previous chapter, and instead lined up its sixth season to gravitate around the heroics and cunning of its female protagonists.\\" Tim Surette of TV.com wrote that Melisandre is one of his favorite characters. In isolation from the rest of the episode, many critics were baffled by the drastic changes to the Dorne storyline. For io9, Charlie Jane Anders called it \\"the absolute worst\\" part of the episode, and criticized the Dorne storyline in general for giving Doran Martell \\"a grand total of ten minutes' screentime\\" before suddenly killing him off, given that he is alive in the novels and his major subplot from the books - that he was simply feigning a desire for peace while planning to betray the Lannisters - was not introduced at all before his departure. Alan Sepinwall from HitFix also disliked the Dorne scenes and summarized, \\"I'll settle for not needing to audibly groan every time the story returns to Dorne, frankly.\\" For Vulture, Nate Jones wrote an op-ed piece specifically criticizing the Dorne storyline in seasons five and six, culminating in the changes in the season six premiere, which it felt to be bizarre and illogical - purely relying on shock value when the characters' actions don't make sense upon closer analysis. Jones was also critical of how it was altering the female characters in Dorne, saying that they were changed from the novels to be \\"the kind of violent, scantily clad women that emerge when creators want to pay lip service to feminism, but don't have the time or inclination to create actual three-dimensional female characters.\\" References External links * \\"The Red Woman\\" at HBO.com * * Category:2016 American television episodes Category:Game of Thrones (season 6) episodes Category:Television episodes written by David Benioff and D.B.

This fusion of drawing, narrative, and pattern coalesced in Marks’ aesthetic, and on December 6, 2000, Marks experienced a major shift in her thinking: “My drawings told me they had to be sewn.” She also realized that simple hand-sewing or hand embroidery would not suffice to attain what she was after, and that mastering the properties of a sewing machine was required. She purchased a portable sewing machine, and “began to learn to draw with it, at first simply, then with greater complexity, making contemporary drawings that were enriched and transformed by the process of their creation. From the outset, I somehow knew that this was what I was going to do for the rest of my life and that the potential was enormous. I wanted to make the sewing machine an extension of my nervous system.” Marks thus broke with her earlier processes and expressed her aesthetic through fabric and the properties of sewing. Though her work had previously explored realms of the fantastic, the colors, textures and imagery in fabric, and the tonal, tactile, and linear properties of stitching provided Marks with an expanded repertoire of elements with which to actualize her ideas. Marks calls these works ″sewn drawings.″Ostrower, Jessica, [\\"China Marks at Luise Ross] \\"Art in America,\\" February 2005 Though she had no previous knowledge of the complexities of a sewing machine, Marks’ expertise with power tools, skills she acquired as a sculptor, served as the basis to understand the mechanics of machine sewing. Nevertheless, mastering the sewing machine and being able to draw with it was an intense learning process that moved from a combination of hand and machine embroidery through achieving the dexterity to draw on the machine. Marks’ earliest sewn drawings began as a process of assembling imagery (faces, heads, human figures, fabulous beasts, flora, structures, objects, etc.) cut from scraps of disparate commercially printed fabrics, or creating forms from scratch with fabric scraps. After a process of arranging, re-arranging, and exploring potential variables, a phantasmagorical world would emerge. Marks would then construct a suitable ground for the narrative, using textiles from her growing collection of fabric scraps, swatches, and yardage. The resulting panels, reminiscent of applique, tapestry, embroidery, and traditional drawing, were self-contained narratives of vibrant color, abundant texture, and exuberant imagination. As the sewn drawings developed and became larger, more layered, and generally more complex, Marks’ portable sewing machine could no longer handle the heavier load. In 2002, she purchased an industrial zigzag machine, the Consew 233R, which could handle Marks’ ambition. As a result of the sewing machine's greater capabilities, Marks′ work changed and grew to such a degree that the earlier work “suddenly seemed like the work of another person.” Forms became more intricate, compositions became more variegated, with enriched layers of texture and color. Shading achieved a greater range through pure stitching. Books In 2007, at the prompting of book artist Esther K. Smith, who was writing “How to Make Books” for Random House, Marks created her first one-of-a-kind book, “Dream Girls.” Images from the first draft of “Dream Girls” appeared in Smith’s book. Created from fabric, and using the sewn drawings technique Marks was developing, “Dream Girls” extended Marks′ oeuvre from the self-contained narratives of the individual sewn drawings to a longer form of storytelling. The process, and end result, so enhanced the narrative impulse that already animated her drawings, Marks resolved “to make at least a book a year” for the rest of her life. She made two unique books the following year: “A Book of Horses” and “A Book of Lives.” During this period, as Marks continued her development of sewn drawings and one-of-a-kind books, a chance walk in the Spring of 2009 resulted in Marks spotting a broken umbrella in the street. Intrigued by the black umbrella’s white-printed text, it eventually triggered her thinking about text. She silk- screened text of white ink on black fabric, creating a store of printed text which resulted in two books created in 2009: “The First Black Book,” consisting only of white text on black fabric; and “The Second Black Book,” which included additional text and a few illustrations created as sewn drawings and applied found objects. Her 2010 book, “Presing Questions,” broke from the pure black and added color and extensive text. The text, written in doggerel, was executed as appropriated lettering taken from fabric, as well as invented letters. These breakthroughs in the relationship of text to imagery profoundly affected Marks’ sewn drawings, and by autumn of 2010, her drawings now included text. As with the books, the text in the sewn drawings was derived from words or cut letters from pieces of fabric, or letters Marks created from unrelated shapes. Her visual narratives were now enhanced by literary narrative; Marks′ characters could now speak. In 2013, Marks’ process was further enhanced by the purchase of a state-of-the-art “computerized embroidery machine, specialty threads, stabilizers, and CAD software, along with a Windows-based laptop to manage the software,” all of it acquired with money awarded Marks by the Pollock-Krasner Foundation. With these new tools, Marks could now embroider lines and blocks of text directly onto the panels of sewn drawings, instead of piecing words or letters together from fabric sources. The text and typefaces could now be specific to the narrative and immediately legible, leading Marks to become as much writer as visual artist. Besides the sewn drawings, Marks’ fascination with written narrative also manifested itself in text pieces. These smaller works, with only minimal sewn imagery or devoid of imagery entirely, allow Marks’ “voice” its own presentation. Two of her text pieces were featured in the poetry publication, W.I.S.H. POETRY PRESS in January 2014.Berens, Joshua, [\\"Some Jazzy Stitches by China Marks] \\"W.I.S.H Poetry Press,\\" January 2014 Marks sees her place in contemporary art as that of an “appropriationist and a synthesizer, influenced by manga, anime, and other contemporary art, as well as by almost everything else I see, hear, touch and taste.” Her driving purpose is to create art that entertains her audience, to make jaws drop, to surprise and delight. By appropriating images from printed fabric, techniques from the fabric arts of embroidery and tapestry, the textured experience of collage, the narrative of storytelling, and all of it supported by a consciousness of drawing, Marks unites tradition and experimentation. She considers her sewn drawings and fabric books to be “a new model for storytelling, more experiential than linear.” Marks continues to create sewn drawings, books and text pieces at her studio in Long Island City, New York.  Exhibitions, Public Commissions and Collections  Marks has exhibited extensively since the first solo show of her sculptures and drawings in 1984 at BACA Downtown, a nonprofit gallery and black box theater in downtown Brooklyn. In 1986, she created a room-sized, installation titled “Intimations of a Parallel World,” at New York’s 22 Wooster Gallery’s Two Two Raw Downstairs space. Using cut-out drawings of men and animals in action, recalling Ancient Greek relief friezes, “Intimations of a Parallel World” was an early expression of Marks’ interest in alternative realms, “a world parallel to our own, accessible only through my art.” Marks, China and Hicks, H.L. [\\"To Give Ourselves Over: A Conversation\\"], Numero Cinq Magazine, Volume IV, Number 3,\\" March 2103 Marks created additional iterations of the “Parallel World” installations with “A World Made Flesh: Part Two of The Parallel World,” exhibited at the Morris Museum, Morristown, New Jersey, in 1987; “Sacred Precinct: Part Three of The Parallel World,” exhibited at New York’s Petrosino Park in 1991; and “Who Killed the Queen: Part Four of The Parallel World,” exhibited at the Tomasulo Gallery at Union County College, Cranford, New Jersey. Other significant exhibitions during this period included solo shows at Rutgers University’s Paul Robeson Center Gallery in Newark; the Newark Museum; the Johnson and Johnson Gallery in Johnson & Johnson; the Trans Hudson Gallery in Jersey City; a fifteen-year retrospective at the Rabbet Gallery in New Brunswick; and Grand Arts in Kansas City, Missouri. Marks was also represented in important group exhibitions at this time at the Art Museum of Florida State University, Tallahassee; the Ben Shahn Galleries at William Paterson University in Wayne, New Jersey; Kansas City Art Institute, Kansas City, Missouri; important exhibitions in New York’s Marymount Manhattan College; the Luise Ross Gallery; the George Adams Gallery; and other venues across the country. By 2003, Marks was exhibiting her sewn drawings, and later, her one-of-a-kind books. Solo shows of this new material were mounted at O’Kane Gallery at the University of Houston–Downtown, Houston, Texas; the Luise Ross Gallery in New York; the Marianna Kistler Beach Museum of Art, Manhattan, Kansas; Emerson Center for Arts and Culture in Bozeman, Montana; the Schoolhouse History and Art Center, Colstrip; the Paris Gibson Square Art Center, Great Falls, the Visual Arts Gallery at the University of Montana, Missoula; Art 101, Brooklyn, New York; and the Thompson Gallery at the Cambridge School of Weston, Weston, Massachusetts. Solo exhibitions are scheduled through 2016 in New York’s prestigious Center for Book Arts; the Foosaner Art Museum at Florida Institute of Technology, Melbourne; and the Hampden Gallery at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, among others across the country.  Honors and awards  Marks won her first important award, a Fulbright-Hayes Fellowship for a 16-month stay in Nepal, making sculpture, in 1972. Additional honors followed, including a Graduate Fellowship from the Danforth Foundation; multiple fellowships from the New Jersey State Council on the Arts; an Esseff Foundation for the Arts Purchase Award; a National Endowment for the Arts-Mid Atlantic fellowship for works on paper; two George Sugarman Foundation grants; two New York Foundation for the Arts fellowships, the second as a Gregory Millard Fellow in Printmaking/Drawing/Artist’s Books; and many others. In 1988, Marks was honored as a Distinguished Artist by the New Jersey State Council on the Arts. She served as an Artist-in-Residence at the Newark Museum in 2003; a residency at Anchor Graphics at Columbia College, Chicago in 2011; and in 2013 Marks was awarded the prestigious Pollock-Krasner Foundation grant.

In 2007, the software development and translation solutions company secured $1.6 million in Series A-2 financing. The A-2 round was led by Canopy Ventures of Lindon, Utah, contributing $1 million. Previous investors including Flywheel Ventures also participated in the A-2 round. The funding was to expand its sales and marketing efforts and further increase Lingotek’s presence in the language translation market. On July 16, 2008, Lingotek received a strategic investment with In-Q-Tel, a strategic, not-for-profit investment firm that works to identify, adapt, and deliver innovative technology solutions to support the mission of the Central Intelligence Agency and the broader U.S. Intelligence Community. Launched by the CIA in 1999 as a private, independent organization, the In-Q-Tel mission is to identify and partner with companies developing cutting-edge technologies that serve the national security interests of the United States. In exchange, Lingotek was to provide a new and innovative platform to facilitate more efficient, faster language translation. The agreement funded the development and enhancement of new translation solutions, including breakthrough global collaboration translation technology. The In-Q-Tel investment was also part of a Series B funding round, with participation by Flywheel Ventures, and Canopy Ventures. The funds were used to expand business operations, distribution, and further develop Lingotek’s language technology capabilities. Products In 2006, Lingotek was the first U.S. company to launch a fully online, web-based, computer-assisted translation (CAT) system and pioneered the integration of translation memories (TM) with a main-frame powered machine translation (MT). While the translation products of more than a dozen European companies appeared in the U.S. market, the only standalone tools to directly support human translators developed in the U.S. were Lingotek in 2006. The developer was based in Utah and came from within the LDS Church. The LDS Church uses Lingotek as its preferred tool for its crowdsourcing translation. While Lingotek was originally marketed to government entities, translation companies, and freelance translators, the current marketing effort is focused on larger corporations with translation needs. In August, 2006, Lingotek launched a beta version of its collaborative language translation service that enhanced a translator’s efficiency by quickly finding meaning-based translated material for reuse. Branded as the Lingotek Collaborative Translation Platform, the service was based on three tiers of translation: automatic, community, and professional. Lingotek’s language search engine indexed linguistic knowledge from a growing repository of multilingual content and language translations, instead of web pages. Users could then access its database of previously translated material to find more specific combinations of words for re-use. Such meaning-based searching maintained better style, tone, and terminology. Lingotek ran within most popular web browsers, including initial support for Internet Explorer and Firefox. Lingotek supported Microsoft Office, Microsoft Word, Rich Text Format (RTF), Open Office, HTML, XHTML, and Microsoft Excel formats, thereby allowing users to upload such documents directly into Lingotek. Lingotek also supported existing translation memory files that were Translation Memory eXchange (TMX)-compliant memories, thus allowing users to import TMX files into both private and public indices. In June 2007, Lingotek began offering free access to its language search engine and other web 2.0-based translation-related software tools. Free access to the language search engine included both open and closed translation memory (TM). The Lingotek project management system helped project managers track translation projects in real-time. The system’s alignment tool, glossary capabilities, version tracking and other tools were all included and available at no charge to all Lingotek users. In 2008, Lingotek moved to Amazon Web Services's on-demand cloud computing platform. The Lingotek TMS has long been used internally and for government agencies. The company's first version of the product was a hosted, multi-tenant web app in 2006, which moved into the Amazon cloud in 2008. Though chiefly known in the industry as a technology- enabled LSP, Lingotek has been licensing the system separately, to customers that don't have a language services relationship. Due to its connectivity, scalability, security, and strong feature set, this is an option that enterprises should consider for their own translation environments. Lingotek’s system was developed specifically with mass collaboration in mind. The company introduced software-as-a-service (SaaS) collaborative translation technology in 2009, which combined the workflow and computer-aided translation (CAT) capabilities of human and machine translation into one application. Organizations can upload new projects, assign translators (paid or unpaid), check the status of current projects in real time, and download completed documents from any computer with web access. In 2010, Lingotek re-positioned its Collaborative Translation Platform (CTP) as a software-as-a-service (SaaS) product which combined machine translation, real-time community translation, and management tools. Lingotek’s cloud-based CAT system was available on the market in 2012. The translation system can process text files and offers comprehensive support for the localization of web page files in HTML. In addition, the Lingotek CAT tools can handle several file types, including: * Microsoft Office, Microsoft Word, Microsoft PowerPoint, and Microsoft Excel; * Adobe FrameMaker files; * Files with the standardized format for localization: XML Localisation Interchange File Format (.xliff), .ttx (XML font file format) files, and .po (portable object) * Java properties files; * OpenDocument files; * Windows resource files; * Mac OS and OS X; and * TMX (Translation Memory eXchange). Lingotek’s stand‐alone translation management system (TMS) can be used to manage translation workflow for many different types of assets, from documents to websites. Since different types of content require different workflows, and often different service providers, Lingotek’s enterprise TMS enables operators to manage not just the translation process, but also the vendor supply chain. In 2010, Lingotek created a solution that integrated the Collaborative Translation Platform with other applications. The Lingotek - Inside API (application programming interface) allows users to translate content in web applications such as SharePoint, Drupal, Salesforce.com, Jive Social CRM, and Oracle universal content management (UCM). Lingotek translation connectors work in conjunction with other content creation tools such as Drupal and WordPress, that integrate with its TMS. In 2016, the company was named a Top 30 Drupal Contributor. Lingotek’s TMS added multi- vendor translation, which enables brands to choose any translation agency for in-workflow translation in 2014. Awards & Recognition Lingotek was named Comparably Best Places to Work 2017 and received an award for Utah Best in State Language Services 2017. In 2016, Lingotek was identified as a Top 30 Drupal Contributor. The company was a Bronze Winner of the 2015 Edison Award Verbal Communications; named a CIO Microsoft 100 Solution Provider by CIO Review; a Gartner Cool Vendor of the Year (2012),Cool Vendors Research, \\"Cool Vendors in Content Management, 2012\\", Gartner, 2012 and received the Stevie Award for Best New Product or Service of the Year – Software as a Service (2010).2010 Stevie Awards \\"International Business Awards\\", Stevie Awards In 2006, Lingotek was named Most Innovative Product by Utah Valley Entrepreneurial Forum.

In 1929 Bigelow came to Duke University where he served as a member of the chemistry department faculty until 1961. Bigelow's primary field of research was fluorine chemistry and the direct fluorination of organic compounds. His research provided the foundations for the preparation of fluorocarbons by direct fluorination carried out during World War II as part of the Manhattan Project. After retiring from active teaching at Duke, Bigelow continued his research work at Hynes Chemical Research, a firm started by several of his former graduate students. In 1958 he was the recipient of the Herty Medal by the Georgia Section of the American Chemical Society, recognizing him as an outstanding Southern chemist. Lucius A. Bigelow died in 1973, survived by his wife Mary Cummings Bigelow and two children.

The only example flew with different engines in the mid-1920s. Design and development Though in 1924 Flight described the C.99, which was on display at the 18th Paris Salon, as a fighter, both contemporary and modern French sources term it an observation and long range reconnaissance aircraft. It was a conventional single engine tractor biplane with two open cockpits in tandem. Its unequal span wings were rectangular in plan and were mounted without stagger, divided into two bays on each side by two pairs of parallel interplane struts. Cabane struts supported the upper wing over the fuselage. The C.99 had a steel frame engine mounting in the nose, designed to accept a variety of engines. At the 1924 Salon it had a Hispano-Suiza 12H water cooled V-12 engine but it was also seen with a water cooled Fiat engine and a Lorraine-Dietrich was another possibility. The forward seat was just behind the wing trailing edge and the second close behind. There was a triangular fin which carried a rudder with a straight and upright edge. This extended to the keel so the elevators, attached to a tailplane mounted on top of the fuselage, required a central cut-out for movement. The C.99 had a fixed undercarriage with its mainwheels on a single axle mounted on V-struts from each side of the fuselage. As a bomber, the C.99 could carry twelve bombs. At the Salon it was fitted with four machine guns, one fixed and forward firing for the pilot and two on a Scarff ring for the observer in the rear cockpit, who also had the fourth, rearward firing, gun in his floor.

The Hunter's Federation (FKNK) and St Hubert Hunters (KSU) filed a petition at the Constitutional Court in an attempt to stop the referendum being held, saying it would violate the country's European Union treaty obligations. The FKNK said the petition had 104,293 signatures, making it the largest in Maltese history.Update 3 - Hunters' petition carries 104,293 signatures - 'more than PN vote at EP elections' Times of Malta, 2 June 2014 However, the court dismissed their claim on 9 January 2015, and also ordered the FKNK and KSU to pay court costs. In 2009 the European Court of Justice had found that Malta was breaching its EU treaty obligations by allowing the spring hunt. However, successive governments passed legislation allowing it to continue. Malta is the only country in the EU to allow spring hunting for recreational purposes. Only two species, turtle doves and quails, are allowed to be shot, with quotas of 11,000 and 5,000 bird respectively. This quota is set annually, based on how many birds were reported killed the previous autumn. Hunters are required to report their kills to the government. According to the Maltese government, 805 turtle doves and 151 quail were reported as killed in the 2012 spring hunting season. Result The question voted on in the referendum was \\"Do you agree that the provisions of the ‘Framework for Allowing a Derogation Opening a Spring Hunting Season for Turtle Dove and Quail Regulations’ (Subsidiary Legislation 504.94) should continue in force?\\" Aftermath Hunter in Qalet Marku, Naxxar, in spring 2014 When the results of the referendum were out, Prime Minister Joseph Muscat announced that the spring hunting season would open on 14 April. He warned hunters to be careful, and he said they were being given a 'final chance' and no abuse will be tolerated. During the season, there were six illegalities, which is much fewer than in previous years. A particular incident involved a Dutch boy being accidentally hit by pellets fired by a hunter. On 27 April, a kestrel was illegally shot at, and the injured bird fell in the yard of St. Edward's College in Birgu. Muscat called this incident \\"inexcusable\\" and closed the season immediately. This decision was welcomed by the Coalition Against Spring Hunting, the Nationalist Party, the Democratic Alternative and BirdLife Malta. The pro-hunting lobby, consisting of FKNK and KSU, condemned the incident and called for those responsible to be brought to justice. Birdlife Malta said that it reported 9 incidents and in addition, a total of 63 illegal bird callers were detected by CABS during this hunting season.
