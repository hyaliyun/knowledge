After her purchase by the Hong Kong- based merchant house Jardine Matheson, in 1833 Sylph set a speed record by sailing from Calcutta to Macao in 17 days, 17 hours. Her primary role was to transport opium between various ports in the Far East. She disappeared en route to Singapore in 1849. History Sylph was designed in London by Sir Robert Seppings, surveyor of the Royal Navy, to the order of a consortium of Calcutta merchants headed by Rustomjee Cowasjee. Two contemporary paintings of Sylph show her to have been a heavily rigged ship with trysails on each mast and a tall, high-peaked spanker. Sleek, elegant, functional and devoid of ornament, Sylph did not have the rakish lines of the later clippers, yet proved to be particularly swift. She is supposed to have run from the Sandheads to Macao in sixteen days. In 1833 Jardines sent Sylph to explore the profitability of trading along the Chinese coast. Arriving at Macao in September, Sylph unloaded some of the opium she had transported from Calcutta and immediately departed northwards with the German Protestant missionary Karl G√ºtzlaff on board as translator. During the First Opium War (1839-1842) Jardines were offered a premium price for the ship, an offer that was declined on the basis of the huge profits she made from transporting opium. Sylph and another well-known clipper, Cowasjee Family, were fitted out with extra guns and full European crews during the war, and were joined by the Lady Hayes, belonging to Jardine, Matheson & Co., the three ships sailing in company. While they were sailing among the islands Chinese war junks surrounded them and a fierce battle ensued. But Captains Wallace and Vice, of Sylph and Cowasjee Family, were two of the most experienced captains in the trade, celebrated for their daring and success in dealing with pirates, and the war junks suffered a severe defeat, many of them being sunk; after which the opium clippers had no more trouble. The opium clipper Sylph salvaged by the sloop Clive, by Huggins While sailing from Calcutta to China and carrying 995 chests of opium, Sylph ran aground on a shoal off the Malay Peninsula on January 30, 1835. According to the Canton Register dated April 14, 1835, Captain Wallace told the vessel's insurers that she had been swamped, then beached by the northeast monsoon.Canton Register (Vol. 8 No. 15), Tuesday, 14 April 1835 p. 62 The East Indiaman Clive came to the rescue and the ship and all but two chests of opium were recovered. After undergoing re-rigging in Hong Kong in 1848 at a cost of 11,166.22 Mexican dollars, Sylph disappeared en route to Singapore the following year, possibly captured and burned by pirates based on Hainan Island. Other sources believe that she was wrecked on the rocks of Pedra Branca off the coast of Singapore whilst carrying a cargo of opium to the value of 557,200 Spanish dollars.

Grinsdale has a church called St Kentigern's Church. It is the source of the surname. It is also beside the River Eden. The civil parish was merged into Beaumont in 1934. In 1931 the civil parish had a population of 161. Grinsdale lies beside the river Eden near Carlisle. Four Roman military marching camps were set up in the area. The rich loamy soil encouraged farming around Grinsdale. Linen manufacture and weaving once provided employment in the hamlet. Grinsdale's church, St Kentigern, was built in 1740 outside the village and just above the river on the site where a 12th-century church once stood. It has a small west tower, a three-bay nave, and a two-bay chancel with arched windows. The church was restored in 1895. This place gave name to a family who held Grinsdale under the Barony of Burgh.'Parishes: Edenhall - Grinsdale', Magna Britannia: volume 4: Cumberland (1816), pp. 100‚Äì109. Date accessed: 24 April 2012. The elder line failed about King John's time, when the co-heiresses married Newton and Le-Sor. Newton's lands passed by successive marriages to Martindale and Dacre, and having been forfeited to the crown, were granted to Whitmore, and passed by sale to the Dacre family of Kirklinton. A younger brother continued the male line of the family of Grinsdale, and some of his posterity represented the city and the county in parliament. This branch became extinct about the reign of Henry IV when the co-heiresses sold their lands in Grinsdale to the Dentons, of whom they were purchased by the Lowthers about the year 1686. This estate passed to the Earl of Lonsdale, who was Lord Paramount of the manor, as parcel of his Barony of Burgh. The church of Grinsdale was given by Hugh de Morville to the priory of Lanercost, and became appropriated to that monastery. King Edward VI granted the rectory of Grinsdale to Sir Thomas Dacre; the great tithes were sold by the Dacre family in 1751, to the respective landholders. The church, which had been many years totally in ruins, was rebuilt about the year 1743 by Joseph Dacre at his own expense. The Hadrian's Wall Path passes the church, on its way from Carlisle to Bowness-on-Solway via Kirkandrews-on-Eden, Beaumont, Cumbria and Burgh-by-Sands. The site of Milecastle 69 on Hadrian's Wall is thought to lie close to the village.

The band's original line-up includes the songwriter Attila Wind (vocals/guitars), B√°lint Hamvas (bass), and Viktor Albert (drums). The sound of the band is generally a mix of flanging and light distorted guitars, throbbing bass, and enchanting keyboard melodies. Dawnstar represents a mixture of mid-1960s psychedelic, late 1970s goth, mid-1980s grunge and 1990s indie rock of the Budapest indie music scene. History=Formation Wind, born to an English father from Sunderland and Hungarian mother from Budapest, met Hamvas in the mid-1990s at the Teleki Blanka Gymnasium in Budapest, Hungary. In 1999 they formed Ansellia, named after the eponymous orchid, as a duo project and recorded their first demo, Eunomia. In 2000 Wind composed eight new tracks which were recorded in Piliscsaba. This demo entitled Vanity helped the band recruit Albert who was Hamvas's classmate at the Budapest Business School. After several concerts at local clubs, in spring 2001 the band started using the name Dawnstar, which is a combination of ‚Ä≥dawn‚Ä≥ and ‚Ä≥star‚Ä≥ as an alternative for Morning Star or Venus, instead of Ansellia. They gave their first concert with this new name on 13 December 2002 at the Woodoo club in Csepel. The early sound of the band was influenced by the grunge revolution from Seattle. However, later the band started to mix their sound with many different music genres such as psychedelia, post-punk and garage rock. In 2002 Dawnstar recorded their third demo, Under Your Wings, at the Pick-up Studios in Budapest. The result was a mixture of flanging verses and distorted choruses establishing the distinctive sound of the band. Hiatus The band were on hiatus from 2003-05 due to the foreign studies of the band members. In 2003 Wind continued his studies at University of Trieste in Italy while Hamvas at the University of Padua in 2004. On 16 April 2005, Dawnstar performed at the Ecofest, organised to celebrate eco-friendly ideas by the V√©degylet. A week before the show, Wind recruited Mitropulos as an additional musician to play the keyboard. Finally, Mitropulos joined Dawnstar as a permanent member in late 2005. In 2006 Dawnstar recorded their fourth demo entitled A Metrosexual's Confessions. In 2006 the band played three shows at the Erzs√©betliget Theatre in Budapest. Before their third show on 31 November 2006, the band members were interviewed by Beatrice's lead singer Fer√≥ Nagy. On 30 March 2007, Dawnstar performed at the Budapest Fringe Festival. Change The World On 30 November 2007, Dawnstar released their first EP, Change The World, including three songs: the title track Change The World, Scarlet and Don't Die A Martyr For Me. The band opted for Heaven Street Seven's Zolt√°n Tak√°cs and L√°szl√≥ Philip as the sound engineers for the record. The band spent two days with the recording at the Abnormal Studios in November, 2007. On 22 January 2017, the band's song entitled Don't Die A Martyr For Me was listed among antiwar songs on the Italian website, Antiwar Songs. On 6 July 2009, Dawnstar played at the Donaukanaltreiben Festival in Vienna, Austria. The band was spotted on the community website, Myspace by Heidimarie Pyringer, who organised the concert for the band in the Austrian capital. On 10 April 2010, Dawnstar played at the Fringe Festival in P√©cs which was selected to be the European Capital of Culture for the same year. Next year, on 1 April 2011, Dawnstar performed at the Budapest Fringe Festival for the third time. Saturnine Valentines Dawnstar in 2013 In 2012 Dawnstar started recording their first full-length studio album entitled Saturnine Valentines at the Abnormal Studios in Budapest. The band hired D√°vid Schram, who previously worked on Shell Beach's This Is Desolation and FreshFabrik's MORA, as mixing and mastering engineer for their album. On 19 May 2013, Dawnstar uploaded three songs (Love's Gonna Be Tender, In Heaven We Meet Again, Ophelia) from their upcoming studio album on YouTube and SoundCloud and three months later the full record was available on Bandcamp. In December 2013, Dawnstar was featured on J.D. Doyle's Queer Music Heritage. In the same month Love's Gonna Be Tender was aired on OutRadio. On 19 January 2016, the band's first video clip, In Heaven We Meet Again, was premiered on Underground Magazin. The video was shot in √úr√∂m in December 2015 and it was directed by Wind. The video was inspired by Daniel Myrick and Eduardo S√°nchez's psychological horror movie Blair Witch Project. On 12 February 2016 the band played a show at Szilvupl√© B√°r √©s Variet√© in Budapest with three guest vocalist including: Vikt√≥ria Wind (n√©e Bord√°cs), Zs√≥fia Toporczy (Pl√ºssnapalm), and Vikt√≥ra Sereg. This was the first time when guest vocalist were invited to support the band. On 17 June 2016, Dawnstar released their second video entitled London Nights. In the video Wind is wandering in the streets of London, The United Kingdom passing by some famous sights such as Tower Bridge and St Paul's Cathedral.

He also speaks of his athletic agility and of his feats of daring when he climbed the donjon tower of the then much higher Kendal Castle, and, running round the top leapt the terrific gorge to the consternation and admiration of the large crowd. He later went on to attract admiration in London for his skating performances on the Serpentine river in Hyde Park, eclipsing the best men in the Skating Club. By the time his sisters had grown up. William, who had been exhibiting his work, was still hankering after a painting career, and this ambition was \\"hastened after an introduction to Thomas Allom, the estimable landscape painter and architect, and to Mr Thomas Sidney Cooper A.R.A whom he met at the home of Mr. John Barton, then of Gill Cottage, (now of Preston)\\".He set off to try his fortune in London. He did not follow his friends‚Äô advice and stick to vignette heads in crayons, wanting to use paints, and unfortunately he did not become fashionable. After some tribulations he settled on becoming a provincial artist, and being of a genial and affable nature, and excelling in poetry, vocal, and instrumental music, he made friends and patrons in Lancashire, Yorkshire, Staffordshire, Nottinghamshire and Westmorland who were glad to give him work in oils. Poetry William must have found that his poetry was well received and intended to publish because he had written the Introduction in London in 1867 just before his death. The book was published in Kendal by his friends the next year under the title Rustic Studies in the Westmorland Dialect, with Sketches from the Sketch Book of an Artist (published by Whittaker and Company in London, printed by Titus Wilson, Kendal).

It closely resembles other mancalas from East Africa such as Enkeshui and Layli Goobalay. Rules The Andada board comprises two rows of holes; the number of holes per row may vary from 12 to 24, but is always a multiple of 3. Holes are traditionally called ita (meaning \\"houses\\"). At the beginning, two seeds are placed in each hole. Seeds are called ayla (\\"cows\\"). Each player owns the row of holes closest to him. The game is opened by a special move made by one of the players, who will take all seeds from one of his holes and sows them counterclockwise; then takes the seeds from the hole immediately after the one where the first sowing has ended and sows them too, and so on, repeating this procedure until all holes have either 3 or 0 seeds. This will lead the board in one of the following situations (assuming the board has 12 holes per row): : 3 3 0 3 3 0 3 3 0 3 3 0 : 0 3 3 0 3 3 0 3 3 0 3 3 : 3 0 3 3 0 3 3 0 3 3 0 3 : 3 0 3 3 0 3 3 0 3 3 0 3 : 0 3 3 0 3 3 0 3 3 0 3 3 : 3 3 0 3 3 0 3 3 0 3 3 0 The opponent then will choose who will move first in the remainder of the game. Players will then take turns as in other mancalas. At his/her turn, the player takes all seeds from a hole and sows them counterclockwise. If the last seed falls in a non empty hole, the player will take all seeds from that hole and sow them too (relay sowing). When the last seed falls in an empty hole, if this hole is in the player's own row, he will capture any seeds in the opposing hole in the opponent's row. Captured seeds are removed from the game. When no hole holds more than 1 seed, any seed that reaches the end of one player's row will be removed from the game instead of moved to the opponent's row. The first player to be without any seeds in his row loses the game. References R. Pankhurst. Gabata and Related Board Games of Ethiopia and the Horn of Africa.

He was the first editor of the nine volume Enciclopedia dello Spettacolo (Encyclopedia of Performing Arts), published between 1954 and 1965, that covered theater, music, cinema, and dance. Most notably, he held an eminent position in theatrical study in Italy, giving his name to the Silvio D'Amico National Academy of Dramatic Art in Rome, Italy's most prestigious drama school. Biography A Catholic,Witt, p. 122 D'Amico was educated by Jesuits at Rome's Massimiliano Massimo Institute. After graduating in law in 1911, he was appointed to the Ministry of Education to the Directorate General for Antiquities and Fine Arts. In 1923, he became professor of theater history in the Royal School of Acting \\"Eleonora Duse.\\" He met Duse when he was young and ambitious, a time when D'Amico wanted to create an Italian national theatre that produced works of young Italian playwrights. Between 1925 and 1940, he directed dramatic criticism in the La Tribune newspaper. With Nicola De Pirro, he founded the magazine Scenario in 1932 and they directed it together for three years, after which De Pirro continued alone.

Personal life He had at least two children. A son, Fedele D'Amico (nickname: Lele), who was a musicologist, married the Italian screenwriter, Suso Cecchi d'Amico, in 1938. Another son, Alessandro d'Amico, married Pirandello's granddaughter, Maria Luisa Aguirre. D'Amico's brother, Mario, worked on the Enciclopedia with him. He died in Rome in April 1955. At the news of his death, the theaters of the capital remained closed for mourning.

As an instrument temir komuz is unrelated to the komuz in terms of style and structure however, it takes its name from this other popular Turkic instrument. The stringed komuz is used by Turkic people living in central Asia e.g., Kyrgyz, Uzbeks, Kazakhs, Turkmens, and Uyghurs etc., as well as by Azeri, Turkish, and Yakut people. In fact, komuz is cognate for the names of several musical instruments, used extensively by Turkic people and key to the music of Central Asia, just as Kazakh kobyz (Uzbek qo'biz) (bowed instruments), the Tuvan and Sakha or Yakut xomus (a jaw harp), Azeri gopuz, Dagestan agach komus, Avar people temur, and Turkish kopuz. The oldest known komuz-like instrument dates from the 4th century although the related Azerbaijani gopuz is believed to date back to 6000 BCE following an archaeological discovery of clay plates depicting gopuz players. In the 1960s American archeologists working in the Shushdagh mountains near the ancient city of Jygamish in Iranian Azerbaijan, uncovered a number of rare clay plates which dated back to around 6000 BCE which depicted musicians at a council, holding a komuz-like instrument to their chests.

Numbering around 500,000, this ethnic group traces its origins back to settlers who arrived from SomaliaIndia and the Indian Ocean, 1500-180 Page 203The African Diaspora in the Indian Ocean - Page 82 in the 15th or 16th century. Upon arriving in Madagascar, these settlers converted the Antemoro to Islam; the religion was soon abandoned in favor of traditional beliefs and practices associated with respect for the ancestors, although remnants of Islam remain in fady such as the prohibition against consuming pork. In the 16th century an Antemoro kingdom was established, supplanting the power of the earlier Zafiraminia, who also descended from seafarers. The Antemoro soon developed a reputation as powerful sorcerers and astrologers, in large part owing to their monopoly on knowledge of writing, termed sorabe, which uses the Arabic script to transcribe the Malagasy language. Antemoro ombiasy (astrologer sages) migrated throughout the island, where they practiced their arts for local communities, served as advisers to kings, and even founded new principalities. This Antemoro mobility and their creation of a network of powerful spiritual advisers across the island is credited with forcing an awareness among Malagasy of communities beyond their own and sparking a sense of a common Malagasy identity. The Antemoro kingdom was disbanded in the late 19th century following an uprising of the Antemoro commoners against the noble class. Today the Antemoro remain clustered around the southeast coastal homeland, where they grow rice and coffee, produce salt, and manufacture charms. The Antemoro often leave their homeland for six to ten months out of the year or more to work as ombiasy offering charms, spells, divinations and other arcane services. Nearly every village in Madagascar has an ombiasy, and many are either Antemoro themselves or have traveled to the Antemoro homeland to receive training. The community's historic production of Antemoro paper, a flower-embedded paper traditionally used to record secret knowledge using sorabe, is another major source of income as the paper is commonly sold to tourists and exported overseas. Ethnic identity Distribution of Malagasy ethnic groups \\"Antemoro\\", in the Malagasy language, means \\"people of the coast\\". They live on the southeastern coast, mostly between Manakara and Farafangana. The Antemoro are descendants of Muslims who settled in Madagascar in the 14th century and intermarried with the local population. In 2013 the Antemoro population was estimated at 500,000. While there are claims that link them to Arabia, other scholars argue these people are more likely linked to groups originating in the Swahili coast.Solofo Randrianja and Stephen Ellis, Madagascar: A Short History (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2009), p. 57 History The Antemoro figure among the more recent settlers on the island of Madagascar. They are descended from Muslim seafarers who are believed to have arrived on the southeast coast around 1500. Boats carrying Muslim settlers had arrived on Madagascar's shores in the past, but there was a marked uptick in arrivals around this time. Upon arrival they encountered several other Malagasy ethnic groups including the Zafiraminia, who also traced their origins back to Mecca by way of East Africa, although some scholars suggest that the origins of the Zafiraminia was in SumatraRandrianja and Ellis, Madagascar, p. 62 and who had developed a high status among Malagasy communities for the knowledge and technology they had carried with them from overseas, and who had the prerogative of practicing ritual animal sacrifice for the ancestors (sombili), a highly powerful and important rite among Malagasy communities. Oral and written historical traditions of the Antemoro describe their desire to secure marriages between the two communities, but these efforts were rejected by the Zafiraminia. A conflict developed between the two groups for supremacy, which the oral histories of other Malagasy groups describe as a battle between two giants. The conflict evolved as additional Arab settlers arrived and joined with their fellow newcomers to become Antemoro themselves. Antemoro paper is still commonly produced in Madagascar in centers such as Ambalavao (pictured). Around 1550 the mounting conflict seems to have reached a turning point with the Zafikasimambo noble family rising to power in Matitana following the family leader's marriage to a local woman. Historical texts tie the lineage of the family's leader, Zafikazimambobe, to Anteony noble Ramarohala, who had settled there at least three generations before. Other historical sources confirm however that the genealogy described in these texts is not factual, and that the Zafikazimambo family had only newly arrived and so had no demonstrable descent from local nobles. Rather, these texts suggest that it took over three generations for the Antemoro to successfully integrate into the society through intermarriage and other means, and also reflect an awareness among the Antemoro of the importance of local caste and lineage traditions and their need to find a place within them. Upon rising to power, the Zafikasimambo clan absorbed the ritual privileges of the former Zafiraminia clan and had established themselves as the premier ombiasy (wise men) who practiced astrology and served as scribes; they regularly left the Antemoro homeland to provide their services where needed. These ombiasy also often trained the spiritual leaders of other communities, further reinforcing the preeminence of the Matitana ombiasy as masters of arcane knowledge and those outside their clan who sought to learn or dispense it. The Zafikasimambo used their right to conduct sombily (ritual sacrifice) to shape and increasingly control political and economic activities in the area. To end the conflict with the Zafiraminia, they executed as many males of the group as possible and relegated the women and children to restricted areas. In this way they established the first strong Antemoro kingdom. They are rare among Malagasy clans as newcomers who successfully established their own kingdom within a short time after landing on the island. Under Antemoro Zafikasimambo leadership, the commoners' freedom was significantly reduced and religion became a central feature of social and political life. The conflict between the Antemoro and Zafiraminia nobles and the resulting Zafikasimambo rule also established a tradition of emigration from this part of the island. Unlike the majority of Malagasy who generally seek to return to their ancestral land, the Antemoro initially felt no such call to remain linked to a geographic area. As a result, the ombiasy of the Antemoro traveled widely, some moving from place to place and others settling permanently at royal courts and elsewhere. Their arcane knowledge of writing, medicine, technology and other areas both established their reputation as indispensable advisers to nobles and commoners alike, and instilled the island-wide feature of the community astrologer who shapes daily life. The ombiasy of Matitana were According to historian Bethwell Ogot, the network of stationary and itinerant Antemoro ombiasy were key in transforming the societies of Madagascar from an amalgam of insular clans to outward looking communities with greater awareness of others, leading to territorial expansion and larger, more complex kingdoms. In addition, oral histories suggest that sovereigns among the Merina, Tanala and Antanosy may have had ancestors who migrated away from Antemoro country. By the early 18th century, the Antemoro had established themselves as major rice and slave exporters. Throughout the 1700s, the Antemoro were embroiled in a conflict with the Ikongo-Tanala that culminated in a bloody Tanala invasion of the eastern coastal plain. Shortly afterward, a major Antemoro leader named Andriamamohotra established an alliance and vassal relationship with the king then ruling Imerina, Andrianampoinimerina, to reestablish peace. Society Antemoro villages are primarily clustered in the southeastern coastal area near Vohipeno and Manakara. Society was traditionally divided into two broad categories: the mpanombily (or tompomenakely), who were nobles said to be descended from Arabs from Mecca, and the menakely, composed of the working and slave classes, who were said to have descended from the local Malagasy who submitted to the Arabs' rule, or alternately from slaves that the Arabs had brought with them. The mpanombily comprised many noble clans such as the Anakara, Onjatsy, Tsimaito, Antaiony, Antalaotra, Antaisambo, Antaimahazo and others. Particular clans within Antemoro society historically held distinct privileges and responsibilities. The butchering of certain animals for human consumption was assigned to specific clans. Antemoro kings (andrianony) were selected by popular decision from among the Anakara clan, originally clustered around the mouth of the Matitanana river near the town of Manakara that shares their name. Once selected, these rulers were accorded a near-sacred status. The fady they established were scrupulously observed for centuries after the ruler's death. The Anakara were responsible for safeguarding the sacred Antemoro idols and texts, spoke a secret language for communicating arcane knowledge amongst themselves, and rarely intermarried with other Antemoro clans. This clan was believed to be in communication with powerful genies (ziny) and other spirits and was reputed to produce the most powerful sorcerers and astrologers on the island. They knew how to manufacture charms, cast spells, and practice geomancy using local gemstones. To maintain their distinction from other members of Antemoro society, the Anakara lived in villages sealed off by spiked wooden palisades where none could enter without permission. Rulers were further distinguished by fady forbidding them to wear shirts or hats. Family affiliation Each Antemoro clan was endogamous and marriage outside the clan was deeply taboo. Those who transgressed were mourned as if dead and were entirely cut off from the community. Religious affiliation The Antemoro adhere to the traditional spiritual beliefs and practices common throughout the island, although different Antemoro clans and families incorporate aspects of Islam to varying degrees. They commonly make and wear amulets upon which verses of the Qur'an are written using the sorabe script. Before converting to Islam in the seventh or eighth century, the Malagasy clans that later intermarried with Arabs to found the Antemoro dynasty were monotheists who believed in a creator god and numerous spirits that served as intermediaries between living beings and the creator. By the time of conversion to Islam, the creator god had been all but forgotten, with much greater focus placed on the spirits, who had been raised to the level of deities. The arrival of Arab settlers prompted large scale conversion to Islam, but the core tenets were soon lost and gave way to the honoring of ancestors and their fady. Culture Arab and Islamic influences strongly mark Antemoro culture. Traditionally, Antemoro men's clothing included a turban or fez style hat and long, loose robes similar to those worn in many other parts of the Muslim world. Harefo reeds were woven to form mats (tafitsihy) that were sewn together to form jackets and tunics (with long sleeves for older men); a loincloth made of fanto (beaten barkcloth) was worn beneath the ensemble. Women wore sleeveless sheath dresses made from two or three reed mats sewn together and belted at the waist or drawn over one shoulder. Adolescent and adult women often also wore a mat bandeau or halter top. It was historically forbidden for women to wear lambas made of cotton or any other material than woven raffia mats, as it was believed this could render them more attractive to men outside their clan, with whom they were forbidden to marry. The Antemoro were reputed across the island for being the only ethnic group to have developed a written form of the Malagasy language, sorabe, which used Arabic script; this form of writing was largely replaced elsewhere by the Latin alphabet under the Merina monarchy in the 19th century. The Antemoro were also widely reputed in the pre-colonial period for their astrologers, who would predict the future based on lunar phases. They were known all across Madagascar and acted as advisers at the court of many Malagasy kings, including the celebrated Merina king Andrianampoinimerina, whose Antemoro astrologers advised him and taught him sorabe writing. The pan- Madagascar tradition of the ombiasy is rooted in this element of Antemoro culture. The introduction of royal sampy (idols) into the Kingdom of Imerina is likewise attributed to an Antemoro ombiasy. Fady Taboos (fady) among the Antemoro derive from ancestral traditions as well as from aspects of Islamic and Arab culture. An Antemoro taboo against dogs as unclean, although shared by Islam, actually predates the arrival of the religion on the island. The prohibition against eating pork, however, originated with the introduction of Islam. Traditionally, members of a given Antemoro clan could only eat with others of the same clan. Funeral rites The death of any member of the community is mourned in the same way, regardless of social class. All community members participate in a week-long period of mourning for the deceased, during which time they are forbidden to wash or change clothing. On the eighth day, the mourning period is broken and everyone bathes and dresses in fresh attire. A female widow must continue the mourning period until the parents of the deceased declare it completed. A male widower remains shut away in his home for a period of one or two weeks, during which time the parents of the deceased send a female family member to care for him and keep him company. Language The Antemoro speak a dialect of the Malagasy language, which is a branch of the Malayo-Polynesian language group derived from the Barito languages, spoken in southern Borneo. The language is traditionally written using the sorabe script, and those who master this form of writing are called katibo and are considered to possess unusual power. Sorabe writings traditionally ranged from instructional texts for teaching astrology, to historical records and other forms of documentation, and materials written using the sorabe script were considered to be sacred. Economy Many Antemoro work as ombiasy and earn their livelihood selling their services as astrologers, sorcerers, or crafters of powerful amulets; it is common for men to travel for six to ten months out of the year. Coffee production is widespread in the Antemoro homeland and generates income for many families. Those who own little or no land often emigrate to work as agricultural laborers in the north and west. The Antemoro Ampanira clan was historically a main producer and trader of sea salt. The Antemoro are well known for their handmade paper, which is often decorated using pressed fresh flowers and leaves. Antemoro paper is a major product marketed to tourists. Notable Antemoro The first formal school in the Kingdom of Imerina was established and run from 1800 to 1804 by two Antemoro ombiasy, Andriamahazonoro and Ratsilikaina, who taught the future King Radama I and four or five other children to read using sorabe, trained them to manufacture ink and paper, and educated them in the art of astrology and divination. Andriamahazonoro was among the party of three who served as the first ambassadors to Britain and Mauritius; he died in 1838 from tangena poison administered in a trial by ordeal during the reign of Queen Ranavalona I.

On 1 March 1966, the Mizo National Front (MNF) made a declaration of independence, after launching coordinated attacks on the Government offices and security forces post in different parts of the Mizo district in Assam. The Government suppressed the uprising and recaptured all the places seized by the MNF by 25 March 1966. Counter-insurgency operations continued over the next few years, although the intensity of the rebellion diminished over time progressively till its complete resolution in the 1986 peace talks. During the Government operations to suppress the rebellion, the Indian Air Force carried out airstrikes in Aizawl; this remains the only instance of India carrying out an airstrike in its own civilian territory.  Background  Before the formation of the Mizoram state in 1987, the Mizo-dominated areas in India were a part of the Mizo district of the Assam state. The Mizo organisations, including the Mizo Union, had long complained of step-motherly treatment at the hands of the Assam Government, and demanded a separate state for the Mizos. Every 48 years, a cyclic ecological phenomenon called Mautam leads to widespread famine in this region. When such a famine started in 1959, the Mizos were left disappointed by the Assam Government's handling of the situation. The introduction of Assamese as the official language of the state in 1960, without any consideration for the Mizo language, led to further discontent and protests. The growing discontent with the Government ultimately resulted in a secessionist movement led by Mizo National Front (MNF), an organisation that had evolved out of a famine relief team. While the Mizo Union's demand was limited to a separate state for the Mizos within India, the MNF aimed at establishing a sovereign Christian nation for the Mizos.  MNF's plan for armed uprising  The extremist section within MNF advocated the use of violence to seek independence from India. A special armed wing called the Mizo National Army (MNA) was created for the purpose. The MNA consisted of eight infantry \\"battalions\\" organised on the pattern of the Indian army. One of the battalions was named after Joshua, while the rest were named after the legendary Mizo heroes: Chawngbawla, Khuangchera, Lalvunga, Saizahawla, Taitesena, Vanapa and Zampui Manga. The Lion Brigade (Chawngbawla, Khuangchera, Saizahawla and Taitesena battalions) operated in the northern half of the district, while the Dagger Brigade (Joshua, Lalvunga, Vanapa and Zampui Manga) operated in its southern half. MNA consisted of around 2000 men, supported by another group called the Mizo National Volunteers (MNV), which comprised an equal number of irregulars. In the early 1960s, the MNF leaders including Pu Laldenga visited East Pakistan (now Bangladesh), where the Government of Pakistan offered them supply of military hardware and training. Laldenga and his lieutenant Pu Lalnunmawia were arrested by the Government of Assam on the charge of conspiring against the nation, but were released in February 1964 after an undertaking of good conduct by Laldenga. However, shortly after their release, MNF intensified its secessionist activities. The MNF members forcibly collected donations from the Mizo people, recruited volunteers and trained them with arms supplied by Pakistan. By the end of 1965, the MNF weapon cache consisted of the plastic explosives stolen from the Border Roads Organisation, rifles and ammunition obtained from the 1st Battalion, Assam Rifles (1 AR) headquartered at Aizawl, crude bombs and Sten guns. The Indian armed forces, fresh from the Sino-Indian War of 1962 and the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, were focused on the Indo-Pakistan and Indo-China borders. The extremist MNF leaders wanted to take advantage of this situation by starting an armed rebellion to establish an independent Mizo nation. The rehabilitation of the pro-government Chakma refugees from East Pakistan in the Mizo district further instigated them. Accordingly, a plan (codenamed \\"Operation Jericho\\") was created to systematically capture the power in the Mizo district. The MNF aimed at taking over the treasuries and the petrol pumps, neutralising the police force and capturing all the important non-Mizo (\\"Vai\\") officials. The MNF flag was to be hoisted at Aizawl on 1 March 1966, followed by a victory parade on 2 March 1966. The MNF arsenal would be supplemented by capturing the armouries of 1 AR, the Border Security Force (BSF) and the local police. The MNF leaders had hoped that they would have a large number of sympathisers among the local police, the government officials and the AR, which would make the takeover peaceful. They also hoped that if they could keep their flag flying in Aizawl for 48 hours, other countries such as Pakistan would recognise the Mizo territory as a sovereign nation and take up their case in the United Nations. The volunteers and the sympathisers of MNF were promised a prosperous future in the proposed sovereign state. The plan was kept in strict secrecy. As a cover, the MNF leaders indulged in public propaganda advocating use of \\"non-violent means\\" to achieve independence for Mizos. The MNF commander Lt. Col. Laimana, who was suspected of being a government informant, was assassinated on 1 January 1966. On 27 February 1966, Pu Laldenga and some other MNF leaders decided that the armed insurrection would start on 1 March. The instructions were sent to launch simultaneous attacks on the posts of the 1st AR and the BSF. In case the attack failed, an alternate plan of concentrating near the Indo-Pak border was also made. The government authorities did get some indications of the upcoming armed action, but failed to anticipate its intensity. On the night of 27 February, Rokima, the brother of the MNF lieutenant Pu Lalnunmawia was killed in an apparently accidental blast, which was noticed by the AR personnel. All AR posts were alerted to keep a watch on the movements of MNF members.  Armed action by MNF  Mizoram was a part of the Assam state in the 1950s The security forces stationed in the Mizo Hills district included the 1st Battalion, Assam Rifles (1 AR) headquartered at Aizawl, the 5th Battalion, Border Security Force (5 BSF) and the local police. On the night of 28 February/1 March 1966, the MNF launched a series of simultaneous attacks on the 1 AR garrisons at Aizawl, Lunglei and Champhai and the 5 BSF posts at Chawngte, Demagiri, Hnahlan, Marpara, Tipaimukh, Tuipang, Tuipuibari, Vaphai and Vaseitlang.  Lunglei  The first attack by MNF began at about 10:30 pm IST on 28 February 1966, at the sub-treasury at Lunglei. A group 500‚Äì1000 strong attacked the camp of the security forces and the AR post. The attack was repulsed, leaving two AR personnel and a few MNF militants dead, and three more AR personnel wounded. The AR camp was surrounded and starved by the MNF militants for three days. The IAF Helicopter at last flew over the camp to supply the prior needs of Assam Rifles. On 5 March, the insurgents kidnapped R.V. Pillai, the Sub-divisional Officer. By 7 March, they had captured the AR post as well as the Border Roads Task Force camp at Lunglei.  Aizawl  The MNF insurgents entered Aizawl on the night of 28 February 1966. The same day, the Mizo district administration came across the copies of the two-page declaration of independence distributed among the MNF leaders. Since the insurgents had cut all the telephone lines, the local authorities could not seek immediate help from Shillong or Silchar. Later, the commanding officer of the Border Roads Organisation managed to send a wireless message to Silchar. At 02:00 IST, on 1 March 1966, the insurgents attacked the telephone exchange at Aizawl. An hour later, around 150 insurgents led by Pu Lalnundawta, attacked the Aizawl District Treasury and looted money, arms and .303 ammunition. Within a few hours, the insurgents took control of all the important centres of the Mizo district, paralysing the civil administration. They also seized all the vehicles in the town. The law and order situation went beyond the control of the local Police and the small units of AR posted in the district. T S Gill, the Deputy Commissioner of the Mizo district, took shelter in the AR headquarters. The insurgents attacked the 1 AR headquarters in Aizawl unsuccessfully. They also attacked the AR post at Chhimluang on the Aizawl-Silchar road, but were repulsed by the Riflemen. To stop any reinforcements from Silchar, they created several roadblocks and damaged the only bridge on the road. Around this time, several MNF leaders had gathered in Aizawl on the pretext of a General Assembly. A few of the MNF leaders strongly opposed the violence, and asked Laldenga to withdraw his orders for an armed action. However, it was too late to discontinue the operation, as the rebels had already attacked multiple places including Lunglei, Champhai and Demagiri. On 1 March, Laldenga made a declaration of independence, and exhorted all the Mizos to join the revolt against the \\"illegal Indian occupation\\" of the Mizo territory. On 2 March, the insurgents ambushed a patrol of 1 AR, and inflicted heavy casualties on them. After 1 AR at Aizawl refused to surrender, the MNF suicide squad launched an attack on them at 9:00 on 4 March. They lost 13 men in a counter-attack by the Assam Rifles soldiers. Two helicopters with reserves, ammunition and water sent by the Government to help the Riflemen could not land due to constant firing by the insurgents. Some of the air drops meant for the riflemen fell into the hands of MNF members. The same day, the insurgents released all the prisoners from the Aizawl jail, who looted the shops of the non-Mizos (\\"Vai\\"s), and also burned several huts in the Aizawl bazaar. Due to the AR's refusal to surrender, the victory parade proposed to be held on 2 March was postponed to 10 March. On 5 March, the insurgents led by Pu Hruaia plundered the Public Works Department office in Aizawl, looting items for the \\"Mizoram Sawrkar\\" (\\"Mizoram Government\\") Office. On 11 March, the insurgents burned the houses of the senior officials of the Mizo Union.  Other places  At about 01:30 IST on 1 March 1966, around 150 insurgents armed with lathis surrounded the sub-divisional officer of the Public Works Department at Vairengte and asked him to get out of the district. They also took over the departmental stores and the jeep. Similar incidents were reported from Coinluang and Chawngte. On the same day, the insurgents easily captured the AR post at Champhai, with help from their sympathisers in the security forces. At Kolasib, the insurgents took around 250 civil officials, the policemen, the intelligence personnel and the road builders as captives, and kept them without food and water. The women and children were also taken as captives and kept separately in a small building. None of the civilian officials and government servants were hurt, as MNF expected their support in running the administration of the proposed sovereign state.  Government response  According to a statement made by the Chief Minister of Assam Bimala Prasad Chaliha, on 1 March, the insurgents who attacked the Aizawl treasury and Lunglei numbered around 10,000. The Indian Home Minister Gulzari Lal Nanda, in the Indian parliament on 3 March, stated the total number of rebels in Aizawl, Lunglei, Vairengte, Chawngte and Chhimluang as 800‚Äì1300. On 2 March 1966, the Government of Assam invoked the Assam Disturbed Areas Act, 1955 and the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, 1958, proclaiming the entire Mizo district as \\"disturbed\\". Bimala Prasad Chaliha condemned Laldenga for his \\"betrayal\\", while Gulzari Lal Nanda promised \\"stern action\\" with \\"all the force\\" at the Government's command. A 24-hour curfew was imposed in Aizawl on 3 March, and reinforcements were sent for 1 AR by helicopters.  Airstrikes  The IAF was asked to carry the troops in Mi-4 helicopters into the besieged AR camp, accompanied with fighter escorts, but failed due to heavy and accurate fire by the insurgents. The Toofani fighters of 29 Squadron operating from Kumbhirgram and Hunter fighters of 17 Squadron operating from Jorhat undertook independent missions to escort the troop reinforcements and to suppress the insurgents. Later, when the GOC Eastern Command, Lt. Gen. Sam Manekshaw, flew over parts of Mizoram in 1968, his helicopter was fired at by the insurgents. On the afternoon of 4 March 1966, the IAF jet fighters strafed the MNF targets in Aizawl using machine guns, allegedly causing few civilian casualties. The next day, a more extensive airstrike was carried out for about five hours. According to some Mizos, the planes used incendiary bombs, resulting in fires that destroyed several houses in the Dawrpui and Chhinga Veng areas. According to some other accounts, the houses were destroyed in the fires started by the prisoners released from the Aizawl jail by the insurgents. Apart from Aizawl, the neighbouring villages of Tualbung and Hnahlan were also allegedly bombarded. Most of the civilian population fled Aizawl, and took refuge in the remote villages in the adjacent hills. In the history of independent India, this remains the only instance of the Government of India resorting to air strikes in its own territory. Locals claim that Rajesh Pilot and Suresh Kalmadi were among the IAF pilots who dropped the bombs. Pu Zoramthanga, who went on to become the Chief Minister of Mizoram in 1998, once said that the main reason he joined the MNF and became a rebel was the \\"relentless bombing of Aizawl in 1966\\". The people of Mizoram now observe Zoram Ni (\\"Zoram Day\\") to commemorate the air raids.  Ground operations  The operations were overseen by HQ Eastern Command under Lt. Gen. Sam Manekshaw. The local responsibility for the army operations was given to 101 Communication Zone under Maj. Gen. Sagat Singh. 311 (Independent) Infantry Brigade was located at that point of time in Silchar. An additional formation, 61 Mountain Brigade (under Brig. R.Z. Kabraji) was moved from Agartala to Aizawl. Subsequently, a regular division, HQ 57 Mountain Division was raised at Masimpur, near Silchar which oversaw counter-insurgency operations in Mizoram in the later stages. The leading battalion of 61 Mountain Brigade, the 8th battalion, Sikh Regiment (8 Sikh) advanced from Silchar into the disturbed area on 3 March. The forces could reach Aizawl only on 6 March, due to the roadblocks caused by the militants.. On 7 March, they relieved the besieged AR garrison at Aizawl. On 8 March, the 2nd battalion, 11 Gorkha Rifles (2/11 GR) moved towards Champhai and the 3rd battalion, Bihar Regiment (3 Bihar) towards Lunglei. By 15 March, all of 61 Brigade with its four battalions and supporting arms and services had moved into Mizoram and by the end of the month had regained control of Mizoram.  Withdrawal of MNF forces  The insurgents had managed to capture all the posts of 1 AR except their headquarters at Aizawl. Their chances of capturing the AR headquarters were low after the IAF airstrikes. When the MNF leaders heard about the likely arrival of the Indian Army in Aizawl on 7 March, they decided to retreat to Lunglei, which was under the MNF control. The security forces threatened to bomb Lunglei, but two Christian clergymen ‚Äì H. S. Luaia and Pastor C.L. Hminga ‚Äì requested them to avoid it in order to prevent loss of civilian lives. The two also persuaded the MNF not to attack the army. After some resistance, the MNF rebels withdrew from Lunglei on 13 March, taking away some arms, ammunition and vehicles with them. The security forces secured Lunglei on 14 March, and Champhai on 15 March. The 5th battalion, Parachute Regiment (5 Para), was flown in by helicopters to Lunglei on 14‚Äì15 March, set out for Demagiri and secured it on 17 March. By the 25th, all the important towns and the posts had been freed from the MNF control. By the end of March 1966, the Indian security forces had captured 467 muzzle loading guns, 332 shotguns, 175 rifles, 57 pistols/revolvers and about 70,000 rounds of ammunition from MNF. However, MNF had also managed to obtain a large amount of ammunition from the captured security forces posts. Its weapon cache consisted of: around 1500 shotguns, 600 rifles (mostly .303 bore), 75 sten-guns, 30 revolvers/pistols, 25 carbines and 20 light machine guns. The MNA headquarters, originally located in Aizawl was moved multiple times during the conflict: first to South Hlimen (on 3 March), then to Reiek (on 18 March) and finally to the Chittagong Hill Tracts in East Pakistan.  Insurgency  The Mizo Union leaders blamed the MNF for the loss of civilian life, and condemned the armed insurrection. The MNF accused the Indian Government of \\"indiscriminate bombing on civilian population\\" during the airstrikes in Aizawl. Two MLAs of the Assam state, Stanley DD Nichols Roy and Hoover H Hynniewta, visited the Mizo district to take a stock of the situation. Later in April, Roy moved a motion in the Assam Legislative Assembly on the Aizawl air attack, calling the use of air force \\"excessive\\". By the end of 1966, reinforcements were sent to the district by the Government in form of: * two Indian Army battalions ** 18th battalion, Punjab Regiment (18 Punjab) ** 9th battalion, Bihar Regiment (9 Bihar) * three Assam Rifles battalions (6th, 18th and 19th) * four armed police battalions of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) The MNF insurgents dispersed in smaller units, merged with the local population and continued to carry out armed attacks against the security forces in the district. The villagers suffered from both sides as the insurgents would kill those resisting their entry into the villages while the villages suffered reprisals from the security forces in case ambushes had taken place in their vicinity. The Mizo National Front was outlawed in 1967. The same year, the Counterinsurgency and Jungle Warfare School was set up at Vairengte to train the soldiers in fighting with the rebels in the North-East India. As the insurgents found security and refuge in the large number of tiny hamlets from which they would launch attacks on the patrols of the security forces and later merge into the civilian population, the military need was felt to deny the militants access to the common people. To solve the problem, the Government of India resorted to a \\"grouping\\" policy in the Mizo district, starting in January 1967. Under the grouping policy, nearly 80% of the rural population was shifted from their villages and resettled along the highways. The old villages were burnt, and the new settlements were kept under the control of the security forces until 1970. The Indian Army got greater freedom of action and succeeded in isolating the insurgents from the people and cutting the insurgents' supply chain. This grouping of villages resulted in a great deal of suffering for the indigenous populace as their farms and houses were burnt and they could not have enough farmland while being interred into these camps. Farming output went down a cliff and people had to face near-famine conditions.Grouping of Villages in Mizoram: Its Social and Economic Impact by C. Nunthara. Economic and Political Weekly, Vol. 16, No. 30 (Jul. 25, 1981), pp. 1237+1239-1240. This grouping has also been said to be the beginning of social evils in Mizoram. The villagers were forced to move to these camps and agreement papers were often signed at gunpoint. While insurgency continued at lower levels, the space for political negotiations was created and led to Mizoram becoming a Union Territory and the entry of the MNF into mainstream politics. In August 1968, the Government of India offered amnesty to the insurgents, which resulted in the surrender of 1524 MNF members. This was followed by more amnesty offers during 1969‚Äì70. Later, the Mizo Union's negotiations with the Union Government resulted in the Mizo district gaining the status of a Union Territory as \\"Mizoram\\" on 21 January 1972. MNF's secessionist movement came to an end in 1986, when it signed the Mizo accord with the Government of India.

In Scotland, the Enterprise Trust model was originally established in the early 1980s in an environment when the Scottish economy was undergoing significant change. Traditional industries such as coal mining, steel, shipbuilding and heavy engineering were all in decline. This period of economic transition impacted significantly on communities across Scotland and in response, enterprise trusts were established as locally led initiatives to support the regeneration of these communities through focusing on small businesses. Trusts have as their core activity the goal of encouraging and supporting entrepreneurial activity, helping to create successful new businesses and supporting the development and growth of small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) generally employing up to 25 people. The involvement of the private sector on trust boards was a new concept at the time and designed to provide a mix of knowledge and experience in the design and operation of business support programmes.http://www.bes.org.uk/ It has been recognised that SME's are an engine of innovation in the new economy and they are; * the biggest creators of new jobs * better at moving people into employment from unemployment * employ more disabled people, females and older people * offer more flexible employment * treat people more fairlyhttp://www.scottish.parliament.uk/s3/committees/eet/inquiries/Enterprise%20agency%201/44.%20EARI%20Business%20Enterprise%20Scotland%202.pdf By the end of the 1990s there were over 40 trusts operating across Scotland all delivering a range of business creation and support contracts in their respective local areas. However, from 2000 onwards there was a gradual consolidation in the sector with many smaller trusts merging to form more regionally based operations. At the same time, some trusts moved away from business support and development contracts and into other complementary business areas, although still retaining their core ethos of support to new business creation and development. Scottish Liberal Democrat deputy head Jo Swinson has praised the benefits of such Scottish Enterprises as East Dunbartonshire for the assistance they have provided in fostering local businesses. Regeneration throughout Scotland has also been further assisted by agencies such as the Scottish Government export agency Scottish Development International (SDI), run by the Scottish government, Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise who have helped 900 Scottish businesses to internationalise.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-11189745 The Enterprise Trusts are run as not-for-profit organisations with any surpluses generated re-invested in the provision of services for the benefit of customers.

Despite its origin, Otjin is similar to african mancalas such as Ba-awa (Ghana) and quite different from most Asian mancalas. Rules The Otjin board comprises two rows of 10 holes each. Each player owns a row of holes. At game setup, each of smaller holes holds an equal number of seeds, usually 3 (but 2 to 5 are admissible). At his or her turn, the player takes all the seeds from one of his holes and relay sows them counterclockwise. If the last seed is sown in a hole such that, after sowing, the number of seeds in the hole is equal to the number of seeds per hole at the beginning of the game (e.g., 3), the player captures those seeds and removes them from the game. Capture is traditionally called \\"fishing\\". When one of the players cannot play anymore, his or her opponent captures all the seeds that are left on the board, and the game ends.

Church of Saint Paul  Tarsus and the churches  Interior of the church during the celebration of a mass Tarsus, in the Cilicia of the antiquity, in what is now southern Turkey, was an important city during both ancient and medieval ages. The tombs of Daniel of the Bible, and the caliph Al-Ma'mun (786‚Äì833), are both in Tarsus. Saint Paul was a resident of Tarsus. He was born and lived in Tarsus as a Jew named Saul and, after converting, made a number of missionary journeys ending in his arrest and beheading by the Roman Emperor Nero in AD 64 or 67 on the 29th of June. After Paul's death, Tarsus continued as an important city of the area. It became part of the Byzantine Empire, the Abbasid Empire, the Seljuk Empire, the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia, the Ramadanids and the Ottoman Empire. It is not known if there were any churches established by Paul in Tarsus, but in 1704, P. Lucas wrote that there was a Romanesque church which had been built by Paul. V. Langlois visited Tarsus in 1851 and confirmed this. In his words, thick walls that resembled the Roman style, windows that are narrower outside than inside, and thick columns are noticeable, but no other records exist to substantiate this claim. Medieval Mersin's most important Christian sanctuary was the Armenian cathedral of Hagia Sophia in which Leon I of the House of Rubenid was crowned by Konrad Von Wittelsbach, the Archbishop of Mainz and the representative of Pope, as the king of the Cilician Kingdom of Armenia in 1198.

It is very close to the Oware game that spread to the Americas with the atlantic slave trade. Among modern mancalas, which are most often derived from Warri, the Kalah is a notable one that has essentially the same rules as Ayoayo. There are games with identical rules also in other areas of Africa. One such game is the Endodoi, played by the Maasai people of Kenya and Tanzania. Rules The Ayoayo board is composed of two rows of six holes each, and 48 seeds are used; at the beginning, 4 seeds are placed in each hole. These are exactly the same equipment and setup as those of Warri and many other 2-row mancalas such as Layli Goobalay. Each player owns one of the rows. At his or her turn, the player takes all seeds from one of his holes and relay sows them counterclockwise; during each individual sowing, the starting hole is skipped (i.e., no seeds are dropped there even if more than 12 seeds are to be sown). When the last seed is sown in an empty hole, and if this hole belongs to the player in turn, he or she will capture any seed in the opposing hole. When one of the players cannot move anymore, the game is over. The opponent captures all the seeds that are left on the board and the winner is the player who captured most seeds. If a player ends his or her turn with no seeds left in his or her row, the opponent must (if it is possible) choose his move in such a way to bring one or more seeds into the other's row.

The line was built by the Ruhrort-Crefeld District Gladbach Railway Company (, RCG), founded in 1847, and is one of the oldest lines in Germany, opened in 1849 and 1851. The greater part of the route, along with the western section of the Ruhr line of the Rhenish Railway Company (Rheinische Eisenbahn- Gesellschaft, RhE), forms the Duisburg‚ÄìM√∂nchengladbach line, one of the main line in Germany‚Äôs lower Rhine region, connecting the stations of Duisburg and M√∂nchengladbach. History  The Ruhrort-Crefeld District Gladbach railway was established to bring coal mined in the Ruhr district to consumers in the Lower Rhine region. The RCG therefore concluded a contract with the Cologne- Minden Railway Company (CME), which at that time was the only railway company then operating in the northern Ruhr area. The CME built a branch from Oberhausen to Ruhrort from its trunk line, which was opened on 14 October 1848. The RCG began construction of its line to a point located exactly opposite Ruhrort on the bank of the Rhine in Homberg, now part of the city of Duisburg. The Ruhrort‚ÄìHomberg train ferry commenced services to Ruhrort station on the east bank of the Rhine on 12 November 1852, carrying carriages and freight wagons over the river. On 15 October 1849, the line was opened from Homberg to Viersen via Trompet, Kaldenhausen, Uerdingen and Crefeld. the final leg to Gladbach (now M√∂nchengladbach) was completed two years later to the day, on 15 October 1851. In 1853 railway lines were opened to Aachen and to D√ºsseldorf by the Aachen-Neu√ü-D√ºsseldorf Railway Company (Aachen-Neu√ü- D√ºsseldorfer Eisenbahngesellschaft, AND). On 1 April 1850, even before it had completed its line, the RCG, together with the AND, was nationalised by the Prussian government and became part of the Royal Directorate of the Aachen- D√ºsseldorf-Ruhrort Railway Company (K√∂nigliche Direction der Aachen- D√ºsseldorf-Ruhrorter Eisenbahn). On 1 January 1866 this company was taken over by the Bergisch-M√§rkische Railway Company (BME), which was also mostly state- owned. The BME opened a line in 1862 from M√ºlheim-Styrum station on its Witten/Dortmund‚ÄìOberhausen/Duisburg line to Duisburg-Ruhrort and remarked the distances along its track in kilometres from Aachen RHE station (km 0.0) to Dortmund (km 164.3). Partial closure  In 1873 the RhE replaced its original Rheinhausen‚ÄìHochfeld train ferry by the Duisburg-Hochfeld rail bridge. Subsequently the Ruhrort‚ÄìHomberg ferry quickly lost traffic. In consequence, the line between Duisburg-Homberg and Hohenbudberg became increasingly unimportant. The Ruhrort‚ÄìHomberg ferry closed on 19 May 1907. The railway line between Homberg and Trompet was damaged in the Second World War and not returned to service. Today, the only traffic north of Trompet is to the siding of the Sachtleben Chemie company. The opening of the Lower Rhine line in 1904 established a connection between Rheinhausen and Trompet (continuing via Moers to Kleve), which proved to be more profitable, especially as it included a direct rail link to the Hohenbudberg marshalling yard. The original line between Trompet and Uerdingen was eventually closed for passenger on 30 September 1961; the closure of freight traffic followed a day later, on 1 October 1961. Realignment in Viersen  In 1917 the current track in the Viersen area was laid. Originally the line ran from the location of the modern Viersen-Helenabrunn station initially parallel to the line that is now the M√∂nchengladbach freight bypass (originally opened in 1909) and then running directly between Helenabrunn and Heimer (now suburbs of Viersen) to Viersen BME station. Helenabrunn station was in the higher part of Helenabrunn and Heimer. The line was moved further north, where it connected with the Neuss‚ÄìViersen line, which was originally built by the Rhenish Railway Company (Rheinische Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft, RhE), to run to Viersen RhE station (now Viersen station). After the realignment, the BME station was abandoned and demolished. As a replacement for the Helenabrunn station, Viersen-Helenabrunn station (originally Helenabrunn) was built in Neuwerker Stra√üe on the outskirts of modern M√∂nchengladbach. Current situation  Although the first section of the line from Homberg to Hohenbudberg no longer exists, the greater part of the line is still in operation. Together with the western part of the Osterath‚ÄìDortmund S√ºd line of the former Rhenish Railway Company and its branch line from Duisburg RHE station‚Äînow part of Duisburg Hauptbahnhof‚Äîit has developed into a major regional route. The main line from Duisburg Hauptbahnhof via Duisburg-Hochfeld S√ºd and Hohenbudberg to M√∂nchengladbach Hbf is now consistently double track and electrified. Lack of modernisation prevents more intensive use of the line; between Duisburg Hauptbahnhof and Rheinhausen only four trains per hour can operate, one of which continues towards Moers and Xanten on the Lower Rhine line. Furthermore, the line‚Äôs tracks cross the tracks of the Lower Left Rhine line on the level in the vicinity of Krefeld station. There is a similar crossing on the level with the M√∂nchengladbach‚ÄìD√ºsseldorf line near M√∂nchengladbach station. Rail services  The line is served every hour by a Regional-Express service, the Niers-Haard-Express (RE 42), connecting M√∂nchengladbach and the Lower Rhine to the western and central Ruhr area and M√ºnster. Only slightly slower are two Regionalbahn services, the Rhein-Niers-Bahn (RB 33) and the Emscher- Niederrhein-Bahn (RB 35), each running hourly, with alternating routings, one connecting Aachen, M√∂nchengladbach and Duisburg and the other connecting M√∂nchengladbach, Duisburg and Wesel (from 2018, it will continue to Bottrop rather than Wesel). Fares  Fares for the entire route are set by the Rhine-Ruhr public transport association (Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Ruhr, VRR).

He was first elected to Birmingham City Council in 1922, and remained a councillor for over two decades, becoming Lord Mayor of Birmingham in 1936, when he was made an alderman. He chaired the council's Public Health Committee from 1936 to 1930, and the Salaries, Wages and Labour Committee from 1941 to 1943. During his time as mayor he launched the final appeal for the city's Queen Elizabeth Hospital, which raised the ¬£250,000 needed to allow construction to be completed. He was also a life governor of the University of Birmingham.  Parliament  At the 1945 general election, Roberts was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for the Handsworth division of Birmingham. He stood as a Unionist, rather than as a Conservative; the Liberal Unionist tradition lingered in Birmingham long after the 1912 merger of the two parties, with memories of Joseph Chamberlain still strong. Handsworth was a safe seat for the Unionists, who had held it since 1886. The sitting Unionist MP, Oliver Locker-Lampson, had not been re-selected by his local party, and planned to stand as an Independent Conservative, but was offered a post overseas and did not contest the seat. Even without Locker- Lampson, the seat was contested by five candidates. In addition to the Unionist, Liberal, and Labour parties, there was a Communist Party candidate, and another former Lord Mayor, former Unionist Noel Tiptaft, stood as a \\"National Independent\\". Tiptaft proclaimed himself as supporter of the Prime Minister Winston Churchill, prompting Churchill to send a telegram to Alderman Roberts denying that Tiptaft was a supporter of his. Labour took ten of Birmingham's 13 seats, having won none in 1935, but Handsworth was one of the three Birmingham seats retained by the Conservatives. However Roberts's majority was only 3.6% of the votes, compared with the 46% won by Locker- Lampson in a two-way contest in 1935. Roberts was re-elected in 1950, with an increased majority of 5,472 (i.e. 11.4% of the votes). He died at his home in Rednal, Worcestershire on 28 September 1950, aged 66. His death triggered a by-election in his Handsworth constituency, which was held in November that year. The 27-year-old baronet Sir Edward Boyle held the seat for the Conservatives, with an increased majority.  Family  In January 1913, Roberts married Ann Pettifor, the daughter of George Pettifor from Anstey in Leicestershire. She survived him, with one son.

Life  Goldstein was born to Hungarian-Jewish parents in 1947 in Cluj, Romania. In 1958 he emigrated to Israel. From 1966 until 1969 he studied art at Bezalel Academy of Art and Design in Jerusalem, continuing his studies from 1969 until 1972 at the department of sculpture at Accademia di Belle Arti di Brera in Milan. Following his studies he worked in Italy and travelled widely in Europe and the United States until 1978 when his new artistic strategy took him back to Jerusalem. Since 1981 Goldstein acts as lecturer and later professor at Bezalel Academy of Art and Design in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. In the 1990s a number of carefully prepared travels took him to particular places in Greece, Turkey, Asia and mainly in Africa, following a quest for cultures and sites still under a strong non-Western and hermetical tradition. During the 1970s Goldstein worked within the tradition of conceptual art using photography, film, audio recordings, performance, objects, and not at least text as his media exploring perceptional, social and political phenomena. Discontented with the Post-Modern discourse in the West, in 1978 he decided to choose Jerusalem as a place on the edge between Orient and Occident and made it the geographical as well as conceptual base for his art. At the same time he turned to object-related sculpture based on a kind of open constructivist approach. In the 2000s Goldstein gave his work a new and additional dimension by two books, which are not written in his mother tongue(s) but in a particular kind of English, both readable and idiosyncratic, to fit into the dominant language of global communication. In On Paper (Cologne 2004) stories and reflections on subjects like autobiography, gardening, philosophy, war, art theory, or lifestyle blend into an impressive picture of his position between different cultures. The book was followed by a long poem titled Room 205 (Cologne 2010) which describes the musings and hallucinations during a one-minute open-eye recall.

The growing recognition and use of Indigenous education methods can be a response to the erosion and loss of Indigenous knowledge through the processes of colonialism, globalization, and modernity. Indigenous communities are able to \\"reclaim and revalue their languages and [traditions], and in so doing, improve the educational success of Indigenous students\\", thus ensuring their survival as a culture. Principal Sha (also 6th grade teacher) of the Yangjuan Primary School in Yanyuan County, Sichuan looks over his student's essays about the schoolyard. Increasingly, there has been a global shift toward recognizing and understanding Indigenous models of education as a viable and legitimate form of education. There are many different educational systems throughout the world, some that are more predominant and widely accepted. However, members of Indigenous communities celebrate diversity in learning and see this global support for teaching traditional forms of knowledge as a success. Indigenous ways of knowing, learning, instructing, teaching, and training have been viewed by many postmodern scholars as important for ensuring that students and teachers, whether Indigenous or non-Indigenous, are able to benefit from education in a culturally sensitive manner that draws upon, utilizes, promotes, and enhances awareness of Indigenous traditions, beyond the standard Western curriculum of reading, writing, and arithmetic. Robinson Akhenoba(2019) Cultural context of Indigenous learning in the Americas A growing body of scientific literature has described Indigenous ways of learning, in different cultures and countries. Learning in Indigenous communities is a process that involves all members in the community. The learning styles that children use in their Indigenous schooling are the same ones that occur in their community context. These Indigenous learning styles often include: observation, imitation, use of narrative/storytelling, collaboration, and cooperation, as seen among American Indian, Alaska Native and Latin American communities. This is a hands on approach that emphasizes direct experience and learning through inclusion.The child feels that they are a vital member of the community, and they are encouraged to participate in a meaningful way by community members. Children often effectively learn skills through this system, without being taught explicitly or in a formal manner. This differs from Western learning styles, which tend to include methods such as explicit instruction in which a figure of authority directs the learner's attention, and testing/ quizzing. Creating an educational environment for Indigenous children that is consistent with upbringing, rather than an education that follows a traditionally Western format, allows for a child to retain knowledge more easily, because they are learning in a way that was encouraged from infancy within their family and community. Robinson, further said that traditional Western methods of education generally disregard the importance Indigenous cultures and environmental contributions, which results in a lack of relevance for students of aboriginal backgrounds. Modern schools have a tendency to teach skills stripped of context which has a detrimental impact on Indigenous students because they thrive off educational environments in which their cultures and languages are respected and infused in learning. Various aspects of Indigenous culture need to be considered when discussing Indigenous learning, such as: content (how culture is portrayed in text and through language), social culture/ interactions (relations between class interactions and interactions within Indigenous communities), and cognitive culture (differences in worldview, spiritual understandings, practical knowledge, etc.). Classroom structure According to Akhenoba Robinson(2019), The structure of Indigenous American classrooms that reflect the organization of Indigenous communities eliminates the distinction between the community and classroom and makes it easier for the students to relate to the material. Effective classrooms modeled off of the social structure of Indigenous communities are typically focused on group or cooperative learning that provide an inclusive environment. Between traditional Aboriginal education and the western system of education. A key factor for successful Indigenous education practices is the student-teacher relationship. Classrooms are socially constructed in a way that the teacher shares the control of the classroom with the students. Rather than taking an authoritative role, the teacher is viewed as a co-learner to the students, and they maintain a balance between personal warmth and demand for academic achievement.community in Mexico, teachers have been observed to let their students move freely about the classroom while working in order to consult with other students, as well as using their instructors for occasional guidance. Teachers in Indigenous classrooms in a community in Alaska rely on group work, encourage the students to watch each other as a way to learn, and avoid singling out students for praise, criticism, or recitation. Praise, by Western standards, is minimal in Indigenous classrooms, and when it is given it is for effort, not for providing a correct answer to a question. Classroom discourse in Indigenous classrooms is an example of how the teacher shares control with the students. Observations in the Yup'ik and Mazahua communities show that Indigenous teachers are less likely to solicit an answer from an individual student, but rather encourage all of the students to participate in classroom discourse. In the Yup'ik classroom direct questions are posed to the group as whole, and the control of talk is not the sole responsibility of the teacher. Classrooms in Indigenous communities that incorporate Indigenous ways of learning utilize open-ended questioning, inductive/analytical reasoning, and student participation and verbalization, in group settings. Escuela Unitaria (one- room one-teacher) Robinson A.(2019)he opined that, Escuela Unitaria is a one-room one-teacher style of schooling that is used in some rural communities, which utilizes ways of learning common in some Indigenous or Indigenous-heritage communities in the Americas. The school serves up to six grades in a single classroom setting with smaller groups (divided by grade level) in the classroom. Community involvement is strongly implemented in the management of the school. Learning activities are not just inside the classroom but also outside in the agricultural environment. Children are self- instructed and the content involves the students' rural community and family participation. The school is structured to meet cultural needs and match available resources. This classroom setting allows for a collaborative learning environment that includes the teacher, the students, and the community. Integration of cultural knowledge within the curriculum allows students to participate actively and to have a say in the responsibilities for classroom activities. Spirituality Indigenous students make meaning of what they learn through spirituality. Spirituality in learning involves students making connections between morals, values and intellect rather than simply acquiring knowledge. Knowledge to Indigenous people is personal and involves emotions, culture, traditional skills, nature, etc. For this reason, Indigenous students need time to make connections in class, and often benefit from a safe and respectful environment that encourages discussions among students. Gilliard and Moore (2007) presented the experiences of eight Native American educators, focusing on the impact of having family and community culture included in the curriculum. Typically, tribal K-12 schools on the reservation have majority European American teachers. This study differs in that sense by studying educators who are all of Native American background and their interactions with students and families. These educators reported that their interactions with families stem from respect and understanding. There were three categories that surfaced when understanding and defining culture; (1) respect of children, families, and community, (2) building a sense of belonging and community through ritual, and (3) the importance of family values and beliefs. # Respect of children, families, and community; educators approached interactions in a reflective and respectful way when talking with children, families, and the community. Educators accepted practices concerning death in individual families. Educators made it a point to be aware of curricular activities that may offend certain tribes. Lastly, educators spoke in a soft, quiet, and gentle way to the children. # Building a sense of belongingness and community through ritual; specific to the tribe on Flathead Reservation, powwows are a community ritual that bring together families and community. Educators worked with families and their children to make moccasins, ribbon shirts and dresses, and shawls prior to the powwow, and included elements of a powwow into their classroom. For example, they keep a drum in the classroom to use for drumming, singing, and dancing. # Importance of family values and beliefs; educators give the opportunity to parent's to be involved in the day-to-day activities in and around the classroom. Such as, meal times, play time, holidays, and celebrations. Educators collaborate with parents regarding curriculum around holidays and cultural celebrations, reinforced importance of speaking their tribal languages, and clarified with parents what their home language is, and had respectful discussions around traditional values and beliefs that led to compromise, not isolation or separation. The educators in this study worked on a daily basis to respect, plan, and learn about parent beliefs and values so they can create a community culture linked to school curriculum. Similar to the previous study mentioned, Vaughn (2016) conducted a multiple case study of four Native American teachers and two European American teachers at Lakeland Elementary. The participants were asked to draw from influences, relationships, and resources of the local tribe, local and state practices, and knowledge of effective pedagogies to co- construct knowledge. At the time this study was conducted, Lakeland Elementary was failing to meet No Child Left Behind's yearly progress in reading. State officials would come to observe teachers, unannounced, to make sure they were teaching the mandated literacy curriculum. This required the teachers to follow the literacy program, even though the curriculum seldom met the individual and specific linguistic and cultural needs of the majority of Native American students at the school. So the researcher focused on two questions. The first one being, ‚ÄúIn what ways did these teachers approach developing a curriculum to support their students‚Äô social, cultural, and linguistic needs?‚Äù One theme that came up was ‚Äúpedagogical re-envisioning‚Äù, which are pedagogies and understandings of culturally responsive teaching to address writing and understand that each student has individual needs. With understanding this, teachers are able to give students the opportunity to include oral storytelling so students have their own personal twist on their learning. The second question was ‚ÄúWhat shifts in teachers‚Äô pedagogical practices resulted from this collaboration?\\" Four themes came up; cultural resources, working with community, multimodal approaches, and integrating students‚Äô experiences and interests from their lives outside of school into the curriculum. By addressing these four themes, teachers were able to re- envision how curriculum can meet individual needs for many Native American students without leaving out their interests, culture, or resources. Holistic approach to learning Holistic education focuses on the \\"whole picture\\" and how concepts and ideas are interrelated, then analyzes and makes meaning of certain ideas. This form of education is beneficial for all students, especially Indigenous students. Traditionally, Indigenous forms of learning were/are holistic in nature, focusing on interconnections with context (especially culture, nature, and experiences). According to a study by Stevenson et al. (2014), challenges that arise with using technology consistently can stem from a weak relationship between spending time outdoors and environmental knowledge and behavior in middle school aged students in North Carolina. This weak relationship may be due to a change in relationship between children and nature. Instead of children having a natural interaction with nature, outdoor activities are based on organized sport or technology. Middle school aged Native American students reported higher levels of environmental behavior than Caucasian students, urging environmental education professionals to continue to close achievement gaps in classrooms. Environmental education professionals continue to ensure that the same factors creating inequity don't affect environmental knowledge. Along with creating a classroom that strives to include environmental knowledge, promoting outdoor activities, and direct interaction with nature gives a chance for Native American students to voice their knowledge to the teacher, and to their peers. Another form of holistic approach to learning includes parental and community advocacy. As reported by Pedro (2015), parents of students expressed concern that the high school their children attended neglected their children's voices, knowledge, and perspectives in the school. The school districts diversity specialist sought advice to construct a curriculum that would validate, teach, and support the perspective of Native American peoples of the Southwest United States. This team constructed a curriculum based on three ideas; (1) Native American students are harmed when their curriculum is void of knowledge that reflect their identity, culture, and heritage, (2) students who are not Native American are harmed as they learn about narrowed and historicized depictions of Indigenous peoples of the United States, and (3) teaching knowledge from a variety of perspectives should be fundamental to any learning environment. Pedro suggested, with the foundation of parents‚Äô values, that students are able to engage in conversation, in their mind, through critical dialogic listening in silence. Just because students weren't engaging verbally in the discussion, didn't mean students weren't receptive to the points being made by other students who were verbally engaged. Students can share their beliefs and identities through meta-conversations in connection with the voiced realities between other students. After hearing different sides of other students‚Äô stories, they were able to construct their own identities and understandings into the debate, silently. To validate the silence, the teacher in this instance, writes down quotes and questions students had asked in small and whole group conversations. At the end of each unit, the teacher would use these quotes and questions to ask students to reflect upon their writings, using notes they took and readings/handouts given to them. Through this option, students were able to contribute their identities, knowledge, and understandings into the classroom space. This process was called Literacy Events, in which students were given the opportunity to absorb and make sense of different perspectives and ideas from verbal discussions in class and readings. Silence helped the students relate internally, and through writing, their perspectives became known. Essentially, in the end, their stories were in their minds and contributing to the conversation as they chose whose ideas to accept and reject or a combination of both. Parents advocated for their children, so next time a student chooses silence, it might not mean that they are disengaged or uninterested. Instead, give them another avenue to express their thoughts. Indigenous American ways of learning Indigenous education involves oral traditions (such as listening, watching, imitating), group work, apprenticeship, and high levels of cultural context. Additionally, knowledge to Indigenous people is sacred, centers on the idea that each student constructs knowledge individually, and is rooted in experience and culture. Learning is believed to be life-long and involves a unique sense of self-identity and passion, as well as focuses on the importance of community survival and contributions to life and community sustainability. The Indigenous ways of learning occur when diverse perspectives are interconnected through spiritual, holistic, experiential and transformative methods. The optimal learning environment for Indigenous students incorporates: the land (and traditional skills), Indigenous languages, traditions, cultures, people (self, family, elders, and community), and spirituality. Active participation In many Indigenous communities of the Americas, children often begin to learn through their eagerness to be active participants in their communities. Through this, children feel incorporated as valued members when given the opportunity to contribute to everyday social and cultural activities . For example, in a traditional village in Yucat√°n, Mexico, great importance is placed on engaging in mature activities to help children learn how to participate and contribute appropriately. Adults rarely force children to contribute; rather, they provide children with a great range of independence in deciding what to do with their time. Therefore, children are likely to demonstrate that they want to be a productive member of the community because they have been a part of a social, collaborative culture that views everyday work as something that everyone can partake and help in. A main model of learning is to incorporate children in various activities where they are expected to be active contributors. The different forms of activities can vary from momentary interactions to broad societal foundations and how those complement their community's traditions. In Maya Belize culture, girls as young as four can work alongside their mothers when washing clothes in the river ‚Äì rather than being given verbal instructions, they observe keenly, imitate to the best of their ability, and understand that their inclusion is crucial to the community. Rather than being separated and directed away from the mature work and the Indigenous heritage, children are expected to observe and pitch in. Indigenous communities in the Americas emphasize the ability for community members of all ages to be able to collaborate. In this kind of environment, children learn not only how to participate alongside others, but are also likely to demonstrate an eagerness to contribute as a part of their community. Integration of younger and older children provides the opportunity for different levels of observation, listening, and participation to occur [Rogoff et al. (2010)]. Soon after or even during an activity, children are often seen to take it upon themselves to participate in the same previous social and cultural activities that they observed and participated in . By encouraging child immersion in activities rather than specifically asking for their participation, children have the freedom to construct their own knowledge with self-motivation to continue cultural practices alongside others . Children in many Indigenous cultures of the Americas actively participate and contribute to their community and family activities by observing and pitching in (link to LOPI page) while informally learning to socialize and gaining a sense of responsibility amongst other skills. A mother reported that being an active participant in everyday activities provides children with the opportunity to gain direction in learning and working that other environments may not provide. For instance, 15-year-old Josefina and her family own a small restaurant in an Indigenous community in Nocutzepo, Mexico where the entire family collaborates to ensure the restaurant functions smoothly. This includes everyone from the grandmother who tends to the fire for cooking to 5-year-old Julia who contributes by carrying the pieces of firewood. Josefina is one of the seven family members that pitches in towards the family food stand. Through observation and listening, she learned that the food stand was the family's main source of income. Overtime, Josefina took it upon herself to pitch in and take over the food stand, thus learning responsibility, cooperation, and commitment. Nobody instructed or demanded her to help with the family business, but she learned the community's expectations and way of living. The inclusive and welcoming environment of the marketplace setting encourages children to participate in everyday social practices and take initiative to learn about their culture, facilitating communal collaboration. Motivation In Indigenous American communities, the inclusion of children in communal activities motivates them to engage with their social world, helping them to develop a sense of belonging.Cajete, Gregory. (1994). Look to the mountains: An ecology of indigenous education. Kivaki Press, Colorado. Active participation involves children undertaking initiative and acting autonomously. Similarly, Learning by Observing and Pitching In (LOPI) supports informal learning which generates self-sovereignty. The combination of children's inclusion, development of independence, and initiative for contribution are common elements identified in Indigenous American ways of learning. Education in Indigenous communities is primarily based on joint engagement in which children are motivated to \\"pitch-in\\" in collective activities through developing solidarity within family, resulting in reciprocal bonds. Learning is viewed as an act of meaningful and productive work, not as a separate activity. When asked to self-report about their individual contributions, Indigenous Mexican heritage children placed emphasis on the community rather than on individual role. Their contributions emphasized collaboration and mutual responsibility within the community. A study was conducted with children who had immigrated from Indigenous communities in rural Mexico. The children were less likely to view activities that Westernized culture regarded as \\"chores\\" to be a type of work. These children felt that activities such as taking care of siblings, cooking, and assisting in cleaning were activities that help the family. When asked how they viewed participation in household work, children from two Mexican cities reported they contribute because it is a shared responsibility of everyone in the family. They further reported that they want to pitch in to the work because helping and contributing allows them to be more integrated in ongoing family and community activities. Many Mexican-heritage children also reported being proud of their contributions, while their families reported the contributions of children are valued by everyone involved. Learning through collaborative work is often correlated with children learning responsibility. Many children in Indigenous Yucatec families often attempt and are expected to help around their homes with household endeavors. It is common to see children offer their help of their own accord, such as Mari, an 18-month-old child from an Indigenous family who watched her mother clean the furniture with a designated cleaning leaf. Mari then took it upon herself to pick a leaf from a nearby bush and attempt to scrub the furniture as well.Gaskins, S. (1999). Children's daily lives in a Mayan Village: A case study of culturally constructed roles and activities. In A. G√∂nc√º (Ed.), Children's engagement in the world (pp. 25-61). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. Although Mari was not using the proper type of leaf, by attempting to assist in cleaning the furniture, she demonstrated that she wanted to help in a household activity. Mari's mother supported and encouraged Mari's participation by creating an environment where she is able to pitch in, even if not in a completely accurate manner. Parents often offer guidance and support in Indigenous American cultures when the child needs it‚Äîas they believe this encourages children to be self-motivated and responsible. Children from Indigenous communities of the Americas are likely to pitch in and collaborate freely without being asked or instructed to do so. For example, P'urepecha children whose mothers followed more traditional Indigenous ways of living demonstrated significantly more independent collaboration when playing Chinese checkers than middle-class children whose mothers had less involvement in Indigenous practices of the Americas. Similarly, when mothers from the Mayan community of San Pedro were instructed to construct a 3-D jigsaw puzzle with their children, mothers who practiced traditional Indigenous culture showed more cooperative engagements with their children than mothers with less traditional practices. These studies exemplify the idea that children from families that practice traditional Indigenous American cultures are likely to exhibit a motivation to collaborate without instruction. Therefore, being in an environment where collaboration is emphasized, serves as an example for children in Indigenous American communities to pitch in out of their own self- motivation and eagerness to contribute. Assessment In many Indigenous communities of the Americas children rely on assessment to master a task. Assessment can include the evaluation of oneself as well as evaluation from external influences like parents, family members, or community members. Assessment involves feedback given to learners from their support; this can be through acceptance, appreciation or correction. The purpose of assessment is to assist the learner as they actively participate in their activity. While contributing in the activity, children are constantly evaluating their learning progress based on the feedback of their support. With this feedback, children modify their behavior in mastering their task. In the Mexican Indigenous heritage community of Nocutzepo, there is available feedback to a learner by observing the results of their contribution and by observing if their support accepted or corrected them. For example, a 5-year-old girl shapes and cooks tortillas with her mother, when the girl would make irregular tortilla shapes her mother would focus her daughter's attention to an aspect of her own shaping. By doing this, the young girl would imitate her mother's movements and improve her own skills. Feedback given by the mother helped the young girl evaluate her own work and correct it. In traditional Chippewa culture, assessment and feedback are offered in variety of ways. Generally, Chippewa children are not given much praise for their contributions. On occasion, the parents offer assessment through rewards given to the child. These rewards are given as feedback for work well done, and come in the form of a toy carved out of wood, a doll of grass, or maple sugar. When children do not meet expectations, and fail in their contributions, Chippewa parents make sure not to use ridicule as a means of assessment. The Chippewa also recognize the harmful effects of excessive scolding to a child's learning process. Chippewa parents believes that scolding a child too much would \\"make them worse\\", and holds back the child's ability to learn. Hilger, Sister M. I. (1951). \\"Chippewa child life and its cultural background\\". Smithsonian Institution, Bureau of American Ethnology, Bulletin 146, pp. 55-60, 114-117. For the Chillihuani community in Peru, parents bring up children in a manner that allows them to grow maturely with values like responsibility and respect. These values ultimately influence how children learn in this community. Parents from the Chillihuani community offer assessment of their children through praise, even if the child's contribution is not perfect. Additionally, feedback can come in the form of responsibility given for a difficult task, with less supervision. This responsibility is an important aspect of the learning process for children in Chillihuani because it allows them advance their skills. At only five years old, children are expected to herd sheep, alpaca and llamas with the assistance of an older sibling or adult relative. By age 8, children take on the responsibility of herding alone even in unfavorable weather conditions. Children are evaluated in terms of their ability to handle difficult tasks and then complemented on a job well done by their parents. This supports the learning development of the child's skills, and encourages their continued contributions.Bolin, I. (2006). Growing up in a culture of respect: Childrearing in highland Peru. Austin: University of Texas Press. Criticisms of the Western educational model Omitting indigenous knowledge amounts to cultural assimilation. The government stigmatizes indigenous learning, culture, and language to assimilate indigenous peoples and create a more homogenized country. A study on Malaysian post secondary students found that indigenous children struggled with social and academic adaptation as well as self-esteem. The study also found that indigenous students had much more difficulty transitioning to university and other new programs compared to non-indigenous students. These challenges are rooted in the fact that indigenous students are underrepresented in higher education and face psychological challenges, such as self-esteem. Globally, there is a large gap in educational attainment between indigenous and non-indigenous people. A study in Canada found that this gap is widened by the residential school system and traditionally Eurocentric curriculum and teaching methods. Stemming from the negative psychological impacts of attending residential schools in 1883, which were heavily influenced by Christian missionaries and European ideals and customs, a feeling of distrust towards Canadian schools has been passed down through generations. As a result of experiencing racism, neglect, and forced assimilation, the cycle of distrust has pervaded children and grandchildren, and so on. There is a continued lack of teaching of indigenous knowledge, perspective, and history. As mentioned above, there has been a modern-day global shift towards recognizing the importance of Indigenous education. One reason for this current awareness is the rapid spread of Western educational models throughout the world. Critics of the Western educational model believe that due to colonial histories and lingering cultural ethnocentrism, the Western model can not substitute for an Indigenous education. Throughout history, Indigenous Peoples have experienced, and continue many negative interactions Western society (for example, the Canadian Residential School System), which has led to the oppression and marginalization of Indigenous people. The film \\"Schooling the World: The White Man's Last Burden\\" addresses this issue of modern education and its destruction of unique, Indigenous cultures and individuals' identities. Shot in the Buddhist culture of Ladakh in the northern Indian Himalayas, the film fuses the voices of the Ladakhi people and commentary from an anthropologist/ethnobotanist, a National Geographical Explorer-in-Residence, and an architect of education programs. In essence, the film examines the definitions of wealth and poverty, in other words, knowledge and ignorance. Furthermore, it reveals the effects of trying to institute a global education system or central learning authority, which can ultimately demolish \\"traditional sustainable agricultural and ecological knowledge, in the breakup of extended families and communities, and in the devaluation of ancient spiritual traditions.\\"Schooling The World. \\"The Film\\". Last modified 2011, http://www.schoolingtheworld.org/film/. Retrieved 8 April 2012. Finally, the film promotes a deeper dialogue between cultures, suggesting that there is no single way to learn. No two human beings are alike because they develop under different circumstances, learning, and education. The director and editor of the film Carol Black writes, \\"One of the most profound changes that occurs when modern schooling is introduced into traditional societies around the world is a radical shift in the locus of power and control over learning from children, families, and communities to ever more centralized systems of authority.\\"Carol Black, \\"Occupy Your Brain: On Power, Knowledge, and the Re- occupation of Common Sense\\", Schooling the World Blog, January 13, 2012, http://schoolingtheworld.org/blog/. Black continues by explaining that in many non-modernized societies, children learn in a variety of ways, including free play or interaction with multiple children, immersion in nature, and directly helping adults with work and communal activities. \\"They learn by experience, experimentation, trial and error, by independent observation of nature and human behavior, and through voluntary community sharing of information, story, song, and ritual.\\" Most importantly, local elders and traditional knowledge systems are autonomous in comparison to a strict Western education model. Adults have little control over children's \\"moment-to-moment movements and choices.\\" Once learning is institutionalized, both the freedom of the individual and his/her respect for the elder's wisdom are ruined. \\"Family and community are sidelined‚Ä¶The teacher has control over the child, the school district has control over the teacher, the state has control over the district, and increasingly, systems of national standards and funding create national control over states.\\" When Indigenous knowledge is seen as inferior to a standard school curriculum, an emphasis is placed on an individual's success in a broader consumer culture instead of on an ability to survive in his/her own environment. Black concludes with a comment, \\"We assume that this central authority, because it is associated with something that seems like an unequivocal good ‚Äì 'education' ‚Äì must itself be fundamentally good, a sort of benevolent dictatorship of the intellect.\\" From a Western perspective, centralized control over learning is natural and consistent with the principles of freedom and democracy; and yet, it is this same centralized system or method of discipline that does not take into account the individual, which in the end stamps out local cultures. Colonialism & Western methods of learning The education system in the Americas reinforces western cultures, prior knowledge and learning experiences which leads to the marginalization and oppression of various other cultures. Teaching students primarily through European perspectives results in non-European students believing that their cultures have not contributed to the knowledge of societies. Often, Indigenous students resist learning because they do not want to be oppressed or labeled as 'incapable of learning' due to neo-colonial knowledge and teaching. The act of Decolonization would greatly benefit Indigenous students and other marginalized students because it involves the deconstruction of engagement with the values, beliefs and habits of Europeans.  Pedagogical approaches to Indigenous education  Decentralization requires a shift in education that steps away from Western practices. The following are pedagogical approaches aimed at empowering Indigenous students and Indigenous communities through education that does not rely on western culture.  Culturally relevant pedagogy  Culturally relevant pedagogy involves curriculum tailored to the cultural needs of students and participants involved. Culture is at the core of CRP and teachers and educators aim for all students to achieve academic success, develop cultural competence, and develop critical consciousness to challenge the current social structures of inequality that affect Indigenous communities in particular. Culturally relevant pedagogy also extends to culturally sustaining and revitalizing pedagogy which actively works to challenge power relations and colonization by reclaiming, through education, what has been displaced by colonization and recognizing the importance of community engagement in such efforts.  Critical Indigenous pedagogy  Critical Indigenous pedagogy focuses on resisting colonization and oppression through education practices that privilege Indigenous knowledge and promote Indigenous sovereignty. Beyond schooling and instruction, CIP is rooted in thinking critically about social injustices and challenging those through education systems that empower youth and teachers to create social change. The goal of teachers and educators under CIP is to guide Indigenous students in developing critical consciousness by creating a space for self-reflection and dialogue as opposed to mere instruction. This form of pedagogy empowers Indigenous youth to take charge and responsibility to transform their own communities. Under critical Indigenous pedagogy, schools are considered sacred landscapes since they offer a sacred place for growth and engagement. Western-style schooling is limited in engaging Indigenous knowledge and languages but schools that embrace critical Indigenous pedagogy recognize Indigenous knowledge and epistemologies which is why Indigenous schools should be considered sacred landscape.  Land-based pedagogy  Land as pedagogy recognizes colonization as dispossession and thus aims to achieve decolonization through education practices that connect Indigenous people to their native land and the social relations that arise from those lands. Land-based pedagogy encourages Indigenous people to center love for the land and each other as the core of education in order to contest oppression and colonialism that is aimed at deterring Indigenous people from their land. Land-based pedagogy has no specific curriculum because education and knowledge come from what the land gives. Unlike western practices with a standard curriculum, land-based pedagogy is based on the idea of abstaining from imposing an agenda to another living being. Intelligence is considered a consensual engagement where children consent to learning and having a set curriculum is thought to normalize dominance and non-consent within schooling and inevitably extended to societal norms. Western style education is seen as coercive because in order to achieve something, one must follow the set guidelines and curriculum enforced by educators. Individuals show interest and commitment on their own thus achieving self-actualization and sharing their knowledge with others through modeling and ‚Äúwearing their teachings.‚Äù The values of land-based pedagogy are important to Indigenous people groups who believe that ‚Äúraising Indigenous children in a context where their consent, physically and intellectually, is not just required but valued, goes a long way to undoing the replication of colonial gender violence‚Äù (Simpson, 31)  Community-based pedagogy  Community-based education is central to the revival of Indigenous cultures and diverse languages. This form of pedagogy allows community members to participate and influence the learning environment in local schools. Community-based education embraces the ideas of Paolo Freirie who called for individuals to ‚Äúbecome active participants in shaping their own education‚Äù (May, 10). The main effects of instilling community-based pedagogy in schools are as follows: * Parent involvement in decision making encourages children to become closer to their teachers * Indigenous parents themselves gain confidence and positively impacts their children's learning * Teacher-parent collaboration eliminates stereotypes non-Indigenous teachers may have about Indigenous people. * Communities collectively gain self-respect and achieve political influence as they take responsibility for their local schools The school environment under a community-based education system requires communication and collaboration between the school and the community. The community must share leadership within the schools and must be involved in decision-making, planning, and implementation. Children learn through the guidance rather than determinants of their teachers or elders and are taught skills of active participation. Out of community-based education arises community-based participatory research (CBPR), an approach to research that facilitates co-learning co-partnership between researchers and community members to promote community-capacity building. CBPR requires having youth- researcher partnerships, youth action-groups, and local committees made up of youth, tribal leaders, and elders. This approach to research builds strength and empowers community members.  Culturally sustaining and revitalizing pedagogy  McCarty and Lee (2014) express that tribal sovereignty (Indigenous people's as peoples, not populations or national minorities), must include education sovereignty. The authors report that Culturally Sustaining and Revitalizing Pedagogy (CSRP) is necessary in education, based on three items; (1) asymmetrical power relations and the goal of transforming legacies of colonization, (2) reclaim and revitalize what has been disrupted and displaced by colonization, and (3) the need for community-based accountability. CSRP is meant to off balance dominant policy dialogue. This research follows two case studies at two different schools, one in Arizona and one in New Mexico. Tiffany Lee reports for Native American Community Academy (NACA) in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The core values for the school include; respect, responsibility, community service, culture, perseverance, and reflection. These core values reflect tribal communities as well. NACA offers three languages; Navajo, Lakota, and Tiwa, and the school also seeks outside resources to teach local languages. This study emphasizes that teaching language is culturally sustaining and revitalizing; which creates a sense of belonging and strengthens cultural identities, pride, and knowledge. At NACA, teachers know they possess inherent power as Indigenous education practitioners. They make a difference in revitalizing Native languages through culturally sustaining practices. The second case study was reported by Teresa McCarty at Puente de Hozho (PdH), that language has a different role for members of various cultural communities. At PdH, the educators reflect parents‚Äô influence (Dine and Latino/a) for culturally sustaining and revitalizing education. The goal is to heal forced linguistic wounds and convey important cultural and linguistic knowledge that connects to the school's curriculum and pedagogy. Balancing academic, linguistic, and cultural interests is based on accountability to Indigenous communities. The authors describe the need for linguistic teachings as a ‚Äúfight for plurilingual and pluricultural education.‚Äù Educators can attempt to balance state and federal requirements with local communities and Indigenous nations.  Language revitalization efforts  Many Native American and Indigenous communities in the United States are working to revitalize their Indigenous languages. These language revitalization efforts often take place in schools, via language immersion programs. In Guatemala, teachers have had a sense of agency to teach students' the Indigenous language as well as about Indigenous culture in order to prevent language loss and maintain cultural identity.  Importance  Researchers have brought up the importance of language revitalization efforts to preserve Native culture. The extinction of Native languages has been brought up as one of the reasons that revitalization efforts are necessary and McCarty, Romero, and Zepeda have noted that ‚Äú84% of all Indigenous languages in the United States and Canada have no new speakers to pass them on.\\" Native language is seen as a path to preserving Native heritage such as ‚Äúknowledge of medicine, religion, cultural practices and traditions, music, art, human relationships and child-rearing practices, as well as Indigenous ways of knowing about the sciences, history, astronomy, psychology, philosophy, and anthropology.‚Äù ‚ÄúDuane Mistaken Chief, a member of the Blackfeet tribe, explains that American Indians use words and phrases to reconstruct their cultures and to heal themselves. By studying the Indian words, they learn to respect themselves. From the Indian point of view, the traditional language is a sacred gift, the symbol of one‚Äôs identity, the embodiment of one‚Äôs culture and traditions, a means for expressing inner thoughts and feelings, and the source of ancestral wisdom.\\" Additionally, linguists and community members believe in the importance of revitalizing Native languages because ‚Äúit is at once a direction for research, action, and documentation.\\" Finally, it has been suggested that it is especially important to recognize Native languages in school settings because this leads to teachers recognizing the people, which leads to self-esteem and academic success for the students.  School Based Language-Immersion Models  Aguilera and LeCompte (2007) compared case studies of three different language-immersion programs in schools in Alaska, Hawaii, and the Navajo Nation. They examined evidence from prior research studies, examined descriptive documents from the study participants, conducted phone interviews and email exchanges with executive directors and school district administrators, and utilized other research on language-immersion models. In addition to qualitative evidence, they analyzed quantitative data such as school test scores and demographic. Through their comparison of test data, Aguilera and LeCompte found that there was an increase in performance on state benchmark exam scores by the Ayaprun- and Dine‚Äô- immersion students. On the flip side, there was lower performance in these schools on the norm- referenced tests. However, the researchers note that these tests are often biased, negatively impacting Indigenous students. Ultimately, the researchers did not find that one immersion model had a higher academic achievement impact on Native students than the other studies. However, they ‚Äúagree with language experts that total immersion is a more effective approach to achieving proficiency in a Native language.\\" Through their study, Aguilera and LeCompte (2007) examined the language nest and two-way immersion models. Another researcher, Lee (2007), examined ‚Äúcompartmentalizing‚Äù through both quantitative and qualitative measures. Quantitatively, Lee examined language levels, language usage, and lifespan experiences of Navajo students. Qualitatively, Lee interviewed Navajo students to learn more about their feelings and opinions on learning the Navajo language. Below are descriptions of the three school models used in the studies by Aguilera, LeCompte, and Lee. * Language nest ‚Äì This model is used by the Native Hawaiian Aha Punana Leo consortium and begins in preschools. ‚ÄúIn the language nest preschools, the Indigenous language is considered the student‚Äôs first language, and children converse and study in that language, every day and all day.\\" These students are taught in English only after they are literate in their Indigenous language. * Two-Way Language-Immersion Model ‚Äì In this model, maintenance of the Native language is promoted, while students also learn a second language. This model typically lasts from five to seven years. One form of a two-way language immersion model is the 50-50 model, in which students use English half of the class time and the target Native language the other half of the class time. The other model is a 90-10 model, in which students use the target Native language 90% of the time beginning in kindergarten. These students then increase the use of English ‚Äúby 10% annually until both languages are used equally‚Äîa 50-50 split by fourth grade.‚Äù * Compartmentalizing‚Äî Schools that do not have full immersion programs often use compartmentalizing. Compartmentalizing refers to the Indigenous language being taught as a separate topic of study as opposed to having students instructed in the Native language for their academic content areas. According to Lee (2007), compartmentalizing is the most common approach for teaching Navajo language in schools today. Through her study, Lee (2007) concluded that ‚ÄúNavajo-language use in the home was the strongest influence over the students‚Äô current Navajo- language level and Navajo-language use.\\" She noted that ‚Äúschools need to become more proactive in language revitalization‚Äù and shared that she found the compartmentalizing language-immersion programs in her study ‚Äúmodest‚Äù and ‚Äúthe language was mostly taught as though all the students were monolingual English speakers.\\" Ultimately, the researcher asserts that in order for language-immersion programs to be done well, schools need to invest in more resources, improved teaching pedagogy, and the development of students‚Äô critical thinking and critical consciousness skills.\\"  Difficulties of Implementation  Despite much interest in language revitalization efforts in Native communities, it can be challenging when it comes to program implementation. Research suggests several factors in the United States that make it difficult to implement language immersion programs in schools. Aguilera and LeCompte (2007) found the following difficulties in their study: * An ‚Äúoverwhelming pressure to teach English, especially due to the ‚Äúrecent emphasis on high-stakes testing in English\\" * ‚ÄúLack of importance given to cultural aspects of language by non-native educators and policymakers‚Äù * Lack of family participation, due to parents‚Äô fears that their children will not learn English or be successful if they participate in an immersion program * Securing long term funding to sustain programs Other studies found additional difficulties in implementation: * Hostile Policies: McCarty and Nicholas (2014) conducted qualitative research on language revitalization efforts for the Mohawk, Navajo, Hawaiian, and Hopi people and found one difficulty in implementation was hostile policies toward bi/multilingual education efforts. * Scarcity of Indigenous Staff and Resources: Mary Hermes opened Waadookodaading, a language immersion school centered around the Ojibwe language. The school is located near a reservation of about 3,000 enrolled members, but as of 2007, there were only approximately 10 fluent speakers. Because of massive language loss among Indigenous groups, it can be difficult to find fluent native speakers. It is necessary to have high language proficiency in order to teach in an immersion school. Not only do immersion teachers need to be fluent in the language, but they also need to be skilled in pedagogy which presents additional challenges. Requirements from the NCLB state that paraprofessionals need to have at least an associate degree, and those working in the primary grades to have early childhood education coursework. Oftentimes, the people who would serve in these positions in language immersion schools are elders, and they do not have these requirements. Additionally, a lack of materials in Indigenous languages results in a demand on educators to produce the materials along the way. * Conflicting Perspectives: Ngai (2008) conducted qualitative research on Salish language revitalization efforts by speaking with 89 participants through 101 interviews in three different school districts on the Flathead Indian Reservation. His goal through his research was to produce a framework that could be used for Native language education in districts that had a mix of Native and non-Native students. Ngai found that, ‚ÄúLanguage revitalization is particularly challenging in school districts with a mix of AI/AN and non- Native populations because of the co-existence of diverse and often conflicting perspectives.\\"  Helpful Factors in Implementation  Despite the challenges of creating and maintaining immersion programs, there are many schools in existence today. Researchers suggest the following factors as helpful in leading to implementation of immersion models. * Leadership and community activism ‚Äì Aguilera and LeCompte (2007) noted in their study that having Indigenous leaders who are invested in implementing these models is critical. In another study, Ngai (2008) notes that, ‚ÄúIn public schools, the continuation of Salish language instruction since the 1970s can be attributed to the efforts of Salish-language teachers who are willing to step into a traditionally hostile setting in order to pass the language on to the young.‚Äù * School Autonomy ‚Äì Many schools have applied for charter status in order to protect language-immersion schools from being closed by school members who object to the programs. Charter status also allows schools the flexibility to gain more funding. * Partnerships with higher education systems‚ÄîIn order to implement a language immersion model, schools must have trained teachers. Several of the communities where language immersion models have been successful are, ‚Äúsituated in communities where there is access to higher education degree programs, and some of these postsecondary institutions offer Native language classes.\\" Benefits For Indigenous learners and instructors, the inclusion of these methods into schools often enhances educational effectiveness by providing an education that adheres to an Indigenous person's own inherent perspectives, experiences, language, and customs, thereby making it easier for children to transition into the realm of adulthood. For non-Indigenous students and teachers, such an education often has the effect of raising awareness of individual and collective traditions surrounding Indigenous communities and peoples, thereby promoting greater respect for and appreciation of various cultural realities. In terms of educational content, the inclusion of Indigenous knowledge within curricula, instructional materials, and textbooks has largely the same effect on preparing students for the greater world as other educational systems, such as the Western model. There is value in including Indigenous knowledge and education in the public school system. Students of all backgrounds can benefit from being exposed to Indigenous education, as it can contribute to reducing racism in the classroom and increase the sense of community in a diverse group of students.Wilson, Theresa. (2001). Best Practices for Teaching Aboriginal Children: From an Aboriginal and Non-Aboriginal Perspective. Retrieved from http://www.sd61.bc.ca/edsrvs/ANED/about/Best_Practices_for_Teaching_Aboriginal_Students.pdf. There are a number of sensitive issues about what can be taught (and by whom) that require responsible consideration by non-Indigenous teachers who appreciate the importance of interjecting Indigenous perspectives into standard mainstream schools. Concerns about misappropriation of Indigenous ways of knowing without recognizing the plight of Indigenous Peoples and \\"giving back\\" to them are legitimate. Since most educators are non-Indigenous, and because Indigenous perspectives may offer solutions for current and future social and ecological problems, it is important to refer to Indigenous educators and agencies to develop curriculum and teaching strategies while at the same time encouraging activism on behalf of Indigenous Peoples. One way to bring authentic Indigenous experiences into the classroom is to work with community elders. They can help facilitate the incorporation of authentic knowledge and experiences into the classroom.BC Teacher's Federation.

Retrieved from http://www.bctf.ca/uploadedFiles/Public/AboriginalEducation/BeyondWords(1).pdf Teachers must not shy away from bringing controversial subjects into the classroom. The history of Indigenous people should be delved into and developed fully. There are many age appropriate ways to do this, including the use of children's literature, media, and discussion. Individuals are recommended to reflect regularly on their teaching practice to become aware of areas of instruction in need of Indigenous perspectives. 21st century skills Incorporating Indigenous ways of learning into educational practices has potential to benefit both Indigenous and non-Indigenous learners. The 21st century skills needed in modern curriculum include: collaboration, creativity, innovation, problem-solving, inquiry, multicultural literacy, etc. Indigenous ways of learning incorporate all these skills through experiential and holistic methods. Additionally, aboriginal education styles align with 21st century skills though involving teachers and students as co-constructors of education, and by valuing the interconectidness of content and context. Educational gap Some Indigenous people view education as an important tool to improve their situation by pursuing economic, social and cultural development; it provides them with individual empowerment and self- determination. Education is also a means for employment; it is a way for socially marginalized people to raise themselves out of poverty. However, some education systems and curricula lack knowledge about Indigenous peoples ways of learning, causing an educational gap for Indigenous people. Factors for the education gap include lower school enrollments, poor school performance, low literacy rates, and higher dropout rates. Some schools teach Indigenous children to be \\"socialized\\" and to be a national asset to society by assimilating, \\"Schooling has been explicitly and implicitly a site of rejection of Indigenous knowledge and language, it has been used as a means of assimilating and integrating Indigenous peoples into a 'national' society and identity at the cost of their Indigenous identity and social practices\\". Intercultural learning is an example of how to build a bridge for the educational gap. Other factors that contribute to the education gap in Indigenous cultures are socioeconomic disadvantage, which includes access to healthcare, employment, incarceration rates, and housing. According to the Australian Government Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet in their 2015 Closing the Gap Report, the country was not on track to halve the gap in reading, writing and numeracy achievements for Indigenous Australian students. The government reported that there had been no overall improvement in Indigenous reading and numeracy since 2008. Importance Indigenous knowledge is particularly important to modern environmental management in today's world. Environmental and land management strategies traditionally used by Indigenous peoples have continued relevance. Indigenous cultures usually live in a particular bioregion for many generations and have learned how to live there sustainably. In modern times, this ability often puts truly Indigenous cultures in a unique position of understanding the interrelationships, needs, resources, and dangers of their bioregion. This is not true of Indigenous cultures that have been eroded through colonialism or genocide or that have been displaced. The promotion of Indigenous methods of education and the inclusion of traditional knowledge also enables those in Western and post-colonial societies to re-evaluate the inherent hierarchy of knowledge systems. Indigenous knowledge systems were historically denigrated by Western educators; however, there is a current shift towards recognizing the value of these traditions. The inclusion of aspects of Indigenous education requires us to acknowledge the existence of multiple forms of knowledge rather than one, standard, benchmark system.Hall, L.B., Sefa Deo, G.J., & Rosenberg, D.G. Indigenous Knowledges in Global Contexts: Multiple Readings of Our World (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2000) A prime example of how Indigenous methods and content can be used to promote the above outcomes is demonstrated within higher education in Canada. Due to certain jurisdictions' focus on enhancing academic success for Aboriginal learners and promoting the values of multiculturalism in society, the inclusion of Indigenous methods and content in education is often seen as an important obligation and duty of both governmental and educational authorities.In the Canadian province of Manitoba for instance, collaborative efforts between the government and post-secondary institutions (both universities and colleges) has resulted in the implementation of 13 Access Programs (spanning several disciplines and program focus areas). These Access programs often place emphasis on indigenous methods and content in the delivery of post-secondary education and training, while also providing students with a variety of other culturally sensitive supports (such as elders and mentors) in order to enhance their success in higher education. Advocates of such programs will often highlight the fact that, between 2001/02 and 2005/06 (most recent available data) a total of 800 students successfully graduated from these programs with post-secondary credentials, while an average of 70.8 per cent of all students enrolled during these same years were Aboriginal.Statistics cited according to pp. 141‚Äì143 of the Manitoba Council on Post-Secondary Education Statistical Compendium For the Academic Years Ending in 2006 According to these advocates, the inclusion of indigenous models of education in those Access Programs that are intended for Aboriginal learners, is an important factor contributing to the completion of post-secondary education for the estimated 566 Aboriginal students who would not otherwise have been likely to achieve this same level of success. Many scholars in the field assert that Indigenous education and knowledge has a \\"transformative power\\" for Indigenous communities that can be used to foster \\"empowerment and justice.\\"Semali, L.M. & Kincheloe, J.L. What is Indigenous Knowledge? (New York: Falmer Press, 1999) The shift to recognizing Indigenous models of education as legitimate forms is therefore important in the ongoing effort for Indigenous rights, on a global scale. Implications for teachers Educators need to foster a respectful learning environment that promotes confidence and openness as well as an authentic dialogue to help students come to understand content through spirituality and cultural infusion. It is also important for educators to realize that time is crucial for students to connect intellect, spirituality and their understanding of the physical world. Many educators have stated that educational programs do not prepare them with enough support and materials for effectively teaching Indigenous students. Therefore, it is important for educators to seek out ongoing teach development programs directed toward improving teaching so that marginalized groups do not suffer. Challenges (as seen with the Na) There are numerous practical challenges to the implementation of Indigenous education. Incorporating Indigenous knowledge into formal Western education models can prove difficult. However, the discourse surrounding Indigenous education and knowledge suggests that integrating Indigenous methods into traditional modes of schooling is an \\"ongoing process of 'cultural negotiation.'\\" Indigenous education often takes different forms than a typical Western model, as the practices of the Na ethnic group of southwest China illustrate. Because Na children learn through example, traditional Na education is less formal than the standard Western model. In contrast to structured hours and a classroom setting, learning takes places throughout the day, both in the home and in adults' workplaces. Based on the belief that children are \\"fragile, soulless beings\\", Na education focuses on nurturing children rather than on punishing them.Tami Blumenfield, \\"Na Education in the Face of Modernity\\", Landscapes of Diversity: Indigenous Knowledge, Sustainable Livelihoods and Resource Governance in Montane Mainland Southeast Asia (2002): 487-94. Children develop an understanding of cultural values, such as speech taboos and the \\"reflection\\" of individual actions \\"on the entire household.\\" Playing games teaches children about their natural surroundings and builds physical and mental acuity. Forms of Indigenous knowledge, including weaving, hunting, carpentry, and the use of medicinal plants, are passed on from adult to child in the workplace, where children assist their relatives or serve as apprentices for several years. However, increasing modernity is a challenge to such modes of instruction. Some types of Indigenous knowledge are dying out because of decreased need for them and a lack of interest from youth, who increasingly leave the village for jobs in the cities. Furthermore, formal Chinese state schooling \\"interferes with informal traditional learning.\\" Children must travel a distance from their villages to attend state schools, removing them from traditional learning opportunities in the home and workplace. The curriculum in state schools is standardized across China and holds little relevance to the lives of the Na. Na children are required to learn Mandarin Chinese, Chinese and global history, and Han values, as opposed to their native language, local history, and Indigenous values. Methods of instruction rely on rote learning rather than experiential learning, as employed in Na villages. Several individuals and organizations pay for children's school fees and build new schools in an attempt to increase village children's access to education. Yet such well- intended actions do not affect the schools' curriculum, which means there is no improvement in the sustainability of the children's native cultures. As a result, such actions may actually \\"be contributing to the demise of the very culture\\" they are trying to preserve. Associated organizations Many organizations work to promote Indigenous methods of education. The United Nations Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples makes particular reference to the educational rights of Indigenous peoples in Article 14.\\"United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples\\". United Nations. Retrieved 8 April 2012. It emphasizes the responsibility of states to adequately provide access to education for Indigenous people, particularly children, and when possible, for education to take place within their own culture and to be delivered in their own language. Indigenous peoples have founded and actively run several of these organizations. On a global scale, many of these organizations engage in active knowledge transfer in an effort to protect and promote Indigenous knowledge and education modes. One such organization, the Indigenous Education Institute (IEI), aims to apply Indigenous knowledge and tradition to a contemporary context, with a particular focus on astronomy and other science disciplines.Indigenous Education Institute. \\"About IEI.\\" Last modified 2012. http://www.indigenouseducation.org/ Retrieved 8 April 2012.

During a guest appearance at the Berlin State Opera in 1909, she sang Mim√¨ opposite Enrico Caruso. From 1911 until 1918, she was a member of the Berlin State Opera. There, she sang Sophie in the first Berlin performance of Richard Strauss' Der Rosenkavalier, which impressed Thomas Beecham so much that he invited her to sing that role at the opera's first performance in London at the Royal Opera House in 1913. Dux had made her London debut in 1911 with Thomas Beecham at His Majesty's Theatre. During the years from 1918 until 1921, Dux sang mostly in concert recitals and toured the Royal Swedish Opera in Stockholm. In 1921, she became a member of the Chicago Civic Opera where she debuted as Nedda in Leoncavallo's Pagliacci; she remained there for the rest of her career, although she returned to Europe occasionally as a guest artist. Personal life Dux was married three times: first to a writer, Wilhelm Alfred Imperatori, then briefly to the German actor Hans Albers. In August 1926 she married Charles H. Swift, son of the founder of Swift & Company, Gustavus Franklin Swift ‚Äì benefactor of the University of Chicago and the Newberry Library.

Alejandro Sawa Mart√≠nez (15 March 1862 - 3 March 1909) was a Spanish bohemian novelist, poet, and journalist. Born in Seville, Sawa was of Greek origin. His father was an importer of wine and sundries. After a brief flirtation with the priesthood and a stint at the seminary of M√°laga, he underwent a sudden conversion to vehement anticlericalism and thereafter studied law in Granada. He arrived in Madrid in 1885, \\"absurd, brilliant, and starving\\" (Valle-Incl√°n, Bohemian Lights). There he led an impoverished, marginal existence. In 1889, he was lured to Paris by its artistic scene. For a time he worked on the staff of the Garnier publishing house, editing an encyclopedic dictionary, and had ample opportunity to strike up friendships with many of the luminaries of Parnassian and Symbolist literature, though he himself preferred the Romanticism of Victor Hugo. He translated the works of the Goncourt brothers and enjoyed what he would later regard as his \\"golden years\\". He married a Burgundian, Jeanne Poirier, and fathered a girl, Elena. On his return to Madrid in 1896 he plunged headfirst into journalism, serving as editor of El Mot√≠n, El Globo, and La Correspondencia de Espa√±a, and as a contributor to ABC, Madrid C√≥mico, Espa√±a, and Alma Espa√±ola, among others. His last years were marked by his descent into blindness and mental illness. Ironically, it was this period that yielded his only artistic success, a stage adaptation of Alphonse Daudet's Kings in Exile, in the winter of 1899. His own writings, which were largely journalistic, continued to appear in the most prestigious Spanish newspapers even as his body and mind progressively deteriorated. He wrote, \\"I wouldn't have wanted to be born, but I find it unbearable to die.\\" He did so on 3 March 1909, blind and insane, in his modest house on calle Conde Duque de Madrid. Shortly before his death, the great bohemian had declared: Sawa's personality was an inspiration to the novelists of the Generation of '98, notably P√≠o Baroja in The Tree of Knowledge and Valle-Incl√°n in Bohemian Lights. Max Estrella, the protagonist of the latter, was largely inspired by Sawa, who, though outwardly uncultivated, possessed a forceful personality and a style redolent of Hugo and Verlaine, men whom he would claim as his personal friends, along with Alphonse Daudet, Rub√©n Dar√≠o, and Manuel Machado. (The latter would compose an epicede in his honor.) After Sawa's death, Valle- Incl√°n wrote to Rub√©n Dar√≠o: Posthumously published in 1910 with a prologue by Rub√©n Dar√≠o, Iluminaciones en la sombra marked a modernist departure from the naturalist style in which he had written his earlier novels: La mujer de todo el mundo (1885), Crimen legal (1886), Declaraci√≥n de un vencido (1887), Noche (1889), Criadero de curas (1888), and La sima de Igusquiza (1888).

He attended the University of Colorado at Boulder. Miller was considered as one of the best offensive guards of his class. High school career Miller attended Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado, where he played offensive tackle and defensive end. He refused a starting position his sophomore year as playing varsity football was an overwhelming challenge. As a senior, he started all 14 games at offensive tackle, averaging well over 10 pancake blocks per game, did not allow a quarterback sacks, was flagged for just one penalty and had five direct touchdown blocks. On defense, he registered 31 tackles, 20 solo with 12 for losses including five sacks, with 10 hurries, four passes broken up, two fumble recoveries with one forced as a reserve. He was named Colorado's Gatorade Player of the Year, he earned a host of All-America honors for his senior season, including Parade, USA Today, SuperPrep, Rivals.com, PrepStar and MaxPreps. Miller was selected to play in the 2007 U. S. Army All-American Bowl in San Antonio, Texas, and he helped the West to a 24-7 win. Regarded as a five-star recruit by Rivals.com, Miller was listed as the No. 2 offensive tackle prospect in the class of 2007, behind only Josh Oglesby. He picked Colorado over scholarship offers from Miami (Fl.), Nebraska, Notre Dame, Oklahoma, and USC. College career In his true freshman year at Colorado, Miller played in 10 games and started seven, including the 2007 Independence Bowl, at right offensive tackle. He became the first tackle to play as a true freshman at Colorado since Bryan Campbell, who played as a reserve behind Mark VanderPoel on the 1989 and 1990 teams, and when he started, that made him just the ninth true freshman to start a game on the offensive line at Colorado since freshmen were allowed to play again in 1972. Miller earned first-team Freshman All-America honors from The Sporting News, second-team by Scout.com, and third-team by College Football News. TSN also selected him first-team Freshman All-Big 12. After starting the first four games of his sophomore season at right tackle, Miller went down with a broken fibula on the second play of the second half against Florida State in Jacksonville, Florida. He was granted a medical hardship after missing the bulk of the 2008 season due to injury, thus he picked up an extra year of eligibility. Miller returned to the field in 2009, and started all 12 games, seven at right guard where he opened the season, and five at right tackle when the line was shuffled for assorted reasons.

Their repertoire largely consists of their own compositions as well as traditional Irish songs. The band is considered one of the most influential folk groups. It showcases the famous Northern Irish folk singer-songwriter Tommy Sands as lead singer and songwriter and his brothers Ben Sands, Colum Sands and Eugene Sands and sister Anne Sands. Eugene was killed in a car accident in 1975 and the formation became a 4-member band. Tommy, Colum and Ben Sands have also successful solo careers as singers and musicians. The Sands came from a very musical and artistic family. Their parents both came from families of singers, musicians and storytellers and encouraged a love of Irish culture and tradition in their seven children, Mary, the eldest, Hugh, Ben, Tommy, Colum, Eugene and Anne. Their mother Bridie Connolly, was an accordionist, and the daughter of the 'Burren poet', Owen Connolly, and her mother was related to the Bront√´ family.Sands Family Folk, The Sands Family: Biography.

The Sands Family started public performing in local halls and pubs, then they won a 'Folk Group' contest in \\"Old Shieling Hotel\\" in Raheny, Dublin. This led to booking in New York in early 1971 followed by further tours in the US and Canada. They also performed a Saint Patrick's Day concert appearance in Carnegie Hall.

History Sibers was established in 1998 by graduates of Novosibirsk State University mathematics program. Having determined to launch an IT venture, they joined forces to create a dedicated team of software developers and were subsequently employed by the American company, IWC (Interactive Web Concepts), thus forming the IWC Russian Division. The developers ‚Äì 5 of them working in one office in Akademgorodok, Russia ‚Äì completed projects provided to them by their single client, IWC. This was the team's first step to creating what soon became known as Key-Soft Ltd., and would later become Sibers. The founders started the company with nothing more than an initial investment from their own personal savings. In the late 1990s, during the Dot-com Boom, 3COM Corporation bought IWC including its Russian Division.3Com Acquires Internet Consultant IWC to Enhance Global E-networks Strategy; Acquisition Strengthens 3Com's Ability to Deliver Total E-business Solutions - Company Business and Marketing  Edge: Work-Group Computing Report  Find Articles at BNET, findarticles.com It was at this time that all employees became official contract workers of the 3COM Corporation. It was during the spring of 2001 that the Russian team, now composed of ten employees, became an independent offshore software development company known as Key-Soft Ltd. This was the same year Key-Soft registered with Elance and created their own profile to gain their first independent contracts. In 2005, an effort to unite a circle of Russian software developers, Key-Soft created its virtual service outlet called HireRussians. Following ISO (International Organization for Standardization) and CMM (Capability Maturity Model) standards, Key-Soft delivered hundreds of projects for retail, oil/gas, security, finance, real estate, health care industries, education and entertainment for children and adults. The key market at this time was the United States only. As a result of this development, Key-Soft underwent re-branding in 2006, when Key-Soft was officially renamed \\"Sibers\\".Key-Soft re-branded to Sibers The new name reflected the geographical location of the company and differentiated it from the numerous \\"xxx-soft\\" teams, that were popular at that time. The company now employed 70 developers and managers and continued to grow by widening its presence on Elance as well as other online and offline marketplaces. The company gradually continued to expand the range of key territorial markets to include Canada, England, France, and Scandinavia.

In September 2007, shortly after Alisher Usmanov's investment in Arsenal Football Club, Craig Murray blogged about the character of Usmanov, a Russian multi-billionaire Forbes magazine had identified as the 142nd wealthiest person in the world. He said he named Usmanov, alleging corruption, in two of his \\"quite highly classified\\" telegrams to the Foreign Office London in 2002 and 2004 written while Murray was ambassador in Uzbekistan. Usmanov's solicitors, Schillings, requested that Fasthosts delete the material.

Background Letter from Henry II of France to Suleiman the Magnificent and ambassador Jean Cavenac de la Vigne, dated 22 February 1557. The Ottomans had already attacked the Balearic Islands many times previously, as in the 1501 Ottoman raid on the Balearic islands. Then followed the sacks of Pollen√ßa (in 1531 and 1550), the Sack of Mahon in 1535, Alc√∫dia (1551), Valldemossa (1552), Andratx (1553), and S√≥ller (1561). Ottoman attacks only decreased after the Battle of Lepanto in 1571, although they continued until the 17th century.Pitcher, D.E., An Historical Geography of the Ottoman Empire (Leiden, 1972), p.99.Lee, Phil, The rough guide to Mallorca & Menorca (New York, 2004), p. 275. On 30 December 1557, Henry II of France, who was in conflict with the Habsburgs in the Italian War of 1551‚Äì1559, wrote a letter to Suleiman, asking him for money, saltpeter, and 150 galleys to be stationed in the West. Through the services of his ambassador Jean Cavenac de la Vigne, Henry II obtained the dispatch of an Ottoman fleet in 1558.Setton, Kenneth M., The Papacy and the Levant (1204‚Äì1571) (Philadelphia, 1984), p. 698 ff Suleyman the Magnificent sent his fleet as a diversion to help his French allies against the Habsburgs. The Ottoman armada left Constantinople in April 1558. On 13 June 1558 the Ottoman fleet ravaged Italy, with little effect however apart from the sack of Sorrento, then part of the possessions of Spain in southern Italy, where they took 3,000 captives.Setton p.698 ff. Raid In July, the fleet then started to ravage the Balearic islands.\\"In 1558, after the battle of St. Quentin, Souleiman I, the old ally of Francis I, had made a diversion useful to France by sending his fleet against Italy and the Balearic Isles, which it ravaged.\\": Duruy, Victor, History of modern times: from the fall of Constantinople to the French revolution (New York, 1894), p.237. The Ottoman force consisted of 15,000 soldiers on 150 warships. The Ottomans, after repulsing an attack on Mah√≥n, attacked the citadel of Ciutadella in Menorca, which was only garrisoned with 40 soldiers.\\"In the middle soars an obelisk commemorating the futile defense against the Turks in 1558, a brutal episode that was actually something of an accident. The Ottomans had dispatched 15,000 soldiers and 150 warships west to assist their French allied against the Habsburg\\": Lee, p. 171 ff. Port of Ciutadella. On 9 July 1558, the Ottomans under Piyale Pasha and Turgut Reis put the town under siege for eight days, then entered and decimated the town. After the fall of the citadel, the city was ravaged and the population enslaved. All of Ciutadella's 3,099 inhabitants who survived the siege were sold into slavery in the Ottoman Empire, along with people from surrounding villages. In total, 3,452 locals were sold at the slave markets of Constantinople. The Balearic islands were ravaged, and 4,000 people were taken as prisoners.Carr, Matthew, Blood and Faith: the Purging of Muslim Spain (Leiden, 1968), p. 120. An obelisk was set up in the 19th century by Josep Quadrado in the Plaza d'es Born in memory of the offensive, with the following inscription: Every year on 9 July a commemoration takes place in Ciutadella, remembering \\"l‚ÄôAny de sa Desgr√†cia\\", or \\"the Year of the Disaster\\".Balears Cultural Tour Aftermath As a later consequence of the 1553 Franco-Ottoman Invasion of Corsica, the same Ottoman fleet was delayed from joining a French fleet in Corsica near Bastia, possibly due to the failure of the commander Dragut to honour Suleiman's orders. Suleiman apologized in a letter to Henry at the end of 1558.Setton p. 696 ff.Setton p. 700 ff.

Early years Born in 1846, Clarke was the second son of Edward Marmaduke Clarke and Mary Agnes Close. He was educated at Gaultier's School in Sydenham, Kent and Beaucourt's School in Boulogne, France. Between 1862 and 1865 he studied architecture at the National Art Training Schools at South Kensington. In 1865 he entered the office of works where he distinguished himself in work for the rebuilding of the Houses of Parliament. In 1866 he married Frances Susannah Collins with whom he had eight children, three sons and five daughters. The eldest son, C Stanley Clarke became assistant keeper of the Indian section of the Victoria and Albert Museum. South Kensington Museum In 1867 he moved to the South Kensington Museum where he oversaw mosaic reproduction. Beginning in 1874, Clarke accepted various foreign assignments as supervising architect to the crown, most notably Tehran. In 1876, Clarke traveled to Turkey, Syria, and Greece and in 1879 to Spain, Italy, and Germany buying artifacts for the Museum. In 1878 he acted as architect of the Indian section and commercial agent to the Indian government at the Paris Exhibition. In 1880 Clarke arranged the Indian collections at South Kensington, which led to taking on the position of special commissioner in India and then becoming keeper of the India Museum at South Kensington in 1883. His acquisitions included the Hamzanama folios, early Mughal illustrations of the epic adventures of Hamza by northern Indian and Iranian artists. He also bought contemporary crafts, architectural woodwork and drawings. In 1892 Clarke was appointed Keeper of the art collections, in 1893 promoted to Assistant Director before finally becoming Director in 1896. During his time as Director he also filled the posts of Royal Commissioner at the 1900 Paris Exhibition and at St Louis in 1904. He resigned from the South Kensington Museum (renamed in 1899 as the Victoria and Albert Museum) in 1905. Sir Caspar Purdon Clarke (1846-1911), by George Burroughs Torrey, oil on canvas, 1907. Whilst at the South Kensington Museum, he continued to be active as an architect and undertook several commissions in the Indian style. These included Lord Brassey's Indian Museum in Park Lane in 1887 and the Indian Palace at the 1889 Paris Exhibition. In 1899 he was commissioned, in conjunction with architect William Young, to design the Indian hall at Elvedon, Suffolk by Edward Guinness, 1st Earl of Iveagh (1847-1927). He also later advised Iveagh on the furniture and tapestries for Elvedon. Metropolitan Museum of Art In 1904 the president and director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York Luigi Palma di Cesnola died. The American millionaire and art collector J. P. Morgan (1837-1913) assumed the duties as President of the Museum and hired Clarke to be its second director. It was hoped he would be able to raise the Metropolitan Museum of Art to the international standing of the Victoria and Albert Museum. In 1905 Clarke hired Edward Robinson, the recently resigned director of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, to be his assistant director. He returned to England due to ill health in 1909 and resigned in 1910. He remained the museum's honorary European correspondent until his death. Clarke died at Earls Court, London on 29 March 1911. Other offices Clarke's official duties did not stop him carrying out other notable work. In 1870 he organized and conducted evening art classes for artisans in Soho, Lambeth, and Clerkenwell and he designed Cotherstone church, Durham (1876), Alexandra House, Kensington (1886, for students at the Royal College of Music), and the National School of Cookery, South Kensington (1887). He visited America to study the housing of female students at Boston in 1884, edited a work on oriental carpets for the Austrian government in 1892, and besides lecturing, contributed numerous papers on architecture, Eastern arts and crafts, and arms and armour to the Journal of the Society of Arts, the Journal of Indian Art, the Journal of the Royal Institute of British Architects, and other publications. In 1910 he published a catalogue of the Arms and Armour at Sandringham. He was made chevalier of the L√©gion d'Honneur in 1878, in which year he also received silver and bronze medals at the Paris Exhibition, which were followed by a gold medal in 1889. He was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries on 4 May 1893. He was created a Companion of the Indian Empire (CIE) in 1883, and was knighted in the 1902 Coronation Honours, receiving the accolade from King Edward VII at Buckingham Palace on 24 October that year. He was also given the commander's cross of the order of the crown of Germany. ReferencesFurther reading * Lane, John (1905). Sir Caspar Purdon Clarke, Kt.; A Personal Note, New York, J.

It makes an excellent fast-growing hedge for gardens - growing tall, straight and dense. http://www.plantzafrica.com/planthij/ilexmitis.htm Appearance If it is not occasionally pruned back, Ilex mitis can eventually grow enormous. If not pruned, Ilex mitis can grow to a height of 20 meters or more. Its trunk is straight, grey or brown and usually spotted while it produces a dense, even canopy. Young growth and leaf-stalks tend to be purple or red. The simply shaped, pointed, shiny-green leaves have wavy margins that are sometimes slightly serrated. The tree can be identified by its purple or maroon leaf stalks and the leaves‚Äô strongly impressed midribs. The small, white, scented flowers appear in spring. Ilex mitis is dioecious, with separate male and female trees. The bright red fruits ripen in autumn, creating a colourful display and attracting a variety of birds. Distribution This is the only holly (Ilex) species from South Africa, where it grows naturally in all provinces, from Cape Town in the south, all the way up past Zimbabwe and Malawi in the north. It is usually found growing on the banks of rivers and in moist spots in Afro- montane forest. Growing Ilex mitis This is a fast-growing tree, growing nearly a meter a year in ideal conditions. It grows especially well in wet areas like beside lakes or rivers and it tolerates frost, making it suitable for colder climates. Fresh seed will usually germinate, but should first be dried out a bit. If kept moist after planting, the young plants usually sprout several weeks later. It transplants well, but needs to be protected from drying out and direct sun whilst young. It has no known diseases or pests, though in the wild it is one of the favourite foods of elephants.

Potter had a considerable practice in Staffordshire and its neighbouring counties in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century. Potter lived in Pipehill, south-west of Lichfield, and had his office in St John's Street. Joseph Potter's son Joseph Potter Jnr. took over his father's practice after his death and went on to design many of his own buildings in the late nineteenth century. Biography Early in Joseph Potter's career as an architect, he was employed by James Wyatt (a prominent architect at the time) to supervise the alterations to Lichfield Cathedral in 1788‚Äì93 and Hereford Cathedral in 1790‚Äì93. In this period he also worked under Wyatt in the repair to St Michael's Church, Coventry (now St Michael's Cathedral) in 1794 and the rebuilding of Plas Newydd, Anglesey for the 1st Marquess of Anglesey. At Plas Newydd it is thought Potter is solely responsible for the design and build of the gothic chapel. Potter became the established architect at Lichfield Cathedral, overseeing repairs to the south-west spire in 1794, the restoration of the vaults in the north transept in 1795‚Äì97 and restoration of the west face of the cathedral in 1820‚Äì22. Potter was the county surveyor of Staffordshire for 45 years until his death in 1842. Potter was also an engineer for the Grand Trunk Canal Company. Potter had three sons who all carried on the family profession. Robert Potter (c. 1795‚Äì1854) was the eldest son; he became an architect and went on to design numerous buildings. Joseph Potter Jnr. (c. 1797‚Äì1875) took over his fathers practice after his death and went on to design many buildings including the Guildhall and Clock Tower in Lichfield. James Potter (c. 1801‚Äì1857) the youngest son became a civil engineer working mainly on canals and railways. Other architects Thomas Johnson and James Fowler of Louth were pupils of Joseph Potter and were influenced by his methods.

Club career Born Benguela, Portuguese Angola, Malta da Silva was discovered by S.L. Benfica's scouting team at Clube Nacional de Benguela. He joined the club in 1964, and made his competitive debut on 3 January of the following year in an away win against Seixal FC, playing five more Primeira Liga games as the season ended in league conquest. Facing heavy competition from Humberto Coelho, Germano, Ra√∫l Machado and Jacinto Santos he appeared mainly in the Ta√ßa de Portugal, failing to feature in the league from 8 May 1965 to 23 March 1969. Malta da Silva had his breakthrough season at the age of 26, starting as right back for Benfica and playing 33 matches in 1969‚Äì70, where the Portuguese Cup was won. In the following three campaigns, under Jimmy Hagan, he battled with Adolfo and Artur Correia for the position, but still appeared in over 60 league contests to win the three-peat; however, starting from 1973‚Äì74, he gradually lost his importance in the squad, leaving the club in 1976 with official totals of 192 games and one goal. In 1977, Malta da Silva followed many teammates to the North American Soccer League. He played with Ant√≥nio Sim√µes in the San Jose Earthquakes, and then moved to New England Oceaneers in American Soccer League. Two years later, Malta da Silva embarked on a managerial career with Sport Benfica e Castelo Branco, promoting them from the third division in his first season and finishing twelfth the following year to avoid relegation. International career Due to his performances at club level, Malta da Silva received his first call-up to the Portugal national football team in 1971, during the UEFA Euro 1972 qualifying campaign.

This was made the responsibility of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police's (RCMP) Special Branch, later the name was changed to the RCMP Security Service. In the 1950s, RCMP Commissioner Stuart Wood had a \\"PROFUNC list\\" of approximately 16,000 suspected communists and 50,000 suspected communist sympathizers.\\"PROFUNC Recapitulation\\" , RCMP Security Service, 15 May 1953.

These lists dictated who the Special Branch would observe and potentially intern in a national security state of emergency, such as a Third World War crisis with the Soviet Union and People's Republic of China. A separate arrest document, known formally as a C-215 form, was written up for each potential internee and updated regularly with personal information until the 1980s, including but not limited to: age, physical descriptions, photographs, vehicle information.\\"Former Manitoba AG on secret internment list\\", CBC News, 15 October 2010.

Several prominent Canadians are suspected of being on the PROFUNC list including: Winnipeg alderman Jacob Penner, Roland Penner and the founder of the New Democratic Party of Canada Tommy Douglas. It is suspected that the PROFUNC blacklist was used to increase the number of people detained as Front de lib√©ration du Qu√©bec (FLQ) suspects during the 1970 October Crisis, in contravention of the presumption of innocence, many of whom had no affiliation with the FLQ. The Canadian Penitentiary Service received an updated PROFUNC list from the RCMP in 1971 to make them aware of the number of potential internees.Parent, L.

In the early 1980s Solicitor General of Canada Bob Kaplan caused PROFUNC to become defunct by introducing administrative changes entailing the RCMP to discontinue whatever was contributing to some elderly Canadians encountering problems while attempting to cross the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border. Kaplan claimed to have had no knowledge of PROFUNC itself until he was advised of it by journalists in 2010 and that he was dismayed by its existence, stating \\"I just can‚Äôt believe it had any government authorization behind it\\". M-Day and internment Mobilization Day (M-Day) was to be the day, in the event of a perceived national security crisis, police services would arrest and transport people noted on the PROFUNC list and temporarily detain them in reception centres across Canada including: Casa Loma, a country club in Port Arthur, Ontario and Regina Exhibition Park then they would be transferred to penitentiaries. The men would be interned across Canada, the women would be interned in one of two facilities in the Niagara Peninsula or Kelowna and the children would be sent to relatives or interned with their parents. Strict punishment regulations awaited the internees if they broke the rules, including being held indefinitely and shot when caught while attempting a prison escape. Aftermath The existence of the program was revealed in a January 24, 2000, news story by Dean Beeby of The Canadian Press.

Kalvtr√§skskidan (\\"the Kalvtr√§sk ski\\") is among the oldest skis ever found. It was found in the autumn of 1924, as a group of men digging a ditch through a mire near the village of Kalvtr√§sk close to Skellefte√•, Sweden encountered some wooden objects at a depth of 1.5 metres. They carefully extracted the objects that turned out to be two skis measuring 204 cm by 15.5 cm and a shovel shaped ski pole measuring 156 cm. The objects were kept in a shed that winter before being turned into a museum the following summer. By that time one of the skis had started to wither and fall apart, so that only a few fragments of it remain. Thankfully the other ski is still more or less intact. An original dating using pollen analysis of pollen from the site suggested that the skis were 4000 years old, but later carbon dating has shown evidence that they are around 5200 years old, i.e. older than the pyramids of ancient Egypt. An analysis made in 1992 by the Forest Sciences faculty of the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences showed that the skis were made from pine that had grown in a slope, causing the wood to become denser than ordinary. This shows good craftmansship, since this type of wood has been favoured by ski makers in more recent times as well. Each ski had four holes for the bindings, which corresponds well with ancient skis found in Siberia, but not typical of other skis found in Scandinavia. The ski pole is similar to ski poles used in historic times by the Sami people in northern Scandinavia.K. B.

She married Johann Kaspar Goethe, on 20 August 1748, and had four children by him. She was a woman of exceptional intellect, marked individuality, and a joyous cast of mind, as evidenced by her letters, and in the frequent references to her found in the works of her son, upon whose intellectual development she undoubtedly exerted a remarkable influence. She was made the heroine of the work by Bettina von Arnim entitled Dies Buch geh√∂rt dem K√∂nig (1843), and is one of the central figures of Karl Gutzkow's play, Der K√∂nigsleutnant.

In one approach, a topological category is a category that is enriched over the category of compactly generated Hausdorff spaces. They can be used as a foundation for higher category theory, where they can play the role of (‚àû,1)-categories. An important example of a topological category in this sense is given by the category of CW complexes, where each set Hom(X,Y) of continuous maps from X to Y is equipped with the compact-open topology.

Bowen preserves the long lineage of Model Shipwright, having worked actively on the journal since its creation in 1972, subsequently becoming its editor in 1974 until the final instalment. In the first annual, the editors assert that the change of format from a quarterly journal to an annual has three major benefits. Firstly, rather than serialising longer articles over several issues, these could now be incorporated in entirety into a single volume. Secondly, the new format allowed enhanced size and clarity of images, presented in full colour for the first time. Finally, a greater emphasis could be placed on historical contextualisation in order to complement the existing craft-based articles.John Bowen and Martin Robson, Shipwright 2010, Conway Publishing (2010), p. 6 According to Julian Stockwin, the renowned author of naval fiction, 'The first edition of the annual has an impressive line-up of material, not only by model makers for model makers but discussions of new findings relating to ship design and construction by experts in their fields.'Julian Stockwin,  Shipwright Annual ‚Äì John Bowen retires in 2014  Conway Publishing announced on April 25, 2014, that there will be no \\"Shipwright\\" annual for 2014.http://www.conwaypublishing.com/?p=7177 This may or may not be related to the fact, that Conway Publishing is forced to seek for a new Editor, after John Bowen stepped down as Editor:http://www.conwaypublishing.com/?p=7179 > ...

L√©onard Mathurin Duphot (21 September 1769 - December 1797) was a French general and poet, whose Ode aux m√¢nes des h√©ros morts pour la libert√© was highly fashionable at the time. Life Duphot was born in la Guilloti√®re, a suburb of Lyon, a stonemason's son. He joined the Vermandois regiment on 25 July 1785 aged 15, rising to sergeant on 25 March 1792, joining the French expedition to Savoy and being sent to Nice. He was a member of one of the national volunteer battalions created on the outbreak of the French Revolution. He was made chef de bataillon adjudant-g√©n√©ral in November 1794 and fought with distinction in several actions of the Italian campaign in 1796. He was often mentioned in dispatches by general Augereau. On 13 June 1795 he came off the list of active officers and in February 1796 he was drafted back into the army for home service, though he returned to Augereau and Italy in August 1796, fighting at Mantua, Rivoli and La Favorita. Bonaparte then put Duphot in charge of organising the troops of the Cisalpine Republic. He rose to G√©n√©ral de brigade in the arm√©e d'Italie on 30 March 1797. He then went to Rome with the French ambassador Joseph Bonaparte, where they both tried to incite a Republican revolt, especially by holding a Republican festival at Joseph's palace. This caused a riot and Duphot was fatally shot on December 28, 1797 by Papal State troops. On December 29, 1797, the 250th Roman Catholic Church Pope Pius VI moved quickly and sent a formal apology to the French Directory for the death of Brig General Duphot. However, the apology was not accepted by the 1st Republic, and thus his death gave Bonaparte the pretext he needed to occupy Rome, abolish the Papal States and set up the Roman Republic - in Le M√©morial de Sainte-H√©l√®ne, Napoleon said of him \\"he was a general of the greatest promise. He was virtue itself.\\". Duphot had been due to marry Joseph's sister-in-law D√©sir√©e Clary the day after his death - she eventually married Jean-Baptiste Jules Bernadotte, and became Queen of Sweden, when he became King Charles XIV John in 1818.

Ever since its failure to capture the Byzantine Empire's capital, Constantinople, in 717‚Äì718, the Caliphate had launched a series of raids into Byzantine Asia Minor. In 727, the Arab army, led by one of the Caliph's sons, penetrated deep into Asia Minor, sacked two Byzantine fortresses and in late July arrived before Nicaea. Despite constant attacks for 40 days, the city held firm and the Arabs withdrew and returned to the Caliphate. The successful repulsion of the attack was a major boost for Byzantine emperor Leo III the Isaurian's recently initiated campaign to abolish the veneration of icons in the Empire; Leo claimed it as evidence of divine favour for his policy. The siege of Nicaea marks also the high point of the Umayyad raids, as new threats and defeats on their far-flung frontiers decreased Umayyad strength elsewhere, while Byzantine power strengthened afterwards. Background Following the failure of the year-long assault by the Umayyad armies on the Byzantine capital Constantinople in 717‚Äì718, a short period of peace followed as the Umayyads licked their wounds, suppressed the rebellion of Yazid ibn al- Muhallab, and re-assessed their priorities.Blankinship (1994), p. 117Lilie (1976), p. 143Makrypoulias (2003), Chapter 1 When warfare on the Arab‚ÄìByzantine frontier recommenced in 720, the strategic focus of the Caliphate had shifted away from outright conquest. The Muslim raids across the Taurus Mountains into Byzantine Asia Minor still occurred regularly every spring and summer, sometimes accompanied by naval raids and followed by a winter expedition; they devastated large tracts of Asia Minor, and destroyed several fortresses; but the Arabs did not attempt to hold on to captured strongholds on the west side of the Taurus Mountains.Blankinship (1994), pp. 117‚Äì118 Byzantine reaction during these years was passive, as the Empire still nursed its strength against the vastly superior resources of the Caliphate. The Byzantines did not obstruct or confront the raiding Arab armies, but rather retreated to well-fortified positions scattered throughout Asia Minor.Blankinship (1994), pp. 118‚Äì119 After the accession of Caliph Hisham (r. 723‚Äì743), the scale and ambition of the Muslim raids grew. One of the most prominent Umayyad leaders in these campaigns was Hisham's son Mu'awiya, who led expeditions in 725 and 726, the first of which went as far west as Dorylaion.Blankinship (1994), pp. 119‚Äì120Lilie (1976), p. 146 Invasion of 727 and the siege of Nicaea In summer 727,Some authors, notably Julius Wellhausen, date this expedition to 726, but the dating to 727 is confirmed by Theophanes' reference that it occurred \\"in the tenth indiction\\". Lilie (1976), p. 147 (Note 16) another large-scale invasion was led by Mu'awiya, with Abdallah al-Battal heading the vanguard of the army.Blankinship (1994), p. 120Lilie (1976), p. 147 The Byzantine chronicler Theophanes the Confessor claims that the vanguard alone numbered 15,000 men and the entire invasion force 100,000, clearly a grossly inflated number.Mango & Scott (1997), p. 560Makrypoulias (2003), Note 3 Theophanes also records a certain Amr as Mu'awiya's second-in-command, but Arab sources are unambiguous in this regard.Lilie (1976), p. 147 (Note 15)Mango & Scott (1997), pp. 561‚Äì562 (Note 9) The Arab army moved west into northwestern Asia Minor, and the vanguard under al-Battal attacked and sacked the town of Gangra in Paphlagonia and a place called in Arab sources Tabya, possibly the fort of Ateous in Phrygia. Gangra was razed to the ground, but during the attack on Tabya the Arabs, especially the Antiochene contingent, are said to have suffered heavy losses. From there, the Arabs turned west towards Nicaea, the chief city of Bithynia and capital of the powerful Opsician Theme. The Arabs arrived before the city in late July, with al-Battal's vanguard preceding the main army. The Byzantines, probably under the command of the Count of the Opsicians, Artabasdos, did not meet them in the field, but instead retreated behind the city's walls. The Arabs assaulted the city for forty days, employing siege engines which destroyed a part of the walls, but eventually failed to take it. In late August, they raised the siege and departed, taking many captives and much booty.Mango & Scott (1997), pp. 560‚Äì561Makrypoulias (2003), Chapter 2 The 12th-century chronicle of Michael the Syrian claims that the city's inhabitants abandoned it and fled by ship through Lake Ascania, whereupon the Arabs destroyed Nicaea, but this is clearly an error.Lilie (1976), p. 147 (Note 16) Aftermath The repulsion of the Arab assault on Nicaea was an important success for the Byzantines. Emperor Leo III the Isaurian (r. 717‚Äì741) regarded the city's survival as a sign of divine favour towards his newly instituted iconoclastic policies, and was encouraged to drive them further.Makrypoulias (2003), Chapter 3 This is probably related to an incident mentioned in the account of Theophanes, where a certain Constantine, who served as a groom (strator) to Artabasdos, threw a stone on an icon of the Virgin Mary and then trampled on it. The soldier was killed the next day by a catapult, a fact which Theophanes reports as evidence of divine vengeance. However, this passage shows strong signs of tampering by the fervently anti- iconoclast Theophanes, from what was probably originally a pro-iconoclast story.Mango & Scott (1997), pp. 560‚Äì562, incl. notes Militarily, the siege of Nicaea was the high-water-mark of the post-718 Umayyad raids; never again would Umayyad armies penetrate as deeply into Asia Minor.Blankinship (1994), pp. 120‚Äì121 Increasingly thereafter the Syro-Jaziran army, that provided the manpower for the raids against Byzantium, was diverted in the hard and fruitless wars against the Khazars in the Caucasus: the Khazars inflicted a heavy defeat on the Muslims in 730, and a Byzantine‚ÄìKhazar alliance was sealed by the marriage of Leo III's son and heir Constantine V (r. 741‚Äì775) with the Khazar princess Irene shortly after.Blankinship (1994), pp. 121‚Äì125, 149‚Äì154Lilie (1976), pp. 155‚Äì160 Over the next few years, while Byzantine strength revived, the Muslim military situation on all fronts of the over- extended Caliphate deteriorated. Consequently, in the 730s, Arab raids were mostly limited to the immediate frontier regions and their successes became fewer. By 740, when the Umayyads assembled the largest invasion force fielded after 718, the Byzantines had recovered enough to inflict a heavy defeat against them at the Battle of Akroinon.Blankinship (1994), pp. 167‚Äì170Lilie (1976), pp. 148‚Äì153 ReferencesSources  * Category:720s conflicts Category:720s in the Byzantine Empire Nicaea 727 Nicaea 727 Nicaea 727 Nicaea 727 Category:ƒ∞znik Category:Byzantine Iconoclasm Category:727 Category:Military raids Category:Leo III the Isaurian Category:720s in the Umayyad Caliphate Category:Byzantine Bithynia ","title":"Siege of Nicaea (727)"},{"id":"29190278","text":"The silent period (also called pre-production period) is a phase reported to have been observed in second-language acquisition where the learner does not yet produce but is actively processing the L2 (second language). This silent period has been claimed to be typically found in children and has been called the second stage of second language acquisition, following the use of L1 (native language) and preceding productive use of L2, and can last between a few weeks to a year. Generalizing how long this period may last is nearly impossible because it depends on many personal and individual variables that come into play. While the silent period has received much endorsement from researchers and educators, some argue against the validity of such a period. There are debates surrounding its significance in language acquisition, of how language teachers should address such a period in school curriculum, and what exactly language learners are processing (or not) during such a period. The phenomena of the silent period is a theory attributed to Stephen D. Krashen.  Controversy  There is controversy as to whether there is such a defined silent period of active learning. Studies in support of a silent period have used variable methods and definitions of silence. Some define it as the absence of any L2, while others define it as the absence of productive syntax in L2. Moreover, these studies were conducted across variable settings , and report a big range in the length of silent periods. Ultimately, even if these studies did properly established a non-verbal phase, there is still a lack of evidence that it involves active learning, as opposed to general incomprehension or shyness. The general concept of the silent period also seems at odds with the communicative nature of language and language acquisition.  In language teaching  Strategies teachers can use to help children who are in the silent period include: asking the child to teach you words in their language, having children draw a picture of their family and then asking them for details, watching the children on the playground to see if there is any verbalization outside of the classroom, having the children use their bodies to mime what they want to communicate, and asking children to draw what they are trying to say. General support for a silent period of active learning leads to certain implications in language teaching. Educators are less likely to expect engagement from L2 learners early on in acquisition, and might not try to elicit speech from L2 learners . However, if the silent period is not empirically founded, or if it reflects general incomprehension or shyness rather than active learning, then these pedagogical methods have to be reevaluated. The silent period has been used in language teaching methods such as Total Physical Response, the natural approach, and Automatic Language Growth.

The scam involved a crime syndicate which created 118 fake clinics in 25 states and used stolen medical license numbers of real doctors and matched them to legitimate Medicare patients whose names and billing information were also stolen. The group submitted more than $163 million in claims and received $35 million of that before they were caught. Prosecutors charged 73 individuals in several states with allegations of racketeering conspiracy, bank fraud, money laundering and identity theft. The crackdown A scandal surfaced involving a case to defraud the Medicaid and other healthcare programs such as Medicare. With an estimated amount to be stolen totalling $163 million of which $35 million was already acquired by the criminals, it involved more than 50 ethnic Armenians living in the United States who were arrested on October 13, 2010. The operation was run by more than 400 FBI agents. In addition to FBI, IRS and local enforcement agencies in California, Georgia, New Mexico, New York and Ohio were involved in the probe. The Justice Department has already indicted 73 individuals in New York and four other states. 44 defendants were indicted in New York, along with 10 in California, seven in New Mexico, six in Ohio and six in Georgia. According to the authorities, the Armenian-American organized crime group operated across 25 states. Leadership According to the authorities, the individuals acted within an organized crime enterprise run by Armen Kazarian aka PZO, a Soviet Union mobster part of the Vor v zakone who arrived in the US in 1996 and resided in Glendale, California. The other alleged ringleaders, Davit Mirzoyan, 34, also from Glendale and Robert Terdjanian, 35, from Brooklyn were also indicted. The authorities said most members of the organization were Armenian nationals or immigrants. The suspects have been allegedly laundering the stolen money. Prosecutors said that Kazarian travelled to New York to erase a $200,000 debt of one associate to another. When the second associate was unable to pay the fee of $100,000 for that service, his yacht was seized by Kazarian. Charges According to authorities, the investigation started after they received reports about theft of personal information, including Social Security numbers of 2,900 Medicare patients in upstate New York. The government claimed the group billed Medicare from phantom clinics for unnecessary medical services, or for services which were never performed, by stealing identities of both doctors and patients. According to officials, about $35 million of the bills claimed by the network was paid out by Medicaid already. A total of 118 medical clinics in 25 states were used to defraud the US health insurance program. One of the fake clinics was run from a small office over Coney Island auto body shop. Two Queens doctors and a worker at the Lutheran Hospital in Brooklyn were part of the gangster network. The U.S. District Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Preet Bharara, declared that the Mirzoyan‚ÄìTerdjanian organization, an Armenian-run syndicate in New York and Los Angeles, used threats, intimidation and violence, operating in classic mafia style. Bharara said \\"This Armenian group allegedly employed a raft of rackets, extortion, credit-card fraud, identity theft, immigration fraud, and even distribution of contraband cigarettes and stolen Viagra\\" The penalties range from 10 years to life in prison. The defendants will be tried in the states where they have been indicted. In the state of Georgia, six people, Arthur Manasarian, 58; Gegham Sargsyan, 56; Khoren Gasparian, 27; Sahak Tumanyan, 43, and his wife, Hasmik Tumanyan, 38; and Toni R. Lowery, 27, five of them being ethnic Armenians were indicted for opening, operating and filing false claims to defraud Medicaid from five fake clinics in Brunswick, Savannah and Macon such as \\"Brunswick Medical Supply Inc\\". Sargsyan and Gasparian have escaped and are believed to have possibly left the country. One of the highest amounts of the stolen taxpayer money is attributed to the state of Ohio, where the criminals of the organization billed the state for $44 million of which $20 million was paid out. All six charged with the crime by Ohio authorities are ethnic Armenians: Karen Chilyan, Eduard Oganesyan and Arus Gyulbudakyan aka Fina Markova the leader of Ohio ring have already been apprehended while Lilit Galstyan, Julieta Ghazaryan and Marine Movsisyan are still at-large. Outcome On July 8, 2011, the leader of the criminal network Armen Kazarian pleaded guilty to racketeering charges. He faced up to 20 years in prison.

He is the founding partner of The Wolk Law Firm in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, which specializes in aviation law and air crash litigation for plaintiffs. Wolk is an author, editor and lecturer on aviation law and air safety with articles published by The Aviation Consumer, Aviation Safety and other publications and has appeared on ABC Evening News, CBS Evening News, CNBC, and CNN Larry King Live. Wolk is admitted to practice law in Pennsylvania. He received his B.S. degree cum laude from Temple University in 1965, and his J.D. degree from Temple University School of Law in 1968.  Notable cases  Wolk reports that he represented victims in several major airline disasters. Some of the most notable air crash cases Wolk has had involvement in include: *USAir 427, Aliquippa, PA., Pittsburgh, Boeing 737. The flight crashed on September 8, 1994, killing everyone on board. Wolk speculated the cause of the crash was rudder failure and appeared the next day on ABC Evening News for Friday September 9, 1994 Peter Jennings reporter, in this program Wolk offered views on the cause of the crash. Wolk published his opinion that rudder failure was the likely cause of USAir 427 crash in the Pennsylvania Law Weekly, October 10, 1994. On October 25 he appeared on CBS Evening News with Reporter Dan Rather October 25, 1994, and offered comments about possible rudder failure. After the longest investigation in aviation history, more than four and a half years later, the National Transportation Safety Board concluded the probable cause was rudder failure. Wolk was the plaintiffs attorney in Hamley vs. The Boeing Corporation and won the case establishing that it was the rudder actuator that failed. *In 2010, Wolk won a $89 million jury award ($24.7 million in compensatory damages and $64 million in punitive damages) in Pridgen v.

The defendants argued that the lawsuit was barred by the General Aviation Revitalization Act of 1994, as the suit was filed more than 18 years after the component was manufactured. However, Wolk argued that suit should go forward because the manufacturer had intentionally misrepresented information to the Federal Aviation Administration. *Comair Flight 3272, Monroe, MI, (Detroit), Embraer EMB 120 Brasilia; Swissair 111, Peggy's Cove, Nova Scotia, McDonnell Douglas MD-11; EgyptAir 990, near Nantucket, MA, Boeing 767; and Alaska Airlines Flight 261, Port Mugu, CA, McDonnell Douglas MD-80.  Suits against AVWeb.com and others  In 2001, Wolk won a $480 million verdict against Cessna The Devil in the Details, and the Seat Rails... Check-Six.com which drew criticism from the AVWeb.com website. In 2002, Wolk sued the website and four people who posted comments there. The website and comment submitters then settled the suit with a payment to charity and published apologies. This settlement in turn drew critical coverage from the Overlawyered.com weblog. Ted Frank then posted a criticism of Wolk on Overlawyered.com for his 2007 lawsuit against Teledyne. In 2009, Wolk sued Overlawyered editor Walter Olson, Frank, and Overlawyered blogger David Nieporent, claiming that the blog libeled him. According to the complaint, Wolk did not discover the article until April 2009. In 2010, Judge Mary A. McLaughlin of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania dismissed the lawsuit for failure to comply with the one-year statute of limitations on the grounds that a blog is mass media and the statute of limitations runs from the date of publication.Shannon P.

In the lawsuit, Wolk admitted that he had hired an organization to \\"place truthful, favorable information\\" about him on Wikipedia. Writing for Public Citizen, Paul Levy criticized the lawsuit; Public Citizen's blog reports that Wolk has since filed suit against both Levy and Public Citizen. Wolk has also threatened to sue technology blog TechDirt over their reporting of the suit.  Personal aviation experience  Wolk has been a pilot for more than 30 years and holds an Airline Transport Pilot License (ATP) certificate for multi-engine land and sea aircraft. Wolk owned a restored Grumman F9F Panther jet fighter that he has flown in air shows throughout the country; performing low level aerobatics and formation flights.

The suit says the NTSB report contained extensive errors, including a statement that Wolk was not qualified to fly the plane. In 2002, the District Court judge dismissed Wolk's suit against the NTSB and other defendants in its entirety.http://www.paed.uscourts.gov/documents/opinions/02D0076P.pdf Wolk then appealed unsuccessfully to the U.S. Circuit Court for the Third Circuit. In this decision, United States Circuit Judge Joseph F.

As part of the S√©r√© de Rivi√®res system of fortifications, the fort was planned as part of a new ring of forts replacing the older citadel of M√©zi√®res with dispersed fortifications. With advances in the range and destructive power of artillery, the city's defensive perimeter had to be pushed away from the city center to the limits of artillery range. The Fort des Ayvelles was the only such fortification to be completed of the ensemble, as resources were diverted elsewhere. At the time of its construction the fort controlled the Meuse and the railway line linking Reims, Montm√©dy, Givet and Hirson. The Fort des Ayvelles was reduced in status in 1899, its masonry construction rendered obsolete by the advent of high-explosive artillery shells. However, it was re- manned for the First World War before it was captured by the Germans on 29 August 1914. The fort was partly destroyed in 1918. During the Battle of France in 1940 the fort was bombarded. French resisters were executed at Ayvelles during both world wars. At present the fort is maintained by a preservation society, and may be visited. Description Built starting in 1876 under the direction of Captain L√©on Boulenger, the fort was completed in 1878. The fort's four faces form a square perimeter, surrounded by a ditch wide and deep.Les Ardennes en marche, Avril 2008, p.36. The fort features particularly elaborate double caponiers to protect the outer wall and ditch on opposite corners, as well as counterscarps. The caponiers were provided with unique projecting watch-stations, or √©chauguettes. The fort and a subsidiary battery featured Mougin casemates, each armed with a single de Bange Model 1877 155mm gun. The fort possessed 53 artillery pieces in 1899, manned by 880 men, and disposed in two-level casemates on a north-south line. The battery is about to the east, connected to the main fort by a covered causeway. The caponiers were damaged by both world wars and by the French military in explosives tests in 1960 in preparation for demolition of the urban fortifications of Charleville M√©zi√®res. The Mougin gun was removed at about this time, but the casemate remains. In addition to its own Mougin casemate, the pentagonal detached battery was armed with 10 artillery pieces, served by 150 men. The battery was provided with a wall and ditch, with caponiers and counterscarps for defense. The battery was built in 1878 and was never modernized. The battery's Mougin casemate was entirely demolished after World War II by the French Army. 1914 In 1914 the fort was manned by personnel of the French Fourth Army, under the overall command of General Fernand de Langle de Cary. The fort had been hastily garrisoned after the defeat of French forces in Belgium with two companies of the 45th Territorial Infantry Regiment and 300 territorial artillerymen, under the command of Commandant Georges L√©vi Alvar√®s. These were reserve formations, largely composed of local residents. As French forces retreated and maneuvered in the face of the German attack, the fort was the only French force holding almost of the front between Rimogne and Flize. Under these circumstances, Georges L√©vi Alvar√®s requested permission from the Fourth Army to evacuate the fort in the event of German attack. However, before receiving a reply, he decided to evacuate after sabotaging the fort's arms. The garrison evacuated on August 25. Arriving at Boulzicourt, the troops were ordered back to the fort. At the same time, the Germans were preparing a bombardment of the fort. When the garrison returned to the fort on the 26th, the Germans opened fire. The French column retreated. Reaching Launois, the troops were sequestered. Georges L√©vi Alvar√®s, who had remained at the Fort des Ayvelles, committed suicide on the 27th. His body was found by the Germans and was buried nearby, with honors. German forces had bombarded the fort on the 26th and 27th, and waited until the 29th to enter the fort. They stripped the fort of its remaining metals for scrap. While they occupied the area Germans used the Fort des Ayvelles as a munitions depot and as a prison. The fort was the execution site for three French civilians, executed by the Germans between October 1915 and January 1916. The fort was reoccupied by France at the close of the war in November 1918. 1940 In 1940 the Fort des Ayvelles was manned by the second battalion of the French 148th Fortress Infantry Regiment under the command of Commandant Marie, which was in turn part of the weak 102nd Fortress Infantry Division. The 102nd DIF was the successor organization to the Defensive Sector of the Ardennes, which had administered a weak section of the Maginot Line fortifications. The sector was composed principally of scattered casemates and blockhouses, as the French command regarded the Ardennes sector as unsuitable for mechanized warfare. On 14 May 1940 the fort was bombarded by German forces, while the first and third battalions of the 148th RIF faced direct German attack. During the night of 15 May the fort was abandoned by French forces. The remaining troops of the 148th RIF nonetheless found themselves encircled and surrendered. Once again, the fort was the scene of civilian executions, with thirteen members of the French Resistance executed there. The most notable victims were les quatres cheminots d'Amagne (\\"the four railway workers of Amagne\\"), Ren√© Arnould, Georges Boillot, Robert Stadler and Lucien Maisonneuve, executed on 26 June 1944 for sabotage at the Amagne-Lucqy depot. Blockhouses Two blockhouses are near the fort, constructed in the 1930s as part of the Defensive Sector of the Ardennes: the Blockhaus du Fort des Ayvelles Sud, and the Blockhaus de Villers-Semeuse. Both were lightly armed. Present status The fort is maintained by the Association du Fort et de la Batterie des Ayvelles, and may be visited.

His right leg is broken and stuck between the dashboard and the door, and he is suffering from amnesia. Two other passengers are dead nearby. The Man hallucinates about a ‚ÄúWoman‚Äù finding him. The Man scares off a cougar by firing two shots from a revolver he finds inside the car. He hears on the car radio about an armed robbery by a man named Raymond Plazzy. Finding a credit card under the passenger seat in the name of Raymond Plazzy, the Man assumes that he is Plazzy. After a few days, he finally manages to pry his leg free. The Man splints his leg and crawls around the car. He finds bags of money in the trunk. When he starts to crawl up the hill, a man emerges from the woods and starts to loot the car. The Man tries to stop the woodsman, who just aims his gun at him before he runs away with some of the stolen money. A Belgian Shepherd dog appears, and the Man follows it into the woods. He finds a working cell phone inside a cave, discovering the body of the woodsman, who appears to have been attacked by the cougar. The Man cannot obtain a cell signal. Frequently hallucinating about the Woman, he finally shoots her with the revolver after realizing the hallucination have led him back to the car. He then becomes determined to get out of the ravine. After crawling for days, he finds a road and a dead body with a matching photo ID card that says Raymond Plazzy. He then remembers what happened to him: he was running errands with his wife (the Woman) when he witnessed an armed bank robbery, where a security guard is shot and the Man is taken hostage by Plazzy. In the present, the cougar appears and the man kicks Plazzy‚Äòs corpse toward the cougar, which drags it away. The Man now has a cell phone signal and calls for help. The man is picked up by a park ranger. When getting in the truck, he asks about the dog, but it is nowhere to be seen. When he clicks his seat belt on, it triggers a memory of putting on his seatbelt while Plazzy and his two fellow robbers were arguing, with Plazzy holding a gun to the Man‚Äôs head. The Man uses their distraction to grab the wheel, causing the car to crash. The scene blacks out. Cast * Adrien Brody as Man * Caroline Dhavernas as Woman * Ryan Robbins as George Weaver (Plazzy‚Äòs accomplice) * Adrian Hughes as Raymond Plazzy * Adrian Holmes as Man in the Woods * Lloyd Adams as Eric Stapleton (Plazzy‚Äòs getaway driver) * Mark McConchie as Security Guard * Jacob Blair as Park Ranger Production At the film's global premiere, which took place on 15 October 2010 at Emirates Palace as part of the Abu Dhabi Film Festival, Adrien Brody spoke candidly about why he chose to work on a project with a novice feature film director: \\"I believed that Michael had the ability to make something special. And I had a blueprint to work with from the script, and in the conversations that Michael and I had. You can't just make safe bets. Even directors and actors who do great work, do not always do great work. And I don't feel like you can wait around until someone of note comes to you and says come work with me. You have to seek out new things that inspire you. The key to this working is that he really didn't have to babysit me. You have to have trust in each other, and I trust Michael.\\" Reception Wrecked received mixed to favorable reviews from film critics. Rotten Tomatoes rates the film 48% with an average score of 5.3 out of 10, based on 27 reviews. Metacritic, which uses a weighted score, gives the film a score of 61 out of 100, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\", based on 10 reviews. Writing for IndieWire and giving it a \\"B\\" grade, Eric Kohn calls Adrien Brody's performance \\"committed\\" and Michael Greenspan's debut \\"has the stable definition of a one-act play\\" but finds the film \\"falls apart when it starts to repeat itself\\", but that \\"Brody's engagement with the material prevents \\"Wrecked\\" from falling apart.\\" Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter calls the film \\"never less than gripping\\", saying it \\"builds tension steadily\\", \\"is visually inventive\\", not tedious, and yet \\"comes up a bit flat with a perfunctory ending where something more feral or dramatic is needed.\\" Contrastingly, Brad Brevett describes the conclusion as \\"interesting\\", but complains of the film going in circles too much of the time, arguing that the story is too small for a feature film, while conceding that Adrien Brody gives \\"a solid performance, despite having very little to work with.\\" Alex DiVicenzo concurs: \\"Christopher Dodd's script would have benefited from a few more twists and turns; something that puts the man in peril but remains grounded in reality to avoid taking the viewer out of the movie. Director Michael Greenspan does the best that he can with what he has, aided in no small part by the fine cinematography by James Liston.\\" In a very brief New York Times review, Jeannette Catsoulis also complains that the film moves slowly at first and lacks suspense.

Immediately thereafter at the age of twenty-eight, he joined the history faculty at Texas A&M; University.

Comments on Texas History Curriculum Controversy  In September 2018, it was announced that a work group tasked with advising the State Board of Education on social studies curriculum revisions had proposed that educators refrain from calling defenders of The Alamo as \\"heroic\\" The recommendation drew the ire of Republican Governor Greg Abbott, a candidate for re-election in the November 6 general, who urged voters to express opposition to the proposal to their district member on the Texas Board of Education. The recommendation was among several hundred additions, deletions, and tweaks offered by the advisory the panel. The committee said \\"heroic\\" is \\"a value(s)-charged word.\\" Buenger said that he could understand why the word 'heroic' is divisive: \\"Many times the Alamo gets boiled down, as it often does in movies, to the Mexicans are the bad guys and the good guys are good Anglos in coonskin caps.\\" He noted that at least six Mexicans, calling themselves Texians, fought with the American defenders: \\"Part of the problem with the word heroic may be that it's too simplistic,\\" Buenger added. After public hearings were conducted, the Board of Education voted to amend the Texas history curriculum to refer \\"to the heroism of the diverse defenders who gave their lives‚Äù at the Alamo. Family The Buengers, who reside in Austin, Texas, have a son, Carl Davis Buenger (born ca. 1988), who graduated from Rice University with a mathematics degree in 2010. Their daughter, Erin Channing Buenger, died in 2009 of neuroblastoma pediatric cancer at the age of eleven. Former U.S. Representative Chet Edwards, a Buenger family friend, sponsored a successful bill to earmark $150 million toward a cure for neuroblastoma and other cancers.

Prince Charles, Prince of Wales, S1157, S11572, vol. II, pp. 239 and 378 Her youngest grandson, Bernard von Khevenh√ºller (1511‚Äì1548) was \\"Herr auf Sternberg and Hohenwart\\"; her eldest grandson, Christoph Khevenh√ºller (1503‚Äì1557) was Lord of Aichelberg. Hans Khevenh√ºller, ambassador to the Spanish Court Christoph Khevenh√ºller The steep rise of the House of Khevenh√ºller in Carinthia began when in 1525 Christoph Khevenh√ºller (1503-57) was appointed castellan of Ortenburg Castle near Spittal an der Drau and married a wealthy burgher's daughter, Elizabeth Mansdorfer. Her wealth enabled him to acquire a number of properties in Carinthia such as the castles of Aichelberg, Ortenburg, Sommeregg, Hochosterwitz and Landskron as well as the iron mine of Eisentratten near Gm√ºnd. Like the majority of the Carinthian Estates Christoph Khevenh√ºller became a Lutheran Protestant. Of Christoph Khevenh√ºller's s three sons, Hans, Moritz and Bartlm√§, two were politically and economically most successful, thus furthering the rise of the family: Hans Khevenh√ºller Hans Khevenh√ºller (1538‚Äì1606) became the Legate of the Holy Roman Emperor at the Spanish court, an office that he held for 26 years. Educated at the University of Padua, he knew Latin and Italian. He was appointed Imperial Chamberlain, was made a Knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece in 1587 and a count in 1593, a rank that upon his death passed on to his brother Bartlm√§. During his lifetime, he sought and collected animals and plants of economic importance from many parts of the world.  Bartlm√§ Khevenh√ºller The activities of Bartlm√§ Khevenh√ºller (1539‚Äì1613) centred on Carinthia. Styling himself \\"Freiherr auf Landskron and Wernberg\\" he made it to Burggrave und Speaker of the Estates, and managed to make the Khevenh√ºller family one of the wealthiest in the German Reich. He also figured as the head of the Protestants in Carinthia. When in the course of the counter-reformation Emperor Ferdinand II abolished the nobility's religious freedom in the Habsburg lands, the Protestant members of the Khevenh√ºller family were forced to abandon their possessions in Carinthia and emigrated to Germany in 1628. Among these was also the great-grandmother of Nicolaus Ludwig Reichsgraf von Zinzendorf und Pottendorf of the Moravian Church or Herrnhuter Br√ºdergemeine. Interrelation with the noble Saxonian Metzsch family began that led to the Khevenh√ºller-Metsch branch, which later also spread to Spain where as marquesses and dukes they became Grandees of Spain. Paul Khevenh√ºller A Protestant, Paul Khevenh√ºller (1593‚Äì1655) sided with the Swedish king during the Thirty Years' War lending Gustav Adolf 70 000 Swedish riksdalers to finance the war. After the king's death the Swedish state was incapable of repaying the loan and compensated the lender with the property of Julita G√•rd in S√∂dermanland, which remained the residence of his descendants late into the 19th century.

His son, Abd al-Rahman ibn Mu'awiya, was the founder of the Emirate of C√≥rdoba and the Umayyad line of al-Andalus. Biography Mu'awiya was a son of Caliph Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik and Umm al-Hakim, a daughter of Yahya ibn al-Hakam, an Umayyad statesman and brother of Hisham's paternal grandfather, Caliph Marwan I. Mu'awiya is known chiefly for his role in the Arab‚ÄìByzantine Wars, where he led many invasions against Byzantine Asia Minor. The first campaign he led was in summer 725, which was carried out in conjunction with a naval attack by Maymun ibn Mihran against Cyprus. According to Arab accounts, Mua'wiya's army reached as far as Dorylaion, capturing many prisoners and sacking several forts.Blankinship (1994), p. 120Lilie (2000), p. 321 Mu'awiya is also recorded to have launched an expedition in 726, possibly in winter, but nothing specific is known of it. In 727, he led another expedition, alongside Abdallah al-Battal. Battal captured and razed Gangra first, and then their combined forces took the fortress of Ateous, and advanced on Nicaea. Despite a 40-day siege, however, they failed to capture it. In 728 he led the southern expedition into Asia Minor, while his brother Sa'id ibn Hisham led the northern; neither appears to have been particularly successful.Blankinship (1994), p. 121 Muslim sources attribute to him the capture of the fortress of Charsianon in September/October 730, but Byzantine sources state that this was done by Mu'awiya's uncle, Maslama ibn Abd al- Malik. In the next year, his forces were reportedly unable to penetrate the frontier, while a secondary expedition by al-Battal was heavily defeated. In 732, Mu'awiya's expedition penetrated as far as Akroinon.Blankinship (1994), p. 162 In 733, he led an expedition into Paphlagonia. He continued to lead expeditions over the next few years, but although they ranged deep into Asia Minor in search of plunder‚Äîone of his raiding parties reportedly reached Sardeis near the Aegean coast‚Äîno major town or fortress appears to have been captured.Blankinship (1994), p. 168 In summer 737 he again led the southern expedition, but died, according to Theophanes the Confessor, by falling from his horse during a hunt.Blankinship (1994), p. 169 His son by a Berber concubine, Abd al-Rahman (731‚Äì788), escaped the fall of the Umayyad dynasty during the Abbasid Revolution to al-Andalus, where he founded the Umayyad Emirate of C√≥rdoba.·π¨ƒÅhƒÅ (1998), p. 234  References  Sources   Category:737 deaths Category:Umayyad people of the Arab‚ÄìByzantine wars Category:Umayyad dynasty Category:Deaths by horse-riding accident Category:Generals of the Umayyad Caliphate Category:Arab generals Category:Year of birth unknown Category:8th-century Arabs ","title":"Mu'awiya ibn Hisham"},{"id":"29190427","text":"Sir George Parry (16001660) was an English lawyer and politician who sat in the House of Commons of England from 1640 until 1644.

History Although August 1977 marked the NYU Archives' designation as the \\"official repository for all non-current records of the University,\\" its origins date to NYU's Antebellum period. In June 1854, Isaac Ferris, NYU's third president, received a motion from the University Council to collect the publications of alumni for preservation in the library, and ‚Äúto obtain for deposit in the archives the plates of all the commencements and exhibitions.‚ÄùUniversity Archives \\"H\\" File, History of the NYU Archives and Archivist In 1922, NYU Chancellor Elmer Ellsworth Brown commissioned Professor Theodore F. Jones to write a history of the university in commemoration of its centennial celebration in 1932. Dr. Jones assembled the \\"New York University Collection,\\" which included printed and manuscript material relating to the history of NYU, and placed the collection in the Treasure Room at the Gould Memorial Library on the University Heights Campus (currently the site of Bronx Community College). Jones gathered council minutes, financial records, chancellor's files, official university publications, books, pamphlets, academic bulletins, student/faculty publications and photographs, among numerous other materials, to form the nucleus of the University Archives as it exists today.Frusciano and Pettit, Acknowledgements, xiii - xiv. In 1967, NYU President James M. Hester established the Office of University Archivist and commissioned Dr. Thomas C. Pollock \\"to gather material for and write a modern history of the University.\\" According to minutes of the advisory committee on the history of New York University (ACHNYU) meeting from June 14, 1967, \\"...Pollock had agreed to become Archivist of the University with the responsibility for writing a new history...The Office of the Archivist would be set up and a small staff would work under Dr. Pollock's supervision in collecting data for the history.University Archives \\"H\\" File, History of the NYU Archives and Archivist. Up to that time, NYU had assigned the role of managing the university's records ‚Äì mainly the minutes of the governing council and the academic senate ‚Äì to the secretary of the university. Under the supervision of the advisory committee chaired by Professor Bayard Still, Dr. Pollock and his full-time research assistant, Emilie Adam, collected and preserved materials deemed essential for writing a history of NYU in the 20th century. The pair disseminated questionnaires to long-service University personnel, requesting accounts of their experiences at NYU. Pollock and Adam additionally asked department chairpersons to submit brief histories of their respective departments and divisions. Upon Dr. Pollock's resignation in March 1969, President Hester assigned responsibility for the archival program to Professor Still, who, along with Ms. Adam, worked effectively in carrying this endeavor forward. Professor Still and Adam conducted oral interviews with instrumental figures in the University's history, microfilmed a complete set of Council/Board of Trustees minutes, and acquired missing volumes of student newspapers and periodicals. The combined efforts of Dr. Jones and Drs. Pollock and Still ‚Äì over nearly 50 years ‚Äì effectively preserved NYU's historical record. In January 1969, Dr. Pollock expressed to university librarian Dr. Charles F. Gosnell, the need for the consolidation of the historical materials assembled under the ongoing documentary program: \\"The University Archives should be kept in a central place.

In 1986, under the administration of university archivist Tom Frusciano, the archives adopted the new RG/MC system, abandoning the shelf-list arrangement used since the centennial documentary project conducted by Professor Jones. In recent years, the NYU Archives has continued to document the university's history and serve the NYU community under the direction of university archivist Nancy Cricco and assistant university archivist Janet Bunde.

Reception Reviewing the United States premiere, Paul Griffiths of The New York Times criticized the work's repetition, writing, \\"Given that the symphony, in 12 movements, summarized the entirety of creation and human life, the homogeneity that was also found in the musical invention was perplexing. 'Dedication of Merit' -- the last movement, a Buddhist prayer for peace to emanate from virtue -- did not sound so different from 'The Creation of Sentient Beings' (the fourth movement) or, indeed, from most of the rest.\\" He nevertheless added, \\"But none of these was the moment that counted. What mattered was that right at the end, with an emphatic conclusion in sight, Mr. Glass drew back, took his music into darker, more chromatic territory, had his choir re-enter in moaning disconsolateness, and only then moved toward his close.

They were mapped by Norwegian cartographers from air photos taken by the Lars Christensen Expedition (LCE), 1936‚Äì37. Many of the islands and their features were subsequently named by members of the Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition (JARE); unless otherwise noted, features noted in this article were named by JARE. The Flatvaer Islands are separated from L√ºtzow-Holm Bay by Ongul Sound, which is wide and named in association with Ongul Island. On its east margin, opposite East Ongul Island, sits a small cluster of rocks called the Mukai Rocks. The name Mukai-iwa, meaning \\"facing rocks\\" or \\"opposite rocks,\\" was given by JARE Headquarters in 1972.  Ongul and East Ongul Islands  The largest of the Flatvaer Islands is Ongul Island, at long. When initially surveyed, the LCE believed this island to be connected to East Ongul Island, a island immediately east of the northern part of Ongul Island. The LCE applied the name \\"Ongul\\" (\\"fishhook\\"), which is suggestive of the outline of the two islands when taken together. In 1957, the Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition (JARE) discovered that \\"Ongul\\" was actually two islands, separated by the Nakano-seto Strait, meaning \\"central strait\\". The name Ongul Island was retained for the largest island in the group, and the smaller island was given the name East Ongul Island. Showa Station, a Japanese permanent research station, was built on East Ongul Island in 1957. Lake O-ike (\\"big pond\\") is a lake in the east extremity of Ongul Island, so named because it is the largest lake on the island. Sh≈çwa Flat is a small flattish area along the northwest shore of the lake. It was named Sh≈çwa-taira (\\"Emperor Hirohito's era flat\\"), presumably in association with Showa Station.  Minor islands  The northwesternmost island of the Flatvaer Islands is Utholmen Island, meaning \\"the outer island\\". Meholmen Island, meaning \\"the middle island\\", sits between Utholmen and Ongul. Both were named by LCE personnel. East Ongul Island is separated from nearby Nes√∏ya (\\"the point island\\") to the north by the Kitano- seto Strait (\\"northern strait\\"). Nes√∏ya is long, and lies close off the north point of East Ongul Island. It was named by LCE personnel. Antenna Island, named by JARE in 1972, is a tiny island in the strait between Nes√∏ya and East Ongul. Just northwest of the Nakano-seto Strait is a cluster of small islands: Wakadori Island (\\"young-bird island\\"), Hiyoko Island (\\"baby chick island\\"), and Mendori Island (\\"hen island\\"). Mendori Island was named in association with nearby Ondori Island (\\"rooster island\\"), which sits north of Ongul Island. Pollholmen, which is long, is situated off the southeast side of East Ongul Island. LCE personnel named it Pollholmen, meaning \\"bay island\\", presumably because of its location opposite the narrow inlet or bay separating Ongul and East Ongul. To the south, narrow Minamino-seto Strait (\\"southern strait\\") separates Ongul Island from the Te Islands, a group of three small islands and several nearby rocks. Norwegian cartographers, working from air photos taken by LCE personnel, initially mapped the three main islands as one in error, giving it the name Teoya (\\"tea island\\"). JARE personnel later determined the feature was actually be a cluster of islands, but retained the name Te for the group. Ongulgalten Island, meaning \\"the fishhook boar\\", was named by LCE in association with Ongul Island. It is the northernmost of the cluster. Ongulkalven Island lies west of Ongul Island, separated by Nishino- seto Strait (\\"western strait\\"). The island was named \\"Ongulkalven\\" (\\"the fishhook calf\\") in association with Ongul Island by LCE. Kurumi Island (\\"walnut island\\") sits between Ongulkalven and Ongul in the strait. Mame Island (\\"bean island\\") lies west of Ongul.

Biography Bradley was left an orphan when only three years of age. He started life as an errand boy, but his taste for drawing prevailed and at sixteen years of age he began practice as an artist. He took portraits at one shilling each and advertising himself as \\"portrait, miniature, and animal painter, and teacher of drawing.\\" He had a few lessons himself from Mather Brown, then in high repute at Manchester; and at the age of twenty-one went to London, where he was fortunate enough to obtain an introduction to Sir Thomas Lawrence, who gave him encouragement. After remaining some years in the metropolis, in the course of which time he paid occasional visits to Manchester, he finally, in 1847, settled down in the latter town; where, as in London, he enjoyed a large share of patronage. Amongst the portraits painted by him are those of Lords Beresford, Sandon, Denbigh, Bagot, and Ellesmere; Sir E. Kerrison, John Gladstone, B. Heywood, James Emerson Tennent; Col. Currieton, C.B., Col. Anderton, the Rt. Hon. W. E. Gladstone, Sheridan Knowles, W. C. Macready. As an artist Bradley undoubtedly possessed high talent. His heads are remarkable for skillful drawing, and he was not second to any man of the day in producing a striking and intellectual likeness. During his later years his health failed, his mind was affected, and he lost the money he had made in his early career. He died in 1857.

Currently, there are twenty-four titles in the series. Being \\"hardcore\\" wargames, not marketed in normal gaming channels, they were seldom reviewed by mainstream gaming sites or publications. All were reviewed in specialist venues, like The Wargamer. Eastern Front=Smolensk '41 (1999) Covers the First Battle of Smolensk at battalion level. The full campaign map represents an area of 200x300 km (125x186 mi), divided in hexes measuring 1 km (1.6 mi). A turn represents two hours of daytime, or four hours of night. The hex size and turn length were generally maintained in the subsequent games. StrategyPage, a publication whose chief editor is Jim Dunnigan, the author of the 1976 board wargame Panzergruppe Guderian, on which the computer game is loosely based, also reviewed the computer game, and gave Smolensk '41 three different ratings, depending on the audience: two stars for the general gaming public due to excessive complexity (but noting that HPS Simulations did not market the game to this public), \\"four plus\\" stars for the grognard that enjoys fine-grained control over battalion-level units in a game of this scale, but reducing this score for the user interested in more realistic command structures to four stars for the small scenarios, and just three for the grand campaign.http://www.strategypage.com/wargames/articles_reviews/SMOLENSK.asp The Wargamer review appreciated the scale of the game, and its interface, which brought HPS games on par with those from its TalonSoft competitor Campaign series.https://web.archive.org/web/20000304202723/http://www.wargamer.com/reviews/smolensk41_main.asp The editors of Computer Games Strategy Plus named Smolensk '41 the best wargame of 1999, and called it \\"a solid and playable game that offers a lot of value for wargamers.\\" Kharkov '42 (2000) Covers the Soviet spring offensive and the German counter-attack, Operation Frederick, during the Second Battle of Kharkov. The Wargamer review (by a former HPS collaborator) dissected the level of historical realism in the simulation, instead of the game mechanics, which were largely unchanged from the previous iterations. The review found that the terrain behind the front lines felt \\"barren\\" because non-fire support units were abstracted away, which could affect the results of a breakthrough, but that overall, the game was an \\"entry-level wargame\\", \\"not too challenging, with a solid, but narrowly focused research base\\", \\"a kind of interactive historical novel whose fictions are based on fact\\". (On a side note, the reviewer noticed that the historical order of battle, taken from the publications of David Glantz, had to be adjusted by the game designers, because some duplications were found).https://web.archive.org/web/20010401041120/http://www.wargamer.com/reviews/kharkov_42_main.asp Korsun '44 (2002) Captures several Soviet offensives in late 1943 and early 1944 along the Dnieper River: the Kanev airborne assault (four scenarios), the offensive near Kirovograd (two scenarios), and the Battle of the Korsun‚ÄìCherkassy Pocket proper (20 scenarios, with a 240 turns long campaign). The Wargamer reviewer was impressed by campaign notes that ship with the game, which contain \\"a detailed description of how unit ratings were computed and a lengthy bibliography.\\" Several scenarios, which have fairly lopsided orders of battle, are balanced by requiring the attacker to inflict difficult to achieve kill-ratios. The review was critical of some aspects of the interface, in particular the inability to quickly skip over less relevant events during the AI turn, while not missing important events.https://web.archive.org/web/20020806163656/http://www.wargamer.com/reviews/korsun_44/ Kursk '43 (2002) Attempts to portray the Battle of Kursk. Some of the criticism levied at the user interface of the series has been addressed in this game: a fast AI option, avoiding some dialog boxes, and locating units by coordinates. The Wargamer review also analyzed the historical accuracy of the game. Although there are some discrepancies between various historian's accounts of this battle (in particular with respect to losses, see the article on the battle for details), the book of David Glantz and Jonathan House was taken as reference. The reviewer analyzed several scenarios in-detail, and concluded that \\"with the exception of overrating Soviet air power early in the battle, this game is extremely accurate.\\" Rating the level of fun in the game, he found that \\"scenarios with fewer than 40 turns and with relatively small numbers of units are engrossing\\", and suggested that players only try the larger ones afterwards.http://www.wargamer.com/article/1347/panzer- campaigns:-kursk-%2743 This recommendation was echoed by Computer Games Magazine.Computer Games Magazine, April 2003, p. 82 PC Gamer similarly found that \\"firmly grounded on prodigious research, this game is surely the definitive Kursk simulation, and one of the finest titles this prolific designer has ever given us.\\"PC Gamer, April 2003, p. 87 Rzhev '42 (2003) Portrays the less known failure of Operation Mars. A storm condition was added to this game, which is intended to simulate the severe weather in which part of the operation was fought. It halves unit attack and move values, and reduces visibility to one hex. Unlike previous games, which contained historical overviews written by non-professionals, Rzhev '42 comes with a write-up from David Glantz. The usual designer notes, which discuss order of battle balancing, as well achieving historical results, and an extensive bibliography round up the documentation.http://www.wargamer.com/article/1517/panzer- campaigns-9:-rzhev-%2742 Moscow '41 (2005)Stalingrad '42 (2006) Reviewed by Armchair General.http://www.armchairgeneral.com/game-review- stalingrad-42.htm Minsk '44 (2006)Budapest '45 (2007)Kharkov '43 (2010) Covers both Operation Star and Operation Gallop with the objective of completely destroying German forces in southern Russia and the Ukraine taking place 1,000 km west of Stalingrad.

Moscow '42 (2012)=Western Front=Normandy '44 (2000) Covers the initial landings and subsequent breakthrough of Operation Overlord, and consequently employs a smaller scale (down to company level). The Wargamer gave it a positive review, but remarked that the Germans' ability to significantly delay the Allies in the bocage could only be reproduced by using the alternate engagement rules, which prohibit advance and assault on the same phase/turn.https://web.archive.org/web/20001209143500/http://www.wargamer.com/reviews/normandy_44_main.asp The editors of Computer Games Magazine nominated Normandy '44 for their 2000 \\"Wargame of the Year\\" award.

Its reviewer observed that even the optional surrender rules failed to produce the expected numbers of prisoners unless the unit was surrounded, broken (a status meaning it had lost combat cohesiveness), and assaulted. The interface was also criticized for lack of keyboard shortcuts, for modal windows that cover a large portion of the map, and for lack of a pinnable mini-map (jump map). The AI was praised however for managing an occasional surprise.https://web.archive.org/web/20020407183406/http://www.wargamer.com/reviews/bulge_44_main.asp Market-Garden '44 (2003) Attempts to simulate the combined airborne and ground assaults from Operation Market Garden, as well as the German counter- attacks.

Unlike the previous games in the series, no grand campaign is included in this game, but a series of 7 longer scenarios, in addition to 50 smaller ones. A few scenarios feature explicit supply depots with limited stocks (which can be captured, as well) to more closely simulate the limited nature of resources available in desert warfare. Units can also be broken down to company-level in this game.https://web.archive.org/web/20010715210503/http://www.wargamer.com/reviews/tobruk_41_main.asp Sicily '43 (2003) Covers Operation Husky on a map 350 by 190 km.

In order to provide some historical accuracy, when the fog of war is enabled in this game, the player's units can be damaged by their own minefields. (\\"There's no such thing as a friendly minefield\\".) The superior mobility and initiative of Afrika Korps, like the ability to form ad hoc kampfgruppen, is emulated by giving German units a superior command radius, which positively affects morale and supply.http://www.wargamer.com/article/1778/el-alamein-%2742 Salerno '43 (2005)Tunisia '43 (2011)=Pacific=Japan '45 (2019)Japan '46 (2019)= References  External links  * Product page for the series * The designer's page about the series Category:Computer wargames Category:Turn-based tactics video games Category:Multiplayer hotseat games Category:World War II video games Category:Windows games Category:IOS games Category:Android (operating system) games Category:Video games developed in the United States ","title":"Panzer Campaigns"},{"id":"29190628","text":"Andreas Bolek (3 May 1894 in Weinbergen near Lemberg - 5 May 1945 in Magdeburg) was an Austrian politician and a leader in the Nazi Party (NSDAP).www.land-oberoesterreich.gv.at In 1914 he went as an Austrian volunteer in the First World War.

The song's lyrics are about Ibu Pertiwi, the national personification of Indonesia (also interpreted as \\"mother country\\"). It is normally sung by Indonesian children, elementary and secondary school students, or played during Indonesian Independence Day celebrations. In 2016 the Indonesian classical composer, Ananda Sukarlan, made a set of variations for piano based on this song. Lyrics The lyrics are as following: Original lyrics (in Indonesian) First verse: :Kulihat ibu pertiwi :Sedang bersusah hati :Air matanya berlinang :Mas intannya terkenang :Hutan gunung sawah lautan :Simpanan kekayaan :Kini ibu sedang lara :Merintih dan berdoa Second verse: :Kulihat ibu pertiwi :Kami datang berbakti :Lihatlah putra-putrimu :Menggembirakan ibu :Ibu kami tetap cinta :Putramu yang setia :Menjaga harta pusaka :Untuk nusa dan bangsa Translation First verse: :I see Motherland (Ibu Pertiwi: personification of Indonesia) :(She is) in sorrow :Her tears are flowing :Remembering your (lost) golds and diamonds :Forests, mountains, farms, and the seas :Home of the treasures (richness) :Now Mother is grieving :Sighing sadly and praying Second verse: :I see Motherland :We come to serve (you) :Behold your sons and daughters :They will make Mother happy :Mother, we still love (you) :Your faithful sons :Guarding the heirloom :For our homeland and nation Adoption of Christian Hymn music Although the lyrics were originally composed, the music and melody of this adaptation resembled the Christian hymn What a Friend We Have in Jesus, originally written by Joseph M. Scriven as a poem in 1855. The hymn is sung in Indonesian as Yesus Kawan yang Sejati and in Toba Batak as Ise do Alealenta and is popular in Batak churches, as well as in Protestant and Roman Catholic churches. Even though Indonesia has a statistically larger Muslim community, the hymn is quite widely known. Prior his death in 1958, the melody of the music was adopted by Kamsidi Samsuddin, the composer of the Ibu Pertiwi song.

The main aim of EMMA is to ensure a long-term survival and prosperity of a plural, diverse and economically successful magazine publishing industry in the EU. EMMA defends freedom of expression, promotes pluralism and diversity, and ensures that Europe's periodical press industry remains competitive and vibrant. It supports self-regulatory mechanisms, backed up by an equitable and balanced legal framework. EMMA points out that the freedom of commercial communication is an integral part of the overall principle of freedom of expression. Commercial communications are the life-blood of the majority of periodical publications. , EMMA's membership is composed of 21 national associations of magazine publishers and 16 corporate publishing companies in Europe. Altogether EMMA represents over 15,000 publishers (mostly small- and medium-sized enterprises) publishing over 50,000 magazine titles throughout Europe. Mission statement EMMA's mission is \\"to promote and protect the interests of publishers of the periodical press within the European Union thus ensuring the long-term survival and prosperity of a plural, diverse and economically successful magazine publishing industry in the EU\\". EMMA is included in the European Commission's register of interest representatives. History The European representation of magazine publishers was founded in 1988 in Brussels under the French name \\"Federation des associations d'editeurs de periodiques de la C.E.E.\\" (Federation of Associations of Periodical Publishers in the European Economic Community), which originally was abbreviated to FAEP. The goal of the association was, in close collaboration with its members and the authorities of the EEC, to study the regulations governing the activity of periodical publishers, mediate the relations between publishers, the EEC and member states, and to work to maintain the freedom to disseminate information, ideas and knowledge. The name changed to European Federation of Magazine Publishers around 1993, when the EEC became the EU. In October 2011, FAEP transitioned to EMMA, the European Magazine Media Association. However, despite the change in name and aesthetics, the main goals set down in 1988 remain. Today, EMMA defends freedom of expression, thus promoting pluralism and diversity, and ensures that Europe's periodical press industry remains competitive and vibrant.

Relevant EU Policy Initiatives=Advertising Freedom to communicate commercially is a part of freedom of speech. It is often claimed that consumers must be protected through regulation on advertising for food, alcohol, medicines, toys, cars, etc.; bans and restrictions on the advertising of everyday products that every consumer can access freely in the EU will not be accepted by publishers. Applicable law Publishers require legal certainty, as regards defamation and private rights issues, in an age of more cross-border sales and the global nature of the internet. Country of origin is the only solution. Freedom of expression Freedom of Expression is the basis for Freedom of the Press, and consequently a central pillar of a publisher's raison d'√™tre. FAEP defends the freedom of expression, thus promoting pluralism and diversity and ensuring that Europe's periodical press sector remains free. Intellectual Property Publishers encourage adequate protection and reward for those who invest in creativity. Therefore, the enforcement of copyright and strong enforcement of anti-piracy laws and introduction of the work for hire principle across the EU is supported by the periodical press. Information society Regulation that promotes the development of the digital economy, and does not thwart innovation, provides the right framework for a prospering publishing sector in the EU. Publishers demand technology neutral and level playing field as regards data use and protection. VAT (EU VAT) Publishers reject the taxation of reading. A literate and informed population is vital to a \\"knowledge society\\". The costs of illiteracy outweighs the revenues raised by taxing reading.

Biography Boztayev was born 25 June 1933 in Akchatau village in Ayagoz district in Semipalatinsk region. He studied at the Kazakh Mining and Metallurgy Institute as metallurgy engineer. After graduation he worked in the positions of refiner, senior melter, shift master, process engineer, workshop manager. Career=Professional and academic Bozyatev was a full-fledged member of the Academy of National Security Problems research since 1997 (Moscow), an academician of National Academy ‚ÄúEcology‚Äù, an Honorary Citizen of Semipalatinsk town, and Professor emeritus of Semipalatinsk Medical Academy.

Author Boztayev is the author of several books: * From first fire to atom (1956) * Experience of integrated usage of raw materials in Ust-Kamenogorsk lead and zinc plant (1972) * Semipalatinsk Polygon (1992), republished in 2006 * Kaynar syndrome (1995) * Polygon ‚Äì 29 August (1998), republished in Japan. Activism Boztayev made huge contribution in industrial development of East-Kazakhstan and Semipalatinsk regions. One of the first, he exclaimed against continuation of nuclear weapons tests o Semipalatinsk Nuclear Test site (coded telegram to Central Committee of the Communist Party of the USSR addressed to M.S. Gorbachev, 20 February 1989), which was the first official document for stopping nuclear tests. Despite the resistance of military‚Äìindustrial complex of USSR, which supported continuation of nuclear tests, Boztayev consistently and persistently pursued policy for ending tests for two and a half years. On 29 August 1991 Semipaltinsk Nuclear test site was closed by the Decree of the President of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbaev. While being first secretary of Semipalatinsk regional committee of Communistic Party of Kazakhstan, he supported democratic reforms in late 1980s in Kazakhstan, and anti-nuclear movement ‚ÄúNevada-Semipalatinsk‚Äù, which later on emerged in powerful international movement for the closure of nuclear test site. Boztayev requested the Russian Military industrial complex to declassify materials regarding the effects of nuclear tests and to transfer this information to Kazakhstan. He also sought financial aid to the region of the Semipalatinsk polygon and improvement of the socio-economic conditions of the population. He also insisted on creation and operation of a special commission for radio- ecological and health assessment of residents of region. Based on the results of a state commission, an important decision was made: materials concerning ecological effects by nuclear tests were declassified and transferred to Kazakhstan. At the same time, instructions for the creation of an expert medical and social assessment commission and conference were given. Based on the initiative of Boztayev, the first All Soviet Union ‚ÄúHealth of the population and ecological situation in Semipalatinsk region‚Äù Conference was conducted 17‚Äì19 July 1989 in Semipaltinsk; it revealed to the world for the first time the consequences of nuclear tests. It was at this conference that the Resolution for closing Semipalatinsk nuclear test site was adopted. Boztayev is an author and initiator of the ‚ÄúSocial protection of citizens who suffered as a result of nuclear tests conducted in Semipalatinsk nuclear test site‚Äù law passed 18 December 1992. In 1996, Boztayev, along with several famous public figures of Kazakhstan, organized the international charitable foundation ‚ÄúPolygon ‚Äì 29 August‚Äù Boztayev created a program of medical rehabilitation for sufferers from nuclear explosions (Kazakhstan Government decree ‚Ññ 336, 17.03.1997), and one of the first to drawing attention and practical aid of the world community to the problems of suffered population of Semey region.

Latham, The African and the Cinema: An Account of the Work of the Bantu Educational Cinema Experiment during the Period March 1935 to May 1937 (London: Edinburgh House Press, 1937). The project involved educational films played by mobile cinemas to educate the black (\\"bantu\\") people. About 35 such films, on 16mm, were produced between 1935 and 1937, when the Carnegie grant expired. The project was led by J. Merle Davis, director of the International Missionary Council's Department of Social and Industrial Research; George Chitty Latham, former head of Northern Rhodesia's Education Department; and Major Leslie Allen Notcutt, a former plantation manager in Kenya. BEKE productions were low-quality silent films with naive plots that usually involved a \\"wise guy\\" (giving the good example) prevailing over a \\"stupid guy\\" (impersonating bad habits). While some actors were black, everything else in the production was British, building on a stereotypical representation of Africa and Africans. The main teachings conveyed by the films were about hygiene, methods of cash crop cultivation and cooperative marketing; others were \\"prestige films\\" that highlighted the institutions of British rule.

Since 1799, it has served as the community's town hall, and is one of three surviving 18th-century town halls in Belknap County still used for that purpose. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1998.  Description and history  The New Hampton Town House stands in what is now a relatively rural context, on the north side of Town House Road at its junction with Dana Hill Road. It is a vernacular single-story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. It is covered by a side gable roof, with brick chimneys at either end. The main facade is five bays wide, with a center entrance sheltered by a gabled portico supported by square posts. The entry is flanked by paired Greek Revival pilasters, with simpler pilasters found at the building corners. A series of small ells extend to the rear of the main block. The interior of the main block is principally occupied by a large chamber, with the additions providing space for a stage, kitchen, and other facilities. The stage curtain has been painted with a depiction of the building. New Hampton was incorporated in 1777, and its early town meetings were apparently held in local homes or barns. The town voted in 1798 to appropriate funds for the construction of a meeting house, which was also to be funded by the sale of pews. By 1799 the building was sufficiently complete to house town meetings. As built, it was a typical late-18th century meeting house, with a second story gallery space and outside stairs. Because the building's religious function was dedicated to the Congregationalists, the local Free Will Baptists in the town built their own meeting house nearby, the Dana Meeting House. The building was used for religious services by a declining Congregationalist group that finally disbanded in 1842. There is some evidence that a Baptist congregation also used the building for a time, but there was repeated discussion within the town over the need to update the building beginning in the 1840s. These discussions were finally acted upon in 1872, when the gallery level was removed along with the outside stairs, and the roof was lowered to its present height. The building was electrified in the 1930s, and the stage and kitchen were added in 1940.

This album is pre-released in Chile in a special deluxe edition. This album uses a special 36 tone scales per octave -instead of the usual 12 and is therefore a pioneering work in the use of alternate tunings in rock and pop music.

It is housed in an 1895 Renaissance Revival building that was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. Architecture and history The Gordon-Nash Library is located in the village center of New Hampton, on the south side of Main Street opposite the New Hampton School. The building consists of the original 1895 building, to which several additions have been made to the rear. The original building is a single-story masonry structure, built out of gold-colored bricks and covered by a hip roof. It has a three-part front facade, whose defining element is a central projecting hip-roof section. It has a central arched entrance, with a brownstone surround including pilasters and an entablature above the keystoned arch. The outer left section has three sash windows sharing a brownstone lintel, which are separated from transom-like windows by a similar header. The outer right section only has square windows in the transom positions. The library was established on paper in 1887 by Stephen Gordon Nash, whose childhood home had been home for a time to a private subscription library founded in 1818. Nash died in 1894, having purchased land for the library building, but made no further steps toward creating the institution. In his will, he dedicated $10,000 for the construction of a building, and left the residue of his estate as an endowment for its maintenance. The building was erected in 1895 to a design by James E. Fuller of Fuller & Delano, architects based in Worcester, Massachusetts. It was the first purpose-built library building in Belknap County.

It is located on College Avenue in Beaver, Pennsylvania.  History  The Beaver Area Memorial Library started as a small collection of books in the basement of the Beaver Trust Co. (Now Huntington Bank) in the 1940s and was run by the Beaver Civic Club. It eventually moved into the basement of a former high school on College Avenue in Beaver. In 1948, the Beaver County courts granted a charter for the official formation of the Beaver Memorial Library. In early 1949, an old house on the corner of Insurance and Fourth Streets was leased from the Beaver Area school district for the price of one dollar per year. With the help of local merchants who donated materials and labors, the old house was completely renovated. The library was officially open to the public on September 17, 1949 with Mrs. W. Wallace Rinehart as its librarian and Miss Jean Sebring as her assistant. By April 1950, the library already had a reported collection of over 4,000 books. By 1959, the expanding library had outgrown its quarters on Insurance and Fourth, so the Board of Trustees purchased property on River Road and College Avenue to be used for a new building. A fundraiser was started in Beaver County in 1961 to raise the $130 thousand to build the new establishment. Due to the support of citizens county wide, the name of the library was changed in 1961 to the Beaver Area Memorial Library to reflect this support. The new building, which continues to serve as the public library today, was officially dedicated on April 8, 1962 and open to the public. Over the next fourteen years, the library continued to expand. By 1974 library services and clientele had increased by almost five-fold. Because of this growth, the Board of Trustees put into work an expansion of this building which was finished in 1980. This addition added at a cost of nearly $140 thousand. The library soon outgrew this new addition, and the necessity for yet another addition arose. This time, was added to the library; expanding storage space, increasing the children's library, enhancing the work area, and allowing more computers to be added to suit growing public demand for them. During this addition, landscaping and the exterior appearance of the library underwent significant improvements. In total, the new renovations costs a total of $1 million.

Membership in SURS is attained through employment with 61 employing agencies,SURS Participating Employers Retrieved 2012.01.13 including public universities, community colleges, and other qualified state agencies. Eligible employees are automatically enrolled in SURS when employment begins., Chicago State Universities - SURS  History  The Governor and General Assembly founded the University Retirement System in 1941 as an administrator of benefits for employees of the University of Illinois. In the following years, the system grew to include other universities, colleges, and affiliated agencies throughout the state. In 1963, the system adopted its current name,, SUAA SURS History State Universities Retirement System (SURS). SURS employs approximately 132 individuals in its Champaign, Illinois and Naperville, Illinois offices and provides retirement, survivor, disability, and death benefits. SURS serves over 228,000 active and inactive members and benefit recipients throughout the world., SURS Website Booklet SURS is considered a component unit of the State of Illinois‚Äô financial reporting entity and is included in the state's financial reports as a pension trust fund. SURS is governed by Section 5/15, Chapter 40, of the Illinois Compiled Statutes.  Mission  To secure and deliver the retirement benefits promised to our members., About SURS  Membership  SURS serves a diverse group of members with occupations ranging from professors and teachers to clerical, building service workers, and groundskeepers. Unlike many other public pension systems, SURS is the sole source of retirement income for its participants. The state/employer does not contribute to Social Security on the employee's behalf and there is no coordinated benefit for SURS-covered employment from Social Security upon retirement. Receipt of a SURS annuity may reduce, or eliminate entirely, his or her Social Security benefit at retirement under the Windfall Elimination Provision or the Government Pension Offset, Illinois State Social Security & SURS annuity Participation in the State Universities Retirement System (SURS) is mandatory for all eligible University employees. The employee contribution to the system is 8% of the gross salary. University employees do not contribute to Social Security. SURS contributions are deducted from your pay on a pre-tax basis, and income taxes will be due when you make withdrawals at retirement. Eligible employees must select one of the three SURS plan options (Traditional, Portable, or Self-Managed) within 6 months of your date of hire. This is a lifetime, irrevocable decision., University of Illinois Retirement and Investment Plans  Funding History  Prior to 1989, 15-155 provided the employer contribution should be \\"sufficient to meet the requirements of this Article in accordance with actuarial determinations.\\" The statute further provided that in no event were employer contributions from state appropriations to be less than an amount which, when added to contributions from other sources, is less than the total accruing normal costs plus interest at the prescribed rate on the unfunded accrued liabilities. Public Act 86-273, effective August 23, 1989, attempted to add some particularity. It provided: \\"Starting with the fiscal year which ends in 1990, the state's contribution shall be increased incrementally over a 7 year period so that by the fiscal year which ends in 1996, the minimum contribution to be made by the State shall be an amount that, when added to other sources of employer contributions, is sufficient to meet the normal cost and amortize the unfunded liability over 40 years as a level percentage of payroll, determined under the projected unit credit actuarial cost method. The State contribution, as a percentage of the applicable employee payroll, shall be increased in equal annual increments over the 7 year period until the funding requirement specified above is met.\\", SURS Funding History People EX REL. Sklodowski V. STATE The General Assembly and the Governor did not live up to the provisions of this amended 15-155. A Class action suit was brought against the State for failure to live up to the provisions of the funding program established in public act 86-273. The case went to the Illinois Supreme Court, where the court ruled, in 1994, that participants and retirement systems have neither a constitutional or a vested contractual right to enforce statutory funding obligations., PEOPLE SKLODOWSKI v. STATE  Benefit Packages  Upon enrollment with SURS members must choose one of three retirement options.  Traditional Benefit Package  This is the historical SURS defined benefit retirement plan. Unless a member chooses one of the other plans within a specified period of time they are automatically enrolled in the traditional plan. Until 1998 it was the only SURS plan available. It provides lifetime retirement benefits and provides for a survivor benefit at no additional cost., Illinois Pension Code 40 ILCS 5 - SURSTraditional Benefit Member Guide. State of Illinois, 2008, p. 1.  Portable Benefit Package  This is also a Defined Benefit retirement plan that has much in common with the Traditional Benefit Package. However, it provides a more generous separation refund if you leave the system. But the provisions for survivor benefits require a reduction to the retirement and death benefits.  Self-Managed Plan (SMP)  This is a Defined Contribution plan that establishes an account in your name into which your contributions and the employer (State of Illinois) contributions are placed. You decide how your account balance will be invested, selecting from a variety of mutual funds and variable annuities., University of Illinois, SURS Self-Managed Plan  Reciprocity  SURS has reciprocity only with other Illinois public retirement systems in determining your eligibility for, and amount of, SURS retirement and survivor benefits. These other systems are: * County Employees' Annuity and Benefit Fund of Cook County * Forest Preserve District Employees' Annuity and Benefit Fund of Cook County * General Assembly Retirement System * Illinois Municipal Retirement Fund * Judges Retirement System of Illinois * Laborers' Annuity and Benefit Fund * Metropolitan Water Reclamation District Retirement Fund * Municipal Employees' Annuity and Benefit Fund of Chicago * Park Employees' Annuity and Benefit Fund of Chicago * Public School Teachers' Pension and Retirement Fund of Chicago * State Retirement Systems of Illinois * State Teachers' Retirement System The Illinois Retirement Systems Reciprocal Act ensures that pension credits remain in the system in which they are earned. You may not transfer your credits from one system to another. You will be entitled to a retirement annuity from each system, and you survivor(s) will qualify for a survivors annuity, if: * You have at least 1 year of pension credit in more than one of the retirement systems; and * Your combined service credits are equal to the longest minimum service requirement of any of the systems in which you have credit.Traditional Benefit Member Guide. State of Illinois, 2008, p. 6.  SURS Investment Program History  SURS has been developing its investment program since the early 1980s, when Illinois, like many other states, changed its laws to allow the state pension funds to adopt modern investment practices. At the same time, the new laws established a high standard of fiduciary responsibility, namely adopting the prudent expert rule. Those changes permitted the investment program to modernize, resulting in investment income and gains of more than $13.6 billion over the past twenty-five years. This growth in assets has been achieved during a time when the fund has earned 10.0 percent per year. During this same period, funding by the State of Illinois fell far short of both the actuarial and statutory requirements, missing an opportunity for SURS to significantly reduce, if not eliminate, its unfunded liability.  Investment Managers  As of December 31, 2008, SURS uses 40+ direct investment managers, of which 20+ are minority-owned or female-owned. SURS also has 17+ indirect investment managers, all of which are minority-owned or female-owned. Minority-owned and female-owned investment managers invest over 10% of the System's total assets. More than 25% of the SURS portfolio is indexed or passively managed.

She served in the Imperial German Navy during World War I. The battleship was laid down in November 1911 and launched on 4 June 1913. She was formally commissioned into the Imperial Navy on 1 October 1914, just over two months after the outbreak of war in Europe. Markgraf was armed with ten guns in five twin turrets and could steam at a top speed of . Markgraf was named in honor of the royal family of Baden. The name Markgraf is a rank of German nobility and is equivalent to the English Margrave, or Marquess. Along with her three sister ships, , , and , Markgraf took part in most of the fleet actions during the war, including the Battle of Jutland on 31 May and 1 June 1916. At Jutland, Markgraf was the third ship in the German line and heavily engaged by the opposing British Grand Fleet; she sustained five large-caliber hits and her crew suffered 23 casualties. Markgraf also participated in Operation Albion, the conquest of the Gulf of Riga, in late 1917. The ship was damaged by a mine while en route to Germany following the successful conclusion of the operation. After Germany's defeat in the war and the signing of the Armistice in November 1918, Markgraf and most of the capital ships of the High Seas Fleet were interned by the Royal Navy in Scapa Flow. The ships were disarmed and reduced to skeleton crews while the Allied powers negotiated the final version of the Treaty of Versailles. On 21 June 1919, days before the treaty was signed, the commander of the interned fleet, Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, ordered the fleet to be scuttled to ensure that the British would not be able to seize the ships. Unlike most of the scuttled ships, Markgraf was never raised for scrapping; the wreck is still sitting on the bottom of the bay.  Design  alt=Schematics for this type of battleship; the ships mount five gun turrets, two forward, one in the center between two smoke stacks, and two aft The four s were ordered as part of the Anglo-German naval arms race; they were the fourth generation of German dreadnought battleships, and they were built in response to the British that had been ordered in 1909. The K√∂nigs represented a development of the earlier , with the primary improvement being a more efficient arrangement of the main battery. The ships had also been intended to use a diesel engine on the center propeller shaft to increase their cruising range, but development of the diesels proved to be more complicated than expected, so an all-steam turbine powerplant was retained. Markgraf displaced as built and fully loaded, with a length of , a beam of and a draft of . She was powered by three Bergmann steam turbines, with steam provided by three oil-fired and twelve coal-fired boilers, which developed a total of and yielded a maximum speed of . The ship had a range of at a cruising speed of . Her crew numbered 41 officers and 1,095 enlisted men. She was armed with ten SK L/50 guns arranged in five twin gun turrets: two superfiring turrets each fore and aft and one turret amidships between the two funnels. Her secondary armament consisted of fourteen SK L/45 quick-firing guns and six SK L/45 quick-firing guns, all mounted singly in casemates. As was customary for capital ships of the period, she was also armed with five underwater torpedo tubes, one in the bow and two on each beam. Markgrafs 8.8 cm guns were removed and replaced with four 8.8 cm anti-aircraft guns. The ship's armored belt consisted of Krupp cemented steel that was thick in the central portion that protected the propulsion machinery spaces and the ammunition magazines, and was reduced to forward and aft. In the central portion of the ship, horizontal protection consisted of a deck, which was reduced to on the bow and stern. The main battery turrets had of armor plate on the sides and on the roofs, while the casemate guns had of armor protection. The sides of the forward conning tower were also 30 cm thick.  Service history  Markgraf was ordered under the provisional name Ersatz Weissenburg and built at the AG Weser shipyard in Bremen under construction number 186. Her keel was laid in November 1911 and she was launched on 4 June 1913. At her launching ceremony, the ship was christened by Frederick II, Grand Duke of Baden, the head of the royal family of Baden, in honor of which the ship had been named. Fitting-out work was completed by 1 October 1914, the day she was commissioned into the High Seas Fleet. Following her commissioning, Markgraf conducted sea trials, which lasted until 12 December. By 10 January 1915, the ship had joined III Battle Squadron of the High Seas Fleet with her three sister ships. On 22 January 1915, III Squadron was detached from the fleet to conduct maneuver, gunnery, and torpedo training in the Baltic. The ships returned to the North Sea on 11 February, too late to assist I Scouting Group at the Battle of Dogger Bank. In the aftermath of the loss of at the Battle of Dogger Bank, Kaiser Wilhelm II removed Admiral Friedrich von Ingenohl from his post as fleet commander on 2 February. Admiral Hugo von Pohl replaced him as commander of the fleet; von Pohl carried out a series of sorties with the High Seas Fleet throughout 1915. The first such operation‚ÄîMarkgrafs first with the fleet‚Äîwas a fleet advance to Terschelling on 29‚Äì30 March; the German fleet failed to engage any British warships during the sortie. Another uneventful operation followed on 17‚Äì18 April, and another three days later on 21‚Äì22 April. Markgraf and the rest of the fleet remained in port until 29 May, when the fleet conducted another two-day advance into the North Sea. On 11‚Äì12 September, Markgraf and the rest of III Squadron supported a minelaying operation off Texel. Another uneventful fleet advance followed on 23‚Äì24 October. Vice Admiral Reinhard Scheer became commander in chief of the High Seas Fleet on 18 January 1916 when Admiral von Pohl became too ill from liver cancer to continue in that post. Scheer proposed a more aggressive policy designed to force a confrontation with the British Grand Fleet; he received approval from the Kaiser in February. The first of Scheer's operations was conducted the following month, on 5‚Äì7 March, with an uneventful sweep of the Hoofden. Another sortie followed three weeks later on the 26th, with another on 21‚Äì22 April. On 24 April, the battlecruisers of Rear Admiral Franz von Hipper's I Scouting Group conducted a raid on the English coast. Markgraf and the rest of the fleet sailed in distant support. The battlecruiser struck a mine while en route to the target, and had to withdraw. The other battlecruisers bombarded the town of Lowestoft unopposed, but during the approach to Yarmouth, they encountered the British cruisers of the Harwich Force. A short artillery duel ensued before the Harwich Force withdrew. Reports of British submarines in the area prompted the retreat of I Scouting Group. At this point, Scheer, who had been warned of the sortie of the Grand Fleet from its base in Scapa Flow, also withdrew to safer German waters.  Battle of Jutland  Maps showing the maneuvers of the British (blue) and German (red) fleets on 30‚Äì31 May 1916 Markgraf was present during the fleet operation that resulted in the Battle of Jutland which took place on 31 May and 1 June 1916. The German fleet again sought to draw out and isolate a portion of the Grand Fleet and destroy it before the main British fleet could retaliate. Markgraf was the third ship in the German line, behind her sisters K√∂nig and Grosser Kurf√ºrst and followed by Kronprinz. The four ships made up V Division of III Battle Squadron, and they were the vanguard of the fleet. III Battle Squadron was the first of three battleship units; directly astern were the Kaiser-class battleships of VI Division, III Battle Squadron. III Squadron was followed by the and es of I Battle Squadron; in the rear guard were the obsolescent pre-dreadnoughts of II Battle Squadron. Shortly before 16:00 the battlecruisers of I Scouting Group encountered the British 1st Battlecruiser Squadron under the command of Vice Admiral David Beatty. The opposing ships began an artillery duel that saw the destruction of , shortly after 17:00, and , less than half an hour later. By this time, the German battlecruisers were steaming south to draw the British ships toward the main body of the High Seas Fleet. At 17:30, K√∂nigs crew spotted both I Scouting Group and the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron approaching. The German battlecruisers were steaming to starboard, while the British ships steamed to port. At 17:45, Scheer ordered a two-point turn to port to bring his ships closer to the British battlecruisers, and a minute later, the order to open fire was given. Markgraf opened fire on the battlecruiser at a range of . Markgraf and her two sisters fired their secondary guns on British destroyers attempting to make torpedo attacks against the German fleet. Markgraf continued to engage Tiger until 18:25, by which time the faster battlecruisers managed to move out of effective gunnery range. During this period, the battleships and of the 5th Battle Squadron fired on the leading German battleships. At 18:10, one of the British ships scored a 15-inch (38 cm) shell hit on Markgraf. Shortly thereafter, the destroyer fired a single torpedo at Markgraf and missed from a range of about . fired a torpedo at Markgraf at 19:05, but the torpedo missed due to the long range. Around the same time, Markgraf engaged a cruiser from the 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron before shifting her fire back to the 5th Battle Squadron for ten minutes. During this period, two more 15-inch shells hit Markgraf, though the timing is unknown. The hit at 18:10 struck on a joint between two 8-inch-thick side armor plates; the shell burst on impact and holed the armor. The main deck was buckled and approximately of water entered the ship. The other two shells failed to explode and caused negligible damage. A K√∂nig-class battleship firing her main guns at Jutland, by Claus Bergen Shortly after 19:00, the German cruiser had become disabled by a shell from the British battlecruiser ; Rear Admiral Paul Behncke in K√∂nig attempted to position his four ships to cover the stricken cruiser. Simultaneously, the British III and IV Light Cruiser Squadrons began a torpedo attack on the German line; while advancing to torpedo range, they smothered Wiesbaden with fire from their main guns. The obsolescent armored cruisers of the 1st Cruiser Squadron also joined in the melee. Markgraf and her sisters fired heavily on the British cruisers, but even sustained fire from the battleships' main guns failed to drive them off. Markgraf fired both her 30.5 cm and 15 cm guns at the armored cruiser . Under a hail of fire from the German battleships, Defence exploded and sank; credit is normally given to the battlecruiser , though Markgrafs gunners also claimed credit for the sinking. Markgraf then fired on the battlecruiser and scored two hits. The first hit struck the 9-inch armor covering \\"X\\" barbette, was deflected downward, and exploded after penetrating the 1-inch deck armor. The crew for the left gun were killed, the turret was disabled, and the explosion caused serious damage to the upper deck. The second shell penetrated Princess Royals 6-inch belt armor, ricocheted upward off the coal bunker, and exploded under the 1-inch deck armor. The two shells killed 11 and wounded 31. At the same time, Markgrafs secondary guns fired on the cruiser , which was seriously damaged by 15 heavy shells and forced to withdraw. Warrior foundered on the trip back to port the following morning. Around 19:30, Admiral John Jellicoe's main force of battleships entered the battle; began firing at Markgraf at 19:32; she fired four salvos of 13.5-inch Armor-Piercing, Capped (APC) shells and scored a hit with the last salvo. The shell exploded upon impacting the armor protecting the No. 6 15 cm gun casemate. The shell failed to penetrate but holed the armor and disabled the gun. The explosion seriously injured two and killed the rest of the gun crew. A heavy shell nearly struck the ship at the same time, and at 19:44, a bent propeller shaft forced Markgrafs crew to turn off the port engine; naval historian John Campbell speculated that this shell was the one that damaged the shaft. Her speed dropped to , though she remained in her position in the line. Painting of a K√∂nig-class ship under fire at Jutland by Claus Bergen Shortly after 20:00, the German battleships engaged the 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron; Markgraf fired primarily 15 cm shells. In this period, Markgraf was engaged by s 12-inch guns, which scored a single hit at 20:14. The shell failed to explode and shattered on impact on the 8-inch side armor, causing minimal damage. Two of the adjoining 14-inch plates directly below the 8-inch armor were slightly forced inward and some minor flooding occurred. The heavy fire of the British fleet forced Scheer to order the fleet to turn away. Due to her reduced speed, Markgraf turned early in an attempt to maintain her place in the battle line; this, however, forced Grosser Kurf√ºrst to fall out of formation. Markgraf fell in behind Kronprinz while Grosser Kurf√ºrst steamed ahead to return to her position behind K√∂nig. After successfully withdrawing from the British, Scheer ordered the fleet to assume night cruising formation, though communication errors between Scheer aboard and , the lead ship, caused delays. Several British light cruisers and destroyers stumbled into the German line around 21:20. In the ensuing short engagement Markgraf hit the cruiser five times with her secondary guns. The fleet fell into formation by 23:30, with Grosser Kurf√ºrst the 13th vessel in the line of 24 capital ships. Around 02:45, several British destroyers mounted a torpedo attack against the rear half of the German line. Markgraf initially held her fire as the identities of the destroyers were unknown. But gunners aboard Grosser Kurf√ºrst correctly identified the vessels as hostile and opened fire while turning away to avoid torpedoes, which prompted Markgraf to follow suit. Heavy fire from the German battleships forced the British destroyers to withdraw. At 05:06, Markgraf and several other battleships fired at what they thought was a submarine. The High Seas Fleet managed to punch through the British light forces without drawing the attention of Jellicoe's battleships, and subsequently reached Horns Reef by 04:00 on 1 June. Upon reaching Wilhelmshaven, Markgraf went into harbor while several other battleships took up defensive positions in the outer roadstead. The ship was transferred to Hamburg where she was repaired in AG Vulcan's large floating dock. Repair work was completed by 20 July. In the course of the battle, Markgraf had fired a total of 254 shells from her main battery and 214 rounds from her 15 cm guns. She was hit by five large-caliber shells, which killed 11 men and wounded 13.  Subsequent operations  Following repairs in July 1916, Markgraf went into the Baltic for trials. The ship was then temporarily assigned to I Scouting Group for the fleet operation on 18‚Äì19 August. Due to the serious damage incurred by Seydlitz and at Jutland, the only battlecruisers available for the operation were and , which were joined by Markgraf, Grosser Kurf√ºrst, and the new battleship . The British were aware of the German plans, and sortied the Grand Fleet to meet them. By 14:35, Scheer had been warned of the Grand Fleet's approach and, unwilling to engage the whole of the Grand Fleet just 11 weeks after the decidedly close engagement at Jutland, turned his forces around and retreated to German ports. Markgraf was present for the uneventful advance in the direction of Sunderland on 18‚Äì20 October. Unit training with III Squadron followed from 21 October to 2 November. Two days later, the ship formally rejoined III Squadron. On the 5th, a pair of U-boats grounded on the Danish coast. Light forces were sent to recover the vessels, and III Squadron, which was in the North Sea en route to Wilhelmshaven, was ordered to cover them. During the operation, the British submarine torpedoed both Grosser Kurf√ºrst and Kronprinz and caused moderate damage. For most of 1917, Markgraf was occupied with guard duties in the North Sea, interrupted only by a refit period in January and periodic unit training in the Baltic.  Operation Albion  Map showing the movements of the German Navy and Army to seize Riga and the islands in the Gulf In early September 1917, following the German conquest of the Russian port of Riga, the German navy decided to eliminate the Russian naval forces that still held the Gulf of Riga. The Admiralstab (Navy High Command) planned an operation to seize the Baltic island of √ñsel, and specifically the Russian gun batteries on the Sworbe Peninsula. On 18 September, the order was issued for a joint operation with the army to capture √ñsel and Moon Islands; the primary naval component was to comprise the flagship, Moltke, along with III and IV Battle Squadrons of the High Seas Fleet. III Squadron consisted of the four K√∂nig-class ships, and was by this time augmented with the new battleship Bayern. IV Squadron consisted of the five Kaiser-class battleships. Along with nine light cruisers, three torpedo boat flotillas, and dozens of mine warfare ships, the entire force numbered some 300 ships, supported by over 100 aircraft and six zeppelins. The invasion force amounted to approximately 24,600 officers and enlisted men. Opposing the Germans were the old Russian pre-dreadnoughts and , the armored cruisers , , and , 26 destroyers, and several torpedo boats and gunboats. Three British C-class submarines were also stationed in the Gulf. The Irben Strait, the main southern entrance to the Gulf of Riga, was heavily mined and defended by a number of coastal artillery batteries. The garrison on √ñsel numbered nearly 14,000 men, though by 1917 it had been reduced to 60 to 70 percent strength. The operation began on 12 October, when Moltke and the four K√∂nig-class ships covered the landing of ground troops by suppressing the shore batteries covering Tagga Bay. Markgraf fired on the battery located on Cape Ninnast. After the successful amphibious assault, III Squadron steamed to Putziger Wiek, although Markgraf remained behind for several days. On the 17th, Markgraf left Tagga Bay to rejoin her squadron in the Gulf of Riga, but early on the following morning she ran aground at the entrance to Kalkgrund. The ship was quickly freed, and she reached the III Squadron anchorage north of Larina Bank on the 19th. The next day, Markgraf steamed to Moon Sound, and on the 25th participated in the bombardment of Russian positions on the island of Kyn√∂. The ship returned to Arensburg on 27 October, and two days later was detached from Operation Albion to return to the North Sea. Markgraf struck a pair of mines in quick succession while in the Irben Strait and took in of water. The ship continued on to Kiel via Neufahrwasser in Danzig; she then went on to Wilhelmshaven, where the mine damage was repaired. The work was completed at the Imperial Dockyard from 6 to 23 November. After repairs were completed, Markgraf returned to guard duty in the North Sea. She missed an attempted raid on a British convoy on 23‚Äì25 April 1918, as she was in dock in Kiel from 15 March to 5 May for the installation of a new foremast.  Fate  Painting of Markgraf entering the Firth of Forth Markgraf and her three sisters were to have taken part in a final fleet action at the end of October 1918, days before the Armistice was to take effect. The bulk of the High Seas Fleet was to have sortied from their base in Wilhelmshaven to engage the British Grand Fleet. Scheer‚Äîby now the Grand Admiral (Gro√üadmiral) of the fleet‚Äîintended to inflict as much damage as possible on the British navy in order to obtain a better bargaining position for Germany, despite the expected casualties. However, many of the war-weary sailors felt the operation would disrupt the peace process and prolong the war. On the morning of 29 October 1918, the order was given to sail from Wilhelmshaven the following day. Starting on the night of 29 October, sailors on and then on several other battleships, including Markgraf, mutinied. The unrest ultimately forced Hipper and Scheer to cancel the operation. Informed of the situation, the Kaiser stated, \\"I no longer have a navy.\\" Following the capitulation of Germany in November 1918, most of the High Seas Fleet ships, under the command of Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, were interned in the British naval base in Scapa Flow. Prior to the departure of the German fleet, Admiral Adolf von Trotha made clear to von Reuter that he could not allow the Allies to seize the ships, under any conditions. The fleet rendezvoused with the British light cruiser , which led the ships to the Allied fleet that was to escort the Germans to Scapa Flow. The massive flotilla consisted of some 370 British, American, and French warships. Once the ships were interned, their guns were disabled through the removal of their breech blocks, and their crews were reduced to 200 officers and enlisted men. alt=A map designating the locations where the German ships were sunk. The fleet remained in captivity during the negotiations that ultimately produced the Treaty of Versailles. Von Reuter believed that the British intended to seize the German ships on 21 June 1919, which was the deadline for Germany to have signed the peace treaty. Unaware that the deadline had been extended to the 23rd, Reuter ordered the ships to be sunk at the first opportunity. On the morning of 21 June, the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers, and at 11:20 Reuter transmitted the order to his ships. Markgraf sank at 16:45. The British soldiers in the guard detail panicked in their attempt to prevent the Germans from scuttling the ships; they shot and killed Markgrafs captain, Walter Schumann, who was in a lifeboat, and an enlisted man. In total, the guards killed nine Germans and wounded twenty-one. The remaining crews, totaling some 1,860 officers and enlisted men, were imprisoned. Markgraf was never raised for scrapping, unlike most of the other capital ships that were scuttled. Markgraf and her two sisters had sunk in deeper water than the other capital ships, which made any salvage attempt more difficult. The outbreak of World War II in 1939 put a halt to all salvage operations, and after the war it was determined that salvaging the deeper wrecks was financially impractical. The rights to future salvage operations on the wrecks were sold to Britain in 1962. Owing to the fact that the steel that composed their hulls was produced before the advent of nuclear weapons, Markgraf and her sisters are among the few accessible sources of low-background steel, which has occasionally been removed for use in scientific devices. Markgraf and the other vessels on the bottom of Scapa Flow are a popular dive site, and are protected by a policy barring divers from recovering items from the wrecks. In 2017, marine archaeologists from the Orkney Research Center for Archaeology conducted extensive surveys of Markgraf and nine other wrecks in the area, including six other German and three British warships. The archaeologists mapped the wrecks with sonar and examined them with remotely operated underwater vehicles as part of an effort to determine how the wrecks are deteriorating. The wreck at some point came into the ownership of the firm Scapa Flow Salvage, which sold the rights to the vessel to Tommy Clark, a diving contractor, in 1981. Clark listed the wreck for sale on eBay with a \\"buy-it-now\\" price of ¬£250,000, with the auction lasting until 28 June 2019. Three other wrecks‚Äîthose of Kronprinz Wilhelm, K√∂nig, and the light cruiser ‚Äîall also owned by Clark, were also placed for sale. The wrecks of Markgraf and her two sisters ultimately sold for ¬£25,500 apiece to a company from the Middle East, while Karlsruhe sold to a private buyer for ¬£8,500.

The ships had also been intended to use a diesel engine on the center propeller shaft to increase their cruising range, but development of the diesels proved to be more complicated than expected, so an all-steam turbine powerplant was retained. Grosser Kurf√ºrst displaced as built and fully loaded, with a length of , a beam of and a draft of . She was powered by three AEG-Vulcan steam turbines, with steam provided by three oil-fired and twelve coal-fired Schulz- Thornycroft water-tube boilers, which developed a total of and yielded a maximum speed of . The ship had a range of at a cruising speed of . Her crew numbered 41 officers and 1,095 enlisted men. She was armed with ten SK L/50 guns arranged in five twin gun turrets: two superfiring turrets each fore and aft and one turret amidships between the two funnels. Her secondary armament consisted of fourteen SK L/45 quick-firing guns and six SK L/45 quick-firing guns, all mounted singly in casemates. As was customary for capital ships of the period, she was also armed with five underwater torpedo tubes, one in the bow and two on each beam. The ship's armored belt consisted of Krupp cemented steel that was thick in the central portion that protected the propulsion machinery spaces and the ammunition magazines, and was reduced to forward and aft. In the central portion of the ship, horizontal protection consisted of a deck, which was reduced to on the bow and stern. The main battery turrets had of armor plate on the sides and on the roofs, while the casemate guns had of armor protection. The sides of the forward conning tower were also 30 cm thick.  Service history  Grosser Kurf√ºrst was ordered under the provisional name Ersatz Kurf√ºrst Friedrich Wilhelm and built at the AG Vulcan shipyard in Hamburg under construction number 4. Her keel was laid in October 1911 and she was launched on 5 May 1913. At her launching ceremony, Prince Oskar of Prussia christened the ship. Due to the heightening political tensions in Europe in mid-1914, the final construction work was accelerated, so the first set of dockyard trials were conducted on 15 July, and fitting-out work was completed by the 30th, the day she was commissioned into the High Seas Fleet. After her commissioning, she underwent sea trials in the Baltic. The ship's first combat operation was the Raid on Yarmouth on 2‚Äì3 November 1914. The raid was conducted by the battlecruisers of Rear Admiral Franz von Hipper's I Scouting Group. She and the other dreadnoughts sailed in distant support of Hipper's force. After a brief bombardment, the German fleet withdrew to port. On 7 December, she sustained no damage when she accidentally rammed her sister . Her second operation, the raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby, followed on 15‚Äì16 December. On the evening of the 15th, the German battle fleet of some twelve dreadnoughts and eight pre-dreadnoughts came to within of an isolated squadron of six British battleships. However, skirmishes between the rival destroyer screens in the darkness convinced Admiral Friedrich von Ingenohl, the fleet commander, that he was faced with the entire Grand Fleet. Under orders from Kaiser Wilhelm II to avoid risking the fleet unnecessarily, von Ingenohl broke off the engagement and turned the battlefleet back toward Germany. On 22 January 1915, she and the rest of III Squadron were detached from the fleet to conduct maneuver, gunnery, and torpedo training in the Baltic. They returned to the North Sea on 11 February, too late to assist I Scouting Group at the Battle of Dogger Bank. Following the loss of at the Battle of Dogger Bank, the Kaiser removed von Ingenohl from his post on 2 February. Admiral Hugo von Pohl replaced him as commander of the fleet. She then took part in several sorties into the North Sea. On 29 March, she sailed with the fleet out to Terschelling without any contact with the enemy. Another fleet advance occurred on 22 April, again without result. On 23 April, III Squadron returned to the Baltic for another round of exercises lasting until 10 May. She participated in a fleet advance into the North Sea from 29 until 31 May which ended without combat. The ship covered a minelaying operation on 11‚Äì12 September off Texel. Another uneventful fleet advance followed on 23‚Äì24 October. She ended the year with a two-week training cruise in the Baltic, which lasted from 5 to 20 December. Another round of exercises in the Baltic followed on 18‚Äì23 January 1916. She went into drydock in Wilhelmshaven for periodic maintenance on 12 February. Work lasted until 3 March; two days later the ship sailed for a sweep into the Hoofden, though this again failed to encounter any British forces. The fleet conducted another sortie on 23 March to the Amrun Bank, followed by another a month later to Horns Reef on 21‚Äì22 April. On 24‚Äì25 April, Hipper's battlecruisers conducted another bombardment of the English coast; Grosser Kurf√ºrst and the rest of the High Seas Fleet sailed in support. The battlecruisers left the Jade Estuary at 10:55 CET, and the rest of the High Seas Fleet followed at 13:40. The battlecruiser struck a mine while en route to the target, and had to withdraw. The other battlecruisers bombarded the town of Lowestoft unopposed, but during the approach to Yarmouth, they encountered the British cruisers of the Harwich Force. A short artillery duel ensued before the Harwich Force withdrew. Reports of British submarines in the area prompted the retreat of I Scouting Group. At this point, Admiral Reinhard Scheer, who had been warned of the sortie of the Grand Fleet from its base in Scapa Flow, also withdrew to safer German waters.  Battle of Jutland  Maps showing the maneuvers of the British (blue) and German (red) fleets on 31 May ‚Äì 1 June 1916 Grosser Kurf√ºrst was present during the fleet operation on 31 May and 1 June 1916 that resulted in the Battle of Jutland. The German fleet again sought to draw out and isolate a portion of the Grand Fleet and destroy it before the main British fleet could retaliate. She was the second ship in the German line, behind her sister K√∂nig and followed by Markgraf and Kronprinz. The four ships made up V Division of III Battle Squadron, and they were the vanguard of the fleet. III Battle Squadron was the first of three battleship units; directly astern were the Kaiser-class battleships of VI Division, III Battle Squadron. III Squadron was followed by the and es of I Battle Squadron; in the rear guard were the obsolescent pre-dreadnoughts of II Battle Squadron. Shortly before 16:00 the battlecruisers of I Scouting Group encountered the British 1st Battlecruiser Squadron under the command of David Beatty. The opposing ships began an artillery duel that resulted in the destruction of , shortly after 17:00, and less than half an hour later. By this time, the German battlecruisers were steaming south to draw the British ships toward the main body of the High Seas Fleet. At 17:30, K√∂nigs crew spotted both I Scouting Group and the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron approaching. The German battlecruisers were steaming to starboard, while the British ships steamed to port. At 17:45, Scheer ordered a two-point turn to port to bring his ships closer to the British battlecruisers, and a minute later, the order to open fire was given. Grosser Kurf√ºrst engaged the battlecruiser at a range of . Simultaneously, her secondary guns fired on British destroyers attempting to make torpedo attacks against the German fleet. The faster British ships began to pull away from their pursuers, and at 18:00 she was forced to shift fire from Princess Royal to the battleship , though by 18:16 Valiant too had moved out of range. Her shells straddled Valiant four times and her gunners incorrectly claimed a hit on the British ship. The ship did not escape unscathed herself though; at 18:09 she was hit by a shell from either the battleships or . The shell struck the water some from the ship and either ricocheted or exploded, impacting the hull approximately from the bow. The hit caused no significant damage. During this period, she claimed three hits from her 15 cm battery on a destroyer, which was most likely . At 18:22, the ship briefly fired her secondary guns at the destroyer at extreme range, without scoring a hit. At the same time, Grosser Kurf√ºrst came back into range of the battleship Valiant, and engaged her with her two forward turrets. The ship fired for eight minutes, though her shots all fell short of their target. A K√∂nig-class battleship firing her main guns at Jutland, by Claus Bergen Shortly after 19:00, the German cruiser had become disabled by a shell from the British battlecruiser ; Rear Admiral Paul Behncke in K√∂nig attempted to maneuver his four ships to cover the stricken cruiser. Simultaneously, the British 3rd and 4th Light Cruiser Squadrons began a torpedo attack on the German line; while advancing to torpedo range, they smothered Wiesbaden with fire from their main guns. Grosser Kurf√ºrst and her sisters fired heavily on the British cruisers, but even sustained fire from the battleships' main guns failed to drive off the British cruisers. She fired a pair of salvos at extremely close range from her main guns at the armored cruiser , which, under heavy fire from several German capital ships, exploded and sank at 19:19. Observers aboard the ship noted that both salvos hit Defence, though did not ascribe credit for the latter's destruction to the hits. She then shifted fire to the armored cruiser , which was heavily damaged and forced to withdraw. Warrior foundered on the trip back to port the following morning. By 20:00, the German line was ordered to turn eastward to disengage from the British fleet, commanded by Admiral John Jellicoe. Shortly thereafter, four British light cruisers from the 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron resumed the attacks on the crippled Wiesbaden; the leading German battleships, including Grosser Kurf√ºrst, opened fire on the cruisers in an attempt to drive them off. She began firing at 20:07, at ranges between . Despite the heavy fire, the British cruisers managed to escape without serious damage. At around the same time, the British fleet came back into range and seven battleships took V Division under heavy fire. Grosser Kurf√ºrst was hit seven times, four hits occurring at 20:18 and 20:19. Three of the hits were from the guns of , though her gunners incorrectly claimed a fourth hit. The remaining four hits came from the 15-inch guns of or Valiant. One of the 15-inch shells destroyed the No. 2 port-side 15 cm gun, and another struck the main belt and burst on impact. Though it did not penetrate the belt, it forced the plating in by as much as for a length of some . Damage control teams managed to temporarily stop the resulting flooding, after approximately of water had entered the ship. The flooding caused a list of 4¬∞, though counter-flooding efforts reduced it to less than a degree. As the battle continued, the flooding worsened, and by the time she reached Helgoland the following morning, an estimated of water had entered the ship. More hits were sustained, but these shells burst on impact and caused relatively minor damage. Painting of a K√∂nig-class ship under fire at Jutland by Claus Bergen The heavy fire of the British fleet forced Scheer to order the fleet to turn away; this turn reversed the order of the fleet and placed her toward the end of the line. After successfully withdrawing from the British, Scheer ordered the fleet to assume night cruising formation, though communication errors between Scheer, aboard , and , the lead ship, caused delays. The fleet fell into formation by 23:30, with Grosser Kurf√ºrst the 15th vessel in the line of 24 capital ships. Around 02:45, several British destroyers mounted a torpedo attack against the rear half of the German line; she spotted six unidentified destroyers in the darkness. She engaged them with her 15 cm and 8.8 cm guns while turning away to avoid any torpedoes that might have been launched. She scored one 15 cm hit on the destroyer at a range of about , disabling one of Nessuss boilers. Heavy fire from the German battleships forced the British destroyers to withdraw. The High Seas Fleet managed to punch through the British light forces without drawing the attention of Jellicoe's battleships, and subsequently reached Horns Reef by 04:00 on 1 June. Off Helgoland, Grosser Kurf√ºrst had taken in so much water that she was forced to reduce speed. She fell out of formation, but later rejoined the fleet outside the Schillig roadstead. Upon reaching Wilhelmshaven, she went into harbor while several other battleships took up defensive positions in the outer roadstead. The ship was transferred to Hamburg where she was repaired in AG Vulcan's large floating dock. Repair work was completed by 16 July. In the course of the battle, she fired a total of 135 shells from her main battery and 216 rounds from her 15 cm guns. She was hit by eight large-caliber shells, which killed fifteen men and wounded ten.  Subsequent operations  alt=The gun turrets of a battleship. A gray airship flies overhead Following completion of the repair work, Grosser Kurf√ºrst conducted training maneuvers in the Baltic until 4 August. Admiral Scheer attempted a repeat of the original Jutland plan on 18‚Äì19 August. The battlecruiser squadron, however, had been reduced to only two operational ships‚Äî and ‚Äîso Grosser Kurf√ºrst, Markgraf, and the newly commissioned were temporarily transferred to the squadron. The British were aware of the German plans, and sortied the Grand Fleet to meet them. By 14:35, Scheer had been warned of the Grand Fleet's approach and, unwilling to engage the whole of the Grand Fleet just 11 weeks after the decidedly close call at Jutland, turned his forces around and retreated to German ports. Unit training with III Squadron followed from 21 October to 2 November. Two days later, the ship formally rejoined III Squadron. On the 5th, a pair of U-boats grounded on the Danish coast. Light forces were sent to recover the vessels, and III Squadron, which was in the North Sea en route to Wilhelmshaven, was ordered to cover them. The British submarine torpedoed Grosser Kurf√ºrst some northwest of Horns Reef. The torpedo destroyed the port-side rudder and flooded the rudder rooms, though the ship maintained a speed of . She returned to the AG Vulcan dockyard, where she was repaired from 10 November to 9 February. That same day, while in transit to Kiel, the ship ran aground off Krautsand in the Elbe river. Damage was minimal and the ship proceeded to unit training in the Baltic, but on the return to the North Sea on 4 March, she accidentally rammed Kronprinz. Her bow was pushed in, necessitating repairs in the Imperial Dockyard in Wilhelmshaven until 22 April. Grosser Kurf√ºrst rejoined the fleet on 23 April and conducted training with the rest of III Squadron in the Baltic from 17 May to 8 June. After returning to the North Sea the ship was assigned to security duties in the German Bight. Another round of exercises in the Baltic followed on 11‚Äì23 September. She then sailed to Putziger Wiek to prepare for Operation Albion, the planned conquest of the islands off Riga. On 12 October, Grosser Kurf√ºrst took up a position in Tagga Bay off Cape Ninnast. But she struck a mine while maneuvering into firing position, which allowed around of water into the ship. Despite the mine damage, the ship continued with the bombardment of Russian coastal guns on the Cape. She was detached from the invasion force later that day; she sailed to Wilhelmshaven via Kiel, where repairs were completed by 1 December. Upon her return to service, Grosser Kurf√ºrst resumed picket duties in the Bight. She was present during the abortive anti-convoy operation on 23‚Äì25 April 1918. While entering the lock outside Wilhelmshaven following the conclusion of the operation, the ship was damaged. She was back in dock for repairs from 27 April to 2 May. At the end of the month, Grosser Kurf√ºrst ran aground just off the Helgoland's north harbor. The ship's port-side propeller shaft was bent, necessitating repairs at the Imperial Dockyard in Kiel from 2‚Äì9 June and 21‚Äì31 July. She finally rejoined the fleet on 12 August.  Fate  Painting of Grosser Kurf√ºrst steaming to internment alt=A map designating the locations where the German ships were sunk. Grosser Kurf√ºrst and her three sisters were to have taken part in a final fleet action at the end of October 1918, days before the Armistice was to take effect. The bulk of the High Seas Fleet was to have sortied from their base in Wilhelmshaven to engage the British Grand Fleet; Scheer‚Äîby now the Grand Admiral (Gro√üadmiral) of the fleet‚Äîintended to inflict as much damage as possible on the British navy, in order to retain a better bargaining position for Germany, despite the expected casualties. However, many of the war-weary sailors felt the operation would disrupt the peace process and prolong the war. On the morning of 29 October 1918, the order was given to sail from Wilhelmshaven the following day. Starting on the night of 29 October, sailors on and then on several other battleships mutinied. On the 31st, Scheer ordered the fleet dispersed; Grosser Kurf√ºrst and the rest of III Squadron was sent to Kiel. On 4 November, the ship's crew joined the general mutiny and hoisted the red flag of the Socialists. The unrest ultimately forced Hipper and Scheer to cancel the operation. When informed of the situation, the Kaiser stated, \\"I no longer have a navy.\\" Following the capitulation of Germany in November 1918, most of the High Seas Fleet's ships, under the command of Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, were interned in the British naval base in Scapa Flow. Prior to the departure of the German fleet, Admiral Adolf von Trotha made clear to von Reuter that he could not allow the Allies to seize the ships, under any conditions. The fleet rendezvoused with the British light cruiser , which led the ships to the Allied fleet that escorted the Germans to Scapa Flow. The massive flotilla consisted of some 370 British, American, and French warships. Once the ships were interned, their guns were disabled through the removal of their breech blocks, and their crews were reduced to 200 officers and men. The fleet remained in captivity during the negotiations that ultimately produced the Versailles Treaty. Von Reuter believed that the British intended to seize the German ships on 21 June 1919, which was the deadline for Germany to have signed the peace treaty. Unaware that the deadline had been extended to the 23rd, Reuter ordered the ships to be sunk at the next opportunity. On the morning of 21 June, the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers, and at 11:20 Reuter transmitted the order to his ships. Grosser Kurf√ºrst sank at 13:30; unlike her sisters, she was ultimately raised on 29 April 1938 and sold for scrapping in Rosyth. Her bell was sold and was used for many years as a garden ornament. It was sold at auction in March 2014 and was bought by the National Museum of the Royal Navy, Portsmouth, Hampshire.

It is commonly known as the tree pincushion in English or goudsboom in Afrikaans. They natural occur near Cape Town, South Africa. Two subspecies are distinguished. L. conocarpodendron subsp. conocarpodendron, that has greyish leaves because they have a covering of felty hairs. L. conocarpodendron subsp. viridum, has green leaves that lack felty hairs. Flowers can be found between August and December.  Leucospermum conocarpodendron  Early etching of Leucospermum conocarpodendron (left) and two Protea species by Arabella Elizabeth RoupellL. conocarpodendron is an evergreen large shrub of high and in diameter with a rounded crown, which is rigid because of the thick branching at approximately right angles, and with a firm trunk of in diameter that is covered by thick greyish, reddish or blackish bark with a netting of fissures. The flowering branches are rigid, 1‚Äì1¬Ω cm (0.4‚Äì0.6 in) thick and covered with a dense layer of white or greyish crinkly hairs or long soft silky hairs. The leaves lack a leaf stalk and stipules, ovate to lance-shaped with the greater width often beyond midlength 6‚Äì11¬Ω cm (2.4‚Äì4.6 in) long and 2¬Ω‚Äì5 cm (1‚Äì2 in) wide, with a blunt or pointy tip, shallow or deeply incised with three to ten teeth. Dependent on the subspecies, the surface og=f the leaves is either hairless or has a dense covering of soft, greyish, convoluted hairs, occasionally with a fringe of fine hairs. The flower heads sit atop a stalk of about 1¬Ω cm (0.6 in) long, are globe- to egg-shaped, and in diameter. They can be found individually or mostly with two or three together near the tip of the branch, regularly partly enclosed by leaves. The common base of the flowers of the same head is narrowly cone-shaped with a pointy tip, 2¬Ω‚Äì3 cm (1‚Äì1.2 in) long and 1‚Äì1¬Ω cm (0.4‚Äì0.6 in) in diameter. The bracts that subtend the flower head are oval in shape with a point tip, 1¬º‚Äì1¬Ω cm (0.5‚Äì0.6 in) long and approximately wide, tightly overlapping, with a rubbery consistency and softly hairy. The bracts supporting the individual flowers enclose them at their base, have a suddenly pointed tip, and are about long, and about wide, rubbery in consistency, woolly at the base and less so near the top. The perianth is 3¬Ω‚Äì5 cm (1.4‚Äì2.0 in) long and yellow in colour. The lower 1 cm (0.4 in) is fused, cylindric, and hairless. The free parts of the four perianth claws curl back when the flower opens, those to the sides and facing the rim of the flower head densely set with long hairs. The one facing the center of the head minutely powdery or very shortly softly hairy. The perianth limbs are lance-shaped with a pointy tip, long, and have long hairs pressed to the surface, except for the one facing the center that is minutely powdery. The style is stout, 1‚Äì1¬Ω mm (0.04‚Äì0.06 in) thick and 4¬Ω‚Äì5¬Ω cm (1.8-2.2 in) long, at first bent towards the center of the flower head but getting more straight with age. It is topped by a slight thickening that is called the pollen presenter, which has a broad conical shape with a pointy tip, is long and about wide. Subtending the ovary are four lance-shaped scales with a pointy tip of about long. The subtribe Proteinae, to which the genus Leucospermum has been assigned, consistently has a basic chromosome number of twelve (2n=24).  Differences between the subspecies  The grey tree pincushion or vaalkreupelhout in Afrikaans (subsp. conocarpodendron) has felty hairy leaves due to a dense cover of fine crisped hairs, while the green tree pincushion or groenkreupelhout (subsp. viridum) has green hairless adult leaves, sometimes with a fringe of hairs around the edge. At one location, on the east side of Little Lion's Head near Mount Rhodes, a hybrid swarm between both subspecies is found, where individual plants may have hairiness anywhere between that of both parents. Elsewhere, the populations are uniform and can easily be assigned to either of the subspecies.  Differences with related species  L. conocarpodendron differs from its nearest relatives by its tree-like habit, the narrowly cone-shaped common base of the flower heads, the oval involucral bracts with a pointy tip, and the broad cone-shaped pollen presenter.  Taxonomy  The earliest known description of the species we now know as Leucospermum conocarpodendron was by Paul Hermann in Paradisus Batavus, a book describing the plants of the Hortus Botanicus Leiden (botanical garden of the Leyden university), that was published in 1689, three years after his death. He called it Salix conophora Africana (African cone- bearing willow), based on his observation of Leucospermum conocarpodendron on the lower slopes of the Table Mountain. In the following six decades, several other descriptions were published, such as by Leonard Plukenet, James Petiver, John Ray and Herman Boerhaave. Names published before 1753, the year that was chosen as a starting point for the binominal nomenclature proposed by Carl Linnaeus, are not valid however. The tree pincushion was first validly described in the first edition of Species Plantarum as Leucadendron conocarpodendron by Linnaeus in 1753. Johann Jacob Reichard in 1779 reassigned the species to Protea, creating the new combination P. conocarpodendron. In 1781, Carl Peter Thunberg simplified the species name and created P. conocarpa, but because he used the same type as Linnaeus, he should have used the unchanged name. Richard Anthony Salisbury created two superfluous names, Protea tortuosa in 1796 and Leucadendrum crassicaule in 1809. In his book On the natural order of plants called Proteaceae that Robert Brown published in 1810, the species was reassigned to the new genus Leucospermum, but he combined it with Brown's invalid simplified species name to Leucospermum conocarpum. In 1874, Heinrich Wilhelm Buek made the correct combination Leucospermum conocarpodendron. Another form was described by Michael Gandoger in 1901, and he called it Leucospermum macowanii. In 1970, John Patrick Rourke proposed to distinguish between the typical subspecies (L. conocarpodendron subsp. conocarpodendron) and L. conocarpodendron subsp. viridum. L. conocarpodendron is the type species of the section conocarpodendron. The species and subspecies name conocarpodendron means \\"tree bearing cone-shaped fruits\\". The subspecies name viridum means \\"green\\" and is a reference to the leaves' colour. It was called kreupelhout in Dutch (cripple wood) already before 1680, a reference to the twisted branches that together give the tree a \\"crippled\\" appearance.  Distribution, habitat and ecology  L. conocarpodendron subsp. conocarpodendron is an endemic of the Cape Peninsula where it is limited to the eastern slopes of Devils Peak, the northern and western slopes of Table Mountain and the Black Table, to Llandudno. It grows mainly on heavy clay derived from the weathering of Cape Granite but also weathered Table Mountain Sandstone. It prefers north and west exposures that are well drained. L. conocarpodendron subsp. viridum has a much wider distribution that borders on that of the typical subspecies. It occupies the remainder of the Cape Peninsula from Kirstenbosch to the Cape of Good Hope. In addition, it occurs from the upper Berg River Valley, via Pringle Bay and Hermanus to Stanford. Isolated populations can also be found at Helderberg, Simonsberg, and Kogelberg near Durbanville. It occurs on such different soil types as Malmesbury gravel, sand from weathered Table Mountain Sandstone, dune sands, permanently soggy peat, and sometimes on the heavy clay that remains if Cape Granite is decomposed. It mostly grows between sea level and , sometimes 300 m altitude. At some locations this pincushion is dominant and develops dense stands. Both subspecies have some resistance for the wildfires that occur in the fynbos every one or two decades, because the trunk is covered by a thick bark. After the fire has burnt away the soft parts, regrowth takes place from the tip of the higher branches. Repeated mild burning results in an umbrella shaped growth habit. Seed dispersal and survival greatly depends on the symbiosis of many Proteaceae with native ant species, in particular Anoplolepis steingroeveri and Pheidole capensis, that carry the fruits to their underground nests, where the elaiosome is eaten, leaving a slick and hard seed underground, safe from consumption by rodents and birds and overhead fires. The seeds would germinate after a fire, due to the larger temperature variations after the overhead vegetation has vanished and chemicals from the charcoal seep with the winter rains and soak the seeds. Seed dispersal is only limited. In an experiment, seeds on average were moved about 2 m (6¬Ω ft) and at most about 10 m. The absence or presence of the elaiosome did not effect the germination rate, but a field trial showed that seeds without elaiosome almost never survive a fire, whereas those with elaiosome all germinated, implying that the burial of the seed by the ants is essential.  Conservation  Leucospermum conocarpodendron subsp. conocarpodendron is well protected in the Table Mountain National Park, where it is locally abundant. The subspecies is nonetheless regarded a vulnerable species as a significant part of its range was lost due to urbanization and land conversion to gum plantations and invasive plant species. Further housing developments of the Cape Town agglomerations could threaten remaining habitat. Alien ant species have driven back native ants. The alien ants eat the elaiosome on the spot, so that the seed is not protected against consumption or fire. Due to the proximity of housing areas, wildfires in its range are suppressed and so allow the fynbos to develop into a thicket less suitable for the grey tree pincushion, causing the fires when they eventually occur to be hotter because of more biomass, which results in more plants dying. Finally, subsp. viridum is planted in gardens within the range of subsp. conocarpodendron, which will lead to hybridization between the subspies. This occurs even when the plants are quite far apart as both subspecies are bird pollinated. This could eventually lead to the extinction of subsp. conocarpodendron.

Orton Award.\\" Bulletin of the Orton Society XXIV (1974): 7-10. Childs, along with several colleagues, opened an organization to help create dyslexia awareness called The Orton Society (later renamed International Dyslexia Association), in 1949, and she held the position as vice-president from 1959 to 1965. She published several educational books for dyslexia and was recognized for her accomplishments in 1973 with the Samuel T. Orton Award. Personal life Sally Burwell McCall was born on June 10, 1905, in New York City. At the age of sixteen, she began teaching in a summer church school program, and graduated from the Ethical Culture School in New York. She then went on to Columbia University, where she obtained a bachelor's degree in education. She remained in New York and taught in the New York public school system from 1945 through 1964. On August 1, 1925, McCall married Ralph Childs and together they had twin daughters, Sarah and Elizabeth. Career When one daughter began to stutter, Childs contacted Anna Gillingham, one of her teachers from the Ethical Culture School. After Gillingham observed both of the Childs children, she diagnosed them with a specific language disability. Childs became interested in this learning disorder and, under the supervision of Anna Gillingham and Bessie Stillman, she began conducting her own research on dyslexia. When one of her mentors, Dr. Samuel T. Orton, died in 1948, Childs and some of her colleagues began The Orton Society, to further the research, education, and treatment of dyslexia. Childs was voted in as the vice-president in 1959, and she held that title until 1965. She opened the Dallas branch of The Orton Society, and co-founded the New York branch. While she was vice-president, Childs established the Anna Gillingham Fund, a fund to acknowledge Anna Gillingham's contributions to education and to help fund teacher training of dyslexic students. Sally was also the recipient of the 1973 Samuel T. Orton Award, for her ‚Äúoutstanding work in the field of specific language disabilities‚Äù. When Ms. Gillingham died, Mrs. Childs took over the supervision of her training programs, and later developed further training programs herself. She also published several books, including Sound Phonics1, Sound Spelling2, The Childs Spelling Rules3, Magic Squares4, and The Childs Phonics Proficiency Scales5. The Sally B. Childs Fund formed in her name in 1987, which established help to fund teachers that could not afford the training for teaching dyslexic students.

It was founded in April 2009 in Phoenixville, Pennsylvania to provide education to adults who do not fit the prevailing model of higher education. The Sphere College Project is not currently a degree-granting institution.Berg, Joel It's His Very Own College, and Welcome to It, Chronicle of Higher Education, May 22, 2011.Pettit, Leeann A new learning environment offered at Sphere College, The Phoenix, January 9, 2010.Reddy, Michael, Sphere College: Rising from the Ashes in Phoenixville?, Yoga Living Magazine, March/April 2010.  Educational philosophy  The educational philosophy of The Sphere College Project is influenced by other experimental institutions, including Black Mountain College and Hampshire College, and incorporates elements of self-organization. The underlying principle behind the organizational structure of the institution is that no one individual is capable of having sufficient knowledge of the system to completely design it beforehand. The institution reacts to its needs in real- time and must provide sufficient infrastructure to ensure progress toward the common goal, embodied in the mission statement. Since students process information in different ways, the institution must adjust to support their individual learning styles. The philosophy is based on the following disciplines, including the sciences (human/computer interaction; digital communication networks; digital gaming); the arts; and the humanities.  Program of study  The program of study proposed by The Sphere College Project proceeds in three phases: * In Phase I, Self and Other, students embark upon a journey to acquire a deeper understanding of themselves, and to develop their understanding of how similarly and differently people experience the world: to discover what motivates the beliefs and actions of humanity. This is accomplished primarily through reading, discussing and writing about works of literature and philosophy and their relationship to contemporary issues and the students‚Äô own experiences. It also involves activities in the arts, sciences and humanities. In this phase students will seek to identify the direction of their future studies. * Phase II, Tool Acquisition, involves the acquisition of interdisciplinary knowledge and skills to support and implement the student‚Äôs goals. * In Phase III, Action, students draw upon their continually-developing knowledge to put their passion into action by implementing a project that is a good fit for the student. Movement through the phases will proceed according to the schedule of the student. The Sphere College Project is not currently a degree-granting institution. It may, in the future, award degrees and seek accreditation.  References  External links  * Official website for The Sphere College Project * What Should Go in the Former Site of Sphere College?

BDB handles 98% of diamond exports from India. History In 1984, the project was started by a group of Mumbai-based diamond traders. Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority gave 20 acres on an 80 years lease. The project initially involved the public sector Minerals and Metals Trading Corporation. It withdrew from the project later and BDB took it over from there. Then it was restarted in 1992.

The Justice Department initially sought, but then abandoned its search for, a Middle East suspect. The book was published in April 2004 by Nelson Current Publishers, and became a New York Times best-seller. In contrast to conspiracy theories that the bombing was a false flag attack perpetrated by elements of the US government, the book presents a theory that links the Oklahoma City bombers to agents of Iraq and Al-Qaeda, operating under Iranian state sponsorship.  Evidence and theory  Gathering the affidavits of twenty-two eyewitnesses and twenty-three hundred pages of corroborative documentation, the author theorizes that there was a third terrorist named Hussain Hashem Al-Hussaini, an Iraqi soldier in the first Gulf War, who was the \\"John Doe 2\\", who allegedly accompanied McVeigh to the Murrah Federal building in the ammonia nitrate fuel oil-ladened Ryder truck. The Federal Bureau of Investigation account of April 19, 1995 is that it was simply a domestic terrorism case, however Davis cites a CNN/USA Today poll that 68 percent of Americans believe other bombing conspirators are \\"still out there\\". Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA) visited Terry Nichols in prison in 2005 and Rohrabacher claims Nichols would not speculate about \\"John Doe 2\\" but claimed there were unknown others involved in the attack, a statement first made to the FBI during the investigation. Nichols stated his belief that the 1995 bombing that claimed the lives of 168 Americans was a \\"Middle Eastern\\" terrorist operation, however Nichols statements about events leading up to the attack are self-contradictory. It was theorized that why Nichols would not implicate those involved by name was that he still has immediate and extended family members who could be targets of retaliation.

Within the report the following statements citing several pieces of real and circumstantial evidence were made, supporting the main theory laid out by Jayna Davis in her book. \\"...of all the cities in the world, convicted terrorist Ramzi Yousef and Terry Nichols were in Cebu City in the Philippines at the same time three months before the Oklahoma City bombing. Yousef was the perpetrator of the first World Trade Center attack as well as the mastermind behind the planning of other high-profile attacks on Americans. Furthermore, Ramzi Yousef's phone records, from the months before he detonated the first World Trade Center bomb in early 1993, show calls placed to the Filipina neighbor and close friend of Terry Nichols' in-laws in Queens, New York. The opportunity for interaction between American terrorist, Nichols, and al-Qaeda terrorist, Yousef, is evident.\\" \\"One indicator that this terrorist act had broader implications came directly from Abdul Hakim Murad, Yousef's roommate, childhood friend, and fellow convicted terrorist. On the day of the bombing, Murad claimed responsibility for this terrorist act from his jail cell in New York. He bragged to his prison guards, verbally and in writing, that the bombing of the Murrah federal building was the work of the \\"Liberation Army.\\" His confession was similar to the one Yousef had made two years earlier in the immediate aftermath of the first attempt to destroy the World Trade Center. Hours after he drove a Ryder truck into the garage of the north tower of the World Trade Center and detonated the deadly bomb, Yousef called the FBI from a pay phone in Newark International Airport and boasted that the \\"Liberation Army\\" had conducted the attack. He then boarded a plane and escaped, ending up in Manila, Philippines. Note: the Oklahoma City Bombing followed a similar pattern to the 1993 attack on the World Trade Center ‚Äîa rental truck loaded with ammonium-based explosives, using similar detonation devices, based on the strategy of driving a vehicle into or near a target.\\" Another key piece of evidence that Jayna Davis used to build the case in her book for Middle Eastern involvement was the fact that Hussain Al-Hussaini \\"was one of a group of Iraqis hired to do odd jobs for a Palestinian landlord, Samir Khalil, who owned properties throughout the area. Khalil hired the Iraqi newcomers, supposedly refugees from the first Gulf War, to maintain his rental properties. Khalil himself served time for insurance fraud in the early 1990s. Hussaini resembles John Doe Two and was identified by witnesses on the scene.\\" The connections by Davis in her book linking McVeigh to Murad, Yousef and the former Iraqi soldiers was made not only through Terry Nichols connection in the Philippines, but by the suspected John Doe 2, Hussain Al-Hussaini, to Samir Khalil who according to \\"the discovery of a published list of un- indicted coconspirators from the first World Trade Center bombing that includes the name Samir Khalil.\\"  Notes  Category:2004 non-fiction books Category:American non-fiction books Category:Books about terrorism Category:Books about conspiracy theories Category:Islamic terrorism in the United States Category:Works about the Oklahoma City bombing ","title":"The Third Terrorist"},{"id":"29191742","text":"The Women's rhythmic individual ribbon event took place on October 14, 2010 at the Indira Gandhi Arena.

Boca de Potrerillos is an archeological site located some 14 km from the municipal head of Mina, Nuevo Le√≥n, M√©xico. About 60 km north east from Monterrey within the inter-sierra valleys of the Sierra Madre Oriental is the ‚Äúmouth‚Äù or entrance to the Potrerillos Canyon between the Zorra and Antrisco hills. The site covers an area of about 6 km¬≤. The main feature of this site is containing one of the largest concentrations of rock art in Mexico. Although there are some paintings, the vast majority of works are petroglyphs; there are approximately 3,000 in the √°rea. The site The site has been known as Boca Potrerillos since the 19th century because it forms the entrance to the Potrerillos Canyon, being between the El Antrisco and the Zorra Hills. The archaeological vestiges are distributed among three main topographical forms: a) An extensive alluvial range to the east with hundreds of known pre-Hispanic ovens and thousands of carving stone tools and grinding artifacts scattered on the surface; b) A second range to the west of the area, containing (though on a smaller scale), the same elements of the eastern range, and c) The eastern flank of the Antrisco and Zorra hills, where thousands of engraved rocks were found with carvings in one or more of their sides, that makes it one of the most extensive and most important petroglyphs sites in the country. The Boca de Potrerillos archaeological site is located in a quite inhospitable region today. It dominates a desert landscape with very little or no water sources with the typical vegetation of the area: cactus. However the amount of art embodied in the rocks and studies on the technique, style, etc., in which they were made, suggest a prolonged occupation of human groups at different intervals. Carbon-14 dating testing made on the ovens found in the area as well as oxidation studies of the graphical work and patina indicate that the first human settlement could have been installed here as early as 8900 BC and some of the engravings would be from this period. 1 Archaeologists work has achieved differentiating over 25 plant species in the region, now extinct, evidence that the zone was different and friendlier to humans. The site had some importance at the end of the 18th century as a sugar cane producer; it also had some relevance during the 1910 Mexican Revolution, but after the introduction of cattle to the zone and government efforts to send water from state water wells to the city of Monterrey, the site is more arid than ever before. Site Characteristics The presence of hundreds of pre-Hispanic ovens or furnace stoves, the infinity of stone tools and thousands of rock engraved images commonly known as petroglyphs, evidence the lengthy and important socio economical and ritual development of native groups that exploited and maintained an environmental equilibrium in the region up to the Spaniards' arrival. The enormous size of the site, the depth of their deposits and the lack of financial resources hampered extensive excavations. However, because of the sedimentation type and climatic conditions in the area, the archaeological ovens, retained coal content inside up till today. From excavations 20 oven samples were obtained at various depths, which were carbon 14 dated from 6,960 BC., up to 1,760 AD; this long chronology is an extended sequence of 8,000 years of native cultural development in the northeast region of Mexico. Samples were taken adjacent to each furnace and milling stones washed to recognize possible vegetal remains through pollen and phytoliths strata identification. It was possible to distinguish over 25 species, indicating the existence of a more humid habitat different from the current desert conditions. Among the vegetal discoveries, some edible items were found such as Typha, Pecan, walnut, tuna, Nopal and mesquite pods. Also discovered other plants requiring a more humid area such as Juncus, aquatic plants, Nettles, and reeds. Other detected species corresponding to trees are Acacia, Willow, holm oak and pine that are no longer found on the site or nearby communities. Within the ample inventory of stone artifacts rescued and analyzed, the following is an example: 1\\\\. A large variety of arrow heads with various shapes, such as wide stalk with round base, triangular simple body, elongated and fin shaped; 2\\\\. Scrapers in crescent moon shape, circular and spike, others large of the Clear Fork type, characteristic of 3000 BC; 3\\\\. Small plates with incisions as amulets with portable representations of petroglyphs; 4\\\\. Grinding stones including grinds and hands, and 5\\\\. Unique objects as some ceramic pots locally produced and shell items from the Gulf. More than 4,000 engraved rocks are known, with an estimated 8 to 10,000 images. Inhabitants=Hunters and semi-nomad collectors A characteristic of this and other cave painting places in northeastern M√©xico is the lack of ethnic-historical references. Spanish colonial authors wrote many details about the art and work of Mesoamerican native groups, but there were few detailed descriptions for native groups of northeastern New Spain a large sparsely populated area before European settlements, also they are very frugal in describing the lives and ways of the region inhabitants. Captain Alonso de Le√≥n, was the first colonial author who made a complete description about the Native American groups in the region, their lives and customs, Alonso depicted them as barbaric semi-nomad groups divided in numerous subgroups with no dominant culture. It makes it difficult to determine which group or groups took part in the implementation of the Boca de Potrerillos petroglyphs. However recent archaeological work by authors such as William B. Murray,Mois√©s Valadez Moreno Boca de Potrerillos Universidad Aut√≥noma de Nuevo Le√≥n, 1998 , Solveig A. Turpin, Herbert H. Eling Jr., and others have provided understanding of the cave art and artists at Boca de Potrerillos. For the Nahuatl speaking Aztec society the groups living in what is now northern Mexico and Southwestern United States were called Chichimec‚Äôs (an insult in Nahuatl) in referring to them as savages. Upon contact with Spaniards in the region towards the end of the 16th century, initial sources identified over 200 native groups dedicated primarily to hunting and fruit recollection. Within their nomad life these groups had a more or less regular itinerary throughout the year and went back to centers such as Boca de Potrerillos when the weather and times favor these activities. Both, by its untamed nature, as well as for references to them as Chichimec by the Nahuatl dominant group, the native groups, in colonial sources, are described as barbarians and uncultivated, very different from the cultivated groups of Mesoamerica. It is not known, even once of cave art work references in colonial sources. By the end of the 18th century any native trace had already disappeared. The artists It is believed that the groups occupying the zone were a branch of a larger group known by archeologists as Coahuilteco that inhabited the slopes of the Sierra Madre Oriental up to the southwest Texas in the lower Pecos River. Without excluding other groups, related or not, that might have taken part in making the petroglyphs. As shown in the following petroglyphs styles categorization, the question of authorship of many of them is a matter being analyzed and remains unresolved. The Art Work The artistic work of Boca de Potrerillos could split in two: the parietal work and portable art work. Art embodied in the walls or rocky shelters are overwhelmingly abundant compared with physical art of Boca de Potrerillos, however its study and analysis complements the style interpretation and purpose of the work in general. Parietal Art For the art study imprinted in the large rocks, anthropologists have divided the Boca de Potrerillos into four sections: North Slope, southern slope, the promontory and hidden Valley hidden on a slit of the North Slope. These four sections contain approximately 3,000 petroglyphs with different execution and style techniques. The largest number of these prints is on the northern slopes and facing east, which hints at a purpose of astronomical observation. =Style= Designs outlined in these rocks are generally abstract. Anthropologist William B. Murray classifies the engravings in 5 categories: *1. The most recent: angular geometric that resembles cattle stamps. Could have been made by Europeans emulating native traditions by the Apaches and Comanche‚Äôs that attacked Mina (Nuevo Le√≥n) between 1830 and 1850. *2. The engravings of this style appear fresh and recent. Intermediate age symbols similar to those associated with puberty ceremonies in California y Nevada tribes: diamonds, net shaped artifacts (rattle snake), etc. The Fierce Thornapple ceremony for boys and girls is mentioned in colonial sources corroborating the meaning possibility of these figures. These are Coahuilteco symbols similar to other regions, but are limited to a Boca certain area and are not the most common. *3. The majority are classical abstract geometrical tradition of the Great Basin. Identified with the Desert Archaic Culture. The technique used is chopping and shaping by circular/undulated incisions. Styles can be of different ages. The authorship of the symbols is not resolved. *4. Solid figure style. Rare at Boca, but abundant in other places of the region. Sometimes representing projectile points. One of them, Shumla, is associated with the mid to late Archaic Period. *5. Hole and Groove Style, similar to the one found in Diegue√±o, California with wavy lines that follow the contours of the rock and the other with dots rows arranged in complex grids =Purpose= Archaeologists are discerning about the purpose of cave art in Boca de Potrerillos. Following their reflection the meaning and purpose of the cave designs is in sight. Some of these are as follows: *a. The parietal art discovers an educational and public intention with regard to engravings on the slopes and areas exposed for all to see. *b. A ritual sense is expressed by topic repetition. *c. Murray considers and prepares the possibility that some of the Boca engravings have an astronomical purpose. The arrangement of some of them leads him to consider a calendar intention that seeks to be a temporary guidance to determine suitable times of the year for hunter gatherer (activities common to these groups). He proposes the following hypothesis: the area called promontory functioned as solar and celestial observatory from which sunrise‚Äôs positions over the hillside could be contemplated, perhaps using the remote peaks as additional indicators. From the promontory is a good line of sight in all directions. *d. Other authors such as Mois√©s Valadez, Solveig A. Turpin and Herbert H. Eling, supported on recent theories that figures resulting in rock art have a physiological origin derived generally from trance experiences often caused by consumption of hallucinogens such as Peyote, link Boca de Potrerillos art with Shamanism activities. Portable Art The density of prehistoric domestic waste confirms that the area was able to sustain a relatively large population. Research that started in 1990 has discovered even early prehistoric pottery, the first architectural relics and portable art. The analyzed furnaces and Carbon-14 testing indicate that the site has intermittently been occupied for at least 7,800 years or more. =Style= Archaeologists Mois√©s Valadez, Solveig A. Turpin and Herbert H. Eling propose for the Boca de Potrerillos portable art two styles, designating them by the name of the place they were found. *1. Stones from ‚ÄúC√≥conos Ranch‚Äù, with designs identified as ‚Äúrain‚Äù, ‚Äúflower‚Äù, ‚Äúbutterfly‚Äù, ‚Äúeye lock‚Äù and ‚Äúhook‚Äù. From testing applied to furnaces remains and tools found next to these rocks, even though an absolute date cannot be assigned, it is considered to be some 5,000 years old. Stones from Loma de San Pedro. Show intersecting incisions, generally triangular or wedge-shaped stones. The antiquity of these pieces is estimated between 230 and 950 years. =Purposes= Portable art found in prehistoric surroundings has its own digression ways. Some interpret objects markings (stones, bones, etc.) as counting systems. The possibility has been considered that these objects are ornamental or are \\"toys, hunting game, mortuary offerings, divination instruments, Mnemotechnics artifacts, menstruation fetishis, Puberty or fertility amulets or a healing Talisman‚Äù. It is difficult to establish the meaning and purposes of these portable pieces as are the first found in the Nuevo Le√≥n State, but can be analogy compared with portable art found in the lower Pecos River (Texas) and the North American Great Basin. The nature of portable art is personal as opposed to parietal art that is public. For this reason the first type hints at a private use. The motifs, although in some cases appear in both types of art, vary and themes interpreted as \\"Butterfly\\" in representation a Vulva, do not appear in public art. Boca de Potrerillos, astronomical observatory 7,000 years ago. Archaeologist Denise Carpinteyro Espinosa, from National Institute of anthropology and history, Center INAH, reports that petroglyphs (engraved stone) in the site, some are related to astronomy while others are more closely related to everyday life of these hunter-gatherers human groups who inhabited this site 7 thousand years ago. The site is crossed by a river and it is inferred that this site was of great importance for diverse human occupations during over 7,000 years. Boca de Potrerillos, we very ancient settlements. The level of engravings offers a significant knowledge level of the skies and studies that have been made on the handling time for hunting which was related to the stars or for many everyday things of life. Identification and Register Grid System Developed in 2005, specifically for Boca de Potrerillos, has rapidly demonstrated its effectiveness as over 4,000 rock engravings have since been already registered. The system is based on a GPS map divided in grids. Over 600 hectares of the Boca de Potrerillos polygon are identified on a digital master grid that contains location of every rock, which is then recreated in three dimensions, using high definition digital photos. With the support of the Texas University, USA, petroglyph dating studies have been made by the Carbon 14 method which provide a total of 20 epochs, of which the oldest is 8,000 years. With this information the site complete chronology was developed and it was determined that the site apogee occurred 4,000 years ago.Valadez Moreno Mois√©s, Centro INAH Nuevo Le√≥n Boca de Potrerillos See also Chiquihuitillos Cueva Ahumada  References Bibliography *G√ºnter Berghaus (2004).

It is one of several castles owned by the members of Pejaƒçeviƒá noble family in the croatian region of Slavonia. History According to the sign located on the facade above the entrance, the manor was built by count Sigismund Pejaƒçeviƒá in 1801, with the actual construction beginning in 1796. The Retfala Estate was acquired by the Pejaƒçeviƒá Counts as a grant by the then Austrian Empress and Croatian-Hungarian Queen Maria Theresa in 1750. In the beginning it started out as a relatively small estate. Architecture The refined classical manor is composed of three wings shaped in the form of the letter U. The internal space is organised around a central hallway with rooms aligned on either side. The central axis is highlighted by the grand hall and atrium within the great pavilion. The central pavilion is raised on the first floor, whilst the remaining part of the manor, complete with its lateral wings, is at ground level. At ground level, the pavilion is articulated by arcades and a great series of ionic pilasters, which was originally covered by a mansard roof, as was the rest of the building. The manor is separated from the street by a triumphal entrance made from wrought iron railings. Despite the identity of the architect not being known, the manor is regarded as a significant work of classical architecture within Croatia Mausoleum Close to the vicinity of the manor at the Retfala Cemetery, the Pejaƒçeviƒá Family chapel-mausoleum dates from the year 1891.

He was executed by guillotine on June 19, 1956, in Algiers. Early life Zabana was born in 1926 in Saint-Lucien (now Zahana). The youngest of nine children, he was a member of the Algerian Muslim Scouts, which inspired nationalist feeling in him. He joined the Movement for the Triumph of Democratic Liberties in 1950. He later became a member of the military wing of a pro-independence secret society, and participated in a mail operation in Oran in 1950. He was later arrested and spent three years in prison and an additional three years in exile. Role in the preparation of the revolution After the dissolution of the Revolutionary Committee of Unity and Action on 5 July 1954, Zabana was commissioned by Larbi Ben M'hidi to prepare for the revolution by obtaining weapons and personnel. Zabana's tasks were to structure revolutionary forces and train them, and also to visit strategic locations to choose places that could be made centers of revolution. Zabana succeeded in forming revolutionary cadres in Zahana, Oran, A√Øn T√©mouchent, Hammam Bou Hadjar, Hassi El Ghella, and Chaabet El Ham. he then ordered the men of the cadres to gather subscriptions for buying weapons and ammunition. With Abdulmalek Ramadan, Zabana supervised the military training of the cadres. At a meeting on October 30th, 1954, chaired by Ben M'hidi, the organizers of the revolution determined that it would begin with a series of attacks on the night of November 1st. The following day, October 31st, Zabana met with his units and assigned specific targets as well as a rendezvous point on Jabal al-Qada. Role in the revolution On November 1st, 1954, Zabana led a successful operation in Lamarda. After carrying out the offensive operations against the agreed French objectives, Zabana met with the leaders and members of the operational teams to assess them and plan what should be done in the coming stages. Zabana was captured in the Battle of Gar Bouklida on November 11th, 1954, in which he was wounded. He was taken to a hospital and then to prison. Execution On April 21st, 1955 Zabana was brought to the military court in Oran and sentenced to death. On May 3rd, 1955, he was transferred to the Serkadji Prison in Algiers. He was executed on 19 June 1956. Legacy The Ahmed Zabana National Museum and Ahmed Zabana Stadium in Oran are named after him. In 2012, the Algerian film director Sa√Ød Ould-Khelifa launched a biographical film Zabana! with the lead role of Zabana played by Imad Benchenni.

Edge magazine called it \\"shamelessly derivative\\" of The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past. CU Amiga gave the Amiga version of Speris Legacy an overall score of 74%, and criticized its map design, calling the game world \\"a pretty big place with lots of a locations and rather too little to do\\", further expressing that the game's lack of hints regarding the player's goals results in \\"endless meandering\\" and frustration. Amiga Format gave the Amiga version a score of 69%, while they praised Speris Legacy's \\"lovely\\" graphics, they described its gameplay as \\"a drudge\\" and \\"relentless tedium\\". Amiga Format heavily compared Speris Legacy to Zelda, stating that it emulates the \\"look and feel\\" of Zelda well, but falls short in regards to its gameplay, which lacks \\"a sense of achievement\\". They further criticized the size of Speris Legacy's environments, and expressed that this, in addition to the lack of hints or reassurance in the game's puzzlesolving, makes puzzles unnecessarily difficult. Arcane magazine gave Speris Legacy an overall score of three out of ten, expressing that the audio and visuals emulate Zelda well, but the game 'isn't fun' and lacks \\"a sense of accomplishment\\". Arcane further noted that while the game isn't difficult, the player is left \\"constantly in a state of confusion about where you are supposed to be going and what goals you must achieve to get there\\", furthermore calling its puzzles \\"masochistic\\" in this regard.

The company dissolved shortly after, during the Great Depression of the early 1930s. Development The H-10 was designed by Orville Hickman for Lee R. Biggs, owner of the newly formed Pheasant Aircraft Company in Memphis, Missouri. Eleven units were built before the death of the company founder in a flying accident on December 5, 1927. Race pilot Steve Wittman took over as test pilot. Wittman helped relocate the company to his home in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin when Adolf Bechaud and his associates purchased the company. Design The Pheasant H-10 is made from a welded steel tube fuselage with a fabric covering. The aircraft was powered by a water cooled Curtiss OX-5 engine. The landing gear was conventionally mounted, with a tail skid. Operational history Pheasant test pilot Steve Wittman entered The H-10 was entered into the September 8, 1928 Air Derby from New York to Los Angeles. Dropping out due to radiator trouble in the desert. Wittman finished 12th out of 38 entries. Wittman raced again in the 1928 Air Derby from Los Angeles to Cincinnati and finished in 4th place.

After crossing the river, which serves as the border with Lesotho, the line runs for through an industrial area of Maseru, serving the city's station and various factories and depots. The line is owned by Transnet Freight Rail of South Africa; it has freight service but no regular passenger trains. Construction on the Bloemfontein- Bethlehem railway line, intended to link the Orange River Colony (as it was then known) with the port of Durban, began in 1902 under the direction of the Central South African Railways. By June 1904 it was open from Bloemfontein as far as Modderpoort. In order to make the line viable, it was desired that it should serve Maseru, but for the sake of economy it was decided to build the main line along a shorter route and connect Maseru by a branch line.

GPM represents logical relationships of dated objects ‚Äì such as activities, milestones, and benchmarks ‚Äì in a time-scaled network diagram.Mubarak, Saleh (2010). Construction Project Scheduling and Control, Second Edition. John Wiley and Sons. .  History  The Graphical Path Method (GPM) (formerly known as the ‚ÄòGraphical Planning Method‚Äô) was originally developed from 2004-2006 by Dr. Gui Ponce de Leon, current Chairman of the Project Management Institute College of Scheduling (PMICOS), and was first presented at the PMICOS 2008 annual conference.Ponce de Leon, Gui (2008). Graphical Planning Method (A New Network-based Planning/Scheduling Paradigm). PMICOS 5th Annual Conference, Chicago, IL. It was created as an alternative to the Critical Path Method (CPM) and was designed as a graphical tool to encourage an engaging, planning-centric experience for project stakeholders.  Technique To create a GPM schedule, users draw and place objects ‚Äì such as activities, milestones, and benchmarks ‚Äì on a time-scaled canvas. Objects are linked together to establish logical, precedence relationships. These relationships are governed by the Logic Diagramming Method (LDM), a blend of the Arrow Diagramming Method (ADM) and the Precedence Diagramming Method (PDM). In total, LDM permits 12 relationship types to account for all possible dependencies between objects. The resulting web of logically related, dated objects and their relationships forms a network diagram. Object relationships form the backbone of a GPM network. They are used to calculate a number of object attributes, including link gap and object buffer, drift, and float. As objects and their relationships are added to or modified in the schedule, GPM continuously re- calculates and updates gap for all links and float for all dated objects. Link gaps are calculated from the dates of two related activities and floats are algorithmically calculated from gaps. Differences between GPM and CPM The Critical Path Method (CPM) is the traditional mathematical algorithm used for schedule logic computation. GPM utilizes a different algorithm than CPM and thus produces its own distinct schedule attributes. Planned dates vs. early dates In a GPM network, objects not residing on the critical path, and thus having float, are permitted to be scheduled anywhere within their float range and are not forced to their early or late dates. This action in a GPM network is referred to as scheduling objects on planned dates. This is contrary to CPM logic, where a forward and backward pass algorithm defaults objects to their early dates, unless additional logic is introduced to constrain an object to a later date. GPM logic permits the as-planned scheduling framework because logic links retain their own attributes, namely gap.O'Brien, James J.; Plotnick, Fredric L. (2010). CPM in Construction Management, Seventh Edition. McGraw Hill. . Schedule Attributes Gap = GPM allows users to place an object anywhere in between its early and late dates; consequently, link gap emerges between objects. Link gap permits object scheduling on planned dates while retaining the Total Float value of the network. The link gap values become the basis for calculating floats in a GPM network. The as- planned framework introduces additional schedule values of buffer, drift, and float. = Buffer = CPM calculates available slippage in Free Float and Total Float. CPM measures Free Float by how much a predecessor activity may be delayed without causing a delay to its nearest successor activity. In GPM this is called buffer and it is calculated as the minimum of the link gaps for all logic ties to successor objects. = Drift = Because activities in a CPM network default to their early dates, CPM does not calculate activity movement in the opposite direction ‚Äì namely, how much an activity may backslide or extend to earlier dates without affecting predecessor activities. GPM permits activity placement between early and late dates and thus introduces this value of ‚Äúpreceding float‚Äù as drift. GPM calculates drift as the minimum of the link gaps for all logic ties to predecessor objects. = Float = CPM Total Float is measured by how much an activity may be delayed without delaying the project completion date. In GPM this is called float, with the distinction that it is measured with respect to planned dates rather than early dates. Thus, the GPM value of float plus drift is analogous to Total Float in CPM. Real-time vs. sequential compiling CPM relies on activity dates as the basis for float calculations, where total float is determined by the difference between late finish dates and early finish dates. This requires a standby calculation engine to perform a forward pass and a backward pass of the entire network when planning ceases or when an interim calculation is necessary for further planning. The result is that planning and scheduling are separate processes performed in sequential order. In GPM‚Äôs time-scaled framework, dates are innate, real-time attributes of network objects. This permits GPM to use the link gap between two objects for the float calculation and thus schedule data and object attributes are continuously updated in real- time, as changes to the schedule are committed. This allows for dynamic feedback from the schedule; users are permitted to execute schedule optimization, time and cost trade-offs, resource management and other analysis concurrently as the schedule is being built.

Such an event is said to be tragic. Traditionally, the event would require \\"some element of moral failure, some flaw in character, or some extraordinary combination of elements\\"http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19920405&slug;=1484688 to be tragic. Not every death is considered a tragedy. Rather, it is a precise set of symptoms surrounding the loss that define it as such. There are a variety of factors that define a death as tragic. An event in which a massive number of deaths occur may be seen as a tragedy. This can be re-enforced by media attention or other public outcry. A tragedy does not necessarily involve massive death. The death of a single person, e.g., a public figure or a child, may be seen as a tragedy. The person need not necessarily have been famous before death. Factors that make death a tragedy Generally, the label of \\"tragedy\\" is given to an event based on public perception. There are a number of factors that can make a death be considered a tragedy. Scope The scope of an event can affect the public view, and make it appear tragic. This can be the case whether the death toll is high, or if a single, unexpected death occurs in a well-beloved person. The degree of attachment in the public eye may also impact whether or not the event is publicly labeled as a tragedy. For example, the unexpected death of a preparatory school student that receives heavy media attention may be seen as more tragic than that of a recidivist prisoner who is beaten to death by fellow inmates. Prematurity A death may be viewed as a tragedy when it is premature in nature. An old person dying of old age is an expectation, but the death of a child or of a young, healthy adult that is not expected by others can be viewed as tragic. Publicity Publicity is a factor in making the public view an event as a tragedy. With publicity of a large number of deaths or even a single death, this plays on the emotions of the general public, and thereby impacts perception. The range of coverage affects the number of people in whose eyes the event is viewed as tragic. While local coverage may garner sympathy from those in the hometown of the deceased, international coverage may lead the whole world to mourn. Consequences The resulting consequences from one or more deaths can be seen as a tragedy. For example, if a large number of persons are killed in a terrorist attack, not only is life lost, but others may lose their sense of security, and this impacts the lives of others in other ways. Lasting effects The long-term effects of an event can render it as tragic. Tragedies often have effects that shape those affected, and are remembered even long after, as they clearly impact the future for those involved. They may also be commemorated on anniversaries or whenever they otherwise come to mind.Disaster Spiritual Care: Practical Clergy Responses to Community, Regional; by Stephen B. Roberts, Willard W. C. Ashley; ; page 67 A public tragedy often leads to measures being taken to prevent similar tragic events in the future. Dealing with tragedy There are various ways tragedy can affect and influence people long after the event occurs. The typical reaction to tragedy is heavy grief, followed by a slow recovery. Common feelings following a tragedy include sadness, depression, crying, blame, and guilt. Some people wonder what they did to deserve such suffering. For some, their faith may be a source of comfort in the wake of tragedy.

He was also the first African-American player in the team's history. In fact in 1933, he was the only African-American on the team and only one of two black players in the entire National Football League. Early life Kemp graduated from Cecil High School in 1926. After graduation, he worked in the coal mines around Cecil, Pennsylvania for one year before enrolling at Duquesne University. Duquesne Dukes At Duquesne, Kemp was coached by Elmer Layden, a former member of Notre Dame's Four Horsemen (and later the commissioner of the NFL). Kemp became a starter for the Dukes during his sophomore year and by the end of his senior season, he received an honorable mention on some All-American lists. After graduation, Future Pirates owner, Art Rooney told Kemp that he would like for him to play for his \\"J.P. Rooney semi-pro team\\". In 1932 he did play for both the J.P. Rooneys and the semi-pro Erie Pros in his spare time. He remained at Duquesne that season, and served as the line coach under Layden.. Pittsburgh Pirates The following year, the J.P. Rooneys were reorganized and became the NFL's Pittsburgh Pirates. Kemp joined the team and became one of only two black players in the league, the other being Joe Lillard of the Chicago Cardinals. Kemp played in the Pirates' first three games against, the New York Giants, Chicago Cardinals and Boston Redskins. After the Redskins game, Kemp was cut by the team. He appealed the cut to Art Rooney, but Rooney refused to go over the head of the coach, Jap Douds, who as a player-coach, also played Kemp's position. However a Pittsburgh Courier story on November 14, 1933 claimed that Kemp was placed on the reserve list and quit, although fans had rated him highly. Art Rooney stated that he was limited to having only 22 players on the roster and preferred to keep the more experienced players. Kemp then went back to his job in the steel mill and the Pirates went 2‚Äì5 over the next seven games. He was named to the starting lineup after only two days of practice and played the entire game at tackle against the New York Giants, who would defeat the Pirates 27-3 at the Polo Grounds. However, the Friday before the Pirates' game in New York, Kemp was asked to leave the hotel housing the Pirates' players. Walter Francis White of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, suggested he file a discrimination suit. However Kemp refused, fearing the backlash that would occur to Art Rooney, who had given him a chance at an NFL career. That game against the Giants was the final game of Kemp's brief career in the NFL. The next season, he was hired as the head football coach at Bluefield State College. With the exits of Kemp and Lillard, the NFL would not have any black players until 1946. Post career One of the highlights of Ray Kemp's post-football career came when he stood on the Steelers' sideline before a game at Three Rivers Stadium in 1982. The Steelers were celebrating their 50th anniversary and Kemp was a member of their first team in 1933.

Built in the 11th or 12th century as a small chapel of ease to a nearby parish church, and hardly changed or restored since, the stone chapel stands behind a \\"delightful ... wooded ravine\\" beneath the South Downs and has been called \\"a real piece of hidden Sussex\\". The chancel arch, between the nave and chancel which made up the simple two-room building, had a bizarre 12th-century carving of a person of indeterminate sex exposing their genitalia‚Äîuntil 2004, when an unknown vandal destroyed it with a chisel. The church is still used for Christian worship, and English Heritage has listed it at Grade I for its architectural and historical importance. The church is also known as Buncton Chapel. History Buncton existed as a settlement at the time of the Domesday survey in 1086, when it was called Bongetune. Its origins lie in a manor whose land lay within two exclaves of the parish of Ashington within the Rape of Bramber, one of the six ancient subdivisions of Sussex. The medieval manor house has vanished, but a 17th-century replacement still stands. The settlement's church was built on a rural site, considered a \\"picturesque setting\\", at an unknown date during the Norman period. Most sources date its construction to the late 11th or early 12th century; others offer no more confident attribution than 12th-century, \\"1066 to 1200\\" or \\"mostly Norman\\". An article published in volume 38 of the Sussex Archaeological Collections (1892) dated it to 1150‚Äì1180 and attributed its construction to the monks of Sele Priory at nearby Beeding, although a wide- ranging study of Sussex church architecture 15 years later suggested a date of 1070 for the nave and chancel arch‚Äîpartly based on the lack of buttresses. This date would make the church a Saxon‚ÄìNorman transitional building. The mysterious carving on the chancel arch, pictured shortly before its destruction in 2004 The church had a chancel with a squared-off east end and a nave with no aisles, with a chancel arch between them. This \\"two-cell\\" style was characteristic of small Sussex churches of the 11th and 12th centuries, especially those around the South Downs. The walls of both parts are quite high, and have been called \\"too tall for so small a church\\". Some rubble and tiles from a nearby Roman building were used in its construction; an east‚Äìwest Roman road, the Sussex Greensand Way, on the lower part of the Greensand Ridge passed close to the chapel, and a large villa stood about away, near the original Buncton manor house. (The villa's hypocaust was discovered in 1848.) The chancel was altered in the 13th century, and the east end was further changed a century later. It was shortened, the east wall was rebuilt with square masonry blocks, and a Decorated Gothic window was inserted. The church also gained an aumbry and a piscina at this time, and some richly decorative Norman-era masonry arches were inserted in the exterior walls on the north and south sides. They came from another building‚Äîpossibly Sele Priory‚Äîat some point between the 14th century and the Reformation. The only significant structural alteration was a 19th-century bellcote; compared to many ancient churches in Sussex, the church remains \\"delightfully unrestored\\". Some modest renovation was also carried out in 1906. Ancient churches which have survived intact or with minimal alteration often indicate a moribund local economy and loss of local population: local worshippers neither needed nor could afford to update their church. The 14th-century piscina There have been many changes in the parochial arrangements of the church, and for most of its existence it has been a subordinate church within a larger parish. It was recorded as a parish church in 1323, and its rectors occasionally administered the church at nearby Wiston. In the 15th century, though, All Saints lost its parish status as it was linked with St Peter and St Paul's Church in neighbouring Ashington. Thereafter it served as a chapel of ease to that church. (Ashington had been split from the parish of nearby Washington in about the 12th century.) By 1535, the parish and benefice name was Ashington with Buncton. In 1977, Ashington with Buncton and Washington with Wiston parishes were united into a single large benefice; this legal entity still exists, but by the end of the 20th century All Saints was in the parish of St Mary's Church in Wiston. St Mary's was declared redundant by the Diocese of Chichester at the end of 2009. The north impost of the chancel arch had a strange carved stone figure dating from the 12th century. Although it is common for Norman churches to have carved or painted representations of human faces or figures, Buncton's was a very unusual example: an sculpture of a person of indeterminate sex showing its genitals. It was similar to a Sheela na gig‚Äîtypically a smiling naked woman with exposed genitalia, common in churches in the Republic of Ireland but rarely seen elsewhere, and reputedly associated with pagan sites, Celtic fertility rites or medieval anti-immorality teaching. About 30 such carvings exist in Britain. In December 2004, an unknown person entered the church and destroyed the carving with a chisel, smashing it into dozens of pieces. Architecture Decorative blocked arches on the chancel wall The chancel arch, looking towards the Decorated Gothic east window All Saints Church is a small, simple building with a tall, narrow profile. It is built mostly of flint, in common with many Sussex downland churches; some stone rubble and masonry is also visible, and recycled Roman tiles can be seen. It has been described as being \\"a little like a stone barn\\", and its isolation is enhanced by its position in the middle of a field reached through a tree-lined hollow. The outside of the north wall of the chancel incorporates a pair of Romanesque-style Norman-era blocked arches, described as \\"extraordinary\\" by Nikolaus Pevsner (who dated them to 1160). One has beakhead shapes, while the other is made up of intersecting arches and has elaborate decoration and mouldings, with some use of ashlar. The arches serve no apparent structural purpose; their insertion, in the 14th century, was merely decorative. The chancel measures : these unusually short proportions are evidence of the work carried out in the 14th century to cut its length back. It is lower than the nave, which has original Norman doorways in its north and south walls. The latter is now blocked, and has a crude stone lintel with the remains of a segmental arch above. The doorway in the north wall survives in good condition, and is flat-arched with voussoirs and wedge-shaped springers. Three original windows survive in the nave; all are placed very high on the walls. The chancel's lancet windows, in contrast, were inserted in the 13th century or later. Its larger east window is in the Decorated Gothic style and dates from the 14th century. The chancel arch is large and contemporary with the nave. Square plinths with decorative moulding support shafts with unusual capitals which have abaci with such extensive chamfering that they are almost circular. The imposts are carved with a series of characteristic Norman designs such as squares and herringbone patterns‚Äî although the mysterious carved figure with exposed genitals no longer exists. Paintings on the adjacent wall of the nave have mostly been lost as well. The maximum height of the chancel arch is . Interior fittings include a piscina inserted in the 14th century. Pevsner observed that it \\"manages to get a lot of character into tiny dimensions\\". The church today All Saints Church was listed at Grade I by English Heritage on 15 March 1955. Such buildings are defined as being of \\"exceptional interest\\" and greater than national importance. As of February 2001, it was one of 38 Grade I listed buildings, and 1,726 listed buildings of all grades, in the district of Horsham. Services at the church have rarely been more frequent than monthly in recent centuries. This frequency was recorded in 1724 and the early 19th century; for part of that century no services were held in winter, and worshippers travelled to Ashington instead. Weekly worship took place for a time later in that century, but in modern times services have reverted to monthly, with a Eucharistic service on the third Sunday of the month. The parish, whose legal name is Wiston with Buncton, covers those two villages at the foot of the South Downs and a large rural area between the A24 and A283 roads. It is one of two parishes in the wider benefice of Ashington, Washington and Wiston with Buncton.

The poem is also known as phainetai moi (œÜŒ±ŒØŒΩŒµœÑŒ±ŒØ ŒºŒøŒπ) after the opening words of its first line. It is one of Sappho's most famous poems, describing her love for a young woman. Fragment 31 is one of Sappho's most famous works, and has been the subject of numerous translations and adaptations from ancient times to the present day. Celebrated for its portrayal of intense emotion, the poem has influenced modern conceptions of lyric poetry, and its depiction of desire continues to influence writers today. Preservation Fragment 31 was one of the few substantial fragments of Sappho to survive from ancient times, preserved in the first-century AD treatise on aesthetics On the Sublime. Four stanzas are well-preserved, followed by part of one more line; this, as well as Catullus' adaptation of the poem, suggests that there was originally one more stanza of the poem, often thought to have been Sappho resigning herself to the situation in which she finds herself. A reconstruction of the poem by classicist Armand D'Angour suggests that the original poem may have had up to 8 stanzas. The opening words of the poem (\\"To me it seems that man...\\"Sappho 31.1) are almost identical to a fragment of Sappho quoted by Apollonius Dyscolus: \\"To himself he seems\\".Sappho 165 This might have been an alternative opening to Sappho 31. Poem Fragment 31 is composed in Sapphic stanzas, a metrical form named after Sappho and consisting of stanzas of three long followed by one short line. Four strophes of the poem survive, along with a few words of a fifth. The poem is written in the Aeolic dialect, which was the dialect spoken in Sappho's time on her home island of Lesbos. The poem centres around three characters: a man and a woman, both otherwise unidentified, and the speaker. The context of the poem has been the subject of much scholarly debate: Thomas McEvilley calls it the \\"central controversy\\" about the poem. Wilamowitz suggested that the poem was a wedding song, and that the man mentioned in the initial stanza of the poem was the bridegroom. A poem in the Greek Anthology which echoes the first stanza of the poem is explicitly about a wedding; this perhaps strengthens the argument that fragment 31 was written as a wedding song. Since the second half of the twentieth century, scholars have tended to follow Denys Page in dismissing this argument. William Race, for instance, says that the poem contains nothing to indicate that it is about a wedding, while Christina Clark argues that, though the interaction between the two characters observed by the speaker indicates that they are of similar social status, their interaction is likely to be compatible with a number of possible relationships, not just that between a bride and groom. For instance, she suggests that they might just as well be brother and sister. One interpretation suggests that the man's precise relationship with the woman is not important. Instead, the man's role is to act as a \\"contrast figure\\", designed to highlight Sappho's love for the girl by juxtaposing the strength of Sappho's emotional reaction with his impassivity. For instance, John Winkler argues that \\"'That man' in poem 31 is like the military armament in poem 16, an introductory set-up to be dismissed\\". As far back as the eighteenth century, it has been proposed that the poem is about Sappho's jealousy of the man who sits with her beloved. Though this is still a popular interpretation of the poem, many critics deny that the fragment is about jealousy at all. Anne Carson argues that Sappho has no wish to take the man's place, nor is she concerned that he will usurp hers: thus, she is not jealous of him, but amazed at his ability to retain his composure so close to the object of her desire. Another common interpretation of the poem is that it is primarily concerned with expressing the speaker's love for the girl. Joan DeJean criticises the \\"jealousy\\" interpretation of the poem as intended to play down the homoeroticism of the poem. Armand D'Angour argues that the phrase \\"Œ±ŒªŒªŒ± œÄŒ±ŒΩ œÑŒøŒªŒºŒ±œÑŒøŒΩ\\" means \\"all must be dared\\", rather than \\"endured\\" as it is sometimes translated. First translations of the poem would derive from Catullus' re-visitation of the poem, Catullus 51, painting Sappho with a green taint of jealousy. A more conservative reading would on the other hand offer as a secondary option the change of tone in the poem towards a more hopeful, rather than resigned, position. A philological debate has also arisen concerning the very first words of the poem \\"phainetai moi\\" (œÜŒ±ŒØŒΩŒµœÑŒ±ŒØ ŒºŒøŒπ); the most popular interpretation would read the first stanza of the poem as a true banner of lyricism, the use of the first word to introduce the subject of Sappho's alleged jealousy. An alternative reading is suggested by Gallavotti: according to his thesis, the text was corrupted over time as a result of the disappearance of the sound [w] (represented by the letter digamma œú) and Sappho's original would have instead said \\"phainetai woi\\" (œÜŒ±ŒØŒΩŒµœÑŒ±ŒØ œúŒøŒπ). This reading of the original text, which may be supported by a quote by Apollonius Dyscolus, would dramatically change the perspective of the first verse, its translation roughly being: \\"God-like he esteems himself to be\\". The speaker is then counter-posing her own experience in contrast with the man's and the next three stanzas describe the symptoms the narrator experiences \\"whenever I glance at you for a second\\". The final surviving line, 17, has been thought to be the beginning of a stanza describing Sappho reconciling herself to the situation in which she found herself. Reception and influence Lawrence Alma-Tadema, Catullus at Lesbia's 1865 Fragment 31 is one of Sappho's most famous works. It is one of her most frequently adapted and translated poems, and has been the subject of more scholarly commentary than any other of her works. In the ancient world, the Roman poet Catullus adapted it into his 51st poem, putting his muse Lesbia into the role of Sappho's beloved. Other ancient authors who adapted the poem include Theocritus, in his second Idyll, and Apollonius of Rhodes, in his description of the first meeting between Jason and Medea in the Argonautica. In the nineteenth century, the poem began to be seen as an exemplar of Romantic lyric, influencing poets such as Tennyson, whose \\"Ele√§nore\\" and \\"Fatima\\" were both inspired by fragment 31. Other Romantic poets influenced by the fragment include Shelley and Keats ‚Äì for instance in \\"To Constantia, singing\\" and \\"Ode to a Nightingale\\", respectively. Sappho's description of the physical response to desire in this poem is especially celebrated. The poem is quoted in Longinus's treatise On the Sublime for the intensity of its emotion, Plato draws on it in Socrates' second speech on love in the Phaedrus, and the physical symptoms of desire portrayed in the poem continue to be used to convey the feeling in modern culture.

De Cobain was the son of the Rev. Edward De Cobain, of Ashley Hall, Belfast and his wife Harriet Ann Smyth, daughter of John Smyth of Smythborough, and the Shades of Ballynure, County Monaghan, Ulster. His brother, Fletcher De Cobain, would also become a minister. ESW De Cobain was educated at Bell's Academy, Belfast. He was cashier for the Borough of Belfast in the 1860s. For five years he was Grand Master of the Orange Lodge of Belfast, and was Deputy Grand Master for Ireland. He was the author of political lectures and occasional poems.Debretts House of Commons and the Judicial Bench 1886 In the 1885 general election de Cobain was nominated as the Independent Conservative candidate for East Belfast. He successfully beat the Tory candidate, Sir J. P. Corry, and was elected Member of Parliament for Belfast East. He was subsequently reelected in 1886.  Scandal and imprisonment  In April 1891, a warrant was issued by Justice Richard Eaton, Resident Magistrate of Belfast, for his arrest for \\"the commission of unnatural offenses in Belfast.\\" De Cobain had fled to the continent through London to Boulogne-sur-Mer, France. De Cobain continued to proclaim his innocence and refused to resign his seat in Parliament, saying it was tantamount to an admission of guilt. The House of Commons ordered him to attend and when he failed to do so he was expelled on 23 February 1892. De Cobain sailed to New York in May 1892 where he lived for a while and conducted revivalist meetings in Brooklyn. In February 1893, de Cobain returned to Belfast, where he was subsequently arrested. In court, de Cobain claimed that charges were the result of an attempt to blackmail him but the jury found him guilty and he was sentenced to twelve months' imprisonment with hard labour. According to the BBC, papers at the Belfast Public Records Office document allegations that some people were encouraged to give statements against de Cobain, with one allegedly being offered ¬£500.

Mary was the subject of marriage negotiations of James V of Scotland. He visited her in France, but subsequently married Madeleine of Valois. Mary died two years later. Life=First negotiation A marriage to a French princess for the Scottish king had been an expectation since the Franco-Scottish alliance by the Treaty of Rouen of 1517. The Treaty itself was primarily concerned with mutual military support. As James V of Scotland came of age, at first it was thought he would marry the Princess, Madeleine of Valois. By December 1534, it was clear that Madeleine was sickly. Francis I of France suggested that James V should marry Mary of Bourbon instead to fulfill the Treaty. The marriage was promoted by John Stewart, Duke of Albany, and by the end of 1534, his secretary Nicolas Canivet and James V's secretary Thomas Erskine of Haltoun had met the Scottish King and shown him Mary's portrait.Hay, Denys, ed., Letters of James V, HMSO (1954), 280-281: Bapst, E., Les Mariages de Jacques V, 232. However, Marguerite de Navarre had discussed this marriage plan with Henry VIII of England's diplomat, the Duke of Norfolk in June 1533. She pointed out that Charles, Duke of Vend√¥me was closely allied with Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor and claimed that Mary of Bourbon and her sister were 'sore made awry.' The Queen of Navarre wondered if James V might marry Christina of Denmark, and suggested her sister-in-law Isabella as Queen of Scotland instead.Letters and Papers Henry VIII, vol. 6 (1882), no. 692 In January 1535, James V wrote to Francis I explaining that he felt he had been misrepresented in this negotiation, and sent his herald, James Aikenhead to France. Aikenhead was instructed to explain that James could not deviate from the 1517 Treaty by marrying a bride not a Princess without the consent of the Parliament of Scotland.Hay, Denys, Letters of James V, HMSO (1954), 282-283. Second negotiation As Francis I had once again firmly indicated to James V that a French princess of the royal family would not be available to him since Madeleine was too frail, the negotiation for his alternative marriage to Mary of Bourbon began again in earnest.Hay, Denys, Letters of James V, HMSO (1954), 51-52, 283. James V of Scotland, attributed to Corneille de Lyon circa 1535 On 3 June 1535, James V wrote from Stirling Castle to Francis I regarding his possible marriage to Madeleine, the treaty, and the alternative offer of Mary of Bourbon. He wrote that he had heard from Nicolas Canivet that Mary of Bourbon was a possible bride. James V sent the letter with his 'familiar servant,' the herald James Aikenhead, who was told to; 'see and wesie the gentyll woman that is offerit us,' to note her personage, manners, 'having' (deportment) and conversation. Aikenhead, if satisfied on these points, was to enquire about a dowry for Mary as if she were a daughter of Francis. If the business was concluded, Mary should 'haste home' to Scotland with an 'honest train' of gentlewomen before winter. James sent letters on the same day with Aikenhead to Philippe Chabot and Anne de Montmorency.Hay, Dennis, Letters of James V, HMSO (1954), 289-290. Again, the Duke of Albany briefly entertained the idea that James V might marry Christina of Denmark, now the widowed Duchess of Milan, and James V halted progress on the marriage to Mary of Bourbon. At the point, there was also an investigation into the possibility of him marrying his former mistress, Margaret Erskine. Then, on 28 December 1535, Aikenhead was sent to France to resume the Vend√¥me marriage plan and get the best deal for James V. Once again, Aikenhead's instructions included that Mary's train should consist of a 'sobir nummyr' of gentlewomen. James V then appointed his 'procurators,' his legal representatives to finalise the match.Hay, Denys, ed., The Letters of James V, HMSO (1954), 283, 289-290, 302-5. On 29 March 1536 a final contract made at Cremieu, near Lyon, for Mary to marry James V of Scotland, was sealed by Francis I of France. The meeting was convened by Jean III d'Estourmel, Master of Household to the Duke of Vend√¥me, assisted by Mathieu de Lonjo√ºe, Bishop of Soissons, Guillaume Poyet, President of the French parliament, Guillaume F√©au, seigneur de Fernay, Royal Chamberlain, and the Scottish herald James Aikenhead, whose name appears in French records as 'Hacquenet.' The resultant contract was signed by Cardinal Tournon, the Chancellor Antoine de Bourg, Anne de Montmorency, Marshal of France, and Admiral Philippe de Chabot, Count of Busan√ßois.Decagny, Paul, Notice historique sur le ch√¢teau de Suzanne en Santerre (Somme) et sur la maison d'Estourmel, (1857), 37. James V had already consented to the marriage by appointing his procurators to finalise the details on 29 December 1535.Teulet, Alexandre, Relations Politiques de la France et de l'Espagne avec l'Ecosse, vol. 1, Paris (1862) 94-105, Latin. Among its provisions, the contract provided that Francis I would transfer Dunbar Castle with the gift of all of its guns, which was kept by the Duke of Albany, to James V, and if James died first Mary would have Falkland Palace for the rest of her life.Hay, Denys, ed., Letters of James V, HMSO (1954), 314-215. In April 1536 Francis I consolidated the agreement by sending James V the collar of the Order of Saint Michael.Hay, Denys, ed., The Letters of James V, HMSO (1954), 318: Bapst, E., Les Mariages de Jacques V, 273. The Duke of Albany, who had promoted this marriage plan, died in July 1536. The Scottish King visited Mary of Bourbon at St. Quentin in Picardy in September 1536, but then went south to meet Francis I.Cameron, Jamie, James V, the personal rule, 1528-1542, Tuckwell, (1998), 131. Instead of marrying Mary, he married the French king's daughter, Madeleine of Valois. On 14 October 1536, Rodolfo Pio da Carpi, Bishop of Faenza, wrote that Francis I now intended Mary of Bourbon to marry Francis, Marquis of Lorraine.Letters & Papers Henry VIII, vol. 11, (1888), no. 711, cited Cameron, Jamie, James V, Tuckwell (1998), 131. Both Madeleine and Mary of Bourbon died soon after. The Scottish chronicle writer Robert Lindsay of Pitscottie wrote; > \\"the duik of Vandones dochter, quho tuke sick displeasour at the king of > Scotlandis marriage that shoe deceast immediately thaireftir: quhairat the > king of Scotland was highlie displeased, thinkand that he was the occasioun > of that gentlewoman's death.\\"Lindsay of Pitscottie, Robert, Chronicles of > Scotland, vol. 2, Edinburgh (1814), 374. A meeting in disguise? Four Scottish chronicles record a story that James V had entered the court of the Duke of Vend√¥me in disguise.Adam Abell, George Buchanan, John Lesley, Robert Lindsay of Pitscottie. He had exchanged his clothing with a servant, perhaps John Tennent of Listonshiels. Mary was not fooled and recognised him from his distinctive red hair and the portrait she had been given. Although this story seems doubtful, a modern historian has noted that English observers reported some secrecy about James's trip to St Quentin from Dieppe.Cameron, Jamie, James V, the personal rule, 1528-1542., (1998), 152-153, note 6 Adam Abell's contemporary chronicle is the earliest source; > \\"In ane dissimilit vestement he com to the duik of Vend√¥me fathir of the > lady that he suld haif marreit.

Resolution=Observations The Security Council emphasised the importance of the implementation of the Dayton Agreement (General Framework Agreement) and welcomed contributions from SFOR, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe and other international organisations. The situation continued to constitute a threat to peace and security and the Council was determined to promote a peaceful resolution of the conflict. Furthermore, it noted that the European Union was intending to launch a follow-on mission with a military component from December 2004. Acts Acting under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, the Council reminded the parties to the Dayton Agreement of their responsibility to implement the agreement. It emphasised the role of the High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina to monitor its implementation. It also attached importance to co- operation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. The Security Council commended the countries participating in SFOR and authorised them to continue their operations for an additional six months; while it welcomed the establishment of a follow-on mission from December 2004 by the European Union. It also authorised the use of necessary measures, including that of the use of force and self-defense, to ensure compliance with the agreements and the safety and freedom of movement of SFOR personnel. All agreements would apply to the follow-on mission.

Foot is known for his musings, rants, \\"disturbances\\" and apparent aversion to pop culture. The Daily Express likened him to \\"a rare exotic bird\\", and six national newspapers including The Independent and The Age have described him as \\"a comedy genius\\". Biography Foot was born and raised in Amersham, Buckinghamshire, and has a younger brother.https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p028lpwz He studied mathematics at Merton College, Oxford. It was during his studies that he first started performing stand-up. As of 2011, Foot has refused to discuss his years at Oxford or former pursuits as a mathematics student. Graduating from Oxford in 1995, Foot was head-hunted by a computer software company in the run-up to the dot-com bubble, however he loathed the industry: \\"I had to read manuals on HTML and just write websites from scratch. None of us really knew what we were doing\\". He started to pursue a career in comedy by doing open mic slots at various venues. He is openly gay. He has been described as \\"a little bit vegetarian\\", but has said that occasionally he does return to eating meat due to nutrition-related health issues. He has stated on his video log that he has face blindness. Live performances Foot frequently performs live, with resident slots at various London comedy clubs, and his fans sometimes demand shows in particularly obscure parts of Britain. He usually takes a show to the Edinburgh Fringe such as By the Yard (2009), Ash in the Attic (2010) (which was directed by Noel Fielding) and Words (2013). Following Edinburgh, Foot usually tours Britain with his current show before taking it to Australia after Christmas for the Australian festival circuit. He has also given runs at Montreal Comedy festival as well as selling out at venues in Sweden. In 2003, Foot and Russell Brand appeared in a double act at Cafe Royal. Foot's style of comedy had a strong influence on Brand, who was inspired by Foot's eccentric hair, quirky mannerisms and love for florid language. In The Guardian, Paul MacInnes wrote about their similarities in an article that explored the notion of \\"copycat comedians\\". Bruce Dessau made similar observations in The Standard. Although a sector of Foot's fan base felt Brand had stolen Foot's act, the two comedians have remained friends. In 2012, Brand made a special appearance at one of Foot's Secret Shows and they improvised a play in which Brand played Foot and Foot played actress Angela Lansbury.

Ash in the Attic was then taken to Melbourne for the 2011 Melbourne International Comedy Festival as part of the official gala selection where it received a 5-star review in The Age. Australian Chortle wrote in their review that Ash in the Attic was \\"One of the best comedy shows ever to have been performed in Melbourne\\". A CD of the show was released, and can be bought from his website, standard online shops, and from Foot at tour shows. Still Life Foot performed eight secret London previews for his 2011 Edinburgh show Still Life before taking it to the Fringe where the show had a sell-out run at the Underbelly. Foot toured the UK in autumn 2011 with Still Life starting at the Soho Theatre on 26 September. Foot took Still Life to the 2012 Melbourne International Comedy Festival where he starred in the Comedy Festival Gala on Australia's Network Ten and was nominated for a Barry Award. Still Life also featured at the Just for Laughs festival in Montreal. The poster image for Still Life is an original artwork, a portrait of Foot amidst various fruits, by Victoria Brook. Kenny Larch Is Dead Foot's 2012 Edinburgh show was called Kenny Larch Is Dead. As ever with Foot, the show had nothing to do with the title. Following the Fringe the sell-out show toured Britain, before being taken to the Melbourne International Comedy Festival.Kenny Larch is Dead, Paul Foot  Melbourne International Comedy Festival 2013 The show won the Best of Fest award at the Sydney Comedy festival, and Best International Show at the Perth comedy awards. Secret shows In September 2006, Foot started a regular London- based solo variety show called Paul Foot's Comedy for Connoisseurs. The title comes from the name given to his fans, \\"The Guild of Paul Foot Connoisseurs\\", for whom Foot arranges \\"secret\\" events advertised only via his official website and mailing list. In the secret shows Foot often enters a surreal territory, taking on the personae of his own character creations such as \\"Penny\\" and \\"Skeleton Johnson\\", and sometimes improvising elaborate mini- dramas in which he plays all of the parts. Some of Foot's characters feature on his website which also has a secret page for his Guild of Connoisseurs. Foot's television appearances in 2010 introduced a new generation to his style of comedy, leading some \\"Connoisseurs of The Guild of Paul Foot Connoisseurs\\" unable to attend Foot's Secret Shows due to this new wave of popularity with a younger, student demographic booking them out. Foot addressed this problem by organising his first \\"Secret Secret Show\\" for his longest-serving fans. The show was not advertised anywhere on his website. The Paul Foot Festival In 2009, Paul Foot hosted his own all-day festival at Bethnal Green Working Men's Club in East London with the help of arts and music collective HungaMunga. Sketches included 'Foot of the Yard', a whodunnit, an Invisible Man Contest, Flamingo I-Spy, an Erotic Menu, and Paul's Rants. HungaMunga provided many arts and crafts materials and activities. Foot also painted portraits of members of the audience. The festival also included Paul's Prot√©g√©'s featuring the comedians Tom Bell and Joel Dommett. Musical performers at the festival were Birmingham gonzo-ska band Misty's Big Adventure and Antony Elvin. Television Foot has appeared on numerous television shows including: * FAQ U (Channel Four) * Edinburgh and Beyond (Paramount Comedy Channel) * Rob Brydon's Annually Retentive (BBC Three) * Come Dine With Me (Channel 4) * Richard & Judy (Channel 4) * Never Mind the Buzzcocks (BBC Two) * Russell & Katy Get Married (FIVE) * Big Brother's Big Mouth (Channel 4) * The 50 Funniest Moments of 2010 (Channel 4) * Greatest Christmas TV Ads (FIVE) * Melbourne International Comedy Festival All Star Supershow (Channel Ten ‚Äì Australia) * Russell Howard's Good News Extra (BBC Three) * 8 out of 10 Cats (Channel 4) * Would I Lie To You (BBC One) In 2008, Foot was a finalist in NBC's Last Comic Standing. In 2011, Foot filmed a series of TV advertisements for Virgin Mobile in Australia. He helped to devise his character in the campaign called \\"Robin Da Hood\\", a bizarre fusion of medieval eccentricities and modern-day Australian urbanity. The first of these adverts featured an emergency phone conversation between Foot and head of the Virgin Group Sir Richard Branson. Awards In 1997, Foot won both the BBC New Stand-up Award and the Daily Telegraph Open Mic Award, and was a finalist for the So You Think You're Funny award for newcomers. In 1998, he was nominated for the Perrier Best Newcomer Award in Edinburgh. In 2011, Foot was nominated for a Barry Award at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival. In 2012, Foot was nominated again for a Barry Award at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival. In 2013, Foot won the top award at the Sydney Comedy festival for Kenny Larch Is Dead, which won the best show award. Paul Foot Podcast Since 2009, Foot has released a podcast, the Paul Foot Podcast. It was originally the highlights from his show on Resonance FM, and featured fellow stand-up comedian Joel Dommett, among other regulars. After the Resonance FM show ended, a few episodes were released independently up to May 2010. Episodes of the podcast then became more sporadic, being released every few months or so; these episodes included guests such as Trevor Lock and Paul's tour support act Malcolm Head, as well as recordings from Paul's Secret Shows. Guild of Connoisseurs He commands a significant cult following called The Guild of Connoisseurs. As well as secret stand-up comedy shows Foot arranges events for The Guild of Connoisseurs such as secret picnics, spoof lectures and guided tours. In July 2011 he scheduled an event at Stepney City Farm at which connoisseurs attempted to complete a 32,000 piece jigsaw puzzle. Foot hosts competitions within the Guild too, such as an annual tie design competition and portrait painting competitions.

In 1979, the island was purchased by Betsy Wyeth, wife of painter Andrew Wyeth.

He later went on to pursue a Masters of Public Health (MPH) from Emory University. Career Khan‚Äôs federal career began in 1991 when he joined CDC and the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps as an Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS) officer. Dr. Khan has focused his career on bioterrorism, global health, and emerging infectious diseases. While serving as the interim Director for CDC‚Äôs global infectious disease activities, he designed CDC‚Äôs joint global field epidemiology and laboratory training program.

As deputy director of the bioterrorism program, Khan created the Critical Agent list, which has remained the basis for all biological terrorism preparedness. Dr. Khan also published the first national public health preparedness plan, initiated syndrome based surveillance, and designed key focus areas to improve local and State capacities to respond to emergencies. Khan used these preparedness efforts during the first anthrax attack in 2001, during which he directed the CDC operational response in Washington, D.C.

In her debut appearance in season three, Amelia visited her former sister-in-law, Addison Montgomery, and became a partner at the Oceanside Wellness Group. In July 2010, it was reported that she was promoted to series regular for the fourth season, after appearing in the final five episodes of season three. She remained in the series until the final episode. Scorsone crossed over as a special guest in one episode each of the seventh (2010‚Äì11) and eighth seasons (2011‚Äì12) of Grey's Anatomy, which ran concurrently with the fourth (2010‚Äì11) and fifth seasons (2011‚Äì12) of Private Practice, in both 2010 and 2012. After Private Practice ended its six season run in January 2013, Scorsone returned to the Grey's Anatomy universe in its parent show, recurring in the final four episodes of the tenth season in 2014. She was then promoted to series regular for season eleven (2014‚Äì15), and has appeared as a main cast member for the past six seasons. Amelia is the youngest sibling of Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey)'s family, and a recovering drug addict. Her storylines in both shows revolve around her struggle with sobriety, recklessness and her ambition as a neurosurgeon. Scorsone has been a part of the Grey's universe for over ten years and has appeared in a total of nine seasons as a series regular. She has also appeared as a guest star in the second spin-off, Station 19. The actress has been lauded by critics and fans alike. Scorsone describes her character's ‚Äúhero‚Äù journey as showing the ‚Äúfull Phoenix-ing of a woman who was so broken and traumatized by loss and addiction‚Äù. Development=Casting and creation On March 2, 2010, Scorsone was recruited to join the cast of Shonda Rhimes' drama series Private Practice in the recurring role of Amelia Shepherd, the sister of Derek Shepherd from its parent show, Grey's Anatomy. Eric Stoltz, who was directing Scorsone's debut episode \\"Eyes Wide Open\\" heard about the role of Amelia and recommended Scorsone portray her, as he knew her from working with her during her child actress days on My Horrible Year! a decade prior. Shonda Rhimes agreed to bring her in after Stoltz noted her acting chops and resemblance to Patrick Dempsey, who plays Derek Shepherd. Scorsone mentioned that she still had to do the regular auditioning process to get cast. She ended up appearing in five episodes of the third season of Private Practice. As of July 2010, Scorsone had been promoted to series regular for Private Practice. On top of her sister being a big fan of the parent show, she later revealed she considered becoming a doctor after binge- watching the first season of Grey's when she was finishing her bachelor's degree saying, \\"I would unwind after exams by binge-watching the first season of Grey‚Äôs Anatomy. When I got to the end of it, I was under the misapprehension that I wanted to become a doctor. So I went to this medical faculty lecture series and by the end I said, ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt want to be a doctor. In fact, I just want to be on Grey‚Äôs Anatomy.‚Äô\\" Characterization and development In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Scorsone spoke about Amelia's past as an addict being exposed in the season eleven episode, \\"Could We Start Again, Please?\\" She elaborated further, \\"There's the shock and sadness of seeing that all of the work that she's done to build this new life in Seattle is being destroyed, as everybody is finding out about her past in a way that she's not in control of,\\" she continues. \\"It's not as though she decided that she's comfortable with revealing her history and was able to tell the story in a sensitive way; it was taken from her and exposed in a way that she wasn't in control of and that she wouldn't have chosen. It's a pretty exposing and disempowering experience for her.\\" Scorsone describes Amelia as being ‚Äúreally intense‚Äù and requiring ‚Äúlots of emotional energy to play‚Äù. She said, ‚ÄúTo kind of shake it out and get back to my real personality, it helps to kind of go away and explore new things and see the world a little bit‚Äù. Regarding her fifth season storyline on Private Practice, Scorsone commented on her troubled character in 2011, \\"Yes, at this point she suffers emotionally and chemically. She had her surgical privileges revoked because she fell off the wagon. So I explore depression, grief and substance abuse. I think ‚Äì speaking of wanting to help people ‚Äì I do get to articulate and illustrate for people what a struggle with substance abuse and mental health looks like.\\" : \\"Gosh. Everything we did in season 5 of Private Practice felt so intense and fresh. I do think we really dug into the addiction story in a way that educated so many people and made it clear that addiction is an illness and not a moral failing. The whole journey Amelia got to play that year was so rich and deep.\\" The loss of her newborn son in Private Practice transmits into her storyline on Grey's. In the thirteenth season (2016‚Äì17), Amelia experiences a rift with her newly wedded spouse Owen Hunt, portrayed by Kevin McKidd. Caterina Scorsone offered to rationalize Shepherd's fears of having another child, causing the rift, despite Owen being somewhat aware of the loss of her firstborn son. She said, ‚Äú...he's been very accepting but this is a very core trauma for Amelia and there's something about trauma that goes beyond logic. When someone has undergone serious trauma, regardless of whether you think objectively ‚Äî \\"Yes, this person is going to be very patient and accepting of it\\" ‚Äî but there's something in the nature of trauma itself that makes whatever it was that traumatized the person almost unsayable. I think that's what she's experiencing: even to speak it is to re-traumatize herself in some ways. I think this is a powerful combination of perfect storm factors in her paralysis. She doesn't want to disappoint him, she loves him so much and she is also totally paralyzed by the fear and trauma she went through in Los Angeles.\\" Despite Owen and Amelia breaking up over having children, the two share a bond co-parenting Betty and her son, Leo, who Owen later adopts. In the sixteenth season (2019‚Äì20), Amelia discovers she is pregnant again. Scorsone felt Shepherd was more prepared now that she had experienced parenting Leo and fellow addict Betty in the previous two seasons, as well as her articulating the loss of her son Christopher aloud. The sixteenth season sees Amelia in a healthier, happier place. Scorsone felt that the character had come into her ‚Äúauthentic self‚Äù, with her career, community and support of sisters Meredith and Maggie Pierce portrayed by Kelly McCreary. She said, ‚ÄùShe doesn‚Äôt want or need to lose herself in anything or anyone anymore‚Äú and that her motherhood isn't depending on the relationship with new boyfriend Link, portrayed by Chris Carmack, lasting‚Äù. Scorsone also mentioned her uncertainty of Amelia's true love for Link, possibly due to pregnancy hormones, but said Amelia admired his commitment to having the child regardless. Private Practice storyline As explained by Amelia in \\"In the Name of Love\\", she and her brother Derek watched her father get shot dead at his store when she was merely five years old. Amelia comes to the show as part of a team of neurosurgeons visiting Los Angeles to do a consult in the season three episode ‚ÄúEyes Wide Open‚Äù. She joined the team despite knowing she would encounter her former sister-in-law, Addison Montgomery. However, Amelia is soon fired from the team after offering the patient‚Äôs family hope in the form of an experimental surgery, but the patient‚Äôs husband requests Amelia to perform it despite the risks. Her boss, Dr Geraldine Ginsberg, does not believe that the surgery will work and neither does Derek Shepherd, Amelia‚Äôs older brother. Amelia later asks Naomi Bennett for a place at Oceanside as the primary neurosurgeon. In the season three finale, Amelia performs surgery on Maya, Sam and Naomi‚Äôs pregnant daughter. As soon as Amelia finishes surgery on Maya, she rushes to perform surgery to repair brain bleeds in Dell, another employee of the hospital. However, Dell dies on the table, and Amelia takes it very hard. She ends up relapsing on drugs along with her fianc√©, Ryan. Addison stages an intervention with her coworkers for Amelia. Amelia decides to stop doing drugs but she goes on a binge with her fianc√© one last time. Unfortunately, Ryan overdoses and dies. Amelia wakes up next to her dead fianc√© and later learns she is pregnant with his child. However, the baby, who Amelia names Christopher, is born without a frontal lobe, causing him to die in Amelia‚Äôs arms soon after his birth. Amelia donates all of Christopher‚Äôs organs to ensure his death was not in vain. Grey's Anatomy storyline=Guest appearances She appeared in the third episode of the seventh season of Grey's Anatomy where Amelia and Derek started to reconcile their differences, as part of a cross-over. She reprised her role in the fifteenth episode of the eighth season, working a neuro case with Lexie Grey, portrayed by Chyler Leigh. In this episode, Amelia disputes with Derek yet again on a surgery, this time about Cooper‚Äôs son‚Äôs mom, who has a brain tumour. Following the end of Private Practice in January 2013, the character of Amelia was added to its progenitor show Grey's Anatomy. In season ten, she was seen in the season's last four episodes visiting her brother Derek and his wife Meredith Grey in their Seattle home and helping care for their children. Previously, she had only made one-off guest appearances on the show when storylines crossed over between the two series.  As regular cast member  On June 23, 2014, Scorsone and her character was permanently added to the regular cast for season eleven, which began airing in September 2014. In the eleventh season, Amelia has ended her engagement with James and develops a secret fling with Owen Hunt (Kevin McKidd), which she later confides in Derek about. However, after Derek's death, Owen goes to the army. He later returns, and she grieves her brother's loss with him. The twelfth season sees Amelia and Owen's romance developing further, as Amelia express repressed anger over Meredith unplugging Derek before she could say goodbye. She is also angry over Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) hiring Penny Blake (Samantha Sloyan), one of Derek's doctors on the day he died. Later, she marries Owen but expresses doubt and second thoughts before the wedding in the season 12 finale. The thirteenth season sees Amelia and Owen's marriage face problems when the idea of pregnancy brings repressed memories of the death of her firstborn son, Christopher. They divorce early in the fourteenth season civilly, after Amelia's brain tumour is removed, explaining some of her erratic behaviour late in the thirteenth season. Late in the fourteenth season sees Amelia help a teenage addict named Betty and her six-month son, Leo. Owen eventually adopts Leo, and Betty returns home to her parents for stability. Despite Owen and Amelia rekindling romantic feelings, Owen discovers former flame Teddy Altman (Kim Raver) is pregnant with his baby. Amelia starts sleeping with Link, and later discovers she is pregnant with his child. She expresses uncertainty about revealing the paternity of the baby, as it might have been Owen's, but Link's affirmation of loving the child regardless of whether he is the father soothes her. She gives birth to their son in the sixteenth season finale. Reception Tanner Transky for Entertainment Weekly felt Scorsone's appearance in the Grey's season eight cross-over episode, ‚ÄúHave You Seen Me Lately?‚Äù was one of the weaker cross-over episodes for its parent show, but praised the ‚Äúdramatic‚Äù nature in its Private Practice section, evaluating that ‚ÄúFor characters I don‚Äôt really care about that much, I did care... a little bit‚Äù. She also said Amelia ‚Äúproved her strength‚Äù, despite the ‚Äúdemons in her life‚Äù.

For many years in the 19th century he was the effective ruler of Bonny. Background Ijaw trading states. Bonny on southern coast. The Kingdom of Bonny, originally called Ubani, is a traditional state based on the town of Bonny in Rivers State, Nigeria. The kingdom was inhabited by the Ijoid and Igbo people. Bonny rose to power beginning in the 15th century with the coming of the Portuguese and the Atlantic slave trade, acting as a depot for slaves brought from the interior. In the 19th century, the kingdom was forced by the British to end the slave trade. Trade in palm oil replaced the trade in slaves. Early career Oko Jumbo was the son of a slave who became a lesser chief in Bonny, but managed to amass considerable wealth and thus power through astute trading. He became one of the leaders of a group of chiefs who dominated the ruling Manilla Pepple house. On the death of King Dapho of Bonny on 13 August 1855, the acting British Consul in the Bight of Biafra, J.W.B. Lynslager, signed a document on 11 September 1855 appointing the chiefs Anne Pepple, Ada Allison, Captain Hart and Manilla Pepple as a regency, required to consult with Banigo and Oko Jumbo, \\"two gentlemen of the river\\". The arrangement, which gave the Manilla Pepple house control of the regency, caused immediate disputes with the rival Anna (or Annie) Pepple house. When Lynslager's replacement arrived, he reported that \\"the four regents never lived in unity or unanimity ... consequently civil war was ever ripe around and about them... leading to immense loss of British property\\". When the official leader of the Manilla house died in 1863, Banigo and Oko Jumbo could not agree who was to succeed, and so appointed a figurehead named Warribo while continuing to control the house. In an attempt to restore calm, the British restored William Dappa Pepple I (whom they had exiled in 1854) as king on 18 August 1861, and on his death on 30 September 1866 installed his son George Oruigbiji Pepple as king. However, Oko Jumbo remained a leading power in the kingdom. On 6 March 1866, Bishop Crowther described Oko Jumbo as the \\"most sensible and wealthy\\" man in Bonny, and noted that he had learned to read the first chapter of St. Matthew. The next year he had learned to write, and enrolled thirteen of his children in school. He gave his support to the Christian missionaries, and on Easter Day 1867 joined King George in declaring that the Iguana, the traditional deity of Bonny, was no longer \\"Bonny Juju\\". Civil war Tension continued between the Manilla Pepple house and the Annie Pepple house, which was led by a chief named Jubo Jubogha, known as Jaja to the British. A truce was agreed in 1865, banning the use of firearms, but on 2 March 1867 a brawl between Manilla Pepple and Anna Pepple supporters engulfed the town, with all the men fighting on one side or other using \\"matchets and gin bottles, there being no stone in the town\\". The young King George intervened, armed with a pistol, and managed to calm things down. In 1869, after Jaja had decided to relocate outside the city, the dispute flared up into civil warfare, in which the Manilla Pepple's gained the advantage through acquisition of some old 32 lb carronades. Many of the Annie Pepple supporters were killed during and in the aftermath of the main battle, and the town was devastated. Jaja left Bonny and established a rival settlement at Opobo, which controlled the river that supplied three-quarters of the palm oil of the district. The British trading firm of Stuart & Douglas supported Jaja, as did others, who relocated to Opobo. Later years European sanatorium at Bonny, 1885. A peace treaty was concluded between Bonny and Opobo in 1873, and Oko Jumbo visited Jaja and assured him of his friendship. Oko Jumbo soured against Christianity when he realised that King George was using the influence of the missionaries to undermine the power of the chiefs and increase his own influence. He imposed various bans on the practice of the religion. In 1879 King George visited England, where he was well received, given great attention in the press and presented with a steam launch. These reports alarmed Oko Jumbo and Jaja, who became concerned that the British were planning to annexe both Bonny and Opobo, although on George's return the British consul managed to calm the situation down. However, on 14 December 1883 the chiefs deposed King George Pepple. The friendship between Jumbo and Jaja broke down, and both began arming. An 1883 book said that \\"Oko Jumbo has under his command some 7,000 or 8,000 men, all armed with breech-loading rifles and well supplied with ammunition; and Ja-Ja can put about the same number, similarly armed, into the field\\". In 1884, Oko Jumbo fell out with the other chiefs in Bonny. There were rumours that he wanted to place one of his sons on the throne, although a planned coup attempt in January 1885 came to nothing. Another son, Herbert Jumbo, who had been educated in England, quarrelled with his father and placed himself under the protection of the British consul. Later in 1885, Oko Jumbo made a trip to England, arriving in Liverpool in May accompanied by two of his sons, Herbert and James. The Times described him as \\"King of Bonny\\" when reporting the visit. On his return trip, the ship was wrecked off the west coast of Africa but he managed to escape. In February 1886 a protectorate treaty was concluded between Bonny and Britain. A ruling council was established, and King George Pepple was reestablished on his throne. Oko Jumbo was publicly degraded, his bans on Christianity were repealed and afterwards he was a spent force in Bonny politics. In June 1886, refuting rumours that Oko Jumbo had drowned in the shipwreck, a reporter said he had retired 40 miles into the interior, leaving all his affairs in the hands of his son Herbert. In 1887 Jaja was arrested and exiled to Tenerife, dying there in 1891, and his old rival Oko Jumbo died around the same time. Appearance In John Whitford's book on the region published in 1877, Oko Jumbo was described as \\"about forty-five years of age, slightly above the middle stature, well built, inclined to portliness; and has bright sparkling eyes and an intelligent face.\\" He was described as an elegant dresser, although preferring bare feet. He travelled in a long, fast canoe paddled by twenty four to thirty boys. He was hospitable, and often invited white men to share his excellent cookery. An account published after his fall in 1886 described him as \\"a grand old pagan of the bygone school, tall and strong, with a fine handsome face and powerful head, with very little attempt at European dress, or indeed dress of any sort\\". It noted that his two sons, who resided mostly in England, were civilised gentlemen.

It has been formed as one of a number of other molecular scandium hydride products at low temperature using laser ablation and identified by infrared spectroscopy. Scandium trihydride has recently been the subject of Dirac‚ÄìHartree‚ÄìFock relativistic calculation studies, which investigate the stabilities, geometries, and relative energies of hydrides of the formula MH3, MH2, or MH.  Properties and bonding  Scandium trihydride is a quastrigonal planar molecule with three equivalent Sc-H bonds. (C3v) structure an equilibrium distance between Sc and hydrogen of 182.0 pm, the bond angle is 119.2 degrees. By weight percent, the composition of scandium trihydride is 6.30% hydrogen and 93.70% scandium. In scandium trihydride, the formal oxidation states of hydrogen and scandium are -1 and +3 respectively, because of the electronegativity of scandium is lower than that of hydrogen. The stability of metal hydrides with the formula MH3 (M = Sc-Lu) increases as the atomic number of M increases. Early theoretical studies of ScH3 revealed that the molecule is unstable, the bulk substance is likely to be a colourless gas with a low activation energy toward the conversion into trimeric clusters due to the electron deficient nature of the monomer, not unlike the group 13 hydrides. One major difference, is that the dimer is the most stable cluster for group 13 hydrides. This can be attributed to the distortion caused by the d-orbitals. It cannot be made by methods used to synthesise BH3 or AlH3.

During his Deanship a number of significant projects enhancing the fabric of the cathedral were carried out, including the construction of a ramp for access for the aged and disabled and a Garden of Remembrance. The latter was dedicated on the occasion of the centenary of the laying of the foundation stone of the Cathedral, 5 March 2007.http://routesandroots.blogspot.com/2008_05_01_archive.html Beck was serving at the time as Vicar General for the Diocese of Kimberley and Kuruman following the retirement of Bishop Itumeleng Moseki. The centenary celebration, culminating on 13 May 2008, was marked by a series of services and events, including the hosting of Episcopal Synod and the Consecration and Enthronement of Bishop Oswald Swartz. Having reviewed the earlier involvement of St Cyprian's in formal education, one of the outcomes of the centenary was the rebirth of the St Cyprian's Grammar School. Dean Beck, as one of the founders, chaired its Board of Governors and gave guidance to the school from its opening in 2009. Beck House at the school was named in his honour.

History Coal had been dug in Shakerley since the 15th century when a dispute over \\"seacole\\" was recorded in 1429. Coal was used in the smithies of the nailers who plied their trade in Shakerley. There was a colliery between Higher Oak and Common Fold in Shakerley in 1798. John Hope of Chaddock Hall left it to his son, John, and his son-in-law, Thomas Smith. In 1836 Jacob Fletcher of Peel Hall Little Hulton bought the Shakerley estates and acquired \\"514 acres of land, and the valuable mines of coal and stone lying under the same; the estates abounded with thriving young timber; the mines of coal were inexhaustible, of excellent quality, and being in a manufacturing district found a ready sale\\". Shakerley Colliery, which was later renamed the Nelson Pit was sunk in the 1830s or 1840s on land leased from Ellis Fletcher on the Manchester Coalfield in Shakerley. It was worked by Nathan Eckersley and in 1861 passed to his nephew William Ramsden who owned the nearby Messhing Trees Colliery which is named on the 1869 mines list. Some time after 1880 Messhing Trees was renamed the Wellington Pit. The Nelson Pit relied on road transport and a cobblestone toll road was built linking it to the Bolton to Leigh turnpike road near Green Hall, Atherton north of Shakerley. Shakerley Lane remained a toll road until 1949 but is now a bridleway. In 1869 when Ramsden was sinking a shaft at the Nelson Pit he got into financial difficulties and disappeared after setting out to go the bank at Bolton. Ramsden's wife had to keep the collieries working and pay wages and had to approach George Green of Yew Tree Colliery for help. Ramsden returned some weeks later arriving at one of his collieries having walked from Liverpool after returning from Ireland. In 1896 the Shakerley Collieries employed 442 underground workers and 87 surface workers in their pits. In 1933 the company employed 330 underground and 115 workers who produced 90,000 tons of coal annually from the Plodder, Cannel, Arley, Smith and Yard mines. Ramsden's Collieries joined Manchester Collieries in 1935. The Wellington Pit was abandoned in the same year and the Nelson Pit closed in 1938. Disasters Disasters at the Shakerley pits included the death of six men when the cage rope broke at the Nelson Pit on 2 October 1883. Then on 1 October 1895 five men including the colliery manager and undermanager died at the Wellington Pit after an explosion of firedamp possibly caused by a safety lamp. Locomotives After the London and North Western Railway built the Tyldesley Loopline in 1864, Ramsden built a colliery railway to join the mainline railway at Ramsden's Sidings east of Tyldesley Station and Tyldesley Coal Company's Green's Sidings. In 1874 a 0-4-0 saddle tank locomotive Shakerley was bought from Manning Wardle and in 1887 Edith a 0-6-0 tank engine was bought from Hunslets. Shakerley was sold in 1901 and replaced by a new locomotive from Hunslets, identical to Edith which was also named Shakerley.

The location at an altitude of previously accommodated a telegraph of the Chappe system using articulating arms to send messages between Lyon and Milan, and after 1809, Venice. The fort has two entrances with drawbridges to allow access to different levels of the fort, with inclined ramps to allow easy movement of artillery pieces. When completed in 1884 after four years of construction, the fort was manned by 170 men, firing four artillery pieces at the main fort and four more at detached batteries. History The site was first occupied by Marshal Berwick in the early 18th century. The Fort du T√©l√©graphe was completed between 1886 and 1890 as a part of the S√©r√© de Rivi√®res system of fortifications. It saw no action until 1940, when it fired on Italian forces with 155mm guns. The fort was part of the \\"Second Position\\" (Deuxi√®me Position), a backup to the main fortifications of the modern Alpine Line, the southwestern component of the Maginot Line. The fort was armed with six 155mm and four 95mm guns, manned by the 6th battery of the 164th Position Artillery Regiment (164e R√©giment d'Artillerie de Position (RAP)). In 1944 the fort was used by the French Forces of the Interior (FFI) as an artillery position. The fort's peacetime barracks have been retained as high-altitude quarters for the 93rd Mountain Artillery Regiment (Regiment d'Artillerie de Montagne (RAM)) of the 27th Mountain Infantry Brigade. The Fort du T√©l√©graphe is open for visitation during the summer months. The continuing military use has resulted in its preservation, much as the fort's advantageous position has resulted in its continued use as a communications post, albeit using microwaves in place of semaphores.

Resolution=Observations The Security Council recalled the Secretary-General Kofi Annan's conclusion that Israel had withdrawn its forces from Lebanon as of 16 June 2000, in accordance with Resolution 425. It emphasised the temporary nature of the UNIFIL operation and noted that it had completed two out of three parts of its mandate, while expressing concern over the potential for an escalation of the tension. Acts The Lebanese government welcomed steps taken to restore its authority in southern Lebanon through the deployment of Lebanese forces. The parties were urged to ensure UNIFIL's full freedom of movement and to ensure its safety. Both Israel and Lebanon were called upon to fulfill commitments to respect the withdrawal line identified by the United Nations and all air, sea and land violations of the line were condemned, in addition to drawing the concern of the Council. The resolution supported efforts by UNIFIL to monitor violations of the withdrawal line and efforts in demining, encouraging the need for additional maps to be provided of the location of land mines. The Secretary-General was requested to continue consultations with the Lebanese government and troop-contributing countries concerning the implementation of the current resolution. It further directed him to report on the activities of UNIFIL and on tasks conducted by the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO).

Œ§œÅŒ±œÄŒµŒ∂ŒøœçœÇ, Trapezous), in the Ottoman Empire, now Turkey. It provided a major impetus for the rapid expansion of Greek education throughout the Pontus region, on the south coast of the Black Sea. The building still retains its function as a prestigious highschool, and it has been considered as the most impressive Pontic Greek monument in Trabzon. Background In the Middle Ages, Trabzon was the capital of the Empire of Trebizond, one of the successor states to the Byzantine Empire, and the last Greek state to be annexed by the Ottomans, in 1461. During the following centuries a strong Greek community continued to live in the city and the Pontus region.Bryer, Winfield (2006): p. ix-xxvii History The school was founded by Sevastos Kyminitis, a forerunner of the modern Greek Enlightenment, in 1682/3 and became the most influential center of Greek education in Pontus.Bryer, Winfield (2006): p. xxxiii The school was initially housed at the S√ºmela Monastery, with its main goal being the cultivation of the national and religious identity of the local Greek communities. The school was supported by generous donations granted by wealthy Greek families, including the Velissarides and Kallivazis families, members of which controlled trade in most of the Black Sea Ports. Pontic Greeks students and teachers in front of the school building In 1817, Savvas Triantafyllidis became director of the Phrontisterion and the institution reached a higher level of educational standards as a result of the modern Greek Enlightenment. After 1839, and especially 1856, the Ottoman authorities allowed teachers that were trained in Athens, Greece to teach at the Phronstisterion.Bryer, Winfield (2006): p. 106 One of them, Periklis Triantafyllidis, the son of Savvas, taught classical philosophy and also recorded the local Greek dialect, Pontic Greek.Bryer, Winfield (2006): p. xxxiv In 1902 the Phrontisterion was re-housed in a new, imposing building, which remains today as the most impressive Pontic Greek monument in Trabzon. It was a three-story building consisting of 36 classrooms, standing above the sea shore corniche of the city near the now destroyed Greek Orthodox Church of Gregory of Nyssa and the Armenian Cathedral. The school closed in November 1921, during the Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922), while the following years the local Greek communities left the region as part of the population exchange between Greece and Turkey. Today the building houses a Turkish school, the Kanuni Anadolu Lisesi.Bryer, Winfield (2006): p. xii ReferencesSources * Further reading *ŒëŒΩœÑœéŒΩŒ∑ Œ•. Œ†Œ±œÖŒªŒØŒ¥Œ∑.
